17795,non reactive phosphorus nrp contains condensed phosphates and organic phosphorus op species that are recalcitrant in secondary wastewater treatment and tend to remain in final effluents to meet ultra low effluent p discharge limits persistent nrp must be removed the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an advanced oxidation process aop which couples tio2 uv photolysis with ultrafiltration to oxidize and remove nrp species initial tests utilized op model compounds adenosine triphosphate atp and aminoethylphosphonate aep in a binary mixture to evaluate aop treatment and to elucidate possible mechanisms of phosphorus removal the results were consistent with a model of preferential atp binding to the tio2 surface compared to aep on uv light exposure aep was removed from solution due to the photooxidation of atp freeing up binding sites for aep adsorption and subsequent oxidation orthophosphate released during aop treatment was retained on the tio2 solids the aop was applied to three municipal wastewaters and one automotive industry effluent for p removal in all cases phosphorus removal was found to occur through filtration surface complexation and uv oxidation total phosphorus removal efficiencies between 90 and 97 were observed for the municipal wastewater effluents and 44 removal was observed in the industrial effluent after treatment using aop

wastewater exists as two operationally defined fractions based on colorimetric p detection methods termed reactive rp and non reactive phosphorus nrp robards et al 1994 soluble or particulate forms of tp are defined by whether they pass through or are retained by a 0 45 μm filter respectively gu et al 2011 over 75 of tp in wastewater is rp an inorganic fraction made up of orthophosphate that reacts directly to the reagents in analytical colorimetry clark et al 2010 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 alternatively nrp contains condensed phosphates and organic phosphorus op species which require digestion e g persulfate oxidation prior to being measured using colorimetric methods standard methods 2005 conventional wastewater treatment can usually achieve tp discharge limits of 1 mg p l with some plants able to meet limits of 0 3 mg p l us epa 2007 traditional biological and chemical treatments target the rp fraction more effectively than nrp up to 10 of tp in raw wastewater has been reported to consist of nrp venkiteshwaran et al 2018 since the majority of nrp passes through treatment unaffected 26 81 of tp in treated effluents has been found to be in the form of dissolved nrp qin et al 2015 areas with sensitive receiving waters are requiring stricter effluent standards to mitigate eutrophication clark et al 2010 to meet the more demanding effluent quality standards removal of only rp may not be sufficient and for some effluents nrp must also be removed venkiteshwaran et al 2018 hence industries with waste streams that have high concentrations of nrp will benefit from access to effective and efficient nrp treatment technologies it is expected that the need for these technologies will increase with time as the demand for organic phosphorus compounds in industrial uses is on the rise i e herbicides pesticides chelating agents and in pharmaceuticals xing et al 2017 mangat echavia et al 2009 nowack 2003 kamel 2015 further while the goal of current wastewater treatment technologies is p removal p is a valuable resource and hence the implementation of nutrient recovery technologies is an emerging priority for treatment facilities as of 2015 six water resource recovery facilities in north america recover or will be recovering nutrients by implementing struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o crystallization latimer et al 2015 therefore the potential benefits of developing a technology that transforms nrp to rp is two fold oxidation of nrp to rp will eliminate the refractory p in effluents and will increase the fraction of p available for recovery technologies the types of non reactive phosphorus in wastewater will depend on the wastewater source historically nrp forms in domestic wastewater have included condensed phosphates e g pyrophates and phosphorus covalently bound to organic matter e g adenosine 5 triphosphate atp phospholipids maher and woo 1998 the characterization of nrp remaining in treated domestic waste waters has been limited however the few studies that exist indicate that the organic p compounds mainly consist of esterized phosphorus and pyrophosphate species qin et al 2015 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 that contain a covalent phosphorus to oxygen bond where the oxygen is also bound to a carbon atom i e binding arrangement p o c it has been reported that many industries use phosphonates a group of phosphorus compounds that contain a resilient covalent carbon to phosphorus bond i e p c bond nowack 2003 an example of a phosphonate that is in high worldwide demand is glyphosate a nonselective herbicide which has increased in usage due to the production of genetically modified crops that are tolerant to glyphosate xing et al 2017 organic phosphonates are expected to be much more difficult to convert to phosphate compared to organic phosphates regardless of composition the need to reduce the quantity of nrp in municipal and industrial wastewater effluents is expected to increase in advanced oxidation processes aops organic compounds are non selectively oxidized by highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can be produced by photolysis legrini et al 1993 westeroff et al 2009 industrial wastewater streams that contain large quantities of organophosphate pesticides e g glyphosate have been treated with aop processes that couple uv and tio2 to enhance photocatalysis mangat echavia et al 2009 chen and liu 2007 chen and liu 2007 studied photocatalysis of glyphosate using a tio2 powder and discovered 15 and 92 of glyphosate was degraded after 30 min and 3 5 h respectively further 0 1 mm solutions of the pesticides acephate and dimethoate in a clean water matrix were both found to be degraded by photocatalysis using tio2 immobilized onto silica gel after 60 and 105 min respectively mangat echavia et al 2009 overall the results indicate that aops are potentially effective at oxidizing op compounds to form inorganic rp advanced oxidation processes which use tio2 as a photocatalyst have the added benefit of the presence of a surface available for physical adsorption mayer et al 2012 metal oxides are known to complex with p compounds in solution li et al 2016 in both above mentioned studies glyphosate removal was determined to be due to adsorption onto tio2 as well as photolysis chen and liu 2007 observed glyphosate adsorption to the tio2 surface under dark conditions tio2 adsorption capacity for glyphosate was 1 28 10 6 mol g 216 μg glyphosate g tio2 once exposed to uv light rp was liberated from the tio2 chen and liu 2007 mangat echavia et al 2009 reported complete removal of 0 1 mm glyphosate after adsorption and 60 min of uv exposure rp release after oxidation of glyphosate was not observed suggesting that the liberated orthophosphate and other intermediate compounds were removed via adsorption this study utilized a commercial uv tio2 aop coupled with ultrafiltration to oxidize and remove nrp species the aop system used in this study was chosen because 1 tio2 nanoparticles act as a catalyst and sorbent as they have a surface for p adsorption allowing the potential for high levels of p removal in the effluent as well as providing a surface for potential p recovery 2 the system demonstrated higher nrp destruction potential compared to other oxidation methods in a previous high level study which used the aop to oxidize nrp in a reverse osmosis brine patton 2013 3 the system was commercially available for immediate use and was designed to contain the tio2 nanoparticles within the reactor most studies investigating the use of aops for organic phosphorus removal have focused on industrial chemicals while the treatment of nrp in municipal wastewater has not been reported hence the current study sought to extend the use of aops to treat dilute mixtures of organic p compounds typical of those found in municipal wastewater effluents in this study two model compounds were tested in a mixture and individually to evaluate the ability of the commercial aop to oxidize and remove nrp species the model compounds were chosen based on the similarity of their structures with those reported in municipal waste waters atp contains two phosphoanhydride bonds condensed phosphorus and a phosphoester bond that are common in the natural forms of nrp present in wastewater effluent streams while 2 aminoethylphosphonate aep has a similar structure to the phosphonates reported to make up the synthetic nrp in industrial wastewaters qin et al 2015 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 the aop unit was also used to treat real effluent samples to evaluate the ability to breakdown nrp species in a complex wastewater matrix based on the results obtained in this study p removal mechanisms are proposed and the implications for phosphorus removal and recovery are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 integrated advanced oxidation process ultrafiltration system the experiments were completed using a lab scale photo cat system from purifics water inc london ontario canada the photo cat system couples a uv tio2 photocatalysis unit with a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane the submicron pore size ceramic membrane is proprietary and patented by purifics gerrity et al 2008 the lab scale system contains four uv lamps 220 v for a total input light power of 0 88 kw each lamp can be controlled separately to adjust uv exposure the photo cat system has a maximum capacity of 16 l and was run crossflow in batch mode at a flow rate of 25 l min the system is designed to run at constant flux and transmembrane pressure is monitored and recovered using a proprietary self cleaning system gerrity et al 2008 reagent grade titanium dioxide degussa p25 dusseldorf germany was used in a slurry that was continuously circulated within the system degussa p25 consists of a mixture of anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles in the ratio of 3 1 average particle size is 21 25 nm however nanoparticles aggregate to form particles on the scale of hundreds of nanometers ohno et al 2001 gerrity et al 2008 additional information on the photo cat system has been reported by westeroff et al 2009 and gerrity et al 2008 2 2 model compounds and test solution preparation two model compounds were used in this study to evaluate nrp behaviour in the aop atp was used in the form of adenosine 5 triphosphate disodium salt hydrate while aep was in form 2 aminoethyl phosphonic acid both model compounds had 99 purity and were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo the model compounds were tested together in a binary mixture bm as well as individually the molar concentrations of atp 1 44 0 10 mg p l and aep 1 86 0 10 mg p l employed in the bm were maintained in individual tests apart from the control test where less aep 1 21 mg p l was added test solutions were prepared as 1 l concentrates to add to the sample tank of the aop which contained 16 l of tap water on average the phosphorus concentration in the raw tap water was 0 13 0 1 mg p l 2 3 wastewater samples treated effluent samples were collected from three conventional activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp in ontario canada prior to disinfection the municipal wastewater treatment plants are referred to by an alphabetic code a b c to maintain anonymity in addition an untreated wastewater sample that was known to contain substantial nrp was collected directly from the outlet of a collection well of an automotive industrial facility and contained a mixture of industrial and domestic wastewaters apart from the samples obtained from wwtp a the collected samples were stored at 4 c until testing samples from wwtp a were tested the same day as sampling 2 4 experimental method in tests with model compounds the reaction tank of the aop was filled with 16 l of tap water then dosed with 1 l of model compound concentrate and subsequently the system pump was activated when uv irradiation was being used a known mass of tio2 was added to the system and allowed to mix thoroughly for 10 min before uv activation occurred this approach was followed to allow the mercury lamps time to warm prior to testing during photolysis experiments only two of the four uv lamps were used for a total light power of 0 44 kw samples were taken at each step and in 5 min intervals up to 35 min once the uv lamps were on in control tests after tio2 addition the system was mixed continuously for 30 min without uv irradiation and samples were taken every 5 min over the length of 35 min of mixing the energy input to the system lt kwh m3 was calculated using equation 1 1 l t e l t x t v t where elt is the energy input to the lamps kw t is treatment time h and vt is the volume of sample treated m3 between tests the aop system was cleaned out using the automatic purge settings in the control system a similar protocol was used in experiments with wastewater samples all experiments were completed in triplicate 2 5 sample analysis total p was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes intensities were measured in axial mode at a wavelength of 213 617 nm with the viewing height set to 15 mm above the induction coil the flow rate of the sample pump was set to 2 ml min argon was used as the plasma and auxiliary gas set to 15 and 0 5 l min respectively reactive p concentrations were measured using ascorbic acid colorimetric determination at 660 nm as per method g 103 93 rev 10 seal analytical wi in accordance with method 4500 p e in standard methods 2005 reactive and total p were measured in all samples and nrp concentrations were calculated by difference between tp and rp calibration solutions were prepared each day of analysis using kh2po4 in ultrapure water 18 2 mω milliq a certified reference material h3po4 lot bcbm9148v 1002 4 mg p l purchased from sigma aldrich was used to prepare p standards included in all runs for quality assurance the method detection limits of the colorimetric and icp oes methods were 2 and 25 μg p l respectively ateeq 2016 organic carbon was measured in wastewater samples using a shimadzu toc lcph carbon and nitrogen analyzer total organic carbon toc was measured on unfiltered samples while dissolved organic carbon doc was measured on ceramic membrane effluent samples 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis was conducted using either anova or t tests as appropriate results of anova and t tests are indicated by reporting the result of the f or t value respectively as well as the corresponding p value degrees of freedom of the statistical test are reported in brackets 3 results and discussion the results from the testing are presented in an order of increasing complexity of the water matrix and complexity of the nrp mixture the discussion considers performance as a function of light energy input to the system l t the energy levels input values are nominal and calculated using the reported factory lamp energy input the energy inputs provide an approximate estimate of energy requirement of the aop system when run in batch mode the actual energy requirements of a full scale continuous flow system may deviate from the values reported in the current study 3 1 model compounds the nrp present in wastewaters typically represents a mixture of several compounds therefore atp and aep were used in a binary solution to simulate a simple mixture and test the aop technology with respect to organic p oxidation fig 1 a shows the phosphorus concentrations in the bm tests throughout the treatment stages that included addition of tio2 nanoparticles followed by subsequent uv exposure a bm control test was also conducted in which the test solution was mixed in the reactor for the length of uv exposure but without uv light with tio2 addition alone 54 3 p was removed from the solution via adsorption both rp and nrp were adsorbed onto tio2 however 86 of the adsorbed p was nrp with uv exposure a slow decrease in nrp was observed over 35 min 16 0 kwh m3 reducing nrp and rp concentrations by an additional 22 and 48 respectively after treatment with the aop over 83 of tp was removed previous studies observed an increase in rp concentration as a result of the oxidation of organic p in pesticides chen and liu 2007 although this was not observed in the current study the removal of tp during uv exposure suggests that nrp was in fact being oxidized since removal was not observed in the control test without uv light any inorganic phosphate species generated as a product of the oxidation of these molecules could bind to the tio2 surface and thus would not be detected during soluble nrp analysis it was unclear from the bm experiments if both forms of organic p were reacting to tio2 uv treatment in the same way hence solutions of atp and aep were treated with the aop separately to obtain additional insight into the behaviour of the two compounds throughout treatment results from individual treatment of atp and aep are shown in fig 1b and c respectively total p in the atp tests was reduced by 93 with the addition of tio2 and this was followed by a further reduction of 5 with 15 min 6 9 kwh m3 of uv irradiation no further removal was observed with continued uv exposure and the tp concentration of atp remained near the detection limit of 25 μg p l during treatment of aep adsorption removed 38 of tp and an additional 48 tp was removed with 35 min of uv exposure 16 0 kwh m3 in total aop treatment of the individual model compounds yielded tp removals of 98 and 86 from the atp and aep test solutions respectively tio2 adsorption had a larger impact on nrp removal in the atp trials while p adsorption in the aep trials was lower in comparison the decreased adsorption may have been due to the aep solutions having higher initial rp concentrations than atp initial rp concentrations in aep and atp trials were 540 and 84 μg p l respectively rp and nrp were removed in similar proportions in the aep sorption tests preferential adsorption of small phosphate anions over larger organic p species i e glyphosate onto metal oxide in soils has been observed in previous studies gimsing and boggard 2002 2007 preferential adsorption of rp may account for the reduced adsorption of nrp in the treatment of aep overall differences were observed in p removal during aop treatment of the two model compounds adsorption of nrp onto tio2 was the main mechanism of removal for atp while both adsorption and oxidation contributed to the removal of nrp when present as aep the results obtained from individual treatment of the model compounds were compared with the results of treatment of the bm to further elucidate the mechanisms of removal by the aop p removal during treatment of the individual compounds was found to be higher than the removals observed for the binary mixture addition of the tp concentrations of the individual components dashed line in fig 1d were compared to the tp removal observed for treatment of the bm this difference suggests that in the mixture atp competitively binds to the tio2 surface and effectively blocks surface binding sites from adsorbing aep with uv irradiation the atp on the surface is oxidized to rp thereby clearing surface sites which became available for adsorption and oxidation of aep this two step adsorption oxidation mechanism is consistent with that reported by mangat echavia et al 2008 when studying photocatalytic degradation of phosphonate glyphosate using tio2 immobilized on silica gel in the current study rp was not observed to be released during oxidation of atp or aep when treated individually or in a mixture it appears that the rp liberated from nrp adsorbed to the tio2 consequently removing p from the aqueous phase overall the aop technology proved to be an effective method to oxidize nrp associated with both organic phosphate and phosphonate model compounds 3 2 wastewater effluents the performance of the aop in treating p in real wastewater effluents was assessed to determine whether the results from the bm tests could be extended to more complex mixtures final effluent samples were collected after secondary treatment and prior to disinfection from three conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants and one industrial effluent the industrial waste water was from a plant treating automotive industry wastewater and was included in this study due the large quantities of nrp that were present in the process wastewater and known to affect effluent nrp concentrations at the receiving wwtp wwtp c some notable differences in the wwtps include the rated average daily capacity wwtp a has the largest rated capacity of 27 000 m3 day while wwtp b and c had rated capacities of 9 300 and 5 400 m3 day wwtp b does not have primary clarification and wwtp c includes tertiary cloth disk filtration 3 2 1 wastewater characterization the aop removed both nrp and rp fractions in treatment of model compounds therefore total and reactive p were measured in the tests with wastewater effluents the p speciation results for the streams that were treated are summarized in table 1 the samples ranged in tp concentrations from 1 900 to 198 μg p l the industrial sample and wwtp b had the highest and lowest tp concentrations respectively the total p of the industrial sample was approximately 98 nrp of the three wwtp samples the effluent from wwtp c had the highest nrp concentration of 977 μg p l over 80 of the tp wwtps a and b had lower nrp concentrations compared to wwtp c total phosphorus in the two plants consisted of 6 and 30 nrp respectively viewed collectively the effluents provided a range of wastewater properties to test thet aop system on wastewater effluents contained additional organic matter a component not included in the model compound trials therefore the effect of aop treatment on organic matter was also evaluated in this study doc in wastewater effluents is known to be potentially rich in p maizel and remucal 2017 therefore it was anticipated that removal of doc would coincide with nrp removal the initial toc concentrations of the wastewater samples are reported in table 1 toc was not measured on the industrial effluent due to the high suspended solids concentration of the sample the effluent from wwtp c had the highest average toc concentration of 16 4 mg c l while wwtps a and b had concentrations of 9 5 and 10 7 mg c l respectively in this portion of the study phosphorus removal was evaluated after a series of steps that sequentially added ultrafiltration tio2 addition and uv irradiation since each step was hypothesized to contribute to p removal filtration was expected to have little effect on the rp concentration since orthophosphate could pass through the ceramic membrane while any nrp associated with particulate phosphorus species or organic matter would be removed from the wastewater it was expected that a small fraction of nrp might be adsorbed as observed in the model compound trials however the majority of p removed through the addition of tio2 was expected to be due to rp adsorption finally photocatalysis was anticipated to target and remove nrp the results obtained in aop treatment will be discussed with respect to these hypotheses graphs of tp and rp concentrations throughout aop treatment of the wastewater effluents are shown in fig 2 fig 3 summarizes the percent removal of doc observed in the wastewater effluents after filtration adsorption and uv oxidation results are presented and discussed below 3 2 2 phosphorus removal via filtration in treated wastewaters phosphorus exists in particulate and colloidal fractions which can be removed via filtration and hence the removal of p species through filtration was evaluated in this study graphs of tp and rp concentrations throughout aop treatment of the wastewater effluents are shown in fig 2 phosphorus concentrations obtained after ultrafiltration of wastewater effluent are labelled uf after filtration average tp concentrations of 248 44 707 and 1630 μg p l were measured in the effluents from wwtp a fig 2a b fig 2b c fig 2c and industry fig 2d respectively hence it is apparent that tp concentrations were reduced with ultrafiltration of all the wastewater effluents the largest fraction of tp removed was in wwtp b where 78 was removed in wwtp c tp was reduced by 40 filtration of wwtp a and the industrial sample yielded the smallest removals where tp was reduced by roughly 28 and 14 respectively viewed collectively tp was removed via ultrafiltration in all effluents and further investigation into which p fractions were removed is discussed subsequently filtration was expected to remove nrp associated with filterable material thus changes in nrp concentrations through ultrafiltration were examined the average concentrations of nrp in the filtered samples were 33 25 640 and 1600 μg p l in wwtps a b c and the industrial sample respectively after uf nrp concentrations decreased by 55 34 and 14 for wwtp b wwtp c and the industrial sample respectively nrp removal was not observed in ultrafiltration of wastewater effluent from wwtp a as expected the decrease in nrp concentration in the industrial effluent accounted for the total removal observed however nrp removal only explained 20 and 70 of the tp removed in wwtp b and c effluents respectively additionally tp in wwtp a was decreased via uf while no removal of nrp was observed thus removal of nrp was observed in effluents from wwtp b c and industry but did not account for total removals observed from filtration of the wastewater effluents examination of the tp and nrp removals obtained through uf inferred that rp fractions were also removed and hence rp concentrations after filtration were evaluated the average reactive p concentrations measured in wwtp a b and c effluents after filtration were 216 19 and 67 μg p l respectively rp in the industrial effluent was not affected by uf hence with filtration 70 of rp was removed from wwtp c while rp was reduced by 31 in effluent from wwtp a and 86 was removed via filtration of wwtp b effluent conceptually rp was expected to pass through the ceramic membrane however rp removal via uf was observed in the wwtp samples the decreases in rp concentration observed with effluents from wwtp a b and c were not statistically different f 8 1 982 p 0 218 despite the wastewater effluents having different p speciation the observed reduction of rp may have resulted from electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface ceramic membranes are known to be negatively charged at ph values greater than the ph zero point charge phzpc which is typically in the range of 4 5 8 sarma and mahiuddin 2014 elzo et al 1998 hence the negatively charged membrane surface will reject phosphate which is also negatively charged at circumneutral ph brandhuber and amy 2001 in the current study the ph of the effluents ranged from 7 4 to 8 2 with no apparent difference in rp removal therefore it was concluded that the rp removal was due to rejection by the negatively charged ceramic membrane ultrafiltration has been reported to remove phosphorus associated with organic matter larger than 10 μm benotti et al 2009 therefore the doc concentrations after uf of wwtp effluents were examined the effects of uf on doc in the effluent from wwtp a could not be assessed as the sample was lost filtration yielded doc concentrations of 5 8 and 9 7 mg c l in the effluents from wwtp b and c respectively and hence filtration decreased the doc by 46 and 41 in wwtp b and c respectively a greater change in organic carbon concentration was observed with ultrafiltration of wwtp c when compared to wwtp b t 4 6 84 p 0 02 indicating that organic matter in wwtp c was operationally larger than the 10 μm ultrafiltration cut off removal of organic carbon in the effluents coincided with nrp removals in the two samples the nrp removal efficiency of wwtp c was also higher than the removal efficiency observed for wwtp b t 4 12 96 p 0 01 viewed collectively it was apparent that organic matter was removed from the wwtp b and c streams via ultrafiltration and this contributed to nrp removal 3 2 3 phosphorus removal via adsorpton onto tio2 the impact of adsorption was assessed by examining the tp in response to the addition of tio2 to the four wastewater effluents after dosing with tio2 average tp concentrations of 115 25 571 and 1520 μg p l were measured in effluents from wwtps a b c and the industry effluent respectively the full extent of removal in wwtp b was not known as concentrations were consistently below the method detection limit 25 μg l addition of tio2 to wwtp a and c reduced tp concentrations by 38 and 11 respectively the tp concentrations in the industrial sample and wwtp b effluent were not significantly different from the concentrations obtained post uf wwtp b t 4 1 41 p 0 229 industry t 4 1 10 p 0 33 overall adsorption removed tp in wwtp a and c while there was no significant effect on wwtp b and the industrial sample adsorption was expected to remove rp and nrp based on results obtained with the model compounds tio2 addition yielded average rp concentrations of 96 μg p l for wwtp a while rp concentrations were below detection 2 μg p l in the wwtp c effluent thus rp was removed via adsorption reducing rp concentrations by an additional 38 and 31 for the wwtp a and c effluents respectively removal of nrp species in the wastewater effluents via adsorption was investigated for the streams from wwtp a and c with tio2 addition average nrp concentrations of 19 and 571 μg p l were detected for wwtp a and c respectively thus adsorption onto tio2 removed 47 of nrp in wwtp a and 41 in wwtp c since non reactive p removal was associated with removal of organic matter during filtration the doc concentrations were also examined after adsorption to assess whether similar responses were obtained after tio2 addition the average doc concentration in the wwtp c effluent was 8 6 mg c l yielding a removal efficiency of 7 t 4 7 19 p 0 002 the removal efficiency of doc was over 5 times less than that of nrp removal in wwtp c effluent suggesting that nrp was more susceptible to adsorption onto tio2 although the removal efficiency of nrp was higher the doc removed through adsorption in wwtp c could potentially account for a fraction of simultaneous p removal 3 2 4 phosphorus removal via photocatalysis the impact of photolysis on p was assessed by evaluating the change in total p concentrations during uv oxidation fig 2 shows that the tp concentrations in the wwtp a c and industrial effluent samples decreased gradually after tio2 uv photolysis was initiated after 35 min of exposure 16 0 kwh m3 the average tp concentrations in the wwtp a fig 2a wwtp c fig 2c and industrial samples fig 2d were 34 29 and 1060 μg p l respectively the impact of uv exposure on p in the wwtp b effluent could not be assessed as the total and reactive p concentrations in this stream were below detection prior to treatment the removals during photolysis were found to be statistically significant reducing tp concentrations by 23 in wwtp a t 4 3 75 p 0 02 46 in wwtp c t 4 56 9 p 0 001 and 24 in the industrial sample t 4 3 50 p 0 02 wwtp c was observed to have the largest tp removal efficiency when compared to the industrial sample and wwtp a overall uv oxidation removed tp in effluents from all of the streams that had measurable concentrations it was anticipated that uv oxidation would impact the organic p species in the wastewater therefore nrp concentrations were monitored the oxidation of effluents from wwtp a c and the industrial sample yielded average nrp concentrations of 10 8 and 930 μg p l respectively corresponding to reductions of nrp of 25 58 and 32 the decrease in nrp was statistically significant in all cases wwtp a t 4 4 11 p 0 01 wwtp c t 4 55 48 p 0 001 industry t 4 4 33 p 0 01 the highest removal was observed in wwtp c suggesting that the nrp in this stream was more susceptible to photolysis when compared to wwtp a and the industrial effluent doc concentrations were also examined in wwtp a b and c after uv oxidation to assess whether there was concurrent removal of nrp and organic removal average doc concentrations of 6 8 and 7 7 mg c l were measured in the wwtp a and c effluents respectively after 35 min of uv irradiation 16 0 kwh m3 hence oxidation reduced the doc by 0 9 mg c l in the wwtp c effluent t 4 25 31 p 0 002 while there was no effect on doc in wwtp a t 4 0 87 p 0 44 in wwtp c the decrease in doc coincided with increased nrp removal 58 suggesting that nrp removed from wwtp c via oxidation was associated with doc oxidation the results suggest that the relationship between doc and nrp removal depends upon the composition of the organic matter and may differ between effluent streams the changes in reactive p concentrations through hydrolysis were examined as prior studies have employed increases in rp concentrations as evidence of oxidation of p bearing organics by photocatalysis chen and liu 2007 after 35 min of uv oxidation 16 0 kwh m3 both wwtp a and c had rp concentrations of 24 μg p l while the industrial sample had an rp concentration of 131 μg p l as a result of oxidation the rp concentration in the wwtp a effluent underwent a statistically significant decrease of 23 t 4 3 56 p 0 03 the rp concentrations in the wwtp c effluent did not statistically change with uv treatment t 4 1 97 p 0 12 by contrast the rp concentrations in the industrial sample increased significantly t 4 7 24 p 0 002 with the rp concentration obtained after 35 min 16 0 kwh m3 of uv exposure reaching a value that was 3 7x higher than the initial concentration the increased rp concentration demonstrated that rp was liberated by photolysis of nrp in the industrial sample overall uv oxidation generated different responses in the treated effluents with rp decreasing in wwtp a and increasing in the industrial sample there was no significant change in rp concentrations during oxidation of wwtp c as previously demonstrated phosphorus was removed from the various streams by a combination of ultrafiltration adsorption and oxidation however the responses differed between streams and hence the collective responses were summarized in fig 4 to facilitate overall comparisons the total removal in wwtp b could only be estimated since the tp and rp concentrations after ultrafiltration were below the method detection limit viewed collectively the aop reduced both nrp and rp in the municipal wwtp effluents to low levels retaining p in the tio2 solids treatment of the effluent from wwtp b resulted in an overall removal of 87 treatment of wwtp a and c effluents resulted in overall phosphorus removals of 90 and 97 respectively by contrast only 44 of the tp was removed from the automotive industry sample overall the aop effectively removed nrp in the wastewater samples treated achieving high level removal of tp in real wastewater effluents 4 conclusion coupling ultrafiltration with tio2 uv proved to be effective at removing both model compounds via adsorption onto the tio2 as well as oxidation via uv irradiation tests with individual model compounds gave insight into the behaviour of each compound during treatment phosphorus removal in the wwtp effluents and industrial samples was found to occur through filtration of the sample adsorption onto the tio2 and uv irradiation phosphorus removal was observed when wastewater effluents were filtered through the ultrafiltration membrane prior to uv irradiation after 35 min of uv irradiation 16 0 kwh m3 90 87 and 97 total phosphorus removals were observed for wwtps a b and c respectively the industrial sample saw the lowest removal after uv irradiation with total p removal of 35 it was evident in several trials that rp was being liberated through nrp oxidation rp concentration in wwtp a and industry samples increased with time in summary the commercial aop effectively oxidized nrp to rp achieving high level removal of tp in real wastewater effluents and p was retained on the tio2 solids the results of this study show the potential benefits of using the aop for nrp removal but also highlights where more study is necessary the aop can work well on wastewater streams more susceptible to treatment this was observed when the aop effectively removed p in wwtp c through filtration adsorption and oxidation reducing tp to less that 30 μg p l ontario 1994 since the liberated rp was adsorbed onto the tio2 solids the amount of tp in wwtp c after aop treatment was ultra low and would have less impact on receiving waters when compared to its initial speciation alternatively the aop was not as effective in treatment of the industrial sample in which organic p was more recalcitrant p was removed through the actions of ultrafiltration and oxidation while adsorption onto tio2 had no effect on p this indicates that composition of the waste stream substantially affects the performance of the aop as proof of principle this method has promise however more study is required to clearly understand the relationship between composition and aop performance additionally use of different wavelengths catalysts sorbents e g tio2 amended with fe oh 3 and manipulation of water chemistry should be expected in future work to truly exploit the potential of the aop for advanced oxidation and

17795,non reactive phosphorus nrp contains condensed phosphates and organic phosphorus op species that are recalcitrant in secondary wastewater treatment and tend to remain in final effluents to meet ultra low effluent p discharge limits persistent nrp must be removed the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an advanced oxidation process aop which couples tio2 uv photolysis with ultrafiltration to oxidize and remove nrp species initial tests utilized op model compounds adenosine triphosphate atp and aminoethylphosphonate aep in a binary mixture to evaluate aop treatment and to elucidate possible mechanisms of phosphorus removal the results were consistent with a model of preferential atp binding to the tio2 surface compared to aep on uv light exposure aep was removed from solution due to the photooxidation of atp freeing up binding sites for aep adsorption and subsequent oxidation orthophosphate released during aop treatment was retained on the tio2 solids the aop was applied to three municipal wastewaters and one automotive industry effluent for p removal in all cases phosphorus removal was found to occur through filtration surface complexation and uv oxidation total phosphorus removal efficiencies between 90 and 97 were observed for the municipal wastewater effluents and 44 removal was observed in the industrial effluent after treatment using aop

wastewater exists as two operationally defined fractions based on colorimetric p detection methods termed reactive rp and non reactive phosphorus nrp robards et al 1994 soluble or particulate forms of tp are defined by whether they pass through or are retained by a 0 45 μm filter respectively gu et al 2011 over 75 of tp in wastewater is rp an inorganic fraction made up of orthophosphate that reacts directly to the reagents in analytical colorimetry clark et al 2010 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 alternatively nrp contains condensed phosphates and organic phosphorus op species which require digestion e g persulfate oxidation prior to being measured using colorimetric methods standard methods 2005 conventional wastewater treatment can usually achieve tp discharge limits of 1 mg p l with some plants able to meet limits of 0 3 mg p l us epa 2007 traditional biological and chemical treatments target the rp fraction more effectively than nrp up to 10 of tp in raw wastewater has been reported to consist of nrp venkiteshwaran et al 2018 since the majority of nrp passes through treatment unaffected 26 81 of tp in treated effluents has been found to be in the form of dissolved nrp qin et al 2015 areas with sensitive receiving waters are requiring stricter effluent standards to mitigate eutrophication clark et al 2010 to meet the more demanding effluent quality standards removal of only rp may not be sufficient and for some effluents nrp must also be removed venkiteshwaran et al 2018 hence industries with waste streams that have high concentrations of nrp will benefit from access to effective and efficient nrp treatment technologies it is expected that the need for these technologies will increase with time as the demand for organic phosphorus compounds in industrial uses is on the rise i e herbicides pesticides chelating agents and in pharmaceuticals xing et al 2017 mangat echavia et al 2009 nowack 2003 kamel 2015 further while the goal of current wastewater treatment technologies is p removal p is a valuable resource and hence the implementation of nutrient recovery technologies is an emerging priority for treatment facilities as of 2015 six water resource recovery facilities in north america recover or will be recovering nutrients by implementing struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o crystallization latimer et al 2015 therefore the potential benefits of developing a technology that transforms nrp to rp is two fold oxidation of nrp to rp will eliminate the refractory p in effluents and will increase the fraction of p available for recovery technologies the types of non reactive phosphorus in wastewater will depend on the wastewater source historically nrp forms in domestic wastewater have included condensed phosphates e g pyrophates and phosphorus covalently bound to organic matter e g adenosine 5 triphosphate atp phospholipids maher and woo 1998 the characterization of nrp remaining in treated domestic waste waters has been limited however the few studies that exist indicate that the organic p compounds mainly consist of esterized phosphorus and pyrophosphate species qin et al 2015 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 that contain a covalent phosphorus to oxygen bond where the oxygen is also bound to a carbon atom i e binding arrangement p o c it has been reported that many industries use phosphonates a group of phosphorus compounds that contain a resilient covalent carbon to phosphorus bond i e p c bond nowack 2003 an example of a phosphonate that is in high worldwide demand is glyphosate a nonselective herbicide which has increased in usage due to the production of genetically modified crops that are tolerant to glyphosate xing et al 2017 organic phosphonates are expected to be much more difficult to convert to phosphate compared to organic phosphates regardless of composition the need to reduce the quantity of nrp in municipal and industrial wastewater effluents is expected to increase in advanced oxidation processes aops organic compounds are non selectively oxidized by highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can be produced by photolysis legrini et al 1993 westeroff et al 2009 industrial wastewater streams that contain large quantities of organophosphate pesticides e g glyphosate have been treated with aop processes that couple uv and tio2 to enhance photocatalysis mangat echavia et al 2009 chen and liu 2007 chen and liu 2007 studied photocatalysis of glyphosate using a tio2 powder and discovered 15 and 92 of glyphosate was degraded after 30 min and 3 5 h respectively further 0 1 mm solutions of the pesticides acephate and dimethoate in a clean water matrix were both found to be degraded by photocatalysis using tio2 immobilized onto silica gel after 60 and 105 min respectively mangat echavia et al 2009 overall the results indicate that aops are potentially effective at oxidizing op compounds to form inorganic rp advanced oxidation processes which use tio2 as a photocatalyst have the added benefit of the presence of a surface available for physical adsorption mayer et al 2012 metal oxides are known to complex with p compounds in solution li et al 2016 in both above mentioned studies glyphosate removal was determined to be due to adsorption onto tio2 as well as photolysis chen and liu 2007 observed glyphosate adsorption to the tio2 surface under dark conditions tio2 adsorption capacity for glyphosate was 1 28 10 6 mol g 216 μg glyphosate g tio2 once exposed to uv light rp was liberated from the tio2 chen and liu 2007 mangat echavia et al 2009 reported complete removal of 0 1 mm glyphosate after adsorption and 60 min of uv exposure rp release after oxidation of glyphosate was not observed suggesting that the liberated orthophosphate and other intermediate compounds were removed via adsorption this study utilized a commercial uv tio2 aop coupled with ultrafiltration to oxidize and remove nrp species the aop system used in this study was chosen because 1 tio2 nanoparticles act as a catalyst and sorbent as they have a surface for p adsorption allowing the potential for high levels of p removal in the effluent as well as providing a surface for potential p recovery 2 the system demonstrated higher nrp destruction potential compared to other oxidation methods in a previous high level study which used the aop to oxidize nrp in a reverse osmosis brine patton 2013 3 the system was commercially available for immediate use and was designed to contain the tio2 nanoparticles within the reactor most studies investigating the use of aops for organic phosphorus removal have focused on industrial chemicals while the treatment of nrp in municipal wastewater has not been reported hence the current study sought to extend the use of aops to treat dilute mixtures of organic p compounds typical of those found in municipal wastewater effluents in this study two model compounds were tested in a mixture and individually to evaluate the ability of the commercial aop to oxidize and remove nrp species the model compounds were chosen based on the similarity of their structures with those reported in municipal waste waters atp contains two phosphoanhydride bonds condensed phosphorus and a phosphoester bond that are common in the natural forms of nrp present in wastewater effluent streams while 2 aminoethylphosphonate aep has a similar structure to the phosphonates reported to make up the synthetic nrp in industrial wastewaters qin et al 2015 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 the aop unit was also used to treat real effluent samples to evaluate the ability to breakdown nrp species in a complex wastewater matrix based on the results obtained in this study p removal mechanisms are proposed and the implications for phosphorus removal and recovery are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 integrated advanced oxidation process ultrafiltration system the experiments were completed using a lab scale photo cat system from purifics water inc london ontario canada the photo cat system couples a uv tio2 photocatalysis unit with a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane the submicron pore size ceramic membrane is proprietary and patented by purifics gerrity et al 2008 the lab scale system contains four uv lamps 220 v for a total input light power of 0 88 kw each lamp can be controlled separately to adjust uv exposure the photo cat system has a maximum capacity of 16 l and was run crossflow in batch mode at a flow rate of 25 l min the system is designed to run at constant flux and transmembrane pressure is monitored and recovered using a proprietary self cleaning system gerrity et al 2008 reagent grade titanium dioxide degussa p25 dusseldorf germany was used in a slurry that was continuously circulated within the system degussa p25 consists of a mixture of anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles in the ratio of 3 1 average particle size is 21 25 nm however nanoparticles aggregate to form particles on the scale of hundreds of nanometers ohno et al 2001 gerrity et al 2008 additional information on the photo cat system has been reported by westeroff et al 2009 and gerrity et al 2008 2 2 model compounds and test solution preparation two model compounds were used in this study to evaluate nrp behaviour in the aop atp was used in the form of adenosine 5 triphosphate disodium salt hydrate while aep was in form 2 aminoethyl phosphonic acid both model compounds had 99 purity and were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo the model compounds were tested together in a binary mixture bm as well as individually the molar concentrations of atp 1 44 0 10 mg p l and aep 1 86 0 10 mg p l employed in the bm were maintained in individual tests apart from the control test where less aep 1 21 mg p l was added test solutions were prepared as 1 l concentrates to add to the sample tank of the aop which contained 16 l of tap water on average the phosphorus concentration in the raw tap water was 0 13 0 1 mg p l 2 3 wastewater samples treated effluent samples were collected from three conventional activated sludge municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp in ontario canada prior to disinfection the municipal wastewater treatment plants are referred to by an alphabetic code a b c to maintain anonymity in addition an untreated wastewater sample that was known to contain substantial nrp was collected directly from the outlet of a collection well of an automotive industrial facility and contained a mixture of industrial and domestic wastewaters apart from the samples obtained from wwtp a the collected samples were stored at 4 c until testing samples from wwtp a were tested the same day as sampling 2 4 experimental method in tests with model compounds the reaction tank of the aop was filled with 16 l of tap water then dosed with 1 l of model compound concentrate and subsequently the system pump was activated when uv irradiation was being used a known mass of tio2 was added to the system and allowed to mix thoroughly for 10 min before uv activation occurred this approach was followed to allow the mercury lamps time to warm prior to testing during photolysis experiments only two of the four uv lamps were used for a total light power of 0 44 kw samples were taken at each step and in 5 min intervals up to 35 min once the uv lamps were on in control tests after tio2 addition the system was mixed continuously for 30 min without uv irradiation and samples were taken every 5 min over the length of 35 min of mixing the energy input to the system lt kwh m3 was calculated using equation 1 1 l t e l t x t v t where elt is the energy input to the lamps kw t is treatment time h and vt is the volume of sample treated m3 between tests the aop system was cleaned out using the automatic purge settings in the control system a similar protocol was used in experiments with wastewater samples all experiments were completed in triplicate 2 5 sample analysis total p was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes intensities were measured in axial mode at a wavelength of 213 617 nm with the viewing height set to 15 mm above the induction coil the flow rate of the sample pump was set to 2 ml min argon was used as the plasma and auxiliary gas set to 15 and 0 5 l min respectively reactive p concentrations were measured using ascorbic acid colorimetric determination at 660 nm as per method g 103 93 rev 10 seal analytical wi in accordance with method 4500 p e in standard methods 2005 reactive and total p were measured in all samples and nrp concentrations were calculated by difference between tp and rp calibration solutions were prepared each day of analysis using kh2po4 in ultrapure water 18 2 mω milliq a certified reference material h3po4 lot bcbm9148v 1002 4 mg p l purchased from sigma aldrich was used to prepare p standards included in all runs for quality assurance the method detection limits of the colorimetric and icp oes methods were 2 and 25 μg p l respectively ateeq 2016 organic carbon was measured in wastewater samples using a shimadzu toc lcph carbon and nitrogen analyzer total organic carbon toc was measured on unfiltered samples while dissolved organic carbon doc was measured on ceramic membrane effluent samples 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis was conducted using either anova or t tests as appropriate results of anova and t tests are indicated by reporting the result of the f or t value respectively as well as the corresponding p value degrees of freedom of the statistical test are reported in brackets 3 results and discussion the results from the testing are presented in an order of increasing complexity of the water matrix and complexity of the nrp mixture the discussion considers performance as a function of light energy input to the system l t the energy levels input values are nominal and calculated using the reported factory lamp energy input the energy inputs provide an approximate estimate of energy requirement of the aop system when run in batch mode the actual energy requirements of a full scale continuous flow system may deviate from the values reported in the current study 3 1 model compounds the nrp present in wastewaters typically represents a mixture of several compounds therefore atp and aep were used in a binary solution to simulate a simple mixture and test the aop technology with respect to organic p oxidation fig 1 a shows the phosphorus concentrations in the bm tests throughout the treatment stages that included addition of tio2 nanoparticles followed by subsequent uv exposure a bm control test was also conducted in which the test solution was mixed in the reactor for the length of uv exposure but without uv light with tio2 addition alone 54 3 p was removed from the solution via adsorption both rp and nrp were adsorbed onto tio2 however 86 of the adsorbed p was nrp with uv exposure a slow decrease in nrp was observed over 35 min 16 0 kwh m3 reducing nrp and rp concentrations by an additional 22 and 48 respectively after treatment with the aop over 83 of tp was removed previous studies observed an increase in rp concentration as a result of the oxidation of organic p in pesticides chen and liu 2007 although this was not observed in the current study the removal of tp during uv exposure suggests that nrp was in fact being oxidized since removal was not observed in the control test without uv light any inorganic phosphate species generated as a product of the oxidation of these molecules could bind to the tio2 surface and thus would not be detected during soluble nrp analysis it was unclear from the bm experiments if both forms of organic p were reacting to tio2 uv treatment in the same way hence solutions of atp and aep were treated with the aop separately to obtain additional insight into the behaviour of the two compounds throughout treatment results from individual treatment of atp and aep are shown in fig 1b and c respectively total p in the atp tests was reduced by 93 with the addition of tio2 and this was followed by a further reduction of 5 with 15 min 6 9 kwh m3 of uv irradiation no further removal was observed with continued uv exposure and the tp concentration of atp remained near the detection limit of 25 μg p l during treatment of aep adsorption removed 38 of tp and an additional 48 tp was removed with 35 min of uv exposure 16 0 kwh m3 in total aop treatment of the individual model compounds yielded tp removals of 98 and 86 from the atp and aep test solutions respectively tio2 adsorption had a larger impact on nrp removal in the atp trials while p adsorption in the aep trials was lower in comparison the decreased adsorption may have been due to the aep solutions having higher initial rp concentrations than atp initial rp concentrations in aep and atp trials were 540 and 84 μg p l respectively rp and nrp were removed in similar proportions in the aep sorption tests preferential adsorption of small phosphate anions over larger organic p species i e glyphosate onto metal oxide in soils has been observed in previous studies gimsing and boggard 2002 2007 preferential adsorption of rp may account for the reduced adsorption of nrp in the treatment of aep overall differences were observed in p removal during aop treatment of the two model compounds adsorption of nrp onto tio2 was the main mechanism of removal for atp while both adsorption and oxidation contributed to the removal of nrp when present as aep the results obtained from individual treatment of the model compounds were compared with the results of treatment of the bm to further elucidate the mechanisms of removal by the aop p removal during treatment of the individual compounds was found to be higher than the removals observed for the binary mixture addition of the tp concentrations of the individual components dashed line in fig 1d were compared to the tp removal observed for treatment of the bm this difference suggests that in the mixture atp competitively binds to the tio2 surface and effectively blocks surface binding sites from adsorbing aep with uv irradiation the atp on the surface is oxidized to rp thereby clearing surface sites which became available for adsorption and oxidation of aep this two step adsorption oxidation mechanism is consistent with that reported by mangat echavia et al 2008 when studying photocatalytic degradation of phosphonate glyphosate using tio2 immobilized on silica gel in the current study rp was not observed to be released during oxidation of atp or aep when treated individually or in a mixture it appears that the rp liberated from nrp adsorbed to the tio2 consequently removing p from the aqueous phase overall the aop technology proved to be an effective method to oxidize nrp associated with both organic phosphate and phosphonate model compounds 3 2 wastewater effluents the performance of the aop in treating p in real wastewater effluents was assessed to determine whether the results from the bm tests could be extended to more complex mixtures final effluent samples were collected after secondary treatment and prior to disinfection from three conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants and one industrial effluent the industrial waste water was from a plant treating automotive industry wastewater and was included in this study due the large quantities of nrp that were present in the process wastewater and known to affect effluent nrp concentrations at the receiving wwtp wwtp c some notable differences in the wwtps include the rated average daily capacity wwtp a has the largest rated capacity of 27 000 m3 day while wwtp b and c had rated capacities of 9 300 and 5 400 m3 day wwtp b does not have primary clarification and wwtp c includes tertiary cloth disk filtration 3 2 1 wastewater characterization the aop removed both nrp and rp fractions in treatment of model compounds therefore total and reactive p were measured in the tests with wastewater effluents the p speciation results for the streams that were treated are summarized in table 1 the samples ranged in tp concentrations from 1 900 to 198 μg p l the industrial sample and wwtp b had the highest and lowest tp concentrations respectively the total p of the industrial sample was approximately 98 nrp of the three wwtp samples the effluent from wwtp c had the highest nrp concentration of 977 μg p l over 80 of the tp wwtps a and b had lower nrp concentrations compared to wwtp c total phosphorus in the two plants consisted of 6 and 30 nrp respectively viewed collectively the effluents provided a range of wastewater properties to test thet aop system on wastewater effluents contained additional organic matter a component not included in the model compound trials therefore the effect of aop treatment on organic matter was also evaluated in this study doc in wastewater effluents is known to be potentially rich in p maizel and remucal 2017 therefore it was anticipated that removal of doc would coincide with nrp removal the initial toc concentrations of the wastewater samples are reported in table 1 toc was not measured on the industrial effluent due to the high suspended solids concentration of the sample the effluent from wwtp c had the highest average toc concentration of 16 4 mg c l while wwtps a and b had concentrations of 9 5 and 10 7 mg c l respectively in this portion of the study phosphorus removal was evaluated after a series of steps that sequentially added ultrafiltration tio2 addition and uv irradiation since each step was hypothesized to contribute to p removal filtration was expected to have little effect on the rp concentration since orthophosphate could pass through the ceramic membrane while any nrp associated with particulate phosphorus species or organic matter would be removed from the wastewater it was expected that a small fraction of nrp might be adsorbed as observed in the model compound trials however the majority of p removed through the addition of tio2 was expected to be due to rp adsorption finally photocatalysis was anticipated to target and remove nrp the results obtained in aop treatment will be discussed with respect to these hypotheses graphs of tp and rp concentrations throughout aop treatment of the wastewater effluents are shown in fig 2 fig 3 summarizes the percent removal of doc observed in the wastewater effluents after filtration adsorption and uv oxidation results are presented and discussed below 3 2 2 phosphorus removal via filtration in treated wastewaters phosphorus exists in particulate and colloidal fractions which can be removed via filtration and hence the removal of p species through filtration was evaluated in this study graphs of tp and rp concentrations throughout aop treatment of the wastewater effluents are shown in fig 2 phosphorus concentrations obtained after ultrafiltration of wastewater effluent are labelled uf after filtration average tp concentrations of 248 44 707 and 1630 μg p l were measured in the effluents from wwtp a fig 2a b fig 2b c fig 2c and industry fig 2d respectively hence it is apparent that tp concentrations were reduced with ultrafiltration of all the wastewater effluents the largest fraction of tp removed was in wwtp b where 78 was removed in wwtp c tp was reduced by 40 filtration of wwtp a and the industrial sample yielded the smallest removals where tp was reduced by roughly 28 and 14 respectively viewed collectively tp was removed via ultrafiltration in all effluents and further investigation into which p fractions were removed is discussed subsequently filtration was expected to remove nrp associated with filterable material thus changes in nrp concentrations through ultrafiltration were examined the average concentrations of nrp in the filtered samples were 33 25 640 and 1600 μg p l in wwtps a b c and the industrial sample respectively after uf nrp concentrations decreased by 55 34 and 14 for wwtp b wwtp c and the industrial sample respectively nrp removal was not observed in ultrafiltration of wastewater effluent from wwtp a as expected the decrease in nrp concentration in the industrial effluent accounted for the total removal observed however nrp removal only explained 20 and 70 of the tp removed in wwtp b and c effluents respectively additionally tp in wwtp a was decreased via uf while no removal of nrp was observed thus removal of nrp was observed in effluents from wwtp b c and industry but did not account for total removals observed from filtration of the wastewater effluents examination of the tp and nrp removals obtained through uf inferred that rp fractions were also removed and hence rp concentrations after filtration were evaluated the average reactive p concentrations measured in wwtp a b and c effluents after filtration were 216 19 and 67 μg p l respectively rp in the industrial effluent was not affected by uf hence with filtration 70 of rp was removed from wwtp c while rp was reduced by 31 in effluent from wwtp a and 86 was removed via filtration of wwtp b effluent conceptually rp was expected to pass through the ceramic membrane however rp removal via uf was observed in the wwtp samples the decreases in rp concentration observed with effluents from wwtp a b and c were not statistically different f 8 1 982 p 0 218 despite the wastewater effluents having different p speciation the observed reduction of rp may have resulted from electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface ceramic membranes are known to be negatively charged at ph values greater than the ph zero point charge phzpc which is typically in the range of 4 5 8 sarma and mahiuddin 2014 elzo et al 1998 hence the negatively charged membrane surface will reject phosphate which is also negatively charged at circumneutral ph brandhuber and amy 2001 in the current study the ph of the effluents ranged from 7 4 to 8 2 with no apparent difference in rp removal therefore it was concluded that the rp removal was due to rejection by the negatively charged ceramic membrane ultrafiltration has been reported to remove phosphorus associated with organic matter larger than 10 μm benotti et al 2009 therefore the doc concentrations after uf of wwtp effluents were examined the effects of uf on doc in the effluent from wwtp a could not be assessed as the sample was lost filtration yielded doc concentrations of 5 8 and 9 7 mg c l in the effluents from wwtp b and c respectively and hence filtration decreased the doc by 46 and 41 in wwtp b and c respectively a greater change in organic carbon concentration was observed with ultrafiltration of wwtp c when compared to wwtp b t 4 6 84 p 0 02 indicating that organic matter in wwtp c was operationally larger than the 10 μm ultrafiltration cut off removal of organic carbon in the effluents coincided with nrp removals in the two samples the nrp removal efficiency of wwtp c was also higher than the removal efficiency observed for wwtp b t 4 12 96 p 0 01 viewed collectively it was apparent that organic matter was removed from the wwtp b and c streams via ultrafiltration and this contributed to nrp removal 3 2 3 phosphorus removal via adsorpton onto tio2 the impact of adsorption was assessed by examining the tp in response to the addition of tio2 to the four wastewater effluents after dosing with tio2 average tp concentrations of 115 25 571 and 1520 μg p l were measured in effluents from wwtps a b c and the industry effluent respectively the full extent of removal in wwtp b was not known as concentrations were consistently below the method detection limit 25 μg l addition of tio2 to wwtp a and c reduced tp concentrations by 38 and 11 respectively the tp concentrations in the industrial sample and wwtp b effluent were not significantly different from the concentrations obtained post uf wwtp b t 4 1 41 p 0 229 industry t 4 1 10 p 0 33 overall adsorption removed tp in wwtp a and c while there was no significant effect on wwtp b and the industrial sample adsorption was expected to remove rp and nrp based on results obtained with the model compounds tio2 addition yielded average rp concentrations of 96 μg p l for wwtp a while rp concentrations were below detection 2 μg p l in the wwtp c effluent thus rp was removed via adsorption reducing rp concentrations by an additional 38 and 31 for the wwtp a and c effluents respectively removal of nrp species in the wastewater effluents via adsorption was investigated for the streams from wwtp a and c with tio2 addition average nrp concentrations of 19 and 571 μg p l were detected for wwtp a and c respectively thus adsorption onto tio2 removed 47 of nrp in wwtp a and 41 in wwtp c since non reactive p removal was associated with removal of organic matter during filtration the doc concentrations were also examined after adsorption to assess whether similar responses were obtained after tio2 addition the average doc concentration in the wwtp c effluent was 8 6 mg c l yielding a removal efficiency of 7 t 4 7 19 p 0 002 the removal efficiency of doc was over 5 times less than that of nrp removal in wwtp c effluent suggesting that nrp was more susceptible to adsorption onto tio2 although the removal efficiency of nrp was higher the doc removed through adsorption in wwtp c could potentially account for a fraction of simultaneous p removal 3 2 4 phosphorus removal via photocatalysis the impact of photolysis on p was assessed by evaluating the change in total p concentrations during uv oxidation fig 2 shows that the tp concentrations in the wwtp a c and industrial effluent samples decreased gradually after tio2 uv photolysis was initiated after 35 min of exposure 16 0 kwh m3 the average tp concentrations in the wwtp a fig 2a wwtp c fig 2c and industrial samples fig 2d were 34 29 and 1060 μg p l respectively the impact of uv exposure on p in the wwtp b effluent could not be assessed as the total and reactive p concentrations in this stream were below detection prior to treatment the removals during photolysis were found to be statistically significant reducing tp concentrations by 23 in wwtp a t 4 3 75 p 0 02 46 in wwtp c t 4 56 9 p 0 001 and 24 in the industrial sample t 4 3 50 p 0 02 wwtp c was observed to have the largest tp removal efficiency when compared to the industrial sample and wwtp a overall uv oxidation removed tp in effluents from all of the streams that had measurable concentrations it was anticipated that uv oxidation would impact the organic p species in the wastewater therefore nrp concentrations were monitored the oxidation of effluents from wwtp a c and the industrial sample yielded average nrp concentrations of 10 8 and 930 μg p l respectively corresponding to reductions of nrp of 25 58 and 32 the decrease in nrp was statistically significant in all cases wwtp a t 4 4 11 p 0 01 wwtp c t 4 55 48 p 0 001 industry t 4 4 33 p 0 01 the highest removal was observed in wwtp c suggesting that the nrp in this stream was more susceptible to photolysis when compared to wwtp a and the industrial effluent doc concentrations were also examined in wwtp a b and c after uv oxidation to assess whether there was concurrent removal of nrp and organic removal average doc concentrations of 6 8 and 7 7 mg c l were measured in the wwtp a and c effluents respectively after 35 min of uv irradiation 16 0 kwh m3 hence oxidation reduced the doc by 0 9 mg c l in the wwtp c effluent t 4 25 31 p 0 002 while there was no effect on doc in wwtp a t 4 0 87 p 0 44 in wwtp c the decrease in doc coincided with increased nrp removal 58 suggesting that nrp removed from wwtp c via oxidation was associated with doc oxidation the results suggest that the relationship between doc and nrp removal depends upon the composition of the organic matter and may differ between effluent streams the changes in reactive p concentrations through hydrolysis were examined as prior studies have employed increases in rp concentrations as evidence of oxidation of p bearing organics by photocatalysis chen and liu 2007 after 35 min of uv oxidation 16 0 kwh m3 both wwtp a and c had rp concentrations of 24 μg p l while the industrial sample had an rp concentration of 131 μg p l as a result of oxidation the rp concentration in the wwtp a effluent underwent a statistically significant decrease of 23 t 4 3 56 p 0 03 the rp concentrations in the wwtp c effluent did not statistically change with uv treatment t 4 1 97 p 0 12 by contrast the rp concentrations in the industrial sample increased significantly t 4 7 24 p 0 002 with the rp concentration obtained after 35 min 16 0 kwh m3 of uv exposure reaching a value that was 3 7x higher than the initial concentration the increased rp concentration demonstrated that rp was liberated by photolysis of nrp in the industrial sample overall uv oxidation generated different responses in the treated effluents with rp decreasing in wwtp a and increasing in the industrial sample there was no significant change in rp concentrations during oxidation of wwtp c as previously demonstrated phosphorus was removed from the various streams by a combination of ultrafiltration adsorption and oxidation however the responses differed between streams and hence the collective responses were summarized in fig 4 to facilitate overall comparisons the total removal in wwtp b could only be estimated since the tp and rp concentrations after ultrafiltration were below the method detection limit viewed collectively the aop reduced both nrp and rp in the municipal wwtp effluents to low levels retaining p in the tio2 solids treatment of the effluent from wwtp b resulted in an overall removal of 87 treatment of wwtp a and c effluents resulted in overall phosphorus removals of 90 and 97 respectively by contrast only 44 of the tp was removed from the automotive industry sample overall the aop effectively removed nrp in the wastewater samples treated achieving high level removal of tp in real wastewater effluents 4 conclusion coupling ultrafiltration with tio2 uv proved to be effective at removing both model compounds via adsorption onto the tio2 as well as oxidation via uv irradiation tests with individual model compounds gave insight into the behaviour of each compound during treatment phosphorus removal in the wwtp effluents and industrial samples was found to occur through filtration of the sample adsorption onto the tio2 and uv irradiation phosphorus removal was observed when wastewater effluents were filtered through the ultrafiltration membrane prior to uv irradiation after 35 min of uv irradiation 16 0 kwh m3 90 87 and 97 total phosphorus removals were observed for wwtps a b and c respectively the industrial sample saw the lowest removal after uv irradiation with total p removal of 35 it was evident in several trials that rp was being liberated through nrp oxidation rp concentration in wwtp a and industry samples increased with time in summary the commercial aop effectively oxidized nrp to rp achieving high level removal of tp in real wastewater effluents and p was retained on the tio2 solids the results of this study show the potential benefits of using the aop for nrp removal but also highlights where more study is necessary the aop can work well on wastewater streams more susceptible to treatment this was observed when the aop effectively removed p in wwtp c through filtration adsorption and oxidation reducing tp to less that 30 μg p l ontario 1994 since the liberated rp was adsorbed onto the tio2 solids the amount of tp in wwtp c after aop treatment was ultra low and would have less impact on receiving waters when compared to its initial speciation alternatively the aop was not as effective in treatment of the industrial sample in which organic p was more recalcitrant p was removed through the actions of ultrafiltration and oxidation while adsorption onto tio2 had no effect on p this indicates that composition of the waste stream substantially affects the performance of the aop as proof of principle this method has promise however more study is required to clearly understand the relationship between composition and aop performance additionally use of different wavelengths catalysts sorbents e g tio2 amended with fe oh 3 and manipulation of water chemistry should be expected in future work to truly exploit the potential of the aop for advanced oxidation and

17796,activated persulphate ps oxidation is a promising in situ remediation technology for groundwater and soils application of this technology to contaminated zones may result in a large quantity of ps residue in the subsurface environment due to inefficient activation and repeated injection in this study we demonstrated that natural organic matter nom molecules could be reconfigured due to exposure to unactivated ps and bicarbonate resulting in reduced disinfection byproducts formation potential in post chlorination process fourier transformed inferred spectrometry ftir size exclusive chromotraghy sec and mass spectrometry ms analysis revealed that hydroxylation and carboxylation of nom occurred followed by inter molecular coupling via ether bonds the change of both the reactivity toward free chlorine and molecular structure of nom during ps bicarbonate treatment was well mimicked by 3 5 dihydroxylbenzoic acid suggesting that phenolic moieties in nom molecules were the main sites underwent transformation in the ps bicarbonate system we propose that peroxymonocarbonate hco4 formed upon the reaction between ps and bicarbonate was the main reactive species responsible for the reconfiguration of nom it selectively attacked the phenolic moieties via single electron abstracting mechanism leading to phenoxy radical intermediates which couple to each other via c o c bonds the findings of this study shed light on the environmental behaviors and impacts of ps in groundwater environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords persulphate bicarbonate natural organic matter disinfection byproducts peroxymonocarbonate 1 introduction sulphate radical so4 based oxidation has been considered as a promising technology for in situ degradation of organic pollutants in groundwater and soils huang et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 so4 has a high redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe wang and wang 2018 it reacts with a wide spectrum of organic compounds at second order rate constants ranging from 106 to 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1977 as a result organic compounds are degraded to small molecules and even mineralized to co2 and h2o sharma and feng 2019 compared to hydroxyl radicals e0 1 8 2 7 v vs nhe guo et al 2013 which react with organic compounds by mechanisms of h abstraction electron transfer and addition padmaja et al 1993 so4 is more selective it reacts with organic compounds primarily via single electron transfer mechanism usually so4 is generated by activation of persulphate ps by heating lu et al 2015 transition metals ikea et al 2018 uv khan et al 2017 alkali furman et al 2010 etc however limitations are associated with these activation approaches in practical applications for example heat activation is simple and efficient but is costly and not suitable for large subsurface region transition metal activation does not require high energy input but additional chelating agents are usually needed to prevent transition metals from precipitation or being oxidized liang et al 2009 rastogia et al 2009 wu et al 2014 alkali activation can corrode equipments or cause precipitation of metals due to strong alkalinity in addition groundwater has a certain buffer capacity a large amount of alkali liquid is often required to adjust the ph to suitable range in soil and groundwater remediation practices ps is often inefficiently activated horia et al 2007 in addition ps is often injected repeatedly to ensure complete degradation of pollutants ps is relatively stable in the absence of exogenous energy or catalysts with a half life time in underground from months to years johnson et al 2008 zhai et al 2014 therefore after in situ remediation a large quantity of ps residue can be found in groundwater environment carbonate species are ubiquitous in environment they provide buffer capacity in natural waters their speciation and concentrations are governed by ph and co2 partial pressure the total carbonate concentration could range from a few to over 10 mm in groundwaters depending on geological conditions abdelouas et al 1998 richardt and dominic 2010 at circumneutral conditions bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant species it was reported that bicarbonate could react with h2o2 to form peroxymonocarbonate hco4 which showed high reactivity toward electron rich compounds such as sulfides and phenols bakhmutova albert et al 2010 richardt and dominic 2010 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 proposed that hco4 might play a significant role in h2o2 in situ oxidaiton processes where ho formation is inefficient yang et al 2019 in a previous study we found that hco3 could also react with ps to form hco4 jiang et al 2017 in addition we demonstrated that hco4 could selectively oxidize phenolic compounds to phenoxy radicals by single electron transfer and phenoxy radicals then couple to each other to form oligomers phenol functional groups are usually densely present in natural organic matter nom molecules that are ubiquitously found in natural environment thus reaction with the phenolic moieties in nom molecules is presumed to be an important sink of hco4 in situ generated upon the reaction between hco3 and ps in subsurface environment such reactions are expected to reconfigure the molecular structures of nom i e resulting in coupling of the phenolic functionalities to form ethers this in turn brings subtle change to their physicochemical properties and reactivities such as the interactions with organic pollutants and metals the reaction behavior in various water treatment units etc phenolic functionalities are known to act as the principal reactive sites for free chlorine and responsible for the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during water disinfection process liu et al 2015 reckhow et al 1990 sharma et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 based on the above analysis upon exposure to hco4 the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the nom molecules are expected to be converted to ethers resulting in a decrease in their reactivity toward chlorine and therefore reducing the formation of dbps this study was designed to test this hypothesis we systematically examined the disinfection byproducts formation potential dbpfp of nom before and after ps bicarbonate treatment in an attempt to establish the relationship between dbpfp and nom structural change a phenolic model compound with defined structure was also employed to elucidate possible reaction pathways this study sheds light on the environmental

acquisition were pulse length 30 acquisition time 1 36315 s relation delay 2 0 s number of scans 32 temperature 25 0 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of the dbpfp of nom exposed to ps bicarbonate several studies showed that advanced oxidation including activated ps oxidation such as uv ps and heat ps resulted in the degreadation of nom and decreased dbp formation in the subsequent chlorination process hua et al 2019 pengchao xie et al 2015 wang et al 2020 nom samples pre treated by ps bicarbonate for different time were chlorinated to determine the dbpfp the data are illustrated in fig 1 a chloroform and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were the dominant dbp species the formation potential of chloroform of the nom reduced after ps bicarbonate pre treatment the extent of reduction was positively related to the pre treatment time the value of the raw nom sample was 986 9 μg l it decreased to 606 1 μg l after 10 d ps bicarbonate pre treatment the formation potential of tcaa of the raw nom sample was 226 5 μg l the value increased first and reached a temporary maximum in approximately 4 d and decreased thereafter after 10 d pre treatment the formation potential of tcaa decreased to 159 4 μg l the formation potential of dichloroacetic acid dcaa and monochloroacetic acid mcaa was conspiciously less than that of tcaa but follow a similar trend fig s1 shows the dbpfp of nom in the control sample where carbonate species was minimized it can be seen that no significant change of dbpfp occurred in 10 d toc of the samples was also monitored during ps bicarbonate pre treatment and the data are shown in the supporting information fig s2 it was found that ps bicarbonate pre treatment did not cause significant reduction of toc indicating that nom was not degraded therefore we speculate that the molecular structure of nom was reconfigured due to the exposure to ps bicarbonate which led to the change of its dbpfp in post chlorination process 3 2 characterization of nom ftir was applied to characterize the structure of nom before and after ps bicarbonate pre treatment nom molecules contain abundant hydroxyl both aliphatic and aromatic and carboxylic groups with o h stretching vibration wavelengths overlapping each other generating a broad band between 3000 and 3800 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 this typical ir band is clearly seen in the untreated nom as shown in fig 2 after ps bicarbonate pre treatment for 5 d the intensity of this band increased suggesting that more oh groups were generated however further treatment by ps bicarbonate diminished this band since phenolic functionalities in nom molecules are recognized as the primary sites for chlorination and generation of chlorinated dbps the dynamic of the band of oh groups in ftir echos the change of the dbpfp especially for haas fig 1a during ps bicarbonate pre treatment similar increase and decrease dynamic was also observed for the bands at 1612 and 1693 cm 1 corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric o co stretching in carboxylates walter et al 2005 wang et al 2015 respectively increasing of hydroxyl and carboxylic functionalities indicates the oxidation of nom after exposure to ps bicarbonate however the formation of these functionalities was temporal and they were further transformed in the presence of ps bicarbonate in contrast to hydroxyl and carboxylic groups the intensity of ether functionality corresponding to the bands at 1275 1200 cm 1 and 1150 1020 cm 1 symmetric and asymmetric c o c stretching vibration abbasa et al 2017 increased monotonically during ps bicarbonate pre treatment an ether is formed via condensation of two hydroxyl groups with the extrusion of a water molecule thus increase of ether functionality suggests the formation of inter and or intra molecular c o c bonds inter molecular c o c bonding resulted in increased molecular size which was corroborated by sec analysis fig 4 depicts the mws distribution of nom before and after ps bicarbonate pre treatment the untreated nom eluted from the sec column appeared as a broad monomodal distribution with subtle shoulders and small subpeaks which is consistent with the findings of other studes yu ping et al 1994 kristiana et al 2014 siva and madjid 2007 a similar sec profile was observed after ps bicarbonate pre treatment however the peak center shifted from 8 97 min to 8 17 min in 5 d and 8 03 min in 10 d this indicates that the average mw of nom increased due to ps bicarbonate treatment in contrast the peak center remained at the same position in the control with bicarnonate minimized the extracted nom samples were further analysis by ms nom comprises a collection of molecules of different sizes ms depicts mws and distribution of these individual molecules as illustrated in fig 3 the mws of the molecules in the nom before ps bicarbonate treatment mostly fall into the range of 100 800 da with the median of 300 400 da which is in accordance with previous studies leenheer et al 2003 rostad and leenheer 2004 after 10 d of treatment the molecular size increased significantly the median mw shifted to approximately 1000 da this strongly indicates that nom molecules were covalently bonded upon ps bicarbonate pre treatment in addition to the growth of molecular sizes the intensities of the ms peaks also increased significantly after ps bicarbonate pre treatment which serves as an additional evidence of the transformation of alcohols phenols to ethers the oxygen atoms in oh groups both aliphatic and phenolic are generally less likely to be protonated than those in ether groups in esi generally phenols or alcohols have a lower ionization efficiency and thus weaker peak intensities in ms than ethers moreover decarboxylation occurred during the treatment as reveled by ftir which is also advantageous to the generation of positively charged molecular ions in esi 3 3 reaction mechanisms both ms and ftir analysis suggests that nom molecules underwent a temporal hydroxylation followed by inter molecular c o c bonding during ps bicarbonate pre treatment to verify the reaction pathways dhba which has been adapted as an nom model compound in the studies of dbps formation guan et al 2006 was used to mimic the reactivity of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment as shown in fig 1b it is evident that the change of dbpfp of dhba during ps bicarbonate pre treatment followed a similar trend as that of nom i e chloroform formation potential decreased continuously haas formation potential increased first then decreased meanwhile no obvious reduction of toc was observed fig s3 suggesting dbha was transformed but not mineralized from these data it is presumed that moieties of similar phenolic structure in nom molecules were responsible for the reactions in the ps bicarbonate system in other words the reaction behavior of nom can be well mimicked by dhba thus the transformation pathway of dhba in ps bicarbonate system reveal insights on the transformation of nom at a molecular level the transformation products of dhba after ps bicarbonate treatment were enriched and analyzed by ms with an esi interface at negative mode fig 5 presents the full scan ms of the sample before and after reaction in addition to the molecular ion of residual dhba m z 153 four new product peaks m z 109 m z 169 m z 197 and m z 261 can be identified fig 5c the ms ms spectra of each of the peaks are shown in fig s4 the mw of the product corresponding to the peak m z 169 is 16 da higher than that of dhba suggesting it is a hydroxylated dhba the ms ms spectrum of this product is characterized by the cleavage of a co2 molecule 44 da the peak of m z 109 is presumed to be resorcinol formed by decarboxylation of dhba according to the mw the product of m z 197 is probably a derivative of dhba with an extra carboxylic acid group substituted on the aromatic ring these carboxylate groups cleaved sequentially to generate daughter ions m z 153 and m z 109 in ms ms fig s4 fig 6 illustrates the time course formation by peak areas of the transformation products of dhba during ps bicarbonate pre treatment the concentrations of hydroxylated m z 169 and carboxylated m z 197 derivatives increased first and then decreased their temporal maximums appeared at approximately 5 d this trend is in accordance with the change of ftir of the nom during ps bicarbonate treatment formation of hydroxyl and carboxylic functionalities results in more o h stretching thus a stronger absorbance band at 3000 3800 cm 1 formation of carboxylic group explains the intensified absorbance bands at 1612 and 1693 cm 1 in the first 5 d fig 2 however these functionalities were formed temporally and then declined which explains the diminishing of the respective ftir absorbance bands observed after 5 d fig 2 along with the transformation of hydroxylated and carboxylated dhba a product with m z 261 was generated gradually according to the mw and ms ms we postulate that this product was formed via coupling of resorcinol and dhba through ether bond the yield of this product increased monotonically fig 2 which is consistent with the continuous increase of the bands at 1275 1200 cm 1 and 1150 1020 cm 1 corresponding to c o c stretching in ftir overall the observed change of ftir of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment can be well interpreted by the transformation of dhba as depicted in fig 6 which further corroborates that the phenolic moieties in nom was the main reactive sites that underwent oxidation and coupling during ps bicarbonate pre treatment 3 4 identification of the reactive species generally oh and so4 are considered as the principal oxidizing species in activated ps oxidation processes guan et al 2011 these radicals are extremely potent oxidants that react with a wide spectrum of organic compounds however presence of methanol a scavenger of both oh and so4 elbenberger et al 1978 neta and huie 1998 during the pre treatment process caused no difference in terms of the change the dbpfp for both nom and dhba fig s5 this suggests that the reconfiguration of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment was unlikely due to these radicals the rate of dhba transformation increased with the elevation of ps dose as shown in fig 7 when the ps dose was increased from 2 0 to 8 0 mm the removal of dhba in 18 d increased from 31 9 to 84 2 a linear relationship can be established between the pseudo first order rate constant and ps dose insert in fig 7 since the reactors were open to atmosphere it is not realistic to adjust the concentration of bicarbonate while having ph fixed thus a control experiment was performed by bubbling n2 to the solution to minimize the dissolution of co2 from atmosphere and thus the concentrations of carbonate species the data are also shown in fig 7 it is evident that the transformation of dhba was significantly inhibited the removal of dhba in 18 d decreased from 31 9 to 25 given ps dose of 2 0 mm meanwhile products of m z 169 m z 197 and m z 261 which appeared in ps bicarbonate system were absent in the control sample fig 5b these data indicate that bicarbonate also played an important role in the transformation of dhba a previously study revealed that ps could react with hco3 to form peroxymonocarbonate hco4 jiang et al 2017 as an anionic peracid it can oxidize certain organic compounds such as organosulfides neta and huie 1998 amines balagam and richardson 2008 and olefin yao and richardson 2000 in this study 13c enriched bicarbonate h13co3 was used to examine the formation of hco4 upon reaction with ps by 13c nmr richardson et al 2000 the reaction was performed in a mixed alcohol water solvent in order to inhibit the hydrolysis of hco4 richardson et al 2000 as shown in fig 8 a total of 3 peaks were identified in the sample the peaks at approximately 160 8 and 159 5 ppm can be assigned as hco3 and the alcohol carbonate adduct etoco2 respectively since they were also found in the control sample with ps absent a new peak at 165 4 ppm appeared in ps bicarbonate system because there were no other organic carbon species we assume this signal correspond to the carbon in hco4 since hco4 was reported to be formed when bicarbonate and h2o2 are mixed bakhmutova albert et al 2010 lin and liu 2009 while ps can be considered as a derivative of h2o2 hco4 has an oxidative potential of 1 8 0 1 v vs nhe at neutral to moderately basic conditions richardson et al 2000 which is close to that of h2o2 1 78 v in an earlier study we found that hco4 decomposed rapidly in water solution to form superoxide o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 but only hco4 reacted with phenolic compounds via single electron oxidation mechanism generating phenoxy radicals which couple to each other via c o c bond jiang et al 2017 this explains the formation of the product m z 261 during the oxidation of dhba in bicarbonate ps system we postulate that the phenolic moieties in nom molecules underwent a similar oxidative coupling resulting in simultaneous removal of phenolic functionality and inter molecular formation of c o c bonds and accordingly the reduction dbpfp in subsequent chlorination process 4 conclusions it was revealed that nom subjected to ps bicarbonate pre treatment led to decreased dbpfp in post chlorination process ftir sec and ms analysis indicated that nom molecules underwent hydroxylation and carboxylation followed by inter molecular coupling forming c o c bonds such reactions were presumed to result in the reduction of phenolic functionalities and growth of mw which accounted for the decrease of its reactivity toward free chlorine the reaction behavior of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment can be well mimicked by dhba in terms of the change of dbpfp and formation of coupling products by c o c bonds indicating phenolic moieties in nom molecules were the main sites underwent transformation during ps bicarbonate pre treatment formation of hco4 from the reaction between hco3 and ps was proposed and it was responsible for the reconfiguration of nom resulting in the coupling of the phenolic functionalities to form ethers and thus reducing dbpfp it should be noted that nom plays a pivot role in many enviornental chemistry processes the subtle reconfiguration of nom structure and the associated change of environmental behavior due to the exposure to hco4 in ps bicarbonate system such as the interactions with organics and heavy metals deserve further study declaration of competing

groundwater has a certain buffer capacity a large amount of alkali liquid is often required to adjust the ph to suitable range in soil and groundwater remediation practices ps is often inefficiently activated horia et al 2007 in addition ps is often injected repeatedly to ensure complete degradation of pollutants ps is relatively stable in the absence of exogenous energy or catalysts with a half life time in underground from months to years johnson et al 2008 zhai et al 2014 therefore after in situ remediation a large quantity of ps residue can be found in groundwater environment carbonate species are ubiquitous in environment they provide buffer capacity in natural waters their speciation and concentrations are governed by ph and co2 partial pressure the total carbonate concentration could range from a few to over 10 mm in groundwaters depending on geological conditions abdelouas et al 1998 richardt and dominic 2010 at circumneutral conditions bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant species it was reported that bicarbonate could react with h2o2 to form peroxymonocarbonate hco4 which showed high reactivity toward electron rich compounds such as sulfides and phenols bakhmutova albert et al 2010 richardt and dominic 2010 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 proposed that hco4 might play a significant role in h2o2 in situ oxidaiton processes where ho formation is inefficient yang et al 2019 in a previous study we found that hco3 could also react with ps to form hco4 jiang et al 2017 in addition we demonstrated that hco4 could selectively oxidize phenolic compounds to phenoxy radicals by single electron transfer and phenoxy radicals then couple to each other to form oligomers phenol functional groups are usually densely present in natural organic matter nom molecules that are ubiquitously found in natural environment thus reaction with the phenolic moieties in nom molecules is presumed to be an important sink of hco4 in situ generated upon the reaction between hco3 and ps in subsurface environment such reactions are expected to reconfigure the molecular structures of nom i e resulting in coupling of the phenolic functionalities to form ethers this in turn brings subtle change to their physicochemical properties and reactivities such as the interactions with organic pollutants and metals the reaction behavior in various water treatment units etc phenolic functionalities are known to act as the principal reactive sites for free chlorine and responsible for the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during water disinfection process liu et al 2015 reckhow et al 1990 sharma et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 based on the above analysis upon exposure to hco4 the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the nom molecules are expected to be converted to ethers resulting in a decrease in their reactivity toward chlorine and therefore reducing the formation of dbps this study was designed to test this hypothesis we systematically examined the disinfection byproducts formation potential dbpfp of nom before and after ps bicarbonate treatment in an attempt to establish the relationship between dbpfp and nom structural change a phenolic model compound with defined structure was also employed to elucidate possible reaction pathways this study sheds light on the environmental implication of ps application in subsurface remediation practices 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and material all chemicals were of analytical grade or better sodium persulphate k2s2o8 sodium

acquisition were pulse length 30 acquisition time 1 36315 s relation delay 2 0 s number of scans 32 temperature 25 0 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of the dbpfp of nom exposed to ps bicarbonate several studies showed that advanced oxidation including activated ps oxidation such as uv ps and heat ps resulted in the degreadation of nom and decreased dbp formation in the subsequent chlorination process hua et al 2019 pengchao xie et al 2015 wang et al 2020 nom samples pre treated by ps bicarbonate for different time were chlorinated to determine the dbpfp the data are illustrated in fig 1 a chloroform and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were the dominant dbp species the formation potential of chloroform of the nom reduced after ps bicarbonate pre treatment the extent of reduction was positively related to the pre treatment time the value of the raw nom sample was 986 9 μg l it decreased to 606 1 μg l after 10 d ps bicarbonate pre treatment the formation potential of tcaa of the raw nom sample was 226 5 μg l the value increased first and reached a temporary maximum in approximately 4 d and decreased thereafter after 10 d pre treatment the formation potential of tcaa decreased to 159 4 μg l the formation potential of dichloroacetic acid dcaa and monochloroacetic acid mcaa was conspiciously less than that of tcaa but follow a similar trend fig s1 shows the dbpfp of nom in the control sample where carbonate species was minimized it can be seen that no significant change of dbpfp occurred in 10 d toc of the samples was also monitored during ps bicarbonate pre treatment and the data are shown in the supporting information fig s2 it was found that ps bicarbonate pre treatment did not cause significant reduction of toc indicating that nom was not degraded therefore we speculate that the molecular structure of nom was reconfigured due to the exposure to ps bicarbonate which led to the change of its dbpfp in post chlorination process 3 2 characterization of nom ftir was applied to characterize the structure of nom before and after ps bicarbonate pre treatment nom molecules contain abundant hydroxyl both aliphatic and aromatic and carboxylic groups with o h stretching vibration wavelengths overlapping each other generating a broad band between 3000 and 3800 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 this typical ir band is clearly seen in the untreated nom as shown in fig 2 after ps bicarbonate pre treatment for 5 d the intensity of this band increased suggesting that more oh groups were generated however further treatment by ps bicarbonate diminished this band since phenolic functionalities in nom molecules are recognized as the primary sites for chlorination and generation of chlorinated dbps the dynamic of the band of oh groups in ftir echos the change of the dbpfp especially for haas fig 1a during ps bicarbonate pre treatment similar increase and decrease dynamic was also observed for the bands at 1612 and 1693 cm 1 corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric o co stretching in carboxylates walter et al 2005 wang et al 2015 respectively increasing of hydroxyl and carboxylic functionalities indicates the oxidation of nom after exposure to ps bicarbonate however the formation of these functionalities was temporal and they were further transformed in the presence of ps bicarbonate in contrast to hydroxyl and carboxylic groups the intensity of ether functionality corresponding to the bands at 1275 1200 cm 1 and 1150 1020 cm 1 symmetric and asymmetric c o c stretching vibration abbasa et al 2017 increased monotonically during ps bicarbonate pre treatment an ether is formed via condensation of two hydroxyl groups with the extrusion of a water molecule thus increase of ether functionality suggests the formation of inter and or intra molecular c o c bonds inter molecular c o c bonding resulted in increased molecular size which was corroborated by sec analysis fig 4 depicts the mws distribution of nom before and after ps bicarbonate pre treatment the untreated nom eluted from the sec column appeared as a broad monomodal distribution with subtle shoulders and small subpeaks which is consistent with the findings of other studes yu ping et al 1994 kristiana et al 2014 siva and madjid 2007 a similar sec profile was observed after ps bicarbonate pre treatment however the peak center shifted from 8 97 min to 8 17 min in 5 d and 8 03 min in 10 d this indicates that the average mw of nom increased due to ps bicarbonate treatment in contrast the peak center remained at the same position in the control with bicarnonate minimized the extracted nom samples were further analysis by ms nom comprises a collection of molecules of different sizes ms depicts mws and distribution of these individual molecules as illustrated in fig 3 the mws of the molecules in the nom before ps bicarbonate treatment mostly fall into the range of 100 800 da with the median of 300 400 da which is in accordance with previous studies leenheer et al 2003 rostad and leenheer 2004 after 10 d of treatment the molecular size increased significantly the median mw shifted to approximately 1000 da this strongly indicates that nom molecules were covalently bonded upon ps bicarbonate pre treatment in addition to the growth of molecular sizes the intensities of the ms peaks also increased significantly after ps bicarbonate pre treatment which serves as an additional evidence of the transformation of alcohols phenols to ethers the oxygen atoms in oh groups both aliphatic and phenolic are generally less likely to be protonated than those in ether groups in esi generally phenols or alcohols have a lower ionization efficiency and thus weaker peak intensities in ms than ethers moreover decarboxylation occurred during the treatment as reveled by ftir which is also advantageous to the generation of positively charged molecular ions in esi 3 3 reaction mechanisms both ms and ftir analysis suggests that nom molecules underwent a temporal hydroxylation followed by inter molecular c o c bonding during ps bicarbonate pre treatment to verify the reaction pathways dhba which has been adapted as an nom model compound in the studies of dbps formation guan et al 2006 was used to mimic the reactivity of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment as shown in fig 1b it is evident that the change of dbpfp of dhba during ps bicarbonate pre treatment followed a similar trend as that of nom i e chloroform formation potential decreased continuously haas formation potential increased first then decreased meanwhile no obvious reduction of toc was observed fig s3 suggesting dbha was transformed but not mineralized from these data it is presumed that moieties of similar phenolic structure in nom molecules were responsible for the reactions in the ps bicarbonate system in other words the reaction behavior of nom can be well mimicked by dhba thus the transformation pathway of dhba in ps bicarbonate system reveal insights on the transformation of nom at a molecular level the transformation products of dhba after ps bicarbonate treatment were enriched and analyzed by ms with an esi interface at negative mode fig 5 presents the full scan ms of the sample before and after reaction in addition to the molecular ion of residual dhba m z 153 four new product peaks m z 109 m z 169 m z 197 and m z 261 can be identified fig 5c the ms ms spectra of each of the peaks are shown in fig s4 the mw of the product corresponding to the peak m z 169 is 16 da higher than that of dhba suggesting it is a hydroxylated dhba the ms ms spectrum of this product is characterized by the cleavage of a co2 molecule 44 da the peak of m z 109 is presumed to be resorcinol formed by decarboxylation of dhba according to the mw the product of m z 197 is probably a derivative of dhba with an extra carboxylic acid group substituted on the aromatic ring these carboxylate groups cleaved sequentially to generate daughter ions m z 153 and m z 109 in ms ms fig s4 fig 6 illustrates the time course formation by peak areas of the transformation products of dhba during ps bicarbonate pre treatment the concentrations of hydroxylated m z 169 and carboxylated m z 197 derivatives increased first and then decreased their temporal maximums appeared at approximately 5 d this trend is in accordance with the change of ftir of the nom during ps bicarbonate treatment formation of hydroxyl and carboxylic functionalities results in more o h stretching thus a stronger absorbance band at 3000 3800 cm 1 formation of carboxylic group explains the intensified absorbance bands at 1612 and 1693 cm 1 in the first 5 d fig 2 however these functionalities were formed temporally and then declined which explains the diminishing of the respective ftir absorbance bands observed after 5 d fig 2 along with the transformation of hydroxylated and carboxylated dhba a product with m z 261 was generated gradually according to the mw and ms ms we postulate that this product was formed via coupling of resorcinol and dhba through ether bond the yield of this product increased monotonically fig 2 which is consistent with the continuous increase of the bands at 1275 1200 cm 1 and 1150 1020 cm 1 corresponding to c o c stretching in ftir overall the observed change of ftir of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment can be well interpreted by the transformation of dhba as depicted in fig 6 which further corroborates that the phenolic moieties in nom was the main reactive sites that underwent oxidation and coupling during ps bicarbonate pre treatment 3 4 identification of the reactive species generally oh and so4 are considered as the principal oxidizing species in activated ps oxidation processes guan et al 2011 these radicals are extremely potent oxidants that react with a wide spectrum of organic compounds however presence of methanol a scavenger of both oh and so4 elbenberger et al 1978 neta and huie 1998 during the pre treatment process caused no difference in terms of the change the dbpfp for both nom and dhba fig s5 this suggests that the reconfiguration of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment was unlikely due to these radicals the rate of dhba transformation increased with the elevation of ps dose as shown in fig 7 when the ps dose was increased from 2 0 to 8 0 mm the removal of dhba in 18 d increased from 31 9 to 84 2 a linear relationship can be established between the pseudo first order rate constant and ps dose insert in fig 7 since the reactors were open to atmosphere it is not realistic to adjust the concentration of bicarbonate while having ph fixed thus a control experiment was performed by bubbling n2 to the solution to minimize the dissolution of co2 from atmosphere and thus the concentrations of carbonate species the data are also shown in fig 7 it is evident that the transformation of dhba was significantly inhibited the removal of dhba in 18 d decreased from 31 9 to 25 given ps dose of 2 0 mm meanwhile products of m z 169 m z 197 and m z 261 which appeared in ps bicarbonate system were absent in the control sample fig 5b these data indicate that bicarbonate also played an important role in the transformation of dhba a previously study revealed that ps could react with hco3 to form peroxymonocarbonate hco4 jiang et al 2017 as an anionic peracid it can oxidize certain organic compounds such as organosulfides neta and huie 1998 amines balagam and richardson 2008 and olefin yao and richardson 2000 in this study 13c enriched bicarbonate h13co3 was used to examine the formation of hco4 upon reaction with ps by 13c nmr richardson et al 2000 the reaction was performed in a mixed alcohol water solvent in order to inhibit the hydrolysis of hco4 richardson et al 2000 as shown in fig 8 a total of 3 peaks were identified in the sample the peaks at approximately 160 8 and 159 5 ppm can be assigned as hco3 and the alcohol carbonate adduct etoco2 respectively since they were also found in the control sample with ps absent a new peak at 165 4 ppm appeared in ps bicarbonate system because there were no other organic carbon species we assume this signal correspond to the carbon in hco4 since hco4 was reported to be formed when bicarbonate and h2o2 are mixed bakhmutova albert et al 2010 lin and liu 2009 while ps can be considered as a derivative of h2o2 hco4 has an oxidative potential of 1 8 0 1 v vs nhe at neutral to moderately basic conditions richardson et al 2000 which is close to that of h2o2 1 78 v in an earlier study we found that hco4 decomposed rapidly in water solution to form superoxide o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 but only hco4 reacted with phenolic compounds via single electron oxidation mechanism generating phenoxy radicals which couple to each other via c o c bond jiang et al 2017 this explains the formation of the product m z 261 during the oxidation of dhba in bicarbonate ps system we postulate that the phenolic moieties in nom molecules underwent a similar oxidative coupling resulting in simultaneous removal of phenolic functionality and inter molecular formation of c o c bonds and accordingly the reduction dbpfp in subsequent chlorination process 4 conclusions it was revealed that nom subjected to ps bicarbonate pre treatment led to decreased dbpfp in post chlorination process ftir sec and ms analysis indicated that nom molecules underwent hydroxylation and carboxylation followed by inter molecular coupling forming c o c bonds such reactions were presumed to result in the reduction of phenolic functionalities and growth of mw which accounted for the decrease of its reactivity toward free chlorine the reaction behavior of nom during ps bicarbonate pre treatment can be well mimicked by dhba in terms of the change of dbpfp and formation of coupling products by c o c bonds indicating phenolic moieties in nom molecules were the main sites underwent transformation during ps bicarbonate pre treatment formation of hco4 from the reaction between hco3 and ps was proposed and it was responsible for the reconfiguration of nom resulting in the coupling of the phenolic functionalities to form ethers and thus reducing dbpfp it should be noted that nom plays a pivot role in many enviornental chemistry processes the subtle reconfiguration of nom structure and the associated change of environmental behavior due to the exposure to hco4 in ps bicarbonate system such as the interactions with organics and heavy metals deserve further study declaration of competing

17797,a critical challenge in the application of membrane bioreactors mbr for domestic wastewater treatment is its high energy consumption caused by continuous aeration for biofouling control to reduce energy consumption and mitigate fouling in membranes alternative configurations using dynamic shear enhanced filtration by membrane reciprocation rotation and vibration to mechanically impose shear on membrane surfaces have been recently introduced however although these methods are effective at lowering energy usage the nutrient removal efficiencies and microbial community compositions of these systems have not been well studied in this study a lab scale no aeration reciprocation membrane bioreactor was used to characterize the microbial composition functional profile and nutrient removal of the reciprocation mbr system operated under hypoxic conditions microbial community analysis showed proteobacteria 35 and saccharibacteria 27 to be the most abundant phyla in the sludge and the biofilm samples respectively nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were observed at 70 and 50 while the chemical oxygen demand concentration had about a 99 decrease in the effluent quantitative pcr of nutrient removing genes revealed the presence of complete ammonia oxidizing organisms comammox with a mean abundance of 1 88 104 gene copies g sludge which explains the high ammonia removal despite a low abundance of canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a prevalence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with clusters that are distant from other nutrient removing communities suggesting that their metabolism is not dependent on ammonia oxidizers the reciprocation mbr configuration may be a suitable more energy efficient alternative to conventional air scouring systems because of its biofouling mitigation and promising nutrient removal performed by the diverse microbial communities in its system graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor comammox nutrient removal reciprocation 1 introduction in recent years membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been increasingly used in combination with the activated sludge process asp in municipal wastewater treatment since being incorporated into the conventional asp mbrs have provided better effluent quality in wastewater treatment plants with a smaller environmental footprint as compared to settling tanks kraume and drews 2010 sadr and saroj 2015 tewari et al 2010 however one of the main challenges in mbr use is the inevitable membrane fouling which reduces permeate quality and increases energy consumption brepols et al 2010 gil et al 2010 membrane fouling during wastewater treatment is unavoidable due to solutes colloids and bacterial flocs accumulating on the surface of the membrane guo et al 2012 physical chemical mechanical and biological techniques have been applied to mitigate membrane fouling and of these the most widely used method in full scale treatment plants is the air scouring system where the membranes are continuously bombarded with coarse bubbles that scour the surfaces liang et al 2014 despite the excellent performance and success of the air scouring mbr system in the prevention of biofouling its high energy demand accounts for about 50 of the operational cost of the treatment the high energy usage in air scouring systems has promoted the development of more cost efficient and sustainable alternative mbr configurations that would match the effectivity of this anti fouling technology bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 judd 2016 krzeminski et al 2017 lee et al 2016 recently the reciprocation mbr rmbr a configuration that uses inertial forces generated from mechanically moving the hollow fiber membrane modules has shown promising results for controlling biofouling while using 20 or less of the total energy used in air scouring systems de sotto et al 2018 ho et al 2015 the reciprocation mbr system uses much less energy to maintain stable transmembrane pressure tmp while satisfactorily controlling biofouling by using a mechanically imposed shear on the membrane surface through reciprocation of the membrane module the shaking off of the wastewater components e g bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances that start membrane fouling is achieved by hanging the membrane loosely in a cassette that is attached to a motor powered moving case ho et al 2014 2015 in its pilot scale testing the reciprocation mbr system was successful in decreasing the system s total energy consumption and in improving the nutrient removal from the residual nutrients coming from the aeration basin however the microbial community composition of the sludge and how it affects nutrient removal was not studied furthermore previous pilot scale studies of the reciprocation mbr did not focus on the biological attributes e g microbial community functional genes of the system which is the most valuable information to consider in biological nutrient removal in this study a lab scale reciprocation mbr was built to investigate the microbial composition and functional profile of this energy efficient system the mbr system was operated under hypoxic conditions and its microbiome was investigated through various molecular techniques and the results were correlated with the overall nutrient removal performance of the system the microbial composition of both the activated sludge and biofilms on the membrane surface were also studied to survey the types of organisms that are enriched in a low do environment meanwhile functional genes involved in nutrient removal and the enzyme profile of the system were quantified and identified through qpcr and metagenomics analyses respectively to understand the spatial distribution of the microorganisms the distribution of nutrient removing microorganism groups in a sludge floc was visualized using fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy to the authors knowledge this is the first study on the microbial community composition function distribution and their overall effect on nutrient removal in a reciprocation mbr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 mle mbr operations and membrane performance a modified ludzack ettinger membrane bioreactor was fabricated and operated in this laboratory scale experiment supplementary fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the flow of wastewater treatment anoxic and aerobic tanks details of the lab scale reciprocation mbr including flowrates working volumes of the tanks and membrane specifications are found in supplementary tables 1 and 2 for the startup of the experiment seed sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant was inoculated in the tanks and mixed with synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater made with a composition from the recipe of villain et al 2014 that had been slightly modified to account for the typical influent characteristics of the local municipal wastewater was pumped to the anoxic tank and mixed with glucose at a flowrate of 0 6 l h q villain et al 2014 the composition of the synthetic

the mbr 3q and internal recirculation 1q both the anoxic and aerobic tanks had mechanical mixers to facilitate uniform mixing and an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the aerobic tank the 3q was pumped to the reciprocation mbr tank while 1q of the nitrate rich sludge was internally recirculated back to the anoxic tank the sludge was returned to the anoxic tank with a flowrate of 2q to maintain mlss concentration no sludge was wasted until the concentrations of mlss in the anoxic and mbr tanks reached 3 g l and 5 g l respectively and were maintained at these concentrations thereafter biofouling was monitored through the increase in transmembrane pressure tmp which was measured using a pressure gauge installed between the suction outlet and the effluent tubing tmp was maintained below 25 cmhg 0 03 bar and membrane operations was maintained at a flux of 20 lmh following a local full scale wastewater treatment facility for comparison purposes when tmp reaches above 25 cmhg the membrane modules were mildly washed with water to eliminate the cake layer and the biofilm samples were manually collected before thoroughly cleaning the membrane with a high pressure hose reciprocation of the membrane modules was achieved by attaching the membrane cassette in a case that was motorized to move back and forth meanwhile sludge and water samples were collected from the tanks and from the influent and effluent of the system for water quality monitoring and molecular experiments these experiments are found in supplementary information 2 2 dna extraction and

quantitative insights into microbial ecology v1 9 qiime caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2010 quast et al 2012 to extract dna for metagenomic analyses sludge samples were collected from the beginning of the study period after three months and at the end of study period the samples were sent for shotgun sequencing in the miseq 300 300 bp illumina platform in scelse a metagenomics pipeline used by previous studies was employed to identify key pathways and enzymes in the mbr system ng et al 2019 these key pathways and enzymes were used to evaluate the changes in the functional profiles of the microbial communities in the reciprocation mbr 2 4 fluorescence in situ hybridization sludge samples from each of the tanks collected after a year of operations were fixed using 8 paraformaldehyde for 2 h and then washed with a 1 1 ratio of 1x pbs and 96 ethanol before being stored at 20 following the standards for visualizing activated sludge in wastewater treatment a fish experiment was done on fixed samples nielsen et al 2009 briefly 15μl of fixed cells were placed on teflon coated slides soaked in 1m hcl at 60 c overnight and air dried for 5 min probes were combined with the hybridization buffer to hybridize inside a 50 ml conical tube with a buffer wetted tissue and then they were horizontally placed in tube holders at 46 c overnight before being washed in a water bath at 48 c for 5 min the contents and concentrations of hybridization and wash buffers are listed in the supplementary information st3 slides were washed with cold deionized water air dried and then 2 3 μl of mounting solution were added to each well to prevent the samples from being bleached images were visualized under a zeiss lsm710 confocal microscope zeiss germany and 3d micrographs were processed and quantified using imaris image analysis software oxford instruments switzerland 2 5 statistical and correlation analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to differentiate the gene copies of the functional genes in each of the tanks of the reciprocation mbr system in ms excel correlation tests between abundant genera and the most common nutrient removing microorganism and water quality measurements were performed in r using a corrplot package this was done to examine the potential contribution of these organisms to the nutrient removal performance of the reciprocation mle mbr system wei et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance of the reciprocation mbr the average concentrations of cod ammonia tn and tp in the influent tanks and effluent and their percentage removal efficiencies after the acclimation period of five weeks are tabulated in table 1 a decrease of about 99 in the cod concentration was observed in the effluent since glucose a readily utilizable carbon source was used as the main organic c source in the synthetic wastewater the system achieved a total nitrogen removal of 70 with a tn of 8 mg l in the effluent the unoxidized ammonia with a mean value of about 7 mg l nh3 contributed to the high tn values in the effluent the tn values could be decreased further by increasing the do concentration in the aerobic tank to a higher level than the maximum do used in this study 2 mg l which could promote better ammonia oxidation a recent study of an intermittently aerated membrane bioreactor with a high do concentration 3 5 showed a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 80 when a cod n ratio of 10 was used wang 2020 despite the c n ratio being maintained at slightly above 10 in the lab scale mbr operations the performance of the reciprocation mbr for tn removal could be enhanced with other operational conditions such as increased srt in the anoxic tank or an increased internal recirculation flowrate for high denitrification rates in the anoxic tank chen et al 2010 lee et al 2012 meanwhile about 50 of the initial p loading 22 mg l was measured in the effluent of the reciprocation mbr after treatment this is relatively lower than the p levels of other mbr systems which were designed for optimum p uptake monclús et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the low p removal of the reciprocation mbr could be due to the lack of an anaerobic tank that allows for better p uptake of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos bi et al 2013 ultimately despite these additional improvements the reciprocation mbr showed excellent removal of nutrients which is at par to conventional bnr systems while maintaining good anti fouling perfromance sf2 moreover its potential contribution to significantly decrease energy consumption through its energy efficient anti fouling mechanism addresses one of the major issues in wastewater treatment high cost due to continuous aeration of membranes with these insights the reciprocation mbr system is therefore recommended to be tested in an industrial scale where it can be operated with real wastewater at a lower cost as compared to treatment plants employing air scouring systems 3 2 activated sludge and biofilm microbial communities in a hypoxic system fig 1 presents the alpha diversity indices most abundant phyla and the top genera from the sludge n 36 and biofilm samples n 11 the alpha diversity indices for sludge samples are observed at mean values of 8 7 0 7 shannon 12297 1978 chao1 5485 623 observed otus and 203 27 faith s pd while biofilm samples have mean values of 8 41 0 5 shannon 10650 2437 chao1 5590 822 observed otus and 160 16 faith s pd these indices tell us that the species richness evenness abundance the number of different taxa and phylogenetic distances of the two groups in the reciprocation mbr system are relatively similar to discriminate the two groups further the unique and shared otus are presented in fig 1a wherein only 21 taxa are unique in the biofilm samples while 276 otus were found solely in the activated sludge samples out of the 413 otus shared by the two growth types these unique taxa from the two groups are found in sf4 to better understand the diversity of the microbial communities in the sludge and biofilm samples fig 1b shows a closer examination of the different phyla found in the two groups of the 54 phyla from the sludge samples 81 were represented by 5 groups from proteobacteria 35 saccharibacteria 16 bacteroidetes 12 chloroflexi 12 and verrucomicrobia 6 while 70 of the 43 phyla from the biofilm samples were saccharibacteria 27 proteobacteria 19 bacteroidetes 9 parcubacteria 7 and chloroflexi 6 the dominant phyla in the sludge samples from the reciprocation mbr were consistent with the ones found in wastewater treatment processes that have anoxic and aerobic stages for the treatment of livestock and poultry gu et al 2019 pharmaceutical ouyang et al 2019 and domestic wang et al 2012 wastewaters in the biofilm samples the candidate phyla od1 parcubacteria and tm7 saccharibacteria from the membrane surface of the reciprocation mbr were the next dominant phyla that had not been reported in previous studies choi et al 2017 huang et al 2008 jo et al 2016 even though the phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes still comprised most of the total taxa saccharibacteria has been reported to be the most abundant phyla comprising 50 of the total phyla in a membrane bioreactor treating landfill leachate and in activated sludge samples from wastewater treatment plants kindaichi et al 2016 remmas et al 2017 despite the prevalence of saccharibacteria its physiology and ecological role in biofouling and nutrient removal have not yet been investigated parcubacteria on the other hand have been seen in sludge samples taken from nitrogen phosphorus and micropollutant removal systems cheng et al 2018 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 parcubacteria have been identified in a broad range of anoxic environments and have been characterized as forming biofilm with attachment and adhesion proteins and a diverse group of genes that are associated with mediating cell cell contact nelson and stegen 2015 their presence and abundance suggest that they may have an important role in membrane biofouling of the reciprocation mbr under anoxic conditions at the genus level the most abundant genera in the sludge and biofilm samples are shown in fig 1c uncultured saccharibacteria is still the predominant genera in both growth types with about 7 and 13 relative abundance in sludge and biofilm samples respectively heterotrophic organisms involved in nutrient removal such as dechloromonas 1 1 caldilinea 2 4 and kouleothrix 5 2 dominated the suspended communities while uncultured bacterium gn04 3 4 and the family c hitinophagaceae 4 5 are the main species thriving in the biofilm communities 3 3 quantification of functional genes associated with removal of nutrients data from microbial community analysis may not clearly delineate the roles of the nutrient removing communities in removing n and p in each of the tanks of the reciprocation mbr to investigate further the absolute quantification of nutrient removing genes associated with complete ammonia oxidation amoa nitrospira denitrification nirs and phosphate accumulating organisms 16s accumulibacter was conducted the functional gene coding for ammonia monooxygenase in nitrospira comammox was used for comammox quantification since the relative abundance of the canonical betaproteobacterial aob was significantly lower the gene copies of amoa from the canonical aobs however when plotted against amoa nitrospira showed that the abundance of amoa aob was significantly higher p 0 05 by two logs with a mean abundance of 6 3 106 gene copies per gram of sludge data not shown as compared to 3 7 104 per gram of sludge for amoa nitrospira the disparity between the results from the microbial community analysis and the quantitative pcr might have been caused by the primers used to quantify the comammox present in the wastewater samples the total abundance of this comammox functional gene might be underestimated in this study because the existing primers may not fully detect all species of comammox a primer designed to detect all forms of comammox in environmental samples including the currentt isolates of the novel comammox nitrospira species is necessary to better understand the ecological importance of this group of organisms especially in anoxic systems meanwhile nitrate reductase coded by the nirs gene and one of the key enzymes in denitrification was used as a functional marker in previous studies for measuring the abundance of denitrifying bacteria chen et al 2014 wang et al 2014 phosphate accumulation was quantified using the 16s gene of accumulibacter pao because this process is linked to the accumulibacter species in wastewater treatment systems the qpcr s results showed mean values of 1 107 and 3 4 1010 gene copies gram of sludge for 16s accumulibacter and the nirs gene in the mle mbr system respectively the boxplots of the functional genes in the individual tanks fig 2 show that all three genes had similar log values of around 4 amoa ntsp 7 pao and 10 nirs for the duration of the study single factor analysis of variance anova for all three genes showed no significant difference p values 0 05 in the gene copies per gram of sludge between the anoxic aerobic and mbr tanks since the sludge is recirculated back to the anoxic tank where it originally flowed through the rest of the tanks supplementary fig 1 it is expected that all the tanks would have fairly similar gene copy numbers gene expression using rna from activated sludge samples to quantify the expression of each gene was not performed in this study in the future it may be necessary to conduct gene expression experiments to have a better understanding of the nutrient removing activity of the genes in the reciprocation mbr system the presence of comammox nitrospira in the reciprocation mbr system is linked to this organism s affinity with low dissolved oxygen and its preference to grow under anoxic conditions at present there is still no consensus as to whether the organism s ability to perform complete ammonia oxidation varies at different dissolved oxygen concentrations palomo et al 2018 the nitrite reductase gene meanwhile is expected to be expressed higher in both anoxic and mbr tanks where the dissolved oxygen concentration falls below 1 0 mg l dalsgaard et al 2014 in anoxic conditions the dominant electron acceptors are nitrate and nitrite which are reduced by denitrifying organisms to nitrogen gas hence in theory the highest expression of nitrite reductase should be achieved in both anoxic and reciprocation mbr tanks while its expression would be at its lowest in the aerobic tank do 1 0 mg l in previous studies the polyphosphate accumulating ability of paos were exhibited during the aerobic phase hence an increase in the expression of gene coding for phosphate accumulation is expected to increase in aerobic tanks he and mcmahon 2011 this however is not the case with denitrifying paos which were found to have an strong ability to accumulate polyphosphates while performing denitrification in an oxygen depleted environment zafiriadis et al 2011 3 4 relationship between the relative abundance of microorganisms and nutrient removal the pearson correlation coefficients of the relative abundance of the organisms and the nutrient removal efficiencies and effluent concentrations of ammonia tn and tp are tabulated in supplementary information table 4 the decrease in the ammonia concentration negative pearson coefficient r and the high percentage removal of ammonia positive r in the reciprocation mbr were highly correlated to the relative abundance of predominant otus such as uncultured actinomycetales caldilinea kouleothrix uncultured betaproteobacteria uncultured anaerolineae and pseudomonas these microorganisms are mostly heterotrophic in nature and their high correlation to the decrease in ammonia concentration may be due to assimilating ammonia for cellular growth and metabolism while ammonia is usually assimilated for biosynthesis but not for ammonia oxidation i e nitrification organisms like caldilinea and pseudomonas are known to play a part in nitrogen removal in wwtps during denitrification where nitrogen gas n2 is produced from the reduction of nitrate no3 kragelund et al 2011 lu et al 2014 aside from these abundant organisms common nutrient removing genera such as nitrospira nitrosomonadaceae dechloromonas acinetobacter and candidatus accumulibacter sf5 were also assessed of these only the nitrifying genus nitrospira showed a high negative correlation with effluent ammonia 0 78 and tn 0 71 concentrations implying that a higher abundance of this organism could lower the concentrations of ammonia and tn in the effluent strict nitrite oxidizing nitrospira however has not been shown to have the innate ability to oxidize ammonia and are mainly dependent on nitrite from ammonia oxidizing organisms meanwhile the amount of the ammonia oxidizing genus nitrosomonas was observed to have low correlation values with ammonia 0 09 and tn 0 11 concentrations in the effluent this could be because the removal of ammonia in the system was not mainly influenced by this betaproteobacterial group also the relative abundance of nitrosomonas in the sludge was seen at 0 04 which is significantly lower than nitrospira 0 28 keeping this in mind it was hypothesized that the presence of organisms that are able to completely oxidize ammonia were present in the reciprocation mbr complete ammonia oxidizing commamox organisms have been shown to oxidize ammonia to nitrate which was initially thought of as a two step process daims et al 2015 interestingly the only currently available isolates of comammox are all from the genus nitrospira which have been reported to have a higher affinity to ammonia than aobs and require low dissolved oxygen concentrations roots et al 2019 van kessel et al 2015 to support this hypothesis a graph of ammonia and tn removal efficiencies and the relative and absolute abundance of nitrospira is shown in fig 3 and sf6 as shown there is a strong relationship between the abundance of nitrospira and the ammonia and tn removal efficiencies during mbr operations which may support the presence of comammox nitrospira in the reciprocation mbr see fig 3 meanwhile of the denitrifying communities sf5 only pseudomonas had a high correlation with tn removal 0 77 despite its low relative abundance of 0 02 in comparison the denitrifying bacteria dechloromonas had a high relative abundance of 1 1 but a very low correlation coefficient acinetobacter thiobacillus and zooglea the other nitrate reducing organisms that were present in the lab scale mbr were found to perform denitrification in full scale wwtps huang et al 2015 candidatus accumulibacter known as p accumulators in nutrient removal systems had low relative abundance 0 06 and their correlation with tp concentration and removal did not correspond in this study phosphate removal in this case might result from the p accumulation of other heterotrophic bacteria that have been shown to accumulate polyphosphates under anoxic conditions in some denitrifying organisms jin et al 2014 oehmen et al 2010 the presence of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms in the system has yet to be investigated despite high correlation coefficient values supported by previous studies it is still important to note that a correlation analysis of the relative abundances of nutrient removal organisms and water quality analyses alone is not a guaranteed prediction of a system s performance as performance may also be affected by other extrinsic and intrinsic factors other molecular assays such as quantification of expression and absolute abundance can be used to confirm the results of the correlation analysis based on the current operational conditions and the microbial community composition of the reciprocation mbr the system s nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies may be further improved by some operational adjustments nitrogen removal will be improved by increasing internal recirculation rate and hrt srt in the anoxic tank which will help the denitrifying communities i e dechloromonas pseudomonas that are already abundant in the system to perform their jobs in reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas meanwhile the low abundance of organisms that are responsible for phosphate accumulation i e candidatus accumulibacter may be enriched with the addition of an anaerobic compartment in the current treatment train however since the initial seed sludge came from a system that does not enrich these organisms an addition of an inoculum coming from ebpr systems with high relative abundance of paos would be another alternative the high relative abundance of nitrospira believed to be of comammox origin should be maintained by allowing anoxic conditions that are favourable to their growth to be consistent during the mle mbr operations 3 5 functional profile analysis in the reciprocation mbr system annotated reads from the shotgun sequencing of genomic dna samples taken from the reciprocation mbr tank were analysed for the first day of operations day 0 third month day 79 and a year after the lab scale operations began the shotgun sequencing reads that were mapped to the kegg pathways database showed that the majority of reads are related to metabolism genetic and environmental information processing sf7 of these pathways enzyme families membrane transport amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and translation were among the most predominant functions observed in the biological processes inside the tanks the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in the reciprocation mbr system consists of an enzyme driven process and other cellular activities happening simultaneously in the mbr tank while the assimilated nitrogen is used for amino acid synthesis which will eventually be a part of cellular metabolism moreover the use of glucose as the main carbon source of the system has enabled different carbohydrate metabolic pathways e g glycolytic tca etc to be the among the most active components in the metabolism of the prokaryotes in the tank during the mbr operations after these kegg pathways were mapped the molecular functions were analysed through the kegg orthology ko database in this database ko is followed by a 5 digit number which represents different known pathways and further identifies the enzymes that participate in nitrogen and phosphorus removal fig 4 summarizes the top functional orthologs most abundant enzymes and the percentage of enzymes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal there were no significant changes in the amounts of the five most abundant functional orthologs namely the enzymes transporters purine metabolism dna repair and recombination proteins and oxidative phosphorylation during the study s start up day the third month and after one year of operations this shows that these pathways are the most essential for the organisms metabolism reproduction and survival at the conditions set in the system to check for the number of enzymes active in the nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes we processed the reads under the enzyme ortholog the most abundant enzymes are those belonging to membrane transport processes with total reads of about 0 3 0 6 of the total number of enzymes annotated these enzymes are important for the translocation of compounds and ions i e ammonia and polyphosphates across the cellular membranes of prokaryotes meanwhile enzymes involved in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus account for a total of 0 4 and 0 15 of the total number of enzymes annotated respectively despite the small percentages of these enzymes these results still support the data that states that the percentage of nitrogen removed is higher than that of phosphorus to better elucidate the nutrient removal process in the reciprocation mbr system further studies need to be conducted that would show the activity of these enzymes and relate this activity to an actual decrease in the concentrations of total nitrogen and phosphorus in a system s effluent some of the identified enzymes include polyphosphate kinase ec 2 7 4 1 nitrite reductase no forming hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 2 1 1 7 99 1 and methane ammonia monooxygenase subunit a ec 1 14 18 3 1 14 99 39 unfortunately the enzymes that participate in complete ammonia oxidation are still not differentiated in the database from the nitrifying genes of aobs and therefore cannot be presented as a separate group in this study furthermore around 13 of the total metagenomic reads remain unassigned and once identified may give us more comprehensive insights into the function of the no aeration reciprocation mbr during the treatment of domestic wastewater it is to be noted that while metagenomic reads tells us the abundance of different organisms and the prevalence of various enzymes it is the transcription of these genes and the eventual production of the enzymes of interest that are essential to nutrient removal in this regard coupling metagenomics with technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is suggested 3 6 spatial distribution of nutrient removing communities using fish a 3d confocal micrograph of an activated sludge floc from the reciprocation mbr can be seen in fig 5 ammonia oxidizing bacteria magenta are seen in bigger and more dispersed clusters scattered while nitrite oxidizing bacteria which are labelled using red fluorescent dye and appear orange when superimposed with green are present ubiquitously and have seemingly localized the floc under observation in terms of proximity clusters of aob are seen to have minimal or no interaction with those of nob this observation is contrary from previous studies showing syntrophic relationship between canonical aob and strict nob with the latter group needing nitrite from ammonia oxidation for its metabolism and in turn completing the nitrification process by its oxidation to nitrate yusof et al 2011 a quantitative analysis of the 117 μm 55 μm activated sludge floc showed a total of about 3000 bacteria of which 3 8 were aobs 115 counts 3 5 denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms 105 counts and 5 6 were from the nobs the aob representation used for this study was betaproteobacterial in origin e g nitrosomonas while probes for nitrospira species were chosen to represent nob accumulibacter spp and pseudomonas were selected for the denitrifying organisms these results agree with the microbial community data where the relative abundance of nitrospira is higher than that of nitrosomonadaceae the dominance of nitrospira over canonical ammonia oxidizing betaproteobacteria in the activated sludge of the reciprocation mbr in terms of abundance suggests that the major players in the oxidation of ammonia in the system could be nitrospira of comammox origin comammox nitrospira was observed to be the main ammonia oxidizers in a system with low dissolved oxygen concentration in a previous study roots et al 2019 the lack of a close localization between the aob and nob clusters in the floc means that the growth and metabolism of the nitrospira nob is not dependent on the aob strict nitrite oxidizing bacteria are known to depend solely on nitrite produced by ammonia oxidizers which requires a close proximity between these groups for optimum substrate exchange the close proximity of aob and nob has been reported in the studies of nitrifying bacteria in biofilm and activated sludge inwhich the close distance may enhance the diffusion of the intermediate and reflect the syntrophic association between aob and nob yao and peng 2017 however since these two groups do not seem to co depend on each other for substrates i e ammonia or nitrite the possibility of the presence of comammox nitrospira should be considered fish probes targeting the functional genes that encode ammonia monooxygenase which are believed to be different in the comammox and canonical aob groups must be used in future studies to confirm the contribution of each group to the utilization of ammonia in the case of comammox nitrospira and its strict nitrite oxidizing counterpart there are still no available target genes that can differentiate between these two species further function based microscopic studies are necessary to differentiate comammox nitrospira from the strict nob groups meanwhile using pseudomonas and accumulibacter as representatives for denitrification led to an underrepresentation of this diverse group of organisms that are responsible for the n2 gas release in wastewater treatment plants a more abundant species or target with a wider coverage must be used for better visualization of organisms performing nitrate reduction and their interaction with their nitrifying counterparts in the reciprocation mbr 4 conclusions we investigated the microbial community composition nutrient removal performance functional profile and the distribution of nutrient removing communities in an alternative nutrient removal configuration that utilizes membrane reciprocation for biofilm control and operates under a low dissolved oxygen concentration after a year of operations the following conclusions and implications were made the nutrient removal performance despite initial high removal efficiencies may still be improved by increasing the flowrate of internal recirculation and by adding an anaerobic chamber for better denitrification and phosphate accumulation the role of saccharibacteria and parcubacteria in biofilm formation on the membrane surfaces of the reciprocation mbr should be investigated as these phylaare both abundant and persistent from the collected biofilms nitrospira can be used as a potential indicator to evaluate ammonia and the tn removal performance of anoxic systems low dissolved oxygen in the reciprocation mbr allowed for enrichment of comammox nitrospira with a higher affinity to ammonia than canonical aobs due to high energy consumption of existing configurations for nutrient removal in wwtps technologies like the reciprocation mbr that have a low energy requirement excellent membrane performance and a variety of efficient nutrient removing microcosms should be explored spatial distribution using fluorescent labelled primers targeting nutrient removing groups allowed us to have a better understanding of the interaction of the organisms responsible for the nutrient removal of the reciprocation mbr and revealed the importance of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation declaration of

17797,a critical challenge in the application of membrane bioreactors mbr for domestic wastewater treatment is its high energy consumption caused by continuous aeration for biofouling control to reduce energy consumption and mitigate fouling in membranes alternative configurations using dynamic shear enhanced filtration by membrane reciprocation rotation and vibration to mechanically impose shear on membrane surfaces have been recently introduced however although these methods are effective at lowering energy usage the nutrient removal efficiencies and microbial community compositions of these systems have not been well studied in this study a lab scale no aeration reciprocation membrane bioreactor was used to characterize the microbial composition functional profile and nutrient removal of the reciprocation mbr system operated under hypoxic conditions microbial community analysis showed proteobacteria 35 and saccharibacteria 27 to be the most abundant phyla in the sludge and the biofilm samples respectively nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were observed at 70 and 50 while the chemical oxygen demand concentration had about a 99 decrease in the effluent quantitative pcr of nutrient removing genes revealed the presence of complete ammonia oxidizing organisms comammox with a mean abundance of 1 88 104 gene copies g sludge which explains the high ammonia removal despite a low abundance of canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a prevalence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with clusters that are distant from other nutrient removing communities suggesting that their metabolism is not dependent on ammonia oxidizers the reciprocation mbr configuration may be a suitable more energy efficient alternative to conventional air scouring systems because of its biofouling mitigation and promising nutrient removal performed by the diverse microbial communities in its system graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor comammox nutrient removal reciprocation 1 introduction in recent years membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been increasingly used in combination with the activated sludge process asp in municipal wastewater treatment since being incorporated into the conventional asp mbrs have provided better effluent quality in wastewater treatment plants with a smaller environmental footprint as compared to settling tanks kraume and drews 2010 sadr and saroj 2015 tewari et al 2010 however one of the main challenges in mbr use is the inevitable membrane fouling which reduces permeate quality and increases energy consumption brepols et al 2010 gil et al 2010 membrane fouling during wastewater treatment is unavoidable due to solutes colloids and bacterial flocs accumulating on the surface of the membrane guo et al 2012 physical chemical mechanical and biological techniques have been applied to mitigate membrane fouling and of these the most widely used method in full scale treatment plants is the air scouring system where the membranes are continuously bombarded with coarse bubbles that scour the surfaces liang et al 2014 despite the excellent performance and success of the air scouring mbr system in the prevention of biofouling its high energy demand accounts for about 50 of the operational cost of the treatment the high energy usage in air scouring systems has promoted the development of more cost efficient and sustainable alternative mbr configurations that would match the effectivity of this anti fouling technology bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 judd 2016 krzeminski et al 2017 lee et al 2016 recently the reciprocation mbr rmbr a configuration that uses inertial forces generated from mechanically moving the hollow fiber membrane modules has shown promising results for controlling biofouling while using 20 or less of the total energy used in air scouring systems de sotto et al 2018 ho et al 2015 the reciprocation mbr system uses much less energy to maintain stable transmembrane pressure tmp while satisfactorily controlling biofouling by using a mechanically imposed shear on the membrane surface through reciprocation of the membrane module the shaking off of the wastewater components e g bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances that start membrane fouling is achieved by hanging the membrane loosely in a cassette that is attached to a motor powered moving case ho et al 2014 2015 in its pilot scale testing the reciprocation mbr system was successful in decreasing the system s total energy consumption and in improving the nutrient removal from the residual nutrients coming from the aeration basin however the microbial community composition of the sludge and how it affects nutrient removal was not studied furthermore previous pilot scale studies of the reciprocation mbr did not focus on the biological attributes e g microbial community functional genes of the system which is the most valuable information to consider in biological nutrient removal in this study a lab scale reciprocation mbr was built to investigate the microbial composition and functional profile of this energy efficient system the mbr system was operated under hypoxic conditions and its microbiome was investigated through various molecular techniques and the results were correlated with the overall nutrient removal performance of the system the microbial composition of both the activated sludge and biofilms on the membrane surface were also studied to survey the types of organisms that are enriched in a low do environment meanwhile functional genes involved in nutrient removal and the enzyme profile of the system were quantified and identified through qpcr and metagenomics analyses respectively to understand the spatial distribution of the microorganisms the distribution of nutrient removing microorganism groups in a sludge floc was visualized using fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy to the authors knowledge this is the first study on the microbial community composition function distribution and their overall effect on nutrient removal in a reciprocation mbr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 mle mbr operations and membrane performance a modified ludzack ettinger membrane bioreactor was fabricated and operated in this laboratory scale experiment supplementary fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the flow of wastewater treatment anoxic and aerobic tanks details of the lab scale reciprocation mbr including flowrates working volumes of the tanks and membrane specifications are found in supplementary tables 1 and 2 for the startup of the experiment seed sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant was inoculated in the tanks and mixed with synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater made with a composition from the recipe of villain et al 2014 that had been slightly modified to account for the typical influent characteristics of the local municipal wastewater was pumped to the anoxic tank and mixed with glucose at a flowrate of 0 6 l h q villain et al 2014 the composition of the synthetic wastewater was as follows c6h12o6 nh4 2so4 kh2po4 na2co3 nahco3 mgso4 and cacl2 the anoxic tank flowed to the aerobic tank by gravity with a flowrate equal to the sludge drawn from the aerobic tank to the mbr 3q and internal recirculation 1q both the anoxic and aerobic tanks had mechanical mixers to facilitate uniform mixing and an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the aerobic tank the 3q was pumped to the reciprocation mbr tank while 1q of the nitrate rich sludge was internally recirculated back to the anoxic tank the sludge was returned to the anoxic tank with a flowrate of 2q to maintain mlss concentration no sludge was wasted until the concentrations of mlss in the anoxic and mbr tanks reached 3 g l and 5 g l respectively and were maintained at these concentrations thereafter biofouling was monitored through the increase in transmembrane pressure tmp which was measured using a pressure gauge installed between the suction outlet and the effluent tubing tmp was maintained below 25 cmhg 0 03 bar and membrane operations was maintained at a flux of 20 lmh following a local full scale wastewater treatment facility for comparison purposes when tmp reaches above 25 cmhg the membrane modules were mildly washed with water to eliminate the cake layer and the biofilm samples were manually collected before thoroughly cleaning the membrane with a high pressure hose

quantitative insights into microbial ecology v1 9 qiime caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2010 quast et al 2012 to extract dna for metagenomic analyses sludge samples were collected from the beginning of the study period after three months and at the end of study period the samples were sent for shotgun sequencing in the miseq 300 300 bp illumina platform in scelse a metagenomics pipeline used by previous studies was employed to identify key pathways and enzymes in the mbr system ng et al 2019 these key pathways and enzymes were used to evaluate the changes in the functional profiles of the microbial communities in the reciprocation mbr 2 4 fluorescence in situ hybridization sludge samples from each of the tanks collected after a year of operations were fixed using 8 paraformaldehyde for 2 h and then washed with a 1 1 ratio of 1x pbs and 96 ethanol before being stored at 20 following the standards for visualizing activated sludge in wastewater treatment a fish experiment was done on fixed samples nielsen et al 2009 briefly 15μl of fixed cells were placed on teflon coated slides soaked in 1m hcl at 60 c overnight and air dried for 5 min probes were combined with the hybridization buffer

contents and concentrations of hybridization and wash buffers are listed in the supplementary information st3 slides were washed with cold deionized water air dried and then 2 3 μl of mounting solution were added to each well to prevent the samples from being bleached images were visualized under a zeiss lsm710 confocal microscope zeiss germany and 3d micrographs were processed and quantified using imaris image analysis software oxford instruments switzerland 2 5 statistical and correlation analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to differentiate the gene copies of the functional genes in each of the tanks of the reciprocation mbr system in ms excel correlation tests between abundant genera and the most common nutrient removing microorganism and water quality measurements were performed in r using a corrplot package this was done to examine the potential contribution of these organisms to the nutrient removal performance of the reciprocation mle mbr system wei et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance of the reciprocation mbr the average concentrations of cod ammonia tn and tp in the influent tanks and effluent and their percentage removal efficiencies after the acclimation period of five weeks are tabulated in table 1 a decrease of about 99 in the cod concentration was observed in the effluent since glucose a readily utilizable carbon source was used as the main organic c source in the synthetic wastewater the system achieved a total nitrogen removal of 70 with a tn of 8 mg l in the effluent the unoxidized ammonia with a mean value of about 7 mg l nh3 contributed to the high tn values in the effluent the tn values could be decreased further by increasing the do concentration in the aerobic tank to a higher level than the maximum do used in this study 2 mg l which could promote better ammonia oxidation a recent study of an intermittently aerated membrane bioreactor with a high do concentration 3 5 showed a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 80 when a cod n ratio of 10 was used wang 2020 despite the c n ratio being maintained at slightly above 10 in the lab scale mbr operations the performance of the reciprocation mbr for tn removal could be enhanced with other operational conditions such as increased srt in the anoxic tank or an increased internal recirculation flowrate for high denitrification rates in the anoxic tank chen et al 2010 lee et al 2012 meanwhile about 50 of the initial p loading 22 mg l was measured in the effluent of the reciprocation mbr after treatment this is relatively lower than the p levels of other mbr systems which were designed for optimum p uptake monclús et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the low p removal of the reciprocation mbr could be due to the lack of an anaerobic tank that allows for better p uptake of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos bi et al 2013 ultimately despite these additional improvements the reciprocation mbr showed excellent removal of nutrients which is at par to conventional bnr systems while maintaining good anti fouling perfromance sf2 moreover its potential contribution to significantly decrease energy consumption through its energy efficient anti fouling mechanism addresses one of the major issues in wastewater treatment high cost due to continuous aeration of membranes with these insights the reciprocation mbr system is therefore recommended to be tested in an industrial scale where it can be operated with real wastewater at a lower cost as compared to treatment plants employing air scouring systems 3 2 activated sludge and biofilm microbial communities in a hypoxic system fig 1 presents the alpha diversity indices most abundant phyla and the top genera from the sludge n 36 and biofilm samples n 11 the alpha diversity indices for sludge samples are observed at mean values of 8 7 0 7 shannon 12297 1978 chao1 5485 623 observed otus and 203 27 faith s pd while biofilm samples have mean values of 8 41 0 5 shannon 10650 2437 chao1 5590 822 observed otus and 160 16 faith s pd these indices tell us that the species richness evenness abundance the number of different taxa and phylogenetic distances of the two groups in the reciprocation mbr system are relatively similar to discriminate the two groups further the unique and shared otus are presented in fig 1a wherein only 21 taxa are unique in the biofilm samples while 276 otus were found solely in the activated sludge samples out of the 413 otus shared by the two growth types these unique taxa from the two groups are found in sf4 to better understand the diversity of the microbial communities in the sludge and biofilm samples fig 1b shows a closer examination of the different phyla found in the two groups of the 54 phyla from the sludge samples 81 were represented by 5 groups from proteobacteria 35 saccharibacteria 16 bacteroidetes 12 chloroflexi 12 and verrucomicrobia 6 while 70 of the 43 phyla from the biofilm samples were saccharibacteria 27 proteobacteria 19 bacteroidetes 9 parcubacteria 7 and chloroflexi 6 the dominant phyla in the sludge samples from the reciprocation mbr were consistent with the ones found in wastewater treatment processes that have anoxic and aerobic stages for the treatment of livestock and poultry gu et al 2019 pharmaceutical ouyang et al 2019 and domestic wang et al 2012 wastewaters in the biofilm samples the candidate phyla od1 parcubacteria and tm7 saccharibacteria from the membrane surface of the reciprocation mbr were the next dominant phyla that had not been reported in previous studies choi et al 2017 huang et al 2008 jo et al 2016 even though the phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes still comprised most of the total taxa saccharibacteria has been reported to be the most abundant phyla comprising 50 of the total phyla in a membrane bioreactor treating landfill leachate and in activated sludge samples from wastewater treatment plants kindaichi et al 2016 remmas et al 2017 despite the prevalence of saccharibacteria its physiology and ecological role in biofouling and nutrient removal have not yet been investigated parcubacteria on the other hand have been seen in sludge samples taken from nitrogen phosphorus and micropollutant removal systems cheng et al 2018 he et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 parcubacteria have been identified in a broad range of anoxic environments and have been characterized as forming biofilm with attachment and adhesion proteins and a diverse group of genes that are associated with mediating cell cell contact nelson and stegen 2015 their presence and abundance suggest that they may have an important role in membrane biofouling of the reciprocation mbr under anoxic conditions at the genus level the most abundant genera in the sludge and biofilm samples are shown in fig 1c uncultured saccharibacteria is still the predominant genera in both growth types with about 7 and 13 relative abundance in sludge and biofilm samples respectively heterotrophic organisms involved in nutrient removal such as dechloromonas 1 1 caldilinea 2 4 and kouleothrix 5 2 dominated the suspended communities while uncultured bacterium gn04 3 4 and the family c hitinophagaceae 4 5 are the main species thriving in the biofilm communities 3 3 quantification of functional genes associated with removal of nutrients data from microbial community analysis may not clearly delineate the roles of the nutrient removing communities in removing n and p in each of the tanks of the reciprocation mbr to investigate further the absolute quantification of nutrient removing genes associated with complete ammonia oxidation amoa nitrospira denitrification nirs and phosphate accumulating organisms 16s accumulibacter was conducted the functional gene coding for ammonia monooxygenase in nitrospira comammox was used for comammox quantification since the relative abundance of the canonical betaproteobacterial aob was significantly lower the gene copies of amoa from the canonical aobs however when plotted against amoa nitrospira showed that the abundance of amoa aob was significantly higher p 0 05 by two logs with a mean abundance of 6 3 106 gene copies per gram of sludge data not shown as compared to 3 7 104 per gram of sludge for amoa nitrospira the disparity between the results from the microbial community analysis and the quantitative pcr might have been caused by the primers used to quantify the comammox present in the wastewater samples the total abundance of this comammox functional gene might be underestimated in this study because the existing primers may not fully detect all species of comammox a primer designed to detect all forms of comammox in environmental samples including the currentt isolates of the novel comammox nitrospira species is necessary to better understand the ecological importance of this group of organisms especially in anoxic systems meanwhile nitrate reductase coded by the nirs gene and one of the key enzymes in denitrification was used as a functional marker in previous studies for measuring the abundance of denitrifying bacteria chen et al 2014 wang et al 2014 phosphate accumulation was quantified using the 16s gene of accumulibacter pao because this process is linked to the accumulibacter species in wastewater treatment systems the qpcr s results showed mean values of 1 107 and 3 4 1010 gene copies gram of sludge for 16s accumulibacter and the nirs gene in the mle mbr system respectively the boxplots of the functional genes in the individual tanks fig 2 show that all three genes had similar log values of around 4 amoa ntsp 7 pao and 10 nirs for the duration of the study single factor analysis of variance anova for all three genes showed no significant difference p values 0 05 in the gene copies per gram of sludge between the anoxic aerobic and mbr tanks since the sludge is recirculated back to the anoxic tank where it originally flowed through the rest of the tanks supplementary fig 1 it is expected that all the tanks would have fairly similar gene copy numbers gene expression using rna from activated sludge samples to quantify the expression of each gene was not performed in this study in the future it may be necessary to conduct gene expression experiments to have a better understanding of the nutrient removing activity of the genes in the reciprocation mbr system the presence of comammox nitrospira in the reciprocation mbr system is linked to this organism s affinity with low dissolved oxygen and its preference to grow under anoxic conditions at present there is still no consensus as to whether the organism s ability to perform complete ammonia oxidation varies at different dissolved oxygen concentrations palomo et al 2018 the nitrite reductase gene meanwhile is expected to be expressed higher in both anoxic and mbr tanks where the dissolved oxygen concentration falls below 1 0 mg l dalsgaard et al 2014 in anoxic conditions the dominant electron acceptors are nitrate and nitrite which are reduced by denitrifying organisms to nitrogen gas hence in theory the highest expression of nitrite reductase should be achieved in both anoxic and reciprocation mbr tanks while its expression would be at its lowest in the aerobic tank do 1 0 mg l in previous studies the polyphosphate accumulating ability of paos were exhibited during the aerobic phase hence an increase in the expression of gene coding for phosphate accumulation is expected to increase in aerobic tanks he and mcmahon 2011 this however is not the case with denitrifying paos which were found to have an strong ability to accumulate polyphosphates while performing denitrification in an oxygen depleted environment zafiriadis et al 2011 3 4 relationship between the relative abundance of microorganisms and nutrient removal the pearson correlation coefficients of the relative abundance of the organisms and the nutrient removal efficiencies and effluent concentrations of ammonia tn and tp are tabulated in supplementary information table 4 the decrease in the ammonia concentration negative pearson coefficient r and the high percentage removal of ammonia positive r in the reciprocation mbr were highly correlated to the relative abundance of predominant otus such as uncultured actinomycetales caldilinea kouleothrix uncultured betaproteobacteria uncultured anaerolineae and pseudomonas these microorganisms are mostly heterotrophic in nature and their high correlation to the decrease in ammonia concentration may be due to assimilating ammonia for cellular growth and metabolism while ammonia is usually assimilated for biosynthesis but not for ammonia oxidation i e nitrification organisms like caldilinea and pseudomonas are known to play a part in nitrogen removal in wwtps during denitrification where nitrogen gas n2 is produced from the reduction of nitrate no3 kragelund et al 2011 lu et al 2014 aside from these abundant organisms common nutrient removing genera such as nitrospira nitrosomonadaceae dechloromonas acinetobacter and candidatus accumulibacter sf5 were also assessed of these only the nitrifying genus nitrospira showed a high negative correlation with effluent ammonia 0 78 and tn 0 71 concentrations implying that a higher abundance of this organism could lower the concentrations of ammonia and tn in the effluent strict nitrite oxidizing nitrospira however has not been shown to have the innate ability to oxidize ammonia and are mainly dependent on nitrite from ammonia oxidizing organisms meanwhile the amount of the ammonia oxidizing genus nitrosomonas was observed to have low correlation values with ammonia 0 09 and tn 0 11 concentrations in the effluent this could be because the removal of ammonia in the system was not mainly influenced by this betaproteobacterial group also the relative abundance of nitrosomonas in the sludge was seen at 0 04 which is significantly lower than nitrospira 0 28 keeping this in mind it was hypothesized that the presence of organisms that are able to completely oxidize ammonia were present in the reciprocation mbr complete ammonia oxidizing commamox organisms have been shown to oxidize ammonia to nitrate which was initially thought of as a two step process daims et al 2015 interestingly the only currently available isolates of comammox are all from the genus nitrospira which have been reported to have a higher affinity to ammonia than aobs and require low dissolved oxygen concentrations roots et al 2019 van kessel et al 2015 to support this hypothesis a graph of ammonia and tn removal efficiencies and the relative and absolute abundance of nitrospira is shown in fig 3 and sf6 as shown there is a strong relationship between the abundance of nitrospira and the ammonia and tn removal efficiencies during mbr operations which may support the presence of comammox nitrospira in the reciprocation mbr see fig 3 meanwhile of the denitrifying communities sf5 only pseudomonas had a high correlation with tn removal 0 77 despite its low relative abundance of 0 02 in comparison the denitrifying bacteria dechloromonas had a high relative abundance of 1 1 but a very low correlation coefficient acinetobacter thiobacillus and zooglea the other nitrate reducing organisms that were present in the lab scale mbr were found to perform denitrification in full scale wwtps huang et al 2015 candidatus accumulibacter known as p accumulators in nutrient removal systems had low relative abundance 0 06 and their correlation with tp concentration and removal did not correspond in this study phosphate removal in this case might result from the p accumulation of other heterotrophic bacteria that have been shown to accumulate polyphosphates under anoxic conditions in some denitrifying organisms jin et al 2014 oehmen et al 2010 the presence of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms in the system has yet to be investigated despite high correlation coefficient values supported by previous studies it is still important to note that a correlation analysis of the relative abundances of nutrient removal organisms and water quality analyses alone is not a guaranteed prediction of a system s performance as performance may also be affected by other extrinsic and intrinsic factors other molecular assays such as quantification of expression and absolute abundance can be used to confirm the results of the correlation analysis based on the current operational conditions and the microbial community composition of the reciprocation mbr the system s nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies may be further improved by some operational adjustments nitrogen removal will be improved by increasing internal recirculation rate and hrt srt in the anoxic tank which will help the denitrifying communities i e dechloromonas pseudomonas that are already abundant in the system to perform their jobs in reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas meanwhile the low abundance of organisms that are responsible for phosphate accumulation i e candidatus accumulibacter may be enriched with the addition of an anaerobic compartment in the current treatment train however since the initial seed sludge came from a system that does not enrich these organisms an addition of an inoculum coming from ebpr systems with high relative abundance of paos would be another alternative the high relative abundance of nitrospira believed to be of comammox origin should be maintained by allowing anoxic conditions that are favourable to their growth to be consistent during the mle mbr operations 3 5 functional profile analysis in the reciprocation mbr system annotated reads from the shotgun sequencing of genomic dna samples taken from the reciprocation mbr tank were analysed for the first day of operations day 0 third month day 79 and a year after the lab scale operations began the shotgun sequencing reads that were mapped to the kegg pathways database showed that the majority of reads are related to metabolism genetic and environmental information processing sf7 of these pathways enzyme families membrane transport amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and translation were among the most predominant functions observed in the biological processes inside the tanks the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in the reciprocation mbr system consists of an enzyme driven process and other cellular activities happening simultaneously in the mbr tank while the assimilated nitrogen is used for amino acid synthesis which will eventually be a part of cellular metabolism moreover the use of glucose as the main carbon source of the system has enabled different carbohydrate metabolic pathways e g glycolytic tca etc to be the among the most active components in the metabolism of the prokaryotes in the tank during the mbr operations after these kegg pathways were mapped the molecular functions were analysed through the kegg orthology ko database in this database ko is followed by a 5 digit number which represents different known pathways and further identifies the enzymes that participate in nitrogen and phosphorus removal fig 4 summarizes the top functional orthologs most abundant enzymes and the percentage of enzymes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal there were no significant changes in the amounts of the five most abundant functional orthologs namely the enzymes transporters purine metabolism dna repair and recombination proteins and oxidative phosphorylation during the study s start up day the third month and after one year of operations this shows that these pathways are the most essential for the organisms metabolism reproduction and survival at the conditions set in the system to check for the number of enzymes active in the nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes we processed the reads under the enzyme ortholog the most abundant enzymes are those belonging to membrane transport processes with total reads of about 0 3 0 6 of the total number of enzymes annotated these enzymes are important for the translocation of compounds and ions i e ammonia and polyphosphates across the cellular membranes of prokaryotes meanwhile enzymes involved in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus account for a total of 0 4 and 0 15 of the total number of enzymes annotated respectively despite the small percentages of these enzymes these results still support the data that states that the percentage of nitrogen removed is higher than that of phosphorus to better elucidate the nutrient removal process in the reciprocation mbr system further studies need to be conducted that would show the activity of these enzymes and relate this activity to an actual decrease in the concentrations of total nitrogen and phosphorus in a system s effluent some of the identified enzymes include polyphosphate kinase ec 2 7 4 1 nitrite reductase no forming hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 2 1 1 7 99 1 and methane ammonia monooxygenase subunit a ec 1 14 18 3 1 14 99 39 unfortunately the enzymes that participate in complete ammonia oxidation are still not differentiated in the database from the nitrifying genes of aobs and therefore cannot be presented as a separate group in this study furthermore around 13 of the total metagenomic reads remain unassigned and once identified may give us more comprehensive insights into the function of the no aeration reciprocation mbr during the treatment of domestic wastewater it is to be noted that while metagenomic reads tells us the abundance of different organisms and the prevalence of various enzymes it is the transcription of these genes and the eventual production of the enzymes of interest that are essential to nutrient removal in this regard coupling metagenomics with technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is suggested 3 6 spatial distribution of nutrient removing communities using fish a 3d confocal micrograph of an activated sludge floc from the reciprocation mbr can be seen in fig 5 ammonia oxidizing bacteria magenta are seen in bigger and more dispersed clusters scattered while nitrite oxidizing bacteria which are labelled using red fluorescent dye and appear orange when superimposed with green are present ubiquitously and have seemingly localized the floc under observation in terms of proximity clusters of aob are seen to have minimal or no interaction with those of nob this observation is contrary from previous studies showing syntrophic relationship between canonical aob and strict nob with the latter group needing nitrite from ammonia oxidation for its metabolism and in turn completing the nitrification process by its oxidation to nitrate yusof et al 2011 a quantitative analysis of the 117 μm 55 μm activated sludge floc showed a total of about 3000 bacteria of which 3 8 were aobs 115 counts 3 5 denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms 105 counts and 5 6 were from the nobs the aob representation used for this study was betaproteobacterial in origin e g nitrosomonas while probes for nitrospira species were chosen to represent nob accumulibacter spp and pseudomonas were selected for the denitrifying organisms these results agree with the microbial community data where the relative abundance of nitrospira is higher than that of nitrosomonadaceae the dominance of nitrospira over canonical ammonia oxidizing betaproteobacteria in the activated sludge of the reciprocation mbr in terms of abundance suggests that the major players in the oxidation of ammonia in the system could be nitrospira of comammox origin comammox nitrospira was observed to be the main ammonia oxidizers in a system with low dissolved oxygen concentration in a previous study roots et al 2019 the lack of a close localization between the aob and nob clusters in the floc means that the growth and metabolism of the nitrospira nob is not dependent on the aob strict nitrite oxidizing bacteria are known to depend solely on nitrite produced by ammonia oxidizers which requires a close proximity between these groups for optimum substrate exchange the close proximity of aob and nob has been reported in the studies of nitrifying bacteria in biofilm and activated sludge inwhich the close distance may enhance the diffusion of the intermediate and reflect the syntrophic association between aob and nob yao and peng 2017 however since these two groups do not seem to co depend on each other for substrates i e ammonia or nitrite the possibility of the presence of comammox nitrospira should be considered fish probes targeting the functional genes that encode ammonia monooxygenase which are believed to be different in the comammox and canonical aob groups must be used in future studies to confirm the contribution of each group to the utilization of ammonia in the case of comammox nitrospira and its strict nitrite oxidizing counterpart there are still no available target genes that can differentiate between these two species further function based microscopic studies are necessary to differentiate comammox nitrospira from the strict nob groups meanwhile using pseudomonas and accumulibacter as representatives for denitrification led to an underrepresentation of this diverse group of organisms that are responsible for the n2 gas release in wastewater treatment plants a more abundant species or target with a wider coverage must be used for better visualization of organisms performing nitrate reduction and their interaction with their nitrifying counterparts in the reciprocation mbr 4 conclusions we investigated the microbial community composition nutrient removal performance functional profile and the distribution of nutrient removing communities in an alternative nutrient removal configuration that utilizes membrane reciprocation for biofilm control and operates under a low dissolved oxygen concentration after a year of operations the following conclusions and implications were made the nutrient removal performance despite initial high removal efficiencies may still be improved by increasing the flowrate of internal recirculation and by adding an anaerobic chamber for better denitrification and phosphate accumulation the role of saccharibacteria and parcubacteria in biofilm formation on the membrane surfaces of the reciprocation mbr should be investigated as these phylaare both abundant and persistent from the collected biofilms nitrospira can be used as a potential indicator to evaluate ammonia and the tn removal performance of anoxic systems low dissolved oxygen in the reciprocation mbr allowed for enrichment of comammox nitrospira with a higher affinity to ammonia than canonical aobs due to high energy consumption of existing configurations for nutrient removal in wwtps technologies like the reciprocation mbr that have a low energy requirement excellent membrane performance and a variety of efficient nutrient removing microcosms should be explored spatial distribution using fluorescent labelled primers targeting nutrient removing groups allowed us to have a better understanding of the interaction of the organisms responsible for the nutrient removal of the reciprocation mbr and revealed the importance of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation declaration of

water systems borella et al 2005 dennis et al 1984 groothuis et al 1985 kyritsi et al 2018 mouchtouri et al 2007b and the temperature was identified as a major factor for legionella contamination in hotel hot water systems barna et al 2016 dennis et al 1984 groothuis et al 1985 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 legionella spp grows best in warm water and many ld outbreaks are associated with hot water systems barna et al 2016 serrano suárez et al 2013 previous studies also found that many legionella spp including l pneumophila can even multiply at temperatures below 20 c bartram et al 2007 söderberg et al 2004 legionella in particular legionella pneumophila proliferates at water temperatures ranging between 20 and 45 c with some studies reporting an optimum growth temperature of 35 c alary and joly 1992 bartram et al 2007 katz and hammel 1987 and other studies reporting an optimum growth temperature 37 c van der kooij et al 2016 yee and wadowsky 1982 previous studies have also found that they can survive for several hours at 50 c bartram et al 2007 dennis et al 1984 schulze röbbecke et al 1987 can remain viable at 60 c for several minutes leoni et al 2005 and can even survive a heat shock treatment of 70 c for 30 min allegra et al 2011 hot water temperature in the plumbing system has been identified as an important factor to control legionella growth in both published literature and guidance documents dennis et al 1984 1982 ecdc 2017b groothuis et al 1985 montagna et al 2018 singh et al 2020 see rakic et al 2013 for the contamination of legionella pneumophila in water distribution systems and their associated factors while temperature influences the growth of legionella most other factors such as disinfection efficiency rate of corrosion and the hydraulics of the plumbing systems also influence the survival and proliferation of legionella spp in premise plumbing systems lin et al 1998 shands et al 1985 stout et al 1985 singh et al 2020 the temperature in hotel hot water systems has an inverse association with legionella colonization and can be used to control the system contamination dennis et al 1984 groothuis et al 1985 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 yee and wadowsky 1982 the published literature has been inconsistent with some studies suggesting maintaining hot water temperature 55 c in hot water systems to control legionella was required bargellini et al 2011 barna et al 2016 borella et al 2005 dennis et al 1984 mavridou et al 1994 toyosada et al 2017 van der lugt et al 2019 while others suggesting 50 c was enough kyritsi et al 2018 tobin 1986 concerns over energy use and scalding risk both favor the use of lower temperatures if possible therefore there is a need to evaluate and if possible reconcile these studies in order to identify the lowest hot water temperature in plumbing systems that can control the growth of legionella in this study our aim is to systematically review the evidence available on the association between hot water temperature and legionella colonization and to conduct qualitative synthesis and meta analysis to identify the required water temperature for controlling the risk of legionella colonization 2 methods we performed a systematic literature review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma framework shamseer et al 2015 this included a literature search on the web of science core collection pubmed and engineering village to identify relevant reports which were published as of august 7th 2019 for legionella colonization in hot water systems of hotels including peer reviewed research articles reviews case reports government documents and other short reports by using the following combination of three sets of keywords for legionella legionella or legionella pneumophila or legionella spp or legionnaires or pneumonia or legionellosis or legion fever for hotel setting hotel or apartment hotel or apartment hotel or motel or hostelry or accommodation site or guest house or guesthouse or hotel apartment or lodge for temperature temperature or hot water or water heater or hot water systems the above keywords for legionella hotel setting and temperature were combined with the boolean operator and for the search there was no restriction on publication year in our search we then performed a manual review of the reference lists of the identified articles and reports to find any additional articles that might not be found through our keyword search all these identified articles were uploaded into the reference management software zotero 5 0 71 https www zotero org and duplicates were identified by matching the title first author name and publication year and were removed after the removal of the duplicate items we screened the remaining titles and abstracts for relevance the relevance criterion was peer reviewed articles that studied the relationship between legionella spp colonization and hot water temperature in hotel water systems after the relevance screening all the potentially eligible studies were then retrieved as full texts to review in detail for eligibility based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria of this research 2 1 inclusion criteria the inclusion criteria for this research were studies that were not conducted only based on legionella outbreaks studies that identified the exposure to legionella using standard detection methods i e pcr culture qpcr ica test and reported the results with sampling details studies that collected hot water samples at showerheads and or taps articles in english articles that presented primary data review papers and guidance documents were not included full text of the article was available not just abstract or summary 2 2 data extraction relevant data were extracted from the eligible studies using an excel version 16 spreadsheet microsoft corporation redmond usa and digitizeit 2 3 https www digitizeit de the extracted information included the location of the study sampling location i e showerheads taps or water heater detection methods detection limits temperature legionella colonization information and temperature range to control legionella hot water sample data points for hotel settings were extracted as much as possible from the included studies where data from other settings were also reported if the studies calculated odds ratios ors or reported legionella colonization data for a certain range of temperatures these were extracted and pooled 2 3 qualitative synthesis meta analysis and statistical analysis the findings of the eligible studies were summarized in numerical and narrative tables a qualitative synthesis was performed to identify the required temperature for hotel hot water systems by categorizing the studies that found legionella colonization at different temperatures some studies provided evidence for two different temperatures to control legionella colonization where a higher temperature was found to control the legionella colonization to a greater extent and the lower hot water temperature was found to control the colonization to a lesser extent in this study the higher temperature was considered as the control temperature for the contamination and was counted towards the evidence based temperature a statistical cut off point of temperature for legionella colonization was identified using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve hanley and mcneil 1982 specifically the youden index was used to identify the cutoff point from the roc curve ruopp et al 2008 where the youden index determines the point of the roc curve for which the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximal a random effect model was considered for the binary logistic regression model to identify the effect of temperature on legionella colonization in hot water systems a random effect model was considered based on the potential heterogeneity between different studies on account of methods used location of the study the difference in statistical analyses lau et al 1997 subsequently the probability of legionella positive events at different temperatures for the hotel hot water system was calculated using the results of the logistic regression analysis all the studies were considered for the qualitative synthesis but not all the studies were included in the quantitative meta analysis if paired observations for temperature and legionella from some of the studies were not extractable those studies were not included in the meta analyses such as roc curve or meta regression furthermore forest plots considering random effects across different studies using the pooled or data were used to show the effects of temperature on legionella colonization with 95 confidence intervals cis the heterogeneity across different studies was determined using the higgins i2 statistic huedo medina et al 2006 an i2 value of 0 25 was considered as low heterogeneity and 50 75 was considered as moderate heterogeneity mustafić et al 2012 a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant for the calculated results in this study all the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 software spss inc chicago il usa and review manager 5 3 cochrane london uk 3 results 3 1 literature review findings the literature review findings in this study are summarized in the prisma framework diagram in fig 2 our electronic search identified a total of 86 records from all the databases and an additional 5 records from other sources were identified by performing a forward and backward reference search after the removal of 29 duplicate records we screened titles and abstracts of 62 records and identified 30 relevant full text articles of these extracted 30 full text articles 17 articles were excluded from the qualitative synthesis and meta analysis based on our different inclusion criteria fig 2 we considered the remaining 13 articles in our qualitative synthesis and meta analysis for this study 3 2 summary of the included studies selected studies for this research were from various geographical regions of the world table 1 summarizes the locations of these study areas sampling points in the hotel plumbing methods used to detect legionella colonization the total number of hotel hot water samples and major findings only culture method was used in 8 studies and mixed i e both culture and pcr methods were used in 4 studies the remaining one study used the immunochromatography assay ica test mentioned as the legio search technology as a detection method the detection limit was not reported in 4 studies but when mentioned it ranged between 10 and 500 cfu l for the culture method and 480 680 gc l for the pcr method most of the hot water samples were collected from sink hot water taps and showerheads in the hotel water systems a total of eight studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 collected samples after flushing for a certain time ranging between 1 and 5 min while other five studies alexiou et al 1989 erdogan and arslan 2015 fragou et al 2012 kyritsi et al 2018 toyosada et al 2017 did not report the detailed sampling plan the largest hotel hot water sample size of 962 was collected by mouchtouri et al 2007 findings from these studies indicate that the prevalence of legionella spp in hotel hot water samples was common at temperatures ranging between 40 c and 54 c a higher percentage of positive samples was found when the samples were tested using both culture and pcr methods rather than only the standard culture method information on disinfectant residual was not reported systematically enough to be used in this study a total of 9 studies mentioned free chlorine residual measurement in their sampling plan bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 fragou et al 2012 kyritsi et al 2018 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 however chlorine decays rapidly at elevated temperatures serrano suárez et al 2013 and may not persist in the hot water system for example fragou et al 2012 reported that collected hotel water samples were free of chlorine and serrano suárez et al 2013 also did not find any free residual chlorine concentration in the distal samples 3 3 required temperature based on the qualitative synthesis a qualitative synthesis of the included studies was performed to identify the required temperature for hotel hot water systems table 2 only 10 studies provided enough discrete temperature information to categorize in different groups high hot water temperature at taps of 60 c was found by 5 different studies to protect from legionella barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 another four studies also provided evidence that maintaining hot water temperature throughout the whole system at 55 c was protective against legionella contamination borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 toyosada et al 2017 only one study found that maintaining the temperature at 50 c at hot water taps showerheads protected the water distribution systems from legionella colonization kyritsi et al 2018 their differing conclusions do not correspond clearly to differences in analytical methods used for legionella detection two of the five studies in the 60 c category relied on culture alone barna et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2007b while three used culture and pcr methods bonetta et al 2010 serrano suárez et al 2013 fragou et al 2012 three of the four studies in the 55 c category also relied on culture alone borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 and one used an immunochromatography assay method toyosada et al 2017 3 4 receiver operating characteristic roc curve a roc curve was derived from the association between hotel hot water temperature data and legionella test results from 9 different studies where paired observations data were available alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 a roc curve is a probability curve where the true positive rate is plotted against the false positive rate fig 3 represents the roc curve where the true positive rate i e sensitivity defined here as the ability to correctly identify a system as legionella free is plotted against the false positive rate i e 1 specificity defined here as the probability of incorrectly identifying a legionella free system as legionella colonized for different cutoff points the 45 red diagonal line divides the whole roc space and a perfect test curve would pass through the upper left corner of the roc space representing 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity the area under the curve auc for the roc curve was estimated to be 0 914 with a 95 confidence interval of 0 851 0 977 which was statistically significant i e p 0 05 the higher the auc for the roc curve the better the model is at predicting the legionella positive events as positive and legionella negative events as negative the roc curve identified 54 95 c 55 c as the ideal hot water temperature the cutoff point based on the youden index i e the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximal with a rate of correctly identifying a system as legionella free of 94 3 and a rate of incorrectly identifying a legionella free system as contaminated of 25 7 3 5 meta regression a binary logistic regression model was performed to predict legionella colonization based on the hotel hot water temperature data obtained from 9 different studies alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 a random intercept was considered for different studies table 3 summarizes the results of the meta regression used in this study our regression model correctly classified 81 4 of legionella events and the intercept was found to be 19 778 95 ci 10 099 29 458 the temperature range we considered for meta regression 45 70 c had a negative association with the legionella colonization and the association was statistically significant p 0 05 for every one degree celsius increase in temperature the log odds of being legionella positive versus being legionella negative decreased by 0 376 95 ci 0 561 0 192 the random effect variance i e var intercept estimate for the different studies was found to be 0 386 95 ci 0 005 27 878 but the random effect model was not a statistically significant p 0 05 improvement over a model without the random effects for the different studies the parameters shown in table 3 were then used to calculate the probability of legionella positive events at different temperatures fig 4 represents the probability of legionella positive events in hotels at hot water temperatures ranging between 45 and 70 c the probabilities of a legionella positive events at 50 c 55 c 60 c and 65 c were found to be 72 7 28 9 5 83 and 0 94 respectively the probability of detection of legionella decreased 60 when the temperature increased from 50 c to 55 c fig 4 also about an 80 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive events was observed from temperature at 55 c 60 c furthermore about a 97 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive events was observed from temperature at 55 c 65 c 3 6 subgroup analysis we performed a subgroup analysis of 3 studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 which reported legionella colonization data for temperatures 55 c compared with temperatures 55 c based on the heterogeneity test there was no heterogeneity i e i2 0 among subgroups p 0 05 a random effect model was used to capture the effect of temperature on legionella colonization and a forest plot was used to evaluate the weight of each study in the subgroup meta analysis fig 5 the weight of barna et al 2016 was about 81 which was significantly larger than the other two studies included in this sub group analysis barna et al 2016 includes hot water samples from hotel buildings as well as other building settings i e schools health care facilities etc whereas the other two studies only include hotel hot water samples the combined odds ratio for the high temperature compared to the lower temperature was 0 17 95 ci 0 11 0 25 which was statistically significant i e p 0 05 4 discussion we systematically identified reviewed and synthesized the selected available evidence on the association between hot water temperature and legionella colonization in hotel water distribution systems to identify the required hot water temperature our meta analyses showed an increased risk of legionella positive events associated with lower hot water temperatures in hotel premise plumbing our qualitative synthesis also identified a need for a higher required hot water temperature i e at least 55 59 c in most studies compared to the existing guidance hot water temperature i e at least 50 c but ideally 55 c ecdc 2017b to protect the systems from colonization which was consistent with our meta regression and sub group analysis results the results of our qualitative synthesis indicate that the studies identified differing required temperatures for avoiding detectable legionella at hot water taps showerheads but all the temperatures were in the range from 50 c to 60 c only one study identified temperatures 50 c as being sufficient to control legionella kyritsi et al 2018 hot water temperature 55 c in the plumbing system was sufficient to control legionella in a total of 4 studies borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 toyosada et al 2017 these studies agree with the recommendations of several guidance documents to maintain the hot water temperature at the point of use of 55 c ecdc 2017b a hot water temperature 60 c was found to be required to control legionella in five different studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 however the risk of scalding and increase in energy cost associated with high temperatures would argue for lower hot water temperature the roc curve analysis in our study estimated the auc value of 0 914 which indicates the excellent performance of our test variable i e temperature to distinguish between legionella positive and negative samples an auc value close to 1 is identified as a measure of excellent forecasting hanley and mcneil 1982 marzban 2004 previous studies have mentioned temperature as the most important factor in legionella contamination in hotel water systems barna et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 the roc analysis identified 55 c as the cutoff point for the hot water temperature in hotel premise plumbing settings with high sensitivity 94 and high specificity 74 maintaining hotel hot water temperature at all taps 55 c would protect the hotel hot water systems from legionella which is consistent with the results of the qualitative synthesis and existing guidance ecdc 2017b as higher specificity i e true negative rate which is defined here as the ability to identify legionella colonization when present is the priority to protect the hotel water systems it may be possible to increase specificity by choosing a higher temperature temperature and exposure times associated with scalding are briefly discussed below the association between temperature and colonization of legionella spp was analyzed as a univariate analysis in our meta regression table 3 our study found a statistically significant negative association between temperature and legionella colonization odds ratio or from the binary logistic regression was found to be 0 686 which indicates the decreased occurrence of positive legionella colonization in hotel hot water systems with increased temperature higher temperature such as 55 c was found to be significantly associated with decreased legionella colonization fig 4 previous studies also found a negative correlation between temperature 55 c and legionella spp contamination arvand et al 2011 bargellini et al 2011 borella et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b multiple linear regression of water characteristics with legionella colonization also confirmed a positive correlation between water temperature 55 c and legionella contamination barna et al 2016 results from these studies indicate limited effects from other parameters e g ph source water conductivity age of premise plumbing etc the primary results presented above pooled data obtained using different analytical methods as a sensitivity analysis for detection method another binary logistic regression was performed considering data from only studies which used culture as a detection method alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 results from this analysis were also statistically significant but the probability of having legionella positive events considerably increased at higher temperatures for example the probability of detectable legionella at 60 c was 15 in the model fit to only the culture data in comparison to just 6 in the previous regression model which included all the studies the study of toyosada et al 2017 which used the ica test not culture included 15 samples taken at a temperature of 58 c all of which were negative whereas only 6 observations from such high temperatures were available from all other studies 5 of which were negative the limited legionella contamination data at higher temperatures for the model that excludes the toyosada et al 2017 data might be the cause of the difference between the two models while the difference between 0 of 15 positives from the ica data vs 1 of 6 positives from the other studies cannot be established as a systematic difference it is also possible that the ica test used by toyosada et al 2017 was less sensitive than culture methods since l pneumophila accounts for more than 80 of all the cases of legionnaires disease worldwide mondino et al 2020 the effect of temperature on them was considered separately another binary logistic regression was performed considering data in which either the l pneumophila was the only species reported or was the dominant legionella species results from this analysis were also statistically significant but the probability of having l pneumophila positive events slightly decreased at higher temperatures compared to the previous regression model which included all the studies for this regression model at 59 c the probability of l pneumophila positive events was 6 marginally less than the 8 chance of having legionella positive events in the full model yet another binary logistic regression was performed by excluding data from two studies fragou et al 2012 and leoni et al 2005 which contained hotel hot water samples mixed with hospital samples and thereby may have resulted in erroneous results in our previous analysis results from this re analysis were also statistically significant and the probability of having legionella positive events marginally decreased at higher temperatures i e 6 at 59 c compared to the previous regression model which included all the studies the subgroup analysis of our study also indicates the effectiveness of hot water temperatures 55 c to control legionella colonization in hotels compared to hot water temperature 55 c with an overall odds ratio of 0 17 where one study barna et al 2016 dominated our analysis mouchtouri et al 2007b found an odds ratio of 0 26 at a hot water temperature 55 c using multiple logistic regression which is reasonably consistent with the odds ratio of 0 17 found in this meta analysis fig 5 other studies also found an increase in legionella count if the hot water temperature was 55 c arvand et al 2011 barna et al 2016 our i2 statistic identified a low level of heterogeneity among studies and the p value of the chi squared test was 0 49 which is consistent with the null hypothesis and therefore suggests homogeneity between studies both the subgroup and roc analyses give probabilities of detectable legionella that are based on pooling all the observations below the given cut off temperature this makes the results sensitive to the number of samples taken at various temperatures in contrast the logistic regression on temperature gives probabilities of legionella for specific temperatures and is somewhat more conservative than the other approaches i e produces a higher recommended temperature the logistic regression indicates that even when the hot water temperature is maintained at 59 c there will be still a 8 chance of having legionella positive events fig 4 temperature above 65 c at the hot water tap is required to reduce the probability of detectable legionella to 1 fig 4 which seems reasonable as it has been observed that legionella can survive for a short time at 55 70 c dennis et al 1984 erdogan and arslan 2015 rhoads et al 2015 furthermore we observed a 97 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive event from the temperature at 55 c 65 c which is also consistent with previous studies which observed that the decimal reduction time for legionella decreases exponentially with increased temperature dennis et al 1984 schulze röbbecke et al 1987 in addition to the risks posed by legionella the risk of scalding and increases in energy consumption must be taken into account when setting recommended temperatures both qualitative synthesis and meta analyses of our study indicated maintaining temperatures ranging from 55 c to 59 c as the required hot water temperature to control legionella in hotel premise plumbing systems maintaining such high temperatures in the water outlets could increase the risk of scalding barna et al 2016 bédard et al 2015 borella et al 2005 rhoads et al 2014 it has been reported that water temperatures above 47 c at the hot water taps increase the risk of scalding significantly and water at 60 c may cause a second degree burn after 6 s or less of exposure department of veterans affairs 2014 nasem 2019 stanwick 1986 considering the difficulty of maintaining hot water temperature to kill legionella and simultaneously eliminating the risk of scalding thermostatic mixing valves are used to mix both the cold and hot water to reduce the maximum water temperature at the point of use ahmed et al 2019 rhoads et al 2014 however there are concerns regarding the potential for such valves to leak or otherwise create a temperature gradient favorable to legionella growth singh et al 2020 regular maintenance and limiting the pipe length from the valve to the tap may help to manage these issues in reality control of legionella is probably not achieved through monitoring of a single variable even one as important as temperature recent efforts to provide a broader view of multiple factors related to the control of legionella include singh et al 2020 and nasem 2019 the required hot water temperature established in this study was based on the presence absence of the legionella colonization previous studies and guidance documents defined 1000 cfu l of legionella as a threshold for considering preventive measures to protect public health barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 ecdc 2017b nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019 which roughly agrees with the concentration of 1400 cfu l of legionella pneumophila corresponding to 10 4 annual risk of clinical severity infection found by hamilton et al 2019 for setting the threshold concentration level most of the guidance documents talked about legionella spp in general which would be conservative i e measured legionella spp would be greater than or equal to l pneumophilla but careful consideration should be given as some countries set the value specifically for l pneumophila e g france nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019 it may be that lower temperatures would be required to limit legionella growth to below 1000 cfu l than are required to reliably obtain non detectable results a quantitative evaluation of the temperature required to reduce legionella concentrations to 1000 cfu l was not performed in this study because of the lack of appropriate legionella concentration data only two studies fragou et al 2012 serrano suárez et al 2013 provided sufficiently detailed data to allow a linear regression of legionella concentration on temperature to be fit the relationship found in the linear model was not statistically significant i e p 0 05 and the model had issues with outliers in the legionella concentration data furthermore previous studies found that the decimal reduction time for legionella decreases exponentially with increased temperature dennis et al 1984 schulze röbbecke et al 1987 which suggests that a linear relationship may not be expected while the use of linear regression to predict concentrations of legionella would be preferable to this study s approach of using logistic regression to predict whether legionella concentrations are detectable vs non detectable further work in this area appears to require more extensive data and more sophisticated analytical approaches while the concentration data in these two studies were not successfully modeled the results can be inspected to observe the temperatures needed to limit legionella concentrations to 1000 l fragou et al 2012 found legionella concentration 1000 cfu l when the temperature was maintained at a range of 44 60 c also serrano suárez et al 2013 reported legionella concentration 1000 cfu l when the temperature was maintained at a range of 50 60 c the data from these two studies fragou et al 2012 serrano suárez et al 2013 that provided temperature and concentration data showed much higher concentrations at 50 c and detectable but low values of concentrations at 50 c which support the concept that if a tolerable concentration of legionella was defined as 1000 cfu l then substantially lower hot water temperatures could be employed than are required to reduce legionella to non detectable levels even this lower target is inconsistent with the international plumbing code ipc which requires maintaining a hot water temperature 43 c at the point of use is to prevent the risk of scalding international code council 2015 which implies that the use of a thermostatic mixing valve is necessary to comply with this code while controlling legionella see discussion above of issues with thermostatic mixing valves one of the potential limitations in this study is that the studies included in here used different detection methods for legionella culture methods were the most commonly used methods for detecting legionella colonization followed by studies that used both culture and pcr methods previous studies found that culture methods usually provide lower estimates of the concentration of legionella spp compared to pcr methods bonetta et al 2010 serrano suárez et al 2013 as legionella spp can remain viable but nonculturable kirschner 2016 palmer et al 1995 as would be expected among the studies summarized here a higher prevalence of legionella colonization was reported when pcr was used serrano suárez et al 2013 previous studies also found discrepancies in results analyzed by qpcr and culture method diederen et al 2007 whiley and taylor 2014 this is not surprising as qpcr not only can detect cells in viable but non culturable vbnc state but also can detect free dna and dead cells kirschner 2016 it has been found that at a higher temperature such as 70 c legionella usually lose their culturability allegra et al 2011 but real time pcr might detect vbnc cells and dead cells which would still cause the discrepancies in results bonetta et al 2010 reported 3 culture positive samples for legionella pneumophila at a temperature 55 c but the positive sample frequency increased to 7 at an even higher temperature i e 60 c when real time pcr method was used the detection limit for the culture method also varied between studies which could influence the results of our analyses furthermore the time between hot water sampling and analysis using the culture method in samples with elevated temperature can lead to reduced numbers and false negative results in this study we investigated only the relationship between water temperature in hotel hot water systems and legionella colonization other factors that could have influenced the outcome of our analyses are the age of the hotel the water residence time in the plumbing system ph disinfectant level biofilms the concentration of metal ions and other physiochemical parameters electric water heaters with minimal storage have also been found to be negatively associated with legionella colonization compared to oil heaters mouchtouri et al 2007b but the type of water heater was not considered in this study also the quality of individual research studies used as a data source may have influenced the results of this study harrison 2011 5 conclusions our synthesis of the available evidence in the literature revealed the effectiveness of hot water temperature to control legionella colonization in hotel water systems the required hot water temperature identified in this study can be used in conjunction with expected heat losses in pipes to determine water heater temperature setpoints and for planning and policymaking to regulate legionella spp contamination in hotel hot water distribution systems this work was limited to assessing the detection of legionella as a function of temperature as most studies did not report concentration information in a useable format further studies should develop quantitative relationships between legionella concentration and temperature further studies are also needed to evaluate the combined effects of disinfectant residual and

17798,legionella spp occurring in hotel hot water systems in particular legionella pneumophila are causing serious pneumonic infections and water temperature is a key factor to control their occurrence in plumbing systems we performed a systematic review and meta analyses of the available evidence on the association between water temperature and legionella colonization to identify the water temperature in hotel hot water systems required for control of legionella qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis were performed on 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria to identify the effect of temperature the receiver operating characteristic roc curve identified 55 c as a cutoff point for hotel hot water temperature with an area under the curve auc value of 0 914 the odds ratios or for detecting legionella at temperatures 55 c compared to lower temperatures from a meta analysis of three studies was 0 17 95 ci 0 11 0 25 which indicates a strong negative association between temperature and legionella colonization a logistic regression on results from multiple studies using both molecular and culture methods found a temperature of 59 c associated with an 8 probability of detectable legionella only two studies reported sufficiently detailed data to allow a model of concentration vs temperature to be fit and this model was not statistically significant additional research or more detailed reporting of existing datasets is required to assess if legionella growth can be limited below particular concentration targets at different temperatures graphical

pneumophila in water distribution systems and their associated factors while temperature influences the growth of legionella most other factors such as disinfection efficiency rate of corrosion and the hydraulics of the plumbing systems also influence the survival and proliferation of legionella spp in premise plumbing systems lin et al 1998 shands et al 1985 stout et al 1985 singh et al 2020 the temperature in hotel hot water systems has an inverse association with legionella colonization and can be used to control the system contamination dennis et al 1984 groothuis et al 1985 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 yee and wadowsky 1982 the published literature has been inconsistent with some studies suggesting maintaining hot water temperature 55 c in hot water systems to control legionella was required bargellini et al 2011 barna et al 2016 borella et al 2005 dennis et al 1984 mavridou et al 1994 toyosada et al 2017 van der lugt et al 2019 while others suggesting 50 c was enough kyritsi et al 2018 tobin 1986 concerns over energy use and scalding risk both favor the use of lower temperatures if possible therefore there is a need to evaluate and if possible reconcile these studies in order to identify the lowest hot water temperature in plumbing systems that can control the growth of legionella in this study our aim is to systematically review the evidence available on the association between hot water temperature and legionella colonization and to conduct qualitative synthesis and meta analysis to identify the required water temperature for controlling the risk of legionella colonization 2 methods we performed a systematic literature review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma framework shamseer et al 2015 this included a literature search on the web of science core collection pubmed and engineering village to identify relevant reports which were published as of august 7th 2019 for legionella colonization in hot water systems of hotels including peer reviewed research articles reviews case reports government documents and other short reports by using the following combination of three sets of keywords for legionella legionella or legionella pneumophila or legionella spp or legionnaires or pneumonia or legionellosis or legion fever for hotel setting hotel or apartment hotel or apartment hotel or motel or hostelry or accommodation site or guest house or guesthouse or hotel apartment or lodge for temperature temperature or hot water or water heater or hot water systems the above keywords for legionella hotel setting and temperature were combined with the boolean operator and for the search there was no restriction on publication year in our search we then performed a manual review of the reference lists of the identified articles and reports to find any additional articles that might not be found through our keyword search all these identified articles were uploaded into the reference management software zotero 5 0 71 https www zotero org and duplicates were identified by matching the title first author name and publication year and were removed after the removal of the duplicate items we screened the remaining titles and abstracts for relevance the relevance criterion was peer reviewed articles that studied the relationship between legionella spp colonization and hot water temperature in hotel water systems after the relevance screening all the potentially eligible studies were then retrieved as full texts to review in detail for eligibility based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria of this research 2 1 inclusion criteria the inclusion criteria for this research were studies that were not conducted only based on legionella outbreaks studies that identified the exposure to legionella using standard detection methods i e pcr culture qpcr ica test and reported the results with sampling details studies that collected hot water samples at showerheads and or taps articles in english articles that presented primary data review papers and guidance documents were not included full text of the article was available not just abstract or summary 2 2 data extraction relevant data were extracted from the eligible studies using an excel version 16 spreadsheet microsoft corporation redmond usa and digitizeit 2 3 https www digitizeit de the extracted information included the location of the study sampling location i e showerheads taps or water heater detection methods detection limits temperature legionella colonization information and temperature range to control legionella hot water sample data points for hotel settings were extracted as much as possible from the included studies where data from other settings were also reported if the studies calculated odds ratios ors or reported legionella colonization data for a certain range of temperatures these were extracted and pooled 2 3 qualitative synthesis meta analysis and statistical analysis the findings of the eligible studies were summarized in numerical and narrative tables a qualitative synthesis was performed to identify the required temperature for hotel hot water systems by categorizing the studies that found legionella colonization at different temperatures some studies provided evidence for two different temperatures to control legionella colonization where a higher temperature was found to control the legionella colonization to a greater extent and the lower hot water temperature was found to control the colonization to a lesser extent in this study the higher temperature was considered as the control temperature for the contamination and was counted towards the evidence based temperature a statistical cut off point of temperature for legionella colonization was identified using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve hanley and mcneil 1982 specifically the youden index was used to identify the cutoff point from the roc curve ruopp et al 2008 where the youden index determines the point of the roc curve for which the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximal a random effect model was considered for the binary logistic regression model to identify the effect of temperature on legionella colonization in hot water systems a random effect model was considered based on the potential heterogeneity between different studies on account of methods used location of the study the difference in statistical analyses lau et al 1997 subsequently the probability of legionella positive events at different temperatures for the hotel hot water system was calculated using the results of the logistic regression analysis all the studies were considered for the qualitative synthesis but not all the studies were included in the quantitative meta analysis if paired observations for temperature and legionella from some of the studies were not extractable those studies were not included in the meta analyses such as roc curve or meta regression furthermore forest plots considering random effects across different studies using the pooled or data were used to show the effects of temperature on legionella colonization with 95 confidence intervals cis the heterogeneity across different studies was determined using the higgins i2 statistic huedo medina et al 2006 an i2 value of 0 25 was considered as low heterogeneity and 50 75 was considered as moderate heterogeneity mustafić et al 2012 a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant for the calculated results in this study all the statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 software spss inc chicago il usa and review manager 5 3 cochrane london uk 3 results 3 1 literature review findings the literature review findings in this study are summarized in the prisma framework diagram in fig 2 our electronic search identified a total of 86 records from all the databases and an additional 5 records from other sources were identified by performing a forward and backward reference search after the removal of 29 duplicate records we screened titles and abstracts of 62 records and identified 30 relevant full text articles of these extracted 30 full text articles 17 articles were excluded from the qualitative synthesis and meta analysis based on our different inclusion criteria fig 2 we considered the remaining 13 articles in our qualitative synthesis and meta analysis for this study 3 2 summary of the included studies selected studies for this research were from various geographical regions of the world table 1 summarizes the locations of these study areas sampling points in the hotel plumbing methods used to detect legionella colonization the total number of hotel hot water samples and major findings only culture method was used in 8 studies and mixed i e both culture and pcr methods were used in 4 studies the remaining one study used the immunochromatography assay ica test mentioned as the legio search technology as a detection method the detection limit was not reported in 4 studies but when mentioned it ranged between 10 and 500 cfu l for the culture method and 480 680 gc l for the pcr method most of the hot water samples were collected from sink hot water taps and showerheads in the hotel water systems a total of eight studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 collected samples after flushing for a certain time ranging between 1 and 5 min while other five studies alexiou et al 1989 erdogan and arslan 2015 fragou et al 2012 kyritsi et al 2018 toyosada et al 2017 did not report the detailed sampling plan the largest hotel hot water sample size of 962 was collected by mouchtouri et al 2007 findings from these studies indicate that the prevalence of legionella spp in hotel hot water samples was common at temperatures ranging between 40 c and 54 c a higher percentage of positive samples was found when the samples were tested using both culture and pcr methods rather than only the standard culture method information on disinfectant residual was not reported systematically enough to be used in this study a total of 9 studies mentioned free chlorine residual measurement in their sampling plan bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 fragou et al 2012 kyritsi et al 2018 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 however chlorine decays rapidly at elevated temperatures serrano suárez et al 2013 and may not persist in the hot water system for example fragou et al 2012 reported that collected hotel water samples were free of chlorine and serrano suárez et al 2013 also did not find any free residual chlorine concentration in the distal samples 3 3 required temperature based on the qualitative synthesis a qualitative synthesis of the included studies was performed to identify the required temperature for hotel hot water systems table 2 only 10 studies provided enough discrete temperature information to categorize in different groups high hot water temperature at taps of 60 c was found by 5 different studies to protect from legionella barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 another four studies also provided evidence that maintaining hot water temperature throughout the whole system at 55 c was protective against legionella contamination borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 toyosada et al 2017 only one study found that maintaining the temperature at 50 c at hot water taps showerheads protected the water distribution systems from legionella colonization kyritsi et al 2018 their differing conclusions do not correspond clearly to differences in analytical methods used for legionella detection two of the five studies in the 60 c category relied on culture alone barna et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2007b while three used culture and pcr methods bonetta et al 2010 serrano suárez et al 2013 fragou et al 2012 three of the four studies in the 55 c category also relied on culture alone borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 and one used an immunochromatography assay method toyosada et al 2017 3 4 receiver operating characteristic roc curve a roc curve was derived from the association between hotel hot water temperature data and legionella test results from 9 different studies where paired observations data were available alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 a roc curve is a probability curve where the true positive rate is plotted against the false positive rate fig 3 represents the roc curve where the true positive rate i e sensitivity defined here as the ability to correctly identify a system as legionella free is plotted against the false positive rate i e 1 specificity defined here as the probability of incorrectly identifying a legionella free system as legionella colonized for different cutoff points the 45 red diagonal line divides the whole roc space and a perfect test curve would pass through the upper left corner of the roc space representing 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity the area under the curve auc for the roc curve was estimated to be 0 914 with a 95 confidence interval of 0 851 0 977 which was statistically significant i e p 0 05 the higher the auc for the roc curve the better the model is at predicting the legionella positive events as positive and legionella negative events as negative the roc curve identified 54 95 c 55 c as the ideal hot water temperature the cutoff point based on the youden index i e the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximal with a rate of correctly identifying a system as legionella free of 94 3 and a rate of incorrectly identifying a legionella free system as contaminated of 25 7 3 5 meta regression a binary logistic regression model was performed to predict legionella colonization based on the hotel hot water temperature data obtained from 9 different studies alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 toyosada et al 2017 a random intercept was considered for different studies table 3 summarizes the results of the meta regression used in this study our regression model correctly classified 81 4 of legionella events and the intercept was found to be 19 778 95 ci 10 099 29 458 the temperature range we considered for meta regression 45 70 c had a negative association with the legionella colonization and the association was statistically significant p 0 05 for every one degree celsius increase in temperature the log odds of being legionella positive versus being legionella negative decreased by 0 376 95 ci 0 561 0 192 the random effect variance i e var intercept estimate for the different studies was found to be 0 386 95 ci 0 005 27 878 but the random effect model was not a statistically significant p 0 05 improvement over a model without the random effects for the different studies the parameters shown in table 3 were then used to calculate the probability of legionella positive events at different temperatures fig 4 represents the probability of legionella positive events in hotels at hot water temperatures ranging between 45 and 70 c the probabilities of a legionella positive events at 50 c 55 c 60 c and 65 c were found to be 72 7 28 9 5 83 and 0 94 respectively the probability of detection of legionella decreased 60 when the temperature increased from 50 c to 55 c fig 4 also about an 80 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive events was observed from temperature at 55 c 60 c furthermore about a 97 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive events was observed from temperature at 55 c 65 c 3 6 subgroup analysis we performed a subgroup analysis of 3 studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 borella et al 2005 which reported legionella colonization data for temperatures 55 c compared with temperatures 55 c based on the heterogeneity test there was no heterogeneity i e i2 0 among subgroups p 0 05 a random effect model was used to capture the effect of temperature on legionella colonization and a forest plot was used to evaluate the weight of each study in the subgroup meta analysis fig 5 the weight of barna et al 2016 was about 81 which was significantly larger than the other two studies included in this sub group analysis barna et al 2016 includes hot water samples from hotel buildings as well as other building settings i e schools health care facilities etc whereas the other two studies only include hotel hot water samples the combined odds ratio for the high temperature compared to the lower temperature was 0 17 95 ci 0 11 0 25 which was statistically significant i e p 0 05 4 discussion we systematically identified reviewed and synthesized the selected available evidence on the association between hot water temperature and legionella colonization in hotel water distribution systems to identify the required hot water temperature our meta analyses showed an increased risk of legionella positive events associated with lower hot water temperatures in hotel premise plumbing our qualitative synthesis also identified a need for a higher required hot water temperature i e at least 55 59 c in most studies compared to the existing guidance hot water temperature i e at least 50 c but ideally 55 c ecdc 2017b to protect the systems from colonization which was consistent with our meta regression and sub group analysis results the results of our qualitative synthesis indicate that the studies identified differing required temperatures for avoiding detectable legionella at hot water taps showerheads but all the temperatures were in the range from 50 c to 60 c only one study identified temperatures 50 c as being sufficient to control legionella kyritsi et al 2018 hot water temperature 55 c in the plumbing system was sufficient to control legionella in a total of 4 studies borella et al 2005 rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 toyosada et al 2017 these studies agree with the recommendations of several guidance documents to maintain the hot water temperature at the point of use of 55 c ecdc 2017b a hot water temperature 60 c was found to be required to control legionella in five different studies barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 however the risk of scalding and increase in energy cost associated with high temperatures would argue for lower hot water temperature the roc curve analysis in our study estimated the auc value of 0 914 which indicates the excellent performance of our test variable i e temperature to distinguish between legionella positive and negative samples an auc value close to 1 is identified as a measure of excellent forecasting hanley and mcneil 1982 marzban 2004 previous studies have mentioned temperature as the most important factor in legionella contamination in hotel water systems barna et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2007b serrano suárez et al 2013 the roc analysis identified 55 c as the cutoff point for the hot water temperature in hotel premise plumbing settings with high sensitivity 94 and high specificity 74 maintaining hotel hot water temperature at all taps 55 c would protect the hotel hot water systems from legionella which is consistent with the results of the qualitative synthesis and existing guidance ecdc 2017b as higher specificity i e true negative rate which is defined here as the ability to identify legionella colonization when present is the priority to protect the hotel water systems it may be possible to increase specificity by choosing a higher temperature temperature and exposure times associated with scalding are briefly discussed below the association between temperature and colonization of legionella spp was analyzed as a univariate analysis in our meta regression table 3 our study found a statistically significant negative association between temperature and legionella colonization odds ratio or from the binary logistic regression was found to be 0 686 which indicates the decreased occurrence of positive legionella colonization in hotel hot water systems with increased temperature higher temperature such as 55 c was found to be significantly associated with decreased legionella colonization fig 4 previous studies also found a negative correlation between temperature 55 c and legionella spp contamination arvand et al 2011 bargellini et al 2011 borella et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b multiple linear regression of water characteristics with legionella colonization also confirmed a positive correlation between water temperature 55 c and legionella contamination barna et al 2016 results from these studies indicate limited effects from other parameters e g ph source water conductivity age of premise plumbing etc the primary results presented above pooled data obtained using different analytical methods as a sensitivity analysis for detection method another binary logistic regression was performed considering data from only studies which used culture as a detection method alexiou et al 1989 bonetta et al 2010 fragou et al 2012 leoni et al 2005 mouchtouri et al 2007b rakic et al 2013 rakić et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 results from this analysis were also statistically significant but the probability of having legionella positive events considerably increased at higher temperatures for example the probability of detectable legionella at 60 c was 15 in the model fit to only the culture data in comparison to just 6 in the previous regression model which included all the studies the study of toyosada et al 2017 which used the ica test not culture included 15 samples taken at a temperature of 58 c all of which were negative whereas only 6 observations from such high temperatures were available from all other studies 5 of which were negative the limited legionella contamination data at higher temperatures for the model that excludes the toyosada et al 2017 data might be the cause of the difference between the two models while the difference between 0 of 15 positives from the ica data vs 1 of 6 positives from the other studies cannot be established as a systematic difference it is also possible that the ica test used by toyosada et al 2017 was less sensitive than culture methods since l pneumophila accounts for more than 80 of all the cases of legionnaires disease worldwide mondino et al 2020 the effect of temperature on them was considered separately another binary logistic regression was performed considering data in which either the l pneumophila was the only species reported or was the dominant legionella species results from this analysis were also statistically significant but the probability of having l pneumophila positive events slightly decreased at higher temperatures compared to the previous regression model which included all the studies for this regression model at 59 c the probability of l pneumophila positive events was 6 marginally less than the 8 chance of having legionella positive events in the full model yet another binary logistic regression was performed by excluding data from two studies fragou et al 2012 and leoni et al 2005 which contained hotel hot water samples mixed with hospital samples and thereby may have resulted in erroneous results in our previous analysis results from this re analysis were also statistically significant and the probability of having legionella positive events marginally decreased at higher temperatures i e 6 at 59 c compared to the previous regression model which included all the studies the subgroup analysis of our study also indicates the effectiveness of hot water temperatures 55 c to control legionella colonization in hotels compared to hot water temperature 55 c with an overall odds ratio of 0 17 where one study barna et al 2016 dominated our analysis mouchtouri et al 2007b found an odds ratio of 0 26 at a hot water temperature 55 c using multiple logistic regression which is reasonably consistent with the odds ratio of 0 17 found in this meta analysis fig 5 other studies also found an increase in legionella count if the hot water temperature was 55 c arvand et al 2011 barna et al 2016 our i2 statistic identified a low level of heterogeneity among studies and the p value of the chi squared test was 0 49 which is consistent with the null hypothesis and therefore suggests homogeneity between studies both the subgroup and roc analyses give probabilities of detectable legionella that are based on pooling all the observations below the given cut off temperature this makes the results sensitive to the number of samples taken at various temperatures in contrast the logistic regression on temperature gives probabilities of legionella for specific temperatures and is somewhat more conservative than the other approaches i e produces a higher recommended temperature the logistic regression indicates that even when the hot water temperature is maintained at 59 c there will be still a 8 chance of having legionella positive events fig 4 temperature above 65 c at the hot water tap is required to reduce the probability of detectable legionella to 1 fig 4 which seems reasonable as it has been observed that legionella can survive for a short time at 55 70 c dennis et al 1984 erdogan and arslan 2015 rhoads et al 2015 furthermore we observed a 97 decrease in the probability of a legionella positive event from the temperature at 55 c 65 c which is also consistent with previous studies which observed that the decimal reduction time for legionella decreases exponentially with increased temperature dennis et al 1984 schulze röbbecke et al 1987 in addition to the risks posed by legionella the risk of scalding and increases in energy consumption must be taken into account when setting recommended temperatures both qualitative synthesis and meta analyses of our study indicated maintaining temperatures ranging from 55 c to 59 c as the required hot water temperature to control legionella in hotel premise plumbing systems maintaining such high temperatures in the water outlets could increase the risk of scalding barna et al 2016 bédard et al 2015 borella et al 2005 rhoads et al 2014 it has been reported that water temperatures above 47 c at the hot water taps increase the risk of scalding significantly and water at 60 c may cause a second degree burn after 6 s or less of exposure department of veterans affairs 2014 nasem 2019 stanwick 1986 considering the difficulty of maintaining hot water temperature to kill legionella and simultaneously eliminating the risk of scalding thermostatic mixing valves are used to mix both the cold and hot water to reduce the maximum water temperature at the point of use ahmed et al 2019 rhoads et al 2014 however there are concerns regarding the potential for such valves to leak or otherwise create a temperature gradient favorable to legionella growth singh et al 2020 regular maintenance and limiting the pipe length from the valve to the tap may help to manage these issues in reality control of legionella is probably not achieved through monitoring of a single variable even one as important as temperature recent efforts to provide a broader view of multiple factors related to the control of legionella include singh et al 2020 and nasem 2019 the required hot water temperature established in this study was based on the presence absence of the legionella colonization previous studies and guidance documents defined 1000 cfu l of legionella as a threshold for considering preventive measures to protect public health barna et al 2016 bonetta et al 2010 ecdc 2017b nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019 which roughly agrees with the concentration of 1400 cfu l of legionella pneumophila corresponding to 10 4 annual risk of clinical severity infection found by hamilton et al 2019 for setting the threshold concentration level most of the guidance documents talked about legionella spp in general which would be conservative i e measured legionella spp would be greater than or equal to l pneumophilla but careful consideration should be given as some countries set the value specifically for l pneumophila e g france nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019 it may be that lower temperatures would be required to limit legionella growth to below 1000 cfu l than are required to reliably obtain non detectable results a quantitative evaluation of the temperature required to reduce legionella concentrations to 1000 cfu l was not performed in this study because of the lack of appropriate legionella concentration data only two studies fragou et al 2012 serrano suárez et al 2013 provided sufficiently detailed data to allow a linear regression of legionella concentration on temperature to be fit the relationship found in the linear model was not statistically significant i e p 0 05 and the model had issues with outliers in the legionella concentration data furthermore previous studies found that the decimal reduction time for legionella decreases exponentially with increased temperature dennis et al 1984 schulze röbbecke et al 1987 which suggests that a linear relationship may not be expected while the use of linear regression to predict concentrations of legionella would be preferable to this study s approach of using logistic regression to predict whether legionella concentrations are detectable vs non detectable further work in this area appears to require more extensive data and more sophisticated analytical approaches while the concentration data in these two studies were not successfully modeled the results can be inspected to observe the temperatures needed to limit legionella concentrations to 1000 l fragou et al 2012 found legionella concentration 1000 cfu l when the temperature was maintained at a range of 44 60 c also serrano suárez et al 2013 reported legionella concentration 1000 cfu l when the temperature was maintained at a range of 50 60 c the data from these two studies fragou et al 2012 serrano suárez et al 2013 that provided temperature and concentration data showed much higher concentrations at 50 c and detectable but low values of concentrations at 50 c which support the concept that if a tolerable concentration of legionella was defined as 1000 cfu l then substantially lower hot water temperatures could be employed than are required to reduce legionella to non detectable levels even this lower target is inconsistent with the international plumbing code ipc which requires maintaining a hot water temperature 43 c at the point of use is to prevent the risk of scalding international code council 2015 which implies that the use of a thermostatic mixing valve is necessary to comply with this code while controlling legionella see discussion above of issues with thermostatic mixing valves one of the potential limitations in this study is that the studies included in here used different detection methods for legionella culture methods were the most commonly used methods for detecting legionella colonization followed by studies that used both culture and pcr methods previous studies found that culture methods usually provide lower estimates of the concentration of legionella spp compared to pcr methods bonetta et al 2010 serrano suárez et al 2013 as legionella spp can remain viable but nonculturable kirschner 2016 palmer et al 1995 as would be expected among the studies summarized here a higher prevalence of legionella colonization was reported when pcr was used serrano suárez et al 2013 previous studies also found discrepancies in results analyzed by qpcr and culture method diederen et al 2007 whiley and taylor 2014 this is not surprising as qpcr not only can detect cells in viable but non culturable vbnc state but also can detect free dna and dead cells kirschner 2016 it has been found that at a higher temperature such as 70 c legionella usually lose their culturability allegra et al 2011 but real time pcr might detect vbnc cells and dead cells which would still cause the discrepancies in results bonetta et al 2010 reported 3 culture positive samples for legionella pneumophila at a temperature 55 c but the positive sample frequency increased to 7 at an even higher temperature i e 60 c when real time pcr method was used the detection limit for the culture method also varied between studies which could influence the results of our analyses furthermore the time between hot water sampling and analysis using the culture method in samples with elevated temperature can lead to reduced numbers and false negative results in this study we investigated only the relationship between water temperature in hotel hot water systems and legionella colonization other factors that could have influenced the outcome of our analyses are the age of the hotel the water residence time in the plumbing system ph disinfectant level biofilms the concentration of metal ions and other physiochemical parameters electric water heaters with minimal storage have also been found to be negatively associated with legionella colonization compared to oil heaters mouchtouri et al 2007b but the type of water heater was not considered in this study also the quality of individual research studies used as a data source may have influenced the results of this study harrison 2011 5 conclusions our synthesis of the available evidence in the literature revealed the effectiveness of hot water temperature to control legionella colonization in hotel water systems the required hot water temperature identified in this study can be used in conjunction with expected heat losses in pipes to determine water heater temperature setpoints and for planning and policymaking to regulate legionella spp contamination in hotel hot water distribution systems this work was limited to assessing the detection of legionella as a function of temperature as most studies did not report concentration information in a useable format further studies should develop quantitative relationships between legionella concentration and temperature further studies are also needed to evaluate the combined effects of disinfectant residual and

17799,this study identified specific bacterial populations that play a key role in detoxifying acetaminophen n acetyl p aminophenol apap in activated sludge as microbial communities an as bioreactor was established by feeding 100 mg l of apap as a sole carbon nitrogen and energy source while the bioreactor increased apap biotransformation rates significantly 0 7 d 1 to 6 1 d 1 over a month of acclimation it selected for pseudomonas by significantly reducing community diversity by 40 and richness by 47 a pseudomonas population designated pco isolated from the apap degrading community was phylogenetically distinct from other pseudomonas spp previously reported as apap degrading isolates pco could remove apap at levels up to 590 mg l without inhibition and could also metabolize apap derived metabolites 4 aminophenol hydroquinone and 1 4 benzoquinone at varying levels pco was introduced to as at various volumes 5 25 and 50 of the total showing significantly enhanced apap transformation rates 1 5 1 9 and 2 3 d 1 compared to the control 1 2 d 1 without pco inoculation overall our study provides new insights into the phylogenetic and metabolic features of a key species

microbial communities i e living units of microorganisms found in almost all biological waste treatment systems including as a previous study showed the diversity of bacterial classes affected by apap exposure palma et al 2018 given that a bacterial class can comprise a number of species with highly variable metabolic capabilities the specific species among numerous members belonging to each class with their respective metabolic capabilities that are responsive to apap exposure remain to be determined another study suggested that several genera flavobacterium dokdonella methylophilus and pseudomonas are increased in the presence of apap zhou et al 2019 however further experimental phenotypic characterization is necessary to determine whether these genera indeed participate in apap degradation and if so how these taxa contribute to the community apap degradation hence there are research questions with practical implications for advancing the current understanding of microbial apap detoxification how do as microbial communities with higher apap metabolic capability differ from typical as communities in terms of structure and diversity do the previously reported apap degrading isolates indeed play a role in as microbial communities and if so which specific organisms in the context of as communities play a major role in apap metabolism and how despite several bacterial members being capable of metabolizing apap would introducing those microbial agents into apap contaminated waste streams help remove apap the present work aimed to quantitatively address these questions laboratory bioreactors were established by inoculating an as microbial community taken from an aeration tank at a local municipal wwtp as phenotypes associated with apap remediation were monitored while the as communities acclimatized to apap as the substrate high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis were performed to list organisms potentially involved in apap removal occurring in the bioreactor we successfully isolated a species population significantly enriched in the apap degrading community various biochemical assays were carried out to quantitatively estimate the key population s cell growth apap metabolic intermediates and pathway and apap biodegradation kinetics in addition this work attempted to experimentally validate whether the key population represents a potential auxiliary bioaugmentation seed inoculum that can enhance the environmental cleanup of apap in waste streams the results of this study have practical implications for effectively managing wastewater contaminated with pharmaceuticals and for further developing biological methods such as bioaugmentation for reducing apap contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation the as inoculum was taken from an aerobic tank at a local wastewater treatment plant located at suwon si south korea an as bioreactor 1 l of working volume was established by inoculating the as inoculum 3 g l of volatile suspended solids vss as in the bioreactor the bioreactor was fed with 100 mg l of apap as a sole carbon nitrogen and energy source in addition to apap the synthetic feed consisted of per liter 0 05g cacl2 0 09 g kh2po4 0 67 g k2hpo4 0 27g mgso4 7h2o and 2 mg cocl2 6h2o 0 07 mg cucl2 2h2o 2 1 mg h3bo3 0 21 mg mnso4 h2o 0 21 mg namoo4 2h2o 0 14 mg niso4 6h2o and 0 35 mg znso4 7h2o as previously described choi and oh 2019 the bioreactor was operated in sequential batch mode 10 min of filling reaction and 20 min of decanting a feeding cycle lasted 3 5 days most of which time was taken up by the reaction period kim et al 2020 one fourth of the mixed culture suspension was replaced with the synthetic apap feed every 3 5 days resulting in 14 days of solid retention time srt comparable to 10 30 days in full scale sequencing batch reactors 2 2 apap transformation characteristics kinetics and metabolic intermediates transformation rates were calculated using the first order rate constant equation 1 1 k 1 ln c t c 0 t where k1 is the first order rate constant c t and c 0 represent the time dependent apap concentration and initial concentration respectively and t is the time interval transformation rates for apap and its metabolic intermediates by an apap degrading isolate were assessed using a fully grown isolate culture with 100 mg l of apap this apap concentration was selected because microbial growth for 1 2 days at 100 200 mg l was higher than those at other levels the fully grown cells were centrifuged and washed twice using 1 phosphate buffered saline prior to inoculation kim et al 2019 bacterial cell growth was monitored using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 600 nm optical density cell growth of the apap degrading isolate was characterized using the modified gompertz model the edward growth kinetic model edwards 1970 was used to describe the substrate inhibitory effect of apap 2 3 microbial community analysis three samples from the as inoculum as1 were collected at the beginning before reaction of feeding cycle 1 biomass samples as5 as9 and as17 from the bioreactor were collected at the end of feeding cycles 5 9 and 17 respectively genomic dna was extracted from each sample using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were measured using nanodrop nano 400 hangzhou allsheng instruments co hangzhou china all dna samples exhibited 1 μg dna μl and 1 8 of a260 a280 the genomic dna samples were amplified via polymerase chain reaction targeting the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes the 16s rrna gene amplicon was sequenced by the miseq sequencer macrogen inc south korea paired end 16s rrna gene sequences generated from the miseq sequencer were analyzed following the miseq sop pipeline kozich et al 2013 as described previously vidanage et al 2020 briefly raw sequences were filtered with all parameters other than the following set to default maximum homopolymer length 8 minimum homopolymer length 200 maxambig 0 chimeric sequences were excluded using the chimera vsearch command sequences assigned to chloroplasts mitochondria archaea eukaryotes and unknown were then discarded using classify seqs the remaining sequence data were clustered for grouping operational taxonomic units otus at 97 nucleotide identity cutoff alpha diversity indices were estimated with rarefaction single using microbial community composition data at otu level 2 4 analytical methods apap cas number 103 90 2 4 aminophenol 4 ap cas number 123 30 8 hydroquinone hq cas number 123 31 9 and 1 4 benzoquinone bq cas number 106 51 4 were purchased from sigma aldrich seoul south korea concentrations of apap 4 ap hq and bq were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system yl9100 young lin instrument co south korea equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 μm agilent usa and a uv vis detector the mobile phase solution was composed of 1 acetic acid and methanol mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v the sample flow rate and injection volume were 1 ml min and 100 μl respectively detection wavelengths for apap 4 ap hq and bq were 249 nm 290 nm 288 nm and 249 nm respectively detection limits for apap 4 ap hq and bq were 10 1 000 50 and 10 μg l respectively vss and dissolved oxygen carbon doc were measured following standard method federation and association 2005 2 5 nucleotide sequence accession number the 16s rrna gene sequence datasets used in this study were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers as1 1 srr11207236 as1 2 srr11207225 as1 3 srr11207194 as5 srr11207185 as9 srr11207184 and as17 srr11207183 3 results and discussion 3 1 as community acclimation enhanced apap biodegradation fig 1a displays apap concentration profiles in the as bioreactor fed with apap at representative feeding cycles over two months at cycle 1 apap was removed roughly linearly with 0 7 d 1 of the first order rate constant 99 removal achieved within 72 h while acclimating to apap the as bioreactor showed significantly increased apap transformation rates of 3 1 d 1 and 6 1 d 1 at cycle 5 and 9 respectively the apap transformation rate at cycle 17 was 5 6 d 1 comparable to that at cycle 9 suggesting that the phenotypic acclimation of the as to apap occurred within a month mixed liquor vss was observed for two months the vss concentration gradually decreased from 1 g l to 0 31 g l at cycle 9 leveling off at cycles 9 17 considering that there were no microbial inputs in the influents the biomass leaving the bioreactor should be equal to that synthesized in the bioreactor resulting in 0 02 g vsssynthesized l d and 2 95 g vsssynthesized g apapconsumed fig s1 the stable vss concentration and apap transformation rates observed over cycles 9 17 collectively suggest that the apap degrading bioreactor reached a quasi steady state within a month about twice the duration of srt the as biomass was taken from the bioreactor at cycle 17 and was inoculated into separate glass flasks under experimental conditions e g vss aeration and ph identical to those of the bioreactor the as inoculated glass flasks at lower levels of apap 0 1 and 1 mg l showed apap transformation rates comparable to those at 100 mg l fig s2 suggesting that the apap enriched as would also represent a robust microbial consortium at environmentally relevant levels of apap up to a few hundred micrograms per liter the microbial community acclimation occurring over a month significantly accelerated apap transformation rates by about eight times fig 1 a the maximum apap transformation rates 5 6 6 1 d 1 observed at cycles 9 17 were much higher than those of mixed cultures of natural water 0 07 0 34 d 1 and wastewater 0 1 d 1 karaman et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 similar phenotypic patterns associated with increases in apap transformation rates following acclimation have been observed in other biological engineering systems a membrane bioreactor with 5 days of hydraulic retention time increased its apap removal from 85 to 99 for 15 days de gusseme et al 2011 in an upflow fixed bed bioreactor supplemented with 100 mg l of apap internally circulated through the bed it took 40 days to achieve 95 removal of apap for the first spike baratpour and moussavi 2018 a similar degree of apap removal was achieved in 26 days and 10 days by the second and third spike respectively suggesting community acclimation although increases in apap transformation rates by microbial community acclimation has been reported previously ecological mechanisms e g selection that could lead to the phenotypic adaptation have yet to be elucidated furthermore the apap transformation rates observed 5 6 6 1 d 1 in the apap enriched community greatly exceeded those 2 1 d 1 of biotic abiotic decays in natural surface water lin et al 2010 the higher apap transformation rates in the apap enriched community compared with that in natural and waste waters were likely due to the enrichment of apap degraders with higher apap metabolic capacity in the apap enriched community rather than the presence of factors inhibiting apap transformation in natural waste waters this hypothesis led us to further explore microbial community diversity and dynamics upon apap feeding over the operating period 3 2 microbial community selected for pseudomonas by reducing community diversity the apap degrading as community over the entire reactor operating period was subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing created 21 000 30 000 sequences after eliminating chimeric and taxonomically unclassified sequences fig 2 a shows shifts in the community structure upon apap feeding the original as communities as1 before apap feeding clustered closely whereas the apap fed communities diverged in structure from as1 in a time dependent manner while as5 was within the 95 confidence ellipse of as1 as9 and as17 were located well outside the 95 confidence ellipse highlighting significant shifts in community structure occurring during community acclimation to apap feeding the pairwise community similarity measured using the bray curtis distance metric was 0 56 0 01 as5 vs as1 0 42 0 01 as9 vs as1 and 0 22 0 01 as17 vs as1 alpha diversity indices were computed with the number of sequences rarefied to 21 000 the lowest number of sequences per sample using the mothur package table 1 the original community species richness index was 521 by chao1 decreasing to 394 as5 346 as9 and 276 as17 the shannon species diversity index of as1 was 4 36 decreasing significantly to 4 25 as5 3 79 as9 and 2 60 as17 following community acclimation other alpha diversity indices estimated by ace and inverse simpson were in good agreement with the chao1 and shannon indices respectively the significant reductions in species richness by 33 47 and diversity by 24 47 indices at cycles 9 17 were consistent with the significant shifts in community structure fig 2a the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis also revealed alterations in the community composition the analysis revealed nine major phyla 1 on average in the original and apap fed communities among which proteobacteria 77 3 and bacteroidetes 13 6 accounted for the major faction of as17 fig s3 it also identified 10 major families 2 on average across the communities fig s4 in which comamonadaceae 48 0 and pseudomonadaceae 8 5 were found to be significantly enriched in as17 fig 2b shows the top ten otus that primarily dominated as17 in relative abundance 1 of the total the correlation between the relative abundance of each otu fig 2b and the measured community apap transformation rate shown in fig 1a was assessed using pearson s correlation analysis revealing significantly high correlation r 0 96 with statistical significance p 0 04 between pseudomonas and the community apap transformation rate although there were other otus overrepresented in as17 compared to as1 only pseudomonas reached the statistical threshold with pearson s correlation an organism able to grow on solid agar and broth medium as used for bioreactor operation with apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source was isolated from the bioreactor the 16s rrna gene sequence of the organism was determined using sanger s sequencing method analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of the apap metabolizing isolate and the otu sequence otu 004 taxonomically assigned to pseudomonas as shown in fig 2b is provided in fig 3 sequences of six previously characterized fg 2 f2 p moorei kb4 and three p aeruginosa pseudomonas isolates capable of degrading apap and one sequence overrepresented in the 16s rrna gene dataset resulting from the apap exposed microbial community palma et al 2018 were included in the phylogenetic tree the analysis suggested that fg 2 and f2 were closely related to p putida and p entomophila with 98 sequence similarity the apap degrading isolate obtained in this study had 99 sequence similarity to otu 004 and uncultured clone otu 007 palma et al 2018 but it was not phylogenetically close 97 5 sequence similarity to other known apap degrading pseudomonas spp it is noteworthy that although otu 004 and otu 007 were from the korean this study and the portuguese wwtp palma et al 2018 respectively they were phylogenetically closely related these results suggested that the pseudomonas population may have great competitive fitness in metabolizing apap for their survival and maintenance in as communities significant alterations in terms of community structure diversity and composition occurred during the apap acclimation period apap transformation rates fig 1a and biomass yields fig 1b stabilized from cycle 9 onwards significantly differing from those at cycle 1 these phenotypic data agreed well with significant community distance dissimilarities between cycle 1 and cycles 9 17 fig 2a significant reduction in species richness and diversity from the original occurring during community acclimation could be largely attributed to the substrate provided apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source since the bioreactor was run with 14 days of srt the community members identified at cycles 9 17 were likely those capable of metabolizing apap and its metabolites for cell growth those incapable of metabolizing apap and its metabolites might have already been washed out for 8 cycles about two times the srt of note was that comamonadaceae represented the most abundant population in as17 sequence homology search analysis against the ncbi 16s ribosomal rna sequences database suggested that the population was evolutionarily related to acidovorax sp 97 16s rrna gene sequence similarity the dominance of the population in as17 highlighted the apap mediated competitive fitness of the population for survival multiplication although we obtained no isolates of the population the 16s rrna gene sequencing results suggest future investigation into the metabolic versatility of the population associated with apap and its metabolic byproducts although several taxonomically characterized isolates including bacillus delftia klebsiella pseudomonas rhodococcus and stenotrophomonas have been reported to have metabolic capabilities associated with apap zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 palma et al 2018 żur et al 2018 only pseudomonas in our study was significantly overrepresented in the as9 and as17 communities correlating with community apap transformation rates with statistical support p 0 05 although other organisms previously identified as apap degraders were found in both the original and apap degrading as communities they were rare 0 1 and not selected upon apap feeding this raises the question of why pseudomonas was highly enriched in complex microbial communities as in our and previous studies palma et al 2018 while the as communities indeed consisted of known apap degraders hence we further carried out phenotypic characterization for pco associated with cell growth apap inhibitory effects apap degradation characteristics and kinetics and apap metabolic products pathways 3 3 phenotypic characterization of pco associated with apap and its metabolites pco cell growth was characterized by measuring optical density at 600 nm od600 which was used to determine the apap concentration range for pco growth without substrate inhibitory effects pco could grow at 200 1 600 mg l of apap whereas its growth was severely inhibited at 3 200 mg l of apap specific growth rates with varying levels of apap were estimated using the modified gompertz model with the data from fig 4 a the specific growth rate increased at 400 mg l of apap maximum 0 99 d 1 after which it gradually decreased to 0 63 d 1 and 0 22 d 1 at 800 and 1 600 mg l of apap respectively the lag phase was 8 4 16 2 17 2 and 20 7 h at 200 400 800 and 1 600 mg l of apap respectively suggesting that the lag phase increased with an increase in the apap level the edward growth kinetics model is a modified derivative of the monod model that considers a substrate inhibition factor the half saturation constant ks and inhibition constant ki estimates computed using the edward model were 493 and 590 mg l respectively the inhibition constant ki measured for apap was comparable to the previous estimates 100 1 000 mg l for p aeruginosa hu et al 2013 and other pseudomonas spp f1 f2 and fg 2 zhang et al 2013 metabolic characteristics of pco with apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source were investigated fig 5 a shows time course biochemical data including apap doc od600 and ph over 72 h significant growth coupled with consumption of apap and doc strongly indicated that pco possessed the capability to metabolize apap about 90 of the initial doc disappeared for 72 h with significant cell growth suggesting that the majority of apap was mineralized and or used for cell biosynthesis there was a substantial drop in ph and a large fraction of doc remaining at 20 h when the majority of apap was transformed we thus hypothesized that a significant portion of apap disappearance observed at 20 h might represent transformation to other metabolic byproducts rather than mineralization at the time some of which might be acidic intermediates as inferred from the ph decrease hence we established experimental protocols using the hplc system for measuring major apap byproducts frequently detected in biotic abiotic conditions namely 4 ap hq and bq fig 5b illustrates time course concentrations of apap and its metabolic byproducts apap rapidly decreased from 6 to 35 h during which time 4 ap increased significantly while 4 ap reached its maximum at 28 44 h and further decreased at 44 98 h the hq concentration gradually increased 6 90 h and reached its maximum at 90 98 h the serial appearance of these metabolic byproducts potentially indicated the apap transformation pathway next we assessed the degradation characteristics and kinetics of apap and its metabolic byproducts at varying levels although bq was not observed over the detection limit in the apap supplemented pco culture it was included in these experiments since it is often detected as a major biological metabolite in other organisms and natural decay products in aquatic and other environments zhou et al 2019 liang et al 2016 the abiotic condition was established in batch flasks with apap without pco inoculation the inactive condition was with apap and pco inactivated using pre autoclaving abiotic removals represented those removed via physicochemical routes such as photolysis hydrolysis and volatilization while those in the inactive setting included physicochemical routes plus sorption to autoclaved cells the active condition with the pco inoculum was designed to represent parameters including physicochemical biosorption and biodegradation by the cells while apap in the biotic setting decreased from 0 4 to 400 mg l to the detection limit 0 01 mg l between 60 and 144 h those in both abiotic and inactive settings were stable over time suggesting that the removal of apap was solely due to biological breakdown 4 ap hq and bq in both the abiotic and inactive settings gradually decreased with similar degradation rates these results suggested physicochemical routes to some extent accounted for the overall removals observed nevertheless degradation rates of 4 ap at 40 mg l hq at 0 4 400 mg l and bq at 0 4 40 mg l were clearly faster than those observed in the abiotic and inactive settings these data suggested biodegradation by pco could account for all or at least a proportion of the overall removal of 4 ap hq and bq respectively degradation rates generally decreased i e faster removals with increased substrate concentration at least four apap biodegradation pathways have been documented initial conversion to p acetanisidine by methylation 4 aminophenol with aryl acylamidase 3 hydroxyacteminophen by hydroxylation or catechol zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 each of the initial transformation products undergoes a different biotransformation pathway all of which are eventually subjected to the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 our biochemical assay data strongly suggested that pco cleaved apap into 4 ap detected by hplc analysis and acetate the latter of which was not directly detected in this study but could be inferred from the rapid ph drop co occurring with the formation of 4 ap the ph began to return to the original state after 20 h likely resulting from further consumption metabolism of the tentatively formed acidic intermediates hq can be formed directly from apap or via 4 ap as an intermediate de gusseme et al 2011 wu et al 2012 żur et al 2018 hu et al 2013 hq was detected in the pco culture when supplemented with 4 ap fig 6 b as the sole carbon source and 4 ap was not detected with hq fig 6c these data indicate that pco took the hq pathway to the tca cycle via 4 ap as the first intermediate several microbial agents have been previously identified as having apap metabolic capabilities zhang et al 2013 however none of those studies quantitatively assessed the degradation kinetics of varying levels of transformation byproducts directly formed from the parent apap compound up to 60 of apap consumed by humans can be excreted with urine in its original form apap and or its metabolites park et al 2015 to be released into urban wastewater treatment systems through municipal and hospital wastewater disposal the parent transformed apap products are further subjected to various types of biotic and abiotic e g photolysis and hydrolysis breakdown in the environment bq 4 ap and hq are among the major biotransformation products of apap zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 and are frequently detected in natural surface water and soil environments zhou et al 2019 liang et al 2016 while monitoring campaigns have primarily focused on the parent apap compound in aquatic environments little effort has been made in determining the occurrence and fate of apap transformation products however the transformation products may be more toxic than the parent compound for example while the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of apap to staphylococcus is 1 25 g l 8 27 mm those of 4 ap hq and bq are 0 054 g l 0 49 mm 0 01 0 3 g l 0 09 2 72 mm and 0 03 0 07 g l 0 28 0 65 mm respectively zimmermann and curtis 2017 razafintsalama et al 2013 rua et al 2011 lana et al 2006 these data strongly suggested that 4 ap hq and bq are tens of times more toxic i e 3 91 times based on the previous mic values measured based on the transformation ratio of apap to 4 ap 0 64 by m m and hq 0 21 by m m as the maximum observed in the pco culture fig 5 and previously reported toxicity thresholds the transformation products of apap may cause more profound environmental and human health risks than the parent compound a previous study reported that a pseudomonas isolate f1 converted less than 20 of apap into 4 ap and hq after which the metabolites did not undergo further transformation zhang et al 2013 these data suggested that the transformed products presumably may cause toxicity to the apap degrading organism and that not all apap degraders are capable of degrading both the parent apap and its metabolic byproducts thus the results of our degradation characteristics and kinetics experiments imply a potential role of pco on detoxification of both apap and its toxic transformation byproducts 3 4 bioaugmentation potential for apap cleanup using pco identification of a robust organism capable of removing a priority pollutant such as apap is of great practical importance since it would help predict the fate of the pollutant in environments where that organism is present and enable development of biological cleanup technologies such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation although several studies have reported apap metabolizing organisms it remains to be experimentally validated whether introducing an apap metabolizing organism into apap contaminated environments does indeed help control the fate of apap since the amount of seed inoculum is one of the major factors affecting bioaugmentation performance raper et al 2018 varying levels of pco were added to raw as samples freshly obtained from the local wwtp the same unit process as used for inoculating the bioreactor the total biomass was adjusted to a total of 1 g vss l where pco0 pco0 05 pco0 25 and pco0 5 represented 0 0 05 0 25 and 0 5 g vss l of pco inoculated respectively and raw as accounted for the others the first order rate constant was estimated for assessing the degradation rate fig 7 which showed an increase in degradation rates with an increase in pco inoculation sizes pearson s r 0 99 with p 0 05 the apap level shown in fig 7 was selected based on environmental concentrations detectable in natural and engineered aquatic environments levels of apap occurring in waste associated environments ng l to μg l are typically higher than those in natural surface water and groundwater the environmental maxima of apap levels detected in waste streams are 180 218 μg l in wastewater and 333 μg l in landfill leachate vymazal et al 2017 yu et al 2013 masoner et al 2014 which is comparable to 400 μg l tested in this study fig 7 the half life periods of the bioaugmented settings estimated from first order constants were 0 20 0 58 days much shorter than the 1 1 2 3 days for natural decays through photolysis biodegradation and or sorption lin et al 2010 the data observed in this work supported the potential benefits of pco bioaugmentation for apap bioremediation which outperformed conventional as and natural purification since it can detoxify apap up to 590 mg l without inhibition figs 4 and 6 pco represents a potentially useful microbial agent for detoxifying apap at varying levels from micrograms to milligrams per liter within the environment further our study quantified the capability of pco for metabolizing apap 1 7 days of half life at 0 4 40 mg l based on the transformation rate obtained using the modified gompertz model and 4 ap 0 02 days of half life at 40 mg l these values were much less than those 2 days of half life of p aeruginosa at 10 mg l of apap rhodococcus sp at 800 mg l of apap and p sp st 4 at 50 100 ppm of 4 ap about 55 110 mg l de gusseme et al 2011 khan et al 2006 ivshina et al 2006 the faster substrate utilization rates likely conferred pco with competitive fitness i e selective enrichment in the apap fed community where pco could outcompete other organisms for cell growth which was reflected by the microbial community dynamics results fig 2 and figs s2 and s3 our study provided new insights into a key species population playing a significant role in detoxifying apap in the context of complex as communities with hundreds to thousands of different species and elucidated how and to what extent the population detoxified apap from a practical perspective our results shed light on the potential for using pco as robust bioaugmentation seed inocula this study thus suggests potential future works on pco bioaugmentation in apap contaminated sites in pilot full scale systems where the effects of various other factors e g interactions with other biotic abiotic settings in addition to the inoculum density tested in this study on remediation performance can be further investigated and optimized further pco represents an organism phylogenetically distinguished from other pseudomonas e g p putida and p entomophila whose genome sequences are available accordingly future phylogenomic investigations into pco would help identify genomic evolutionary relatedness among the pseudomonas genus and genetic elements regulatory networks involved in metabolizing apap metabolic byproducts the latter of which will help us to better infer its role in controlling apap mediated toxicity in the environment 4 conclusions as increased apap transformation 0 7 d 1 to 6 1 d 1 by about eight times for one month of acclimation as selected for pseudomonas sp pco that was phylogenetically distinct from other apap degrading pseudomonas previously characterized pco could degrade apap 4 ap hq and bq at environmentally relevant levels 0 4 400 mg

was established by feeding 100 mg l of apap as a sole carbon nitrogen and energy source while the bioreactor increased apap biotransformation rates significantly 0 7 d 1 to 6 1 d 1 over a month of

hydroxyacetaminophen and catechol as an initial intermediate zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 palma et al 2018 żur et al 2018 many of these works relied on isolate based studies rather than studies of microbial communities i e living units of microorganisms found in almost all biological waste treatment systems including as a previous study showed the diversity of bacterial classes affected by apap exposure palma et al 2018 given that a bacterial class can comprise a number of species with highly variable metabolic capabilities the specific species among numerous members belonging to each class with their respective metabolic capabilities that are responsive to apap exposure remain to be determined another study suggested that several genera flavobacterium dokdonella methylophilus and pseudomonas are increased in the presence of apap zhou et al 2019 however further experimental phenotypic characterization is necessary to determine whether these genera indeed participate in apap degradation and if so how these taxa contribute to the community apap degradation hence there are research questions with practical implications for advancing the current understanding of microbial apap detoxification how do as microbial communities with higher apap metabolic capability differ from typical as communities in terms of structure and diversity do the previously reported apap degrading isolates indeed play a role in as microbial communities and if so which specific organisms in the context of as communities play a major role in apap metabolism and how despite several bacterial members being capable of metabolizing apap would introducing those microbial agents into apap contaminated waste streams help remove apap the present work aimed to quantitatively address these questions laboratory bioreactors were established by inoculating an as microbial community taken from an aeration tank at a local municipal wwtp as phenotypes associated with apap remediation were monitored while the as communities acclimatized to apap as the substrate high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis were performed to list organisms potentially involved in apap removal occurring in the bioreactor we successfully isolated a species population significantly enriched in the apap degrading community various biochemical assays were carried out to quantitatively estimate the key population s cell growth apap metabolic intermediates and pathway and apap biodegradation kinetics in addition this work attempted to experimentally validate whether the key population represents a potential auxiliary bioaugmentation seed inoculum that can enhance the environmental cleanup of apap in waste streams the results of this study have practical implications for effectively managing wastewater contaminated with pharmaceuticals and for further developing biological methods such as bioaugmentation for reducing apap contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation the as inoculum was taken from an aerobic tank at a local wastewater treatment plant located at suwon si south korea an as bioreactor 1 l of working volume was established by inoculating the as inoculum 3 g l of volatile suspended solids vss as in the bioreactor the bioreactor was fed with 100 mg l of apap as a sole carbon nitrogen and energy source in addition to apap the synthetic feed consisted of per liter 0 05g cacl2 0 09 g kh2po4 0 67 g k2hpo4 0 27g mgso4 7h2o and 2 mg cocl2 6h2o 0 07 mg cucl2 2h2o 2 1 mg h3bo3 0 21 mg mnso4 h2o 0 21 mg namoo4 2h2o 0 14 mg niso4 6h2o and 0 35 mg znso4 7h2o as previously described choi and oh 2019 the bioreactor was operated in sequential batch mode 10 min of filling reaction and 20 min of decanting a feeding cycle lasted 3 5 days most of which time was taken up by the reaction period kim et al 2020 one fourth of the mixed culture suspension was replaced with the synthetic apap feed every 3 5 days resulting in 14 days of solid retention time srt comparable to 10 30 days in full scale sequencing batch reactors 2 2 apap transformation characteristics kinetics and metabolic intermediates transformation rates were calculated using the first order rate constant equation 1 1 k 1 ln c t c 0 t where k1 is the first order rate constant c t and c 0 represent the time dependent apap concentration and initial concentration respectively and t is the time interval transformation rates for apap and its metabolic intermediates by an apap degrading isolate were assessed using a fully grown isolate culture with 100 mg l of apap this apap concentration was selected because microbial growth for 1 2 days at 100 200 mg l was higher than those at other levels the fully grown cells were centrifuged and washed twice using 1 phosphate buffered saline prior to inoculation kim et al 2019 bacterial cell growth was monitored using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 600 nm optical density cell growth of the apap degrading isolate was characterized using the modified gompertz model the edward growth kinetic model edwards 1970 was used to describe the substrate inhibitory effect of apap 2 3 microbial community analysis three samples from the as inoculum as1 were collected at the beginning before reaction of feeding cycle 1 biomass samples as5 as9 and as17 from the bioreactor were collected at the end of feeding cycles 5 9 and 17 respectively genomic dna was extracted from each sample using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were measured using nanodrop nano 400 hangzhou allsheng instruments co hangzhou china all dna samples exhibited 1 μg dna μl and 1 8 of a260 a280 the genomic dna samples were amplified via polymerase chain reaction targeting the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes the 16s rrna gene amplicon was sequenced by the miseq sequencer macrogen inc south korea paired end 16s rrna gene sequences generated from the miseq sequencer were analyzed following the miseq sop pipeline kozich et al 2013 as described previously vidanage et al 2020 briefly raw sequences were filtered with all parameters other than the following set to default maximum homopolymer length 8 minimum homopolymer length 200 maxambig 0 chimeric sequences were excluded using the chimera vsearch command sequences assigned to chloroplasts mitochondria archaea eukaryotes and unknown were then discarded using classify seqs the remaining sequence data were clustered for grouping operational taxonomic units otus at 97 nucleotide identity cutoff alpha diversity indices were estimated with rarefaction single using microbial community composition data at otu level 2 4

seoul south korea concentrations of apap 4 ap hq and bq were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system yl9100 young lin instrument co south korea equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 μm agilent usa and a uv vis detector the mobile phase solution was composed of 1 acetic acid and methanol mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v the sample flow rate and injection volume were 1 ml min and 100 μl respectively detection wavelengths for apap 4 ap hq and bq were 249 nm 290 nm 288 nm and 249 nm respectively detection limits for apap 4 ap hq and bq were 10 1 000 50 and 10 μg l respectively vss and dissolved oxygen carbon doc were measured following standard method federation and association 2005 2 5 nucleotide sequence accession number the 16s rrna gene sequence datasets used in this study were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers as1 1 srr11207236 as1 2 srr11207225 as1 3 srr11207194 as5 srr11207185 as9 srr11207184 and as17 srr11207183 3 results and discussion 3 1 as community acclimation enhanced apap biodegradation fig 1a displays apap concentration profiles in the as bioreactor fed with apap at representative feeding cycles over two months at cycle 1 apap was removed roughly linearly with 0 7 d 1 of the first order rate constant 99 removal achieved within 72 h while acclimating to apap the as bioreactor showed significantly increased apap transformation rates of 3 1 d 1 and 6 1 d 1 at cycle 5 and 9 respectively the apap transformation rate at cycle 17 was 5 6 d 1 comparable to that at cycle 9 suggesting that the phenotypic acclimation of the as to apap occurred within a month mixed liquor vss was observed for two months the vss concentration gradually decreased from 1 g l to 0 31 g l at cycle 9 leveling off at cycles 9 17 considering that there were no microbial inputs in the influents the biomass leaving the bioreactor should be equal to that synthesized in the bioreactor resulting in 0 02 g vsssynthesized l d and 2 95 g vsssynthesized g apapconsumed fig s1 the stable vss concentration and apap transformation rates observed over cycles 9 17 collectively suggest that the apap degrading bioreactor reached a quasi steady state within a month about twice the duration of srt the as biomass was taken from the bioreactor at cycle 17 and was inoculated into separate glass flasks under experimental conditions e g vss aeration and ph identical to those of the bioreactor the as inoculated glass flasks at lower levels of apap 0 1 and 1 mg l showed apap transformation rates comparable to those at 100 mg l fig s2 suggesting that the apap enriched as would also represent a robust microbial consortium at environmentally relevant levels of apap up to a few hundred micrograms per liter the microbial community acclimation occurring over a month significantly accelerated apap transformation rates by about eight times fig 1 a the maximum apap transformation rates 5 6 6 1 d 1 observed at cycles 9 17 were much higher than those of mixed cultures of natural water 0 07 0 34 d 1 and wastewater 0 1 d 1 karaman et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 similar phenotypic patterns associated with increases in apap transformation rates following acclimation have been observed in other biological engineering systems a membrane bioreactor with 5 days of hydraulic retention time increased its apap removal from 85 to 99 for 15 days de gusseme et al 2011 in an upflow fixed bed bioreactor supplemented with 100 mg l of apap internally circulated through the bed it took 40 days to achieve 95 removal of apap for the first spike baratpour and moussavi 2018 a similar degree of apap removal was achieved in 26 days and 10 days by the second and third spike respectively suggesting community acclimation although increases in apap transformation rates by microbial community acclimation has been reported previously ecological mechanisms e g selection that could lead to the phenotypic adaptation have yet to be elucidated furthermore the apap transformation rates observed 5 6 6 1 d 1 in the apap enriched community greatly exceeded those 2 1 d 1 of biotic abiotic decays in natural surface water lin et al 2010 the higher apap transformation rates in the apap enriched community compared with that in natural and waste waters were likely due to the enrichment of apap degraders with higher apap metabolic capacity in the apap enriched community rather than the presence of factors inhibiting apap transformation in natural waste waters this hypothesis led us to further explore microbial community diversity and dynamics upon apap feeding over the operating period 3 2 microbial community selected for pseudomonas by reducing community diversity the apap degrading as community over the entire reactor operating period was subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing created 21 000 30 000 sequences after eliminating chimeric and taxonomically unclassified sequences fig 2 a shows shifts in the community structure upon apap feeding the original as communities as1 before apap feeding clustered closely whereas the apap fed communities diverged in structure from as1 in a time dependent manner while as5 was within the 95 confidence ellipse of as1 as9 and as17 were located well outside the 95 confidence ellipse highlighting significant shifts in community structure occurring during community acclimation to apap feeding the pairwise community similarity measured using the bray curtis distance metric was 0 56 0 01 as5 vs as1 0 42 0 01 as9 vs as1 and 0 22 0 01 as17 vs as1 alpha diversity indices were computed with the number of sequences rarefied to 21 000 the lowest number of sequences per sample using the mothur package table 1 the original community species richness index was 521 by chao1 decreasing to 394 as5 346 as9 and 276 as17 the shannon species diversity index of as1 was 4 36 decreasing significantly to 4 25 as5 3 79 as9 and 2 60 as17 following community acclimation other alpha diversity indices estimated by ace and inverse simpson were in good agreement with the chao1 and shannon indices respectively the significant reductions in species richness by 33 47 and diversity by 24 47 indices at cycles 9 17 were consistent with the significant shifts in community structure fig 2a the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis also revealed alterations in the community composition the analysis revealed nine major phyla 1 on average in the original and apap fed communities among which proteobacteria 77 3 and bacteroidetes 13 6 accounted for the major faction of as17 fig s3 it also identified 10 major families 2 on average across the communities fig s4 in which comamonadaceae 48 0 and pseudomonadaceae 8 5 were found to be significantly enriched in as17 fig 2b shows the top ten otus that primarily dominated as17 in relative abundance 1 of the total the correlation between the relative abundance of each otu fig 2b and the measured community apap transformation rate shown in fig 1a was assessed using pearson s correlation analysis revealing significantly high correlation r 0 96 with statistical significance p 0 04 between pseudomonas and the community apap transformation rate although there were other otus overrepresented in as17 compared to as1 only pseudomonas reached the statistical threshold with pearson s correlation an organism able to grow on solid agar and broth medium as used for bioreactor operation with apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source was isolated from the bioreactor the 16s rrna gene sequence of the organism was determined using sanger s sequencing method analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of the apap metabolizing isolate and the otu sequence otu 004 taxonomically assigned to pseudomonas as shown in fig 2b is provided in fig 3 sequences of six previously characterized fg 2 f2 p moorei kb4 and three p aeruginosa pseudomonas isolates capable of degrading apap and one sequence overrepresented in the 16s rrna gene dataset resulting from the apap exposed microbial community palma et al 2018 were included in the phylogenetic tree the analysis suggested that fg 2 and f2 were closely related to p putida and p entomophila with 98 sequence similarity the apap degrading isolate obtained in this study had 99 sequence similarity to otu 004 and uncultured clone otu 007 palma et al 2018 but it was not phylogenetically close 97 5 sequence similarity to other known apap degrading pseudomonas spp it is noteworthy that although otu 004 and otu 007 were from the korean this study and the portuguese wwtp palma et al 2018 respectively they were phylogenetically closely related these results suggested that the pseudomonas population may have great competitive fitness in metabolizing apap for their survival and maintenance in as communities significant alterations in terms of community structure diversity and composition occurred during the apap acclimation period apap transformation rates fig 1a and biomass yields fig 1b stabilized from cycle 9 onwards significantly differing from those at cycle 1 these phenotypic data agreed well with significant community distance dissimilarities between cycle 1 and cycles 9 17 fig 2a significant reduction in species richness and diversity from the original occurring during community acclimation could be largely attributed to the substrate provided apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source since the bioreactor was run with 14 days of srt the community members identified at cycles 9 17 were likely those capable of metabolizing apap and its metabolites for cell growth those incapable of metabolizing apap and its metabolites might have already been washed out for 8 cycles about two times the srt of note was that comamonadaceae represented the most abundant population in as17 sequence homology search analysis against the ncbi 16s ribosomal rna sequences database suggested that the population was evolutionarily related to acidovorax sp 97 16s rrna gene sequence similarity the dominance of the population in as17 highlighted the apap mediated competitive fitness of the population for survival multiplication although we obtained no isolates of the population the 16s rrna gene sequencing results suggest future investigation into the metabolic versatility of the population associated with apap and its metabolic byproducts although several taxonomically characterized isolates including bacillus delftia klebsiella pseudomonas rhodococcus and stenotrophomonas have been reported to have metabolic capabilities associated with apap zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 palma et al 2018 żur et al 2018 only pseudomonas in our study was significantly overrepresented in the as9 and as17 communities correlating with community apap transformation rates with statistical support p 0 05 although other organisms previously identified as apap degraders were found in both the original and apap degrading as communities they were rare 0 1 and not selected upon apap feeding this raises the question of why pseudomonas was highly enriched in complex microbial communities as in our and previous studies palma et al 2018 while the as communities indeed consisted of known apap degraders hence we further carried out phenotypic characterization for pco associated with cell growth apap inhibitory effects apap degradation characteristics and kinetics and apap metabolic products pathways 3 3 phenotypic characterization of pco associated with apap and its metabolites pco cell growth was characterized by measuring optical density at 600 nm od600 which was used to determine the apap concentration range for pco growth without substrate inhibitory effects pco could grow at 200 1 600 mg l of apap whereas its growth was severely inhibited at 3 200 mg l of apap specific growth rates with varying levels of apap were estimated using the modified gompertz model with the data from fig 4 a the specific growth rate increased at 400 mg l of apap maximum 0 99 d 1 after which it gradually decreased to 0 63 d 1 and 0 22 d 1 at 800 and 1 600 mg l of apap respectively the lag phase was 8 4 16 2 17 2 and 20 7 h at 200 400 800 and 1 600 mg l of apap respectively suggesting that the lag phase increased with an increase in the apap level the edward growth kinetics model is a modified derivative of the monod model that considers a substrate inhibition factor the half saturation constant ks and inhibition constant ki estimates computed using the edward model were 493 and 590 mg l respectively the inhibition constant ki measured for apap was comparable to the previous estimates 100 1 000 mg l for p aeruginosa hu et al 2013 and other pseudomonas spp f1 f2 and fg 2 zhang et al 2013 metabolic characteristics of pco with apap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source were investigated fig 5 a shows time course biochemical data including apap doc od600 and ph over 72 h significant growth coupled with consumption of apap and doc strongly indicated that pco possessed the capability to metabolize apap about 90 of the initial doc disappeared for 72 h with significant cell growth suggesting that the majority of apap was mineralized and or used for cell biosynthesis there was a substantial drop in ph and a large fraction of doc remaining at 20 h when the majority of apap was transformed we thus hypothesized that a significant portion of apap disappearance observed at 20 h might represent transformation to other metabolic byproducts rather than mineralization at the time some of which might be acidic intermediates as inferred from the ph decrease hence we established experimental protocols using the hplc system for measuring major apap byproducts frequently detected in biotic abiotic conditions namely 4 ap hq and bq fig 5b illustrates time course concentrations of apap and its metabolic byproducts apap rapidly decreased from 6 to 35 h during which time 4 ap increased significantly while 4 ap reached its maximum at 28 44 h and further decreased at 44 98 h the hq concentration gradually increased 6 90 h and reached its maximum at 90 98 h the serial appearance of these metabolic byproducts potentially indicated the apap transformation pathway next we assessed the degradation characteristics and kinetics of apap and its metabolic byproducts at varying levels although bq was not observed over the detection limit in the apap supplemented pco culture it was included in these experiments since it is often detected as a major biological metabolite in other organisms and natural decay products in aquatic and other environments zhou et al 2019 liang et al 2016 the abiotic condition was established in batch flasks with apap without pco inoculation the inactive condition was with apap and pco inactivated using pre autoclaving abiotic removals represented those removed via physicochemical routes such as photolysis hydrolysis and volatilization while those in the inactive setting included physicochemical routes plus sorption to autoclaved cells the active condition with the pco inoculum was designed to represent parameters including physicochemical biosorption and biodegradation by the cells while apap in the biotic setting decreased from 0 4 to 400 mg l to the detection limit 0 01 mg l between 60 and 144 h those in both abiotic and inactive settings were stable over time suggesting that the removal of apap was solely due to biological breakdown 4 ap hq and bq in both the abiotic and inactive settings gradually decreased with similar degradation rates these results suggested physicochemical routes to some extent accounted for the overall removals observed nevertheless degradation rates of 4 ap at 40 mg l hq at 0 4 400 mg l and bq at 0 4 40 mg l were clearly faster than those observed in the abiotic and inactive settings these data suggested biodegradation by pco could account for all or at least a proportion of the overall removal of 4 ap hq and bq respectively degradation rates generally decreased i e faster removals with increased substrate concentration at least four apap biodegradation pathways have been documented initial conversion to p acetanisidine by methylation 4 aminophenol with aryl acylamidase 3 hydroxyacteminophen by hydroxylation or catechol zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 each of the initial transformation products undergoes a different biotransformation pathway all of which are eventually subjected to the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 our biochemical assay data strongly suggested that pco cleaved apap into 4 ap detected by hplc analysis and acetate the latter of which was not directly detected in this study but could be inferred from the rapid ph drop co occurring with the formation of 4 ap the ph began to return to the original state after 20 h likely resulting from further consumption metabolism of the tentatively formed acidic intermediates hq can be formed directly from apap or via 4 ap as an intermediate de gusseme et al 2011 wu et al 2012 żur et al 2018 hu et al 2013 hq was detected in the pco culture when supplemented with 4 ap fig 6 b as the sole carbon source and 4 ap was not detected with hq fig 6c these data indicate that pco took the hq pathway to the tca cycle via 4 ap as the first intermediate several microbial agents have been previously identified as having apap metabolic capabilities zhang et al 2013 however none of those studies quantitatively assessed the degradation kinetics of varying levels of transformation byproducts directly formed from the parent apap compound up to 60 of apap consumed by humans can be excreted with urine in its original form apap and or its metabolites park et al 2015 to be released into urban wastewater treatment systems through municipal and hospital wastewater disposal the parent transformed apap products are further subjected to various types of biotic and abiotic e g photolysis and hydrolysis breakdown in the environment bq 4 ap and hq are among the major biotransformation products of apap zur et al 2018 wu et al 2012 and are frequently detected in natural surface water and soil environments zhou et al 2019 liang et al 2016 while monitoring campaigns have primarily focused on the parent apap compound in aquatic environments little effort has been made in determining the occurrence and fate of apap transformation products however the transformation products may be more toxic than the parent compound for example while the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of apap to staphylococcus is 1 25 g l 8 27 mm those of 4 ap hq and bq are 0 054 g l 0 49 mm 0 01 0 3 g l 0 09 2 72 mm and 0 03 0 07 g l 0 28 0 65 mm respectively zimmermann and curtis 2017 razafintsalama et al 2013 rua et al 2011 lana et al 2006 these data strongly suggested that 4 ap hq and bq are tens of times more toxic i e 3 91 times based on the previous mic values measured based on the transformation ratio of apap to 4 ap 0 64 by m m and hq 0 21 by m m as the maximum observed in the pco culture fig 5 and previously reported toxicity thresholds the transformation products of apap may cause more profound environmental and human health risks than the parent compound a previous study reported that a pseudomonas isolate f1 converted less than 20 of apap into 4 ap and hq after which the metabolites did not undergo further transformation zhang et al 2013 these data suggested that the transformed products presumably may cause toxicity to the apap degrading organism and that not all apap degraders are capable of degrading both the parent apap and its metabolic byproducts thus the results of our degradation characteristics and kinetics experiments imply a potential role of pco on detoxification of both apap and its toxic transformation byproducts 3 4 bioaugmentation potential for apap cleanup using pco identification of a robust organism capable of removing a priority pollutant such as apap is of great practical importance since it would help predict the fate of the pollutant in environments where that organism is present and enable development of biological cleanup technologies such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation although several studies have reported apap metabolizing organisms it remains to be experimentally validated whether introducing an apap metabolizing organism into apap contaminated environments does indeed help control the fate of apap since the amount of seed inoculum is one of the major factors affecting bioaugmentation performance raper et al 2018 varying levels of pco were added to raw as samples freshly obtained from the local wwtp the same unit process as used for inoculating the bioreactor the total biomass was adjusted to a total of 1 g vss l where pco0 pco0 05 pco0 25 and pco0 5 represented 0 0 05 0 25 and 0 5 g vss l of pco inoculated respectively and raw as accounted for the others the first order rate constant was estimated for assessing the degradation rate fig 7 which showed an increase in degradation rates with an increase in pco inoculation sizes pearson s r 0 99 with p 0 05 the apap level shown in fig 7 was selected based on environmental concentrations detectable in natural and engineered aquatic environments levels of apap occurring in waste associated environments ng l to μg l are typically higher than those in natural surface water and groundwater the environmental maxima of apap levels detected in waste streams are 180 218 μg l in wastewater and 333 μg l in landfill leachate vymazal et al 2017 yu et al 2013 masoner et al 2014 which is comparable to 400 μg l tested in this study fig 7 the half life periods of the bioaugmented settings estimated from first order constants were 0 20 0 58 days much shorter than the 1 1 2 3 days for natural decays through photolysis biodegradation and or sorption lin et al 2010 the data observed in this work supported the potential benefits of pco bioaugmentation for apap bioremediation which outperformed conventional as and natural purification since it can detoxify apap up to 590 mg l without inhibition figs 4 and 6 pco represents a potentially useful microbial agent for detoxifying apap at varying levels from micrograms to milligrams per liter within the environment further our study quantified the capability of pco for metabolizing apap 1 7 days of half life at 0 4 40 mg l based on the transformation rate obtained using the modified gompertz model and 4 ap 0 02 days of half life at 40 mg l these values were much less than those 2 days of half life of p aeruginosa at 10 mg l of apap rhodococcus sp at 800 mg l of apap and p sp st 4 at 50 100 ppm of 4 ap about 55 110 mg l de gusseme et al 2011 khan et al 2006 ivshina et al 2006 the faster substrate utilization rates likely conferred pco with competitive fitness i e selective enrichment in the apap fed community where pco could outcompete other organisms for cell growth which was reflected by the microbial community dynamics results fig 2 and figs s2 and s3 our study provided new insights into a key species population playing a significant role in detoxifying apap in the context of complex as communities with hundreds to thousands of different species and elucidated how and to what extent the population detoxified apap from a practical perspective our results shed light on the potential for using pco as robust bioaugmentation seed inocula this study thus suggests potential future works on pco bioaugmentation in apap contaminated sites in pilot full scale systems where the effects of various other factors e g interactions with other biotic abiotic settings in addition to the inoculum density tested in this study on remediation performance can be further investigated and optimized further pco represents an organism phylogenetically distinguished from other pseudomonas e g p putida and p entomophila whose genome sequences are available accordingly future phylogenomic investigations into pco would help identify genomic evolutionary relatedness among the pseudomonas genus and genetic elements regulatory networks involved in metabolizing apap metabolic byproducts the latter of which will help us to better infer its role in controlling apap mediated toxicity in the environment 4 conclusions as increased apap transformation 0 7 d 1 to 6 1 d 1 by about eight times for one month of acclimation as selected for pseudomonas sp pco that was phylogenetically distinct from other apap degrading pseudomonas previously characterized pco could degrade apap 4 ap hq and bq at environmentally relevant levels 0 4 400 mg
