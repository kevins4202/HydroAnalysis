15000,the removal of dissolved and particulate iron fe from contaminated mine drainage is an omnipresent challenge in and legacy of the mining industry worldwide the sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands for passive fe removal from circumneutral ferruginous mine water is based either on a linear concentration independent area adjusted removal rate or flat assignment of an experience based retention time neither of which reflects the underlying fe removal kinetics in this study we evaluated the fe removal performance of a pilot scale passive system operating in three identical parallel lines for treatment of mining influenced ferruginous seepage water to determine and parameterise a robust application orientated model approach for sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands each by systematically varying flow rates and thus residence time we were able to demonstrate that the sedimentation driven removal of particulate hydrous ferric oxides in settling ponds may be approximated by a simplified first order approach at low to moderate fe levels the first order coefficient was found in the order of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 which corresponds well with previous laboratory studies the sedimentation kinetics may be combined with the preceding fe ii oxidation kinetics to estimate the required residence time for pre treatment of ferruginous mine water in settling ponds in contrast fe removal in surface flow wetlands is more complex due to the phytologic component which is why we advanced the established area adjusted fe removal approach by parameterising the underlying concentration dependency for polishing of pre treated mine water the quantitative results of this study provide a novel conservative approach for customised sizing of

introduction industrial scale coal lignite and metal mining are commonly associated with the generation of contaminated mine drainage that requires treatment to protect receiving freshwater environments mine water treatment is increasingly facilitated in eco technological passive systems that harness and enhance natural biogeochemical and physical processes for removal of various contaminants skousen et al 2017 passive systems are often regarded as a more sustainable and cost effective approach for mine water treatment especially for circumneutral ferruginous mine waters that predominantly require the removal of iron fe as ubiquitous contaminant in mining environments hedin 2008 passive fe removal is commonly achieved in surface flow systems through oxidation of dissolved fe ii and subsequent sedimentation or filtration of the resultant particulate hydrous ferric oxides hereinafter fe oh 3 hedin et al 1994 skousen et al 2017 aerobic passive systems for iron removal commonly consist of consecutive aeration cascades for oxygenation settling ponds for pre treatment and surface flow wetlands for polishing hedin et al 1994 basically settling ponds provide retention time for oxidation of fe ii and sedimentation of the bulk fe oh 3 load whereas subsequent wetlands facilitate sedimentation or filtration of the remaining colloidal fe oh 3 in the dense vegetation to reliably meet specific discharge limits opitz et al 2021 the assembly of consecutive treatment stages in integrated systems for treatment of circumneutral ferruginous mine water is rather vaguely defined in the literature broadly aiming at 50 to 80 fe removal in settling ponds depending on fe loading to protect the subsequent wetlands from overloading kruse et al 2009 parker 2003 this latent ambiguity is attributable to the underlying sizing practice for both settling ponds and wetlands that is largely based on concentration independent rules of thumb which are ill defined for more customised designing and sizing of integrated passive systems banks 2003 sapsford 2013 only few approaches for sizing of settling ponds are to be found in the literature as compiled in tab s1a none of which became standard practice to date kruse et al 2009 early recommendations were derived from the wastewater sector for instance assigning an overflow rate of 1 10 5 m s to broadly allow for settling of clay sized particles national coal board 1982 however mine discharges often require additional retention time to allow for fe ii oxidation and it was also found that the aggregation and sedimentation behaviour of freshly precipitated fe oh 3 distinctly differs from soil or sewage particles hove et al 2008 sapsford 2013 commonest in the literature is the experience based assignment of either a flat hydraulic retention time hrt in the order of 8 to 48 h or a hydraulic loading rate in the order of 100 m² l s to broadly allow for both fe ii oxidation and settling of larger particles tab s1b overall banks 2003 noted that performance evaluation of settling ponds is rather scarce relative to wetlands which is why wetland sizing is at times transferred to settling ponds various sizing approaches for surface flow wetlands were developed for treatment of acidic and neutral mine water most of which are based on empirical area adjusted fe removal rates as compiled in tab s1b eventually a recommendation for areal sizing of wetlands was issued by the former us bureau of mines hedin et al 1994 that was henceforth adopted in various guidelines e g piramid consortium 2003 skousen et al 1998 watzlaf et al 2004 the wetland area a is calculated from fe loading and an empirical area adjusted sizing constant ra 1 a q f e i n f e o u t r a with q as volumetric flow rate and fe in and fe out as inflow and target effluent fe concentration respectively this approach suggests that fe removal rates in wetlands are constant over time and independent of concentration which corresponds to a zero order removal process the areal sizing coefficient ra was estimated from operational full scale wetlands ranging from 10 g m² d for formal approval procedures to 20 g m² d for basic water quality improvement at legacy mine sites however it should be noted that the established sizing criteria were derived from passive systems treating highly ferruginous mine discharges which is why hedin et al 1994 noted that the areal approach is subject to a loading limitation accordingly a wide range from 1 up to and above 50 g m² d were reported for full scale settling ponds and wetlands as compiled in tab s2 most observations are markedly below 10 g m² d and it was shown that areal fe removal is predominantly governed by fe loading and ph mayes et al 2009 younger 2000 although the areal approach is commonly considered and has proven to be relatively robust for classic ferruginous coal mine discharges there is general agreement that the multicausal relationship between overall fe removal on the one hand and the size of settling ponds or wetlands on the other hand is inadequately described by a linear relationship e g flanagan et al 1994 johnson and hallberg 2002 kruse et al 2009 mayes et al 2009 sapsford 2013 stark and williams 1995 from a process based perspective passive fe removal in settling ponds proceeds along two major presumably rate determining steps namely 1 oxidation of dissolved fe ii followed by 2 sedimentation of the resultant fe oh 3 the oxidative transition from ferrous to ferric fe has been investigated intensively and respective kinetics are well described in the literature e g millero et al 1987 stumm and morgan 1996 the basic homogeneous fe ii oxidation process may be approximated by the following kinetic equation where the oxidation constant kox is substituted by a pseudo first order constant k ox at stable ph and oxygen levels that is second order with respect to h or oh and first order with respect to o2 2 d f e i i d t k o x f e i i o 2 h 2 k o x f e i i this relationship was broadly confirmed for mining environments by extensive field studies dempsey et al 2001 kirby et al 1999 although it is important to note that the process is considerably accelerated in ferruginous mine waters by heterogeneous fe ii oxidation owing to the autocatalytic effect of omnipresent freshly precipitated fe oh 3 as demonstrated by dietz and dempsey 2017 a quantitative assessment of fe oh 3 sedimentation in mining environments was made by sapsford and watson 2011 and sapsford 2013 reporting that settling of these precipitates can be described by a first order process with rates varying for different mine waters 3 d f e o h 3 d t k s e d f e o h 3 the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed was initially estimated in the order of 9 4 10 3 to 3 2 10 1 h 1 based on column experiments by sapsford 2013 whereas laboratory experiments containing both ferrous and ferric fe displayed rather complex or inconclusive patterns a targeted experiment with oxygenated mine water containing only fe oh 3 displayed an exponential decay curve with ksed 2 3 10 2 h 1 sutton et al 2015 sapsford and warson 2011 noted that application of fe removal kinetics may be a way forward to describe the performance of passive mine water treatment systems more accurately encouraging abandonment of the established areal approach for more application orientated model approaches governed by hrt when designing integrated passive treatment schemes such empirical simplified first order models are frequently utilised in ecological engineering sciences above all for passive wastewater treatment systems to estimate the exponential removal or decay of dissolved and suspended compounds through natural biogeochemical and physical processes kadlec and wallace 2009 in a recent sedimentation study opitz et al 2022a we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 sedimentation across a wide concentration range 3 240 mg l may be described by a mixed first and second order model the sedimentation process is governed by two interrelated regimes with a rapid aggregation driven step of second order at high iron levels followed by a slower settling step of first order at lower iron levels the respective coefficients were determined with kr1 9 4 10 3 m³ g h and kr2 5 4 10 3 h 1 4 d f e o h 3 d t k r 2 f e o h 3 k r 1 f e o h 3 2 moreover we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 removal at moderate fe levels 10 mg l may be reasonably well approximated by the simplifying first order relationship in eq 3 as proposed by sapsford 2013 the respective sedimentation coefficient ksed was determined with 2 4 0 4 10 2 h 1 in column experiments opitz et al 2022a which is consistent with the initial estimates reported by sapsford 2013 and sutton et al 2015 in summary the current state of knowledge implies that it is necessary to advance the established sizing practices for both settling ponds and wetlands to account for fe removal dynamics especially in the face of progressively strict environmental regulation in this study we evaluated the fe oh 3 removal performance of a trifurcated pilot system for passive treatment of a mining influenced ferruginous seepage water variation of flow rates in the identical triplicate system lines allowed for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal as a function of mass flow further on fe oh 3 removal in the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands was evaluated regarding different model approaches as outlined above the overall objective was to determine and parameterise robust application orientated fe removal models that could also be used for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands the dual approach combining fundamental laboratory studies with pilot scale field trials offers considerable prospects to advance our knowledge on fe removal mechanisms and kinetics in passive mine water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and pilot plant the westfield study site is a former open pit in the historic lignite district of upper palatinate southeast germany the pit was only partly backfilled with waste rock and power plant ashes leaving a morphological depression behind seepage water collecting in a drainage pond at the lowest point of the former pit is ferruginous and highly mineralised owing to pyrite oxidation and lixiviation of soluble compounds from the backfill yet circumneutral due to the alkalising character of the dumped electrostatic precipitator ashes tab s3 the seepage water is continuously pumped out from the drainage pond for protection of adjacent aquifers to a conventional physico chemical treatment plant for fe removal opitz et al 2022b the westfield pilot plant was implemented in 2017 next to the operational conventional treatment plant to test an integrated three stage passive scheme with settling ponds for pre treatment surface flow wetlands for polishing and sediment filters for purification as long term alternative for treatment of the mining influenced seepage water fig 1 the three consecutive treatment stages were built as identical parallel triplicates such that hydraulic variation in the three system lines generated a comprehensive database the primary objective of the pilot plant was to lower total fe below the strict site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l the basic setup and performance of the multistage pilot plant for removal of relevant contaminants e g fe mn as nh4 turbidity are detailed in opitz et al 2022b in this study we focus on fe oh 3 removal in settling ponds and wetlands standard roll off containers 7 0 2 35 1 25 m were utilised as both settling ponds and wetlands with water depth adjusted to approx 1 0 and 0 45 m respectively the wetlands were planted with common reed at 20 plants m² in a sandy 0 3 m substrate the steel containers were embedded into the ground for isolation and connected by a polyethylene pipework system ten monitoring points mp01 mp10 for sensor installation and sample collection were installed in protected concrete manholes before and after the containers with settling ponds fed from mp01 settling pond outflows corresponding to wetland inflows mp02 mp04 and wetland outflows corresponding to sediment filter inflows mp05 mp07 as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the ferruginous seepage water is thoroughly oxygenated within the seepage water distribution system which is why the pilot plant s inflow fe concentration was relatively low with ferrous and total fe in the order of 1 and 8 mg l respectively thus the westfield pilot plant provided a comparatively rare opportunity to quantify fe oh 3 removal kinetics independent of fe ii oxidation 2 2 hydraulic characterisation flow rates in the three parallel system lines of the pilot plant were adjusted by ball valves and recorded by flowmeters stübbe dfm200 at a 30 s interval in the three feeding lines branching off mp01 fig 1 in addition impulse response tracer tests were conducted for hydraulic characterisation of the container based system several tracer tests were conducted in both settling ponds and wetlands at incremental steady flow rates by pulse injection of rhodamin wt acros organics into the inlets outflow fluorescence was recorded by a cyclops 7 fluorometer turner designs at a 30 s interval tracer tests were conducted in winter when plant density and thermal mixing are relatively low to obtain a conservative estimate of the actual residence time distribution rtd braskerud 2001 fluorescence measurements were corrected for temperature following smart and laidlaw 1977 and converted to tracer concentration following bodin et al 2012 to determine concentration normalised and cumulative rtd functions e t and f t 5 e t q c t i 1 n q c i t δ t 6 f t i 1 n e t δ t flow rate q and effluent tracer concentration c were averaged to a 10 min interval t for ease of handling and to smooth tracer response curves cumulative effluent tracer mass mout mean hrt tm and variance σ² were calculated as the zeroth first and second moments of the rtd to determine tracer recovery centroid and spread of the tracer response curves respectively 7 m o u t i 1 n q c i t δ t 8 t m i 1 n t e t δ t 9 σ 2 i 1 n t m t 2 e t δ t the hydraulic efficiency λ of settling ponds and wetlands was calculated as the ratio of nominal hrt tn and tracer peak time tp following persson et al 1999 with the intrinsic nominal hrt calculated from the container geometry with water depth z and volume v 10 t n a z q v q 11 λ t p t n 2 3 hydrochemical monitoring water samples for fe analysis were collected twice weekly at all measuring points over approx one year 07 2018 to 06 2019 two samples were collected one filtered at 0 45 µm and acidified with 150 µl of 1 m hcl to immediately quench fe ii oxidation the other unfiltered and acidified with 150 µl of 12 m hcl to additionally re dissolve dispersed fe oh 3 samples were cooled to 4 c before transport to the laboratory for spectrophotometric analysis at 512 nm hach dr 3800 vis using acetate buffer solution and 1 10 phenantroline filtered samples were analysed for dissolved fe ii and unfiltered samples for total fe using ascorbic acid for fe iii reduction this procedure allowed determination of not only dissolved species but also particulate and total fe opitz et al 2020 all chemicals used for stabilisation calibration or standards were analytical grade 2 4 data analysis fe removal in the pilot plant was evaluated based on inflow outflow fe concentration system geometry flow rate and hrt as illustrated in fig 2 to generate a comprehensive dataset flow rates in the three parallel system lines were alternated between 100 and 500 l h to vary hydraulic loading flow rates were aggregated as medians around the fe samplings to smooth hydraulic fluctuations thus the final semi weekly dataset based on fe analyses and respectively aggregated flow rates includes 270 measurements 90 per system line for settling ponds and wetlands each in a first step fe oh 3 removal rates in both settling ponds and wetlands were evaluated as the change in concentration from inflow to outflow over retention time assuming approximatively stationary conditions in the containers as fe ii was negligible throughout the pilot system total fe concentration fe was used for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal 12 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n as the surface area of the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands remained constant throughout the study eq 12 basically evaluates fe mass flow through the system as governed by flow rate from this it follows that fe removal rates as fe t are directly proportional to the area adjusted fe removal rate ra from eq 1 13 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n f e i n f e o u t q a z r a z 1 the water depth z of settling ponds and especially wetlands is usually infinitesimal relative to length and width although it should be noted that water depth effects in shallow wetlands are complex and not yet fully understood guo and cui 2021 shih and wang 2020 in a second step the extensive datasets were used to assess fe removal kinetics in the westfield pilot system based on the preceding column experiments it is reasonable to assume that fe oh 3 removal in bare settling ponds is ultimately governed by sedimentation and may thus be approximated by the relationships provided by opitz et al 2022a as the inflow fe level of the westfield pilot plant was consistently below 15 mg l the simplified first order approach rather than the mixed first second order model was used with the coefficient ksed obtained through integration and rearrangement of eq 3 14 k s e d ln f e o u t f e i n t n 1 the investigation of contaminant removal kinetics in passive treatment systems is generally complicated by the fact that usually just two datapoints namely inflow and outflow are measured that can only be related to system geometry and or hrt as illustrated in fig 2 also the westfield pilot plant was inevitably subject to various technical environmental and hydrodynamic effects including but not limited to small constructional differences between the three parallel system lines increasing reed density in wetlands during the second vegetation period intermittent flow rates and fe spikes in the reservoir feed caused by filling flushes wind driven currents rainfall or buoyancy in the open system such intrinsic and external spatiotemporal effects are commonly the primary limitation of pilot scale field trials all the more because most efficiency and performance criteria are developed for full scale systems with small dispersion indices chang et al 2016 philips et al 2005 therefore three strategies were adopted in this study to minimise potential errors firstly a comprehensive dataset was gathered from a trifurcated system to smooth inevitable fluctuations secondly collection of data extended over one year to ensure that different environmental conditions are represented in the dataset thus avoiding seasonal phytologic or meteorologic biases thirdly tracer tests were conducted to assess potential hydraulic or hydrodynamic shortcomings of the pilot scale system 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulics generally both settling ponds and wetlands show unimodal positively skewed breakthrough curves with elongated tails the tracer tests were terminated after 192 h to minimise imminent re cycling of tracer dye to the pilot plant via the westfields seepage water distribution system the lengthy exponential tail of the curves was extrapolated beyond truncation if needed not only for the sake of completeness but also to ensure a conservative estimate of the median hrt headley and kadlec 2007 extrapolation accounted for a small dye fraction only e g an average of 3 4 of total tracer mass for wetlands in depth evaluation revealed significant differences between settling ponds and wetlands settling pond rtd curves are characterised by an early tracer peak after only 3 to 11 h that is broadly independent of flow rate followed by a pronounced tail fig 3 a the shape indicates that part of the dye was transported through advective zones and exited the container early whereas the remaining dye scattered throughout the container before slowly bleeding out of mixed or stagnant zones these findings are in accordance with visual observations of the spreading dye wetland rtd curves show a more consistent classic shape fig 3b stretching of the curves with decreasing flow rate indicates increased mixing which is substantiated by a negative correlation between flow rate and variance r² 0 80 apparently preferential flow paths that are relevant at higher flow rates are stalled at lower flow rates table 1 the tracer peak is observed close to the nominal hrt with tn tp ratios of 0 68 0 08 visual observations showed effective flow distribution by the dense reed stands with dead zones confined to edge areas although rhodamin wt may be lost in wetlands due to sorption or photolysis lin et al 2003 average tracer recovery was around 90 results compiled in table 1 should be regarded with caution as to potential re cycling of tracer dye and tailing effects which was particularly problematic for prolonged tracer retention in settling ponds stephenson and sheridan 2021 nevertheless the tracer tests provide valuable insights into the hydraulics and hydrodynamics of the pilot plant according to the classification by persson et al 1999 hydraulic efficiency was poor in settling ponds and satisfactory in wetlands poor settling pond hydraulics are likely attributable to the unfavourable geometry i e low surface to depth ratio that is prone to preferential flow and dead zones shih and wang 2020 better wetland hydraulics are likely attributable to the higher surface to depth ratio shih et al 2013 and flow distribution by the dense vegetation verschoren et al 2017 altogether the hydraulic and hydrodynamic limitations of the westfield pilot plant prevent a robust linking of temporal fe removal and rtd guo and cui 2021 sheridan et al 2014 von sperling 2002 consequently the nominal hrt was used as a simplistic yet conservative estimate of actual residence time for evaluation of inversely exponential fe oh 3 removal because the pre nominal water portion discharged from the containers is subject to the highest removal rates whereas the post nominal water portion is subject to receding removal rates sapsford 2013 wahl et al 2010 3 2 iron removal inflow fe levels ranged from 2 7 to 14 5 mg l average 8 3 2 2 mg l in settling ponds and 0 64 to 7 3 mg l average 2 4 1 0 mg l in subsequent wetlands combined with the respective flow rates fe loading of settling ponds and wetlands as first to third quartiles ranged from 41 4 to 67 9 and 9 3 to 21 2 g h respectively over the course of the study period the westfield pilot plant was successful in reducing effluent fe levels below the site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l fig s1 the excellent treatment performance and operational reliability are attributable to the multistage setup where residual effluent concentrations are reliably polished in the successive stage s thus optimising overall treatment performance and mitigating natural performance fluctuations in the open system opitz et al 2022b as noted in the introduction the major fe removal mechanisms are expected to be nonlinearly correlated with inflow concentration to examine the relevance of the initial fe level on removal the fe removal rates in settling ponds and wetlands are plotted against the respective initial fe concentration for all 270 samplings both datasets in fig 4 show a significant concentration dependency with fe removal rates increasing with increasing initial concentration for settling ponds the concentration dependency in fig 4 may be reasonably well described by a linear regression although the adumbrated increase of the slope at higher fe levels could be indicative of a transition from settling to aggregation driven fe removal as suggested by the mixed model in eq 4 unfortunately the range of inflow fe concentrations max 14 5 mg l is insufficient for respective in depth evaluation interestingly the x intercept of the regression at 1 5 mg l indicates that sedimentation based fe removal in settling ponds is inherently limited at residual fe levels which corresponds with similar observations in the preceding sedimentation experiments where a residual colloidal fraction remained suspended for long time spans opitz et al 2022a for wetlands the concentration dependency in fig 4 is best described by a superlinear regression implying that fe removal in densely vegetated wetlands follows a more complex overall mechanism compared to bare settling ponds the multicausal polishing process may include but not be limited to sedimentation filtration adsorption and heteroaggregation verschoren et al 2017 hence there is good reason to assume that fe removal in wetlands is inadequately described by the same sedimentation model approach as in bare settling ponds it is however interesting to note that the regression asymptotically approaches the origin illustrating that wetlands in contrast to settling ponds are effective in retaining even finely dispersed residual colloids in the dense hydrophyte stands altogether the direct juxtaposition of both treatment stages highlights the superior treatment efficiency of densely vegetated wetlands relative to unvegetated settling ponds especially for polishing at low fe levels a tentative indication of the order of fe removal can be obtained by the double logarithmic plot of fe removal rates vs initial fe concentration in fig 5 for settling ponds the plot provides limited information due to the relatively stable inflow fe level from the reservoir with 50 of datapoints clustered between 7 2 and 9 6 mg l nevertheless the slope in the order of 1 3 indicates that fe removal may be reasonably well approximated by the simplified first order model at low to moderate fe levels such as observed in the westfield pilot plant moreover it is conceivable that the slope of 1 3 may in fact split in slopes of 1 sedimentation driven and 2 aggregation driven at lower and higher fe levels respectively as observed in the preceding column experiments yet again fig 5 gives no indication of the development of fe removal kinetics at higher initial fe levels and thus no empirical confirmation of the aggregation driven increase of fe removal dynamics evaluation of the settling ponds dataset for first order removal via eq 14 yields an overall coefficient ksed of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 fig s1a which corresponds well with initial laboratory findings noted in the introduction the spread in ksed is attributable to a slight concentration dependency which is in accordance with the preceding column experiments that showed a similar effect due to receding homoaggregation of dispersed fe at lower fe levels opitz et al 2022a in wetlands the complexity of fe removal is substantiated by both the double logarithmic plot in fig 5 which clearly shows a broken order relationship over the dataset and by the scattering observed in fig s1b for the coefficient ksed as evaluated on a trial basis via eq 14 as fe removal in wetlands should also be expected to vary depending on ecological factors macrophyte species plant density water depth etc we propose to advance the established areal sizing approach by incorporating the concentration dependency empirically determined in this study rather than trying to establish an overall kinetic equation for the multicausal process to parameterise the extended areal fe removal model the removal rates in fig 4 were converted to areal fe removal rates following eq 13 the concentration dependency of ra for the pilot scale wetlands was fitted as r a m fe in n with m 0 2 and n 1 4 as illustrated by the superlinear regression in fig s2b 3 3 comparison with literature data in order to compare the westfield pilot plant data with literature data the area adjusted fe removal rates from tab s2 are compared to the converted areal fe removal rates from this study from fig s2 all passive systems compiled in tab s2 were implemented at abandoned coal mines in the anglo american area for treatment of ferruginous weakly acidic to weakly alkaline mine water ph range 4 7 to 8 1 it should be noted that the literature reports are often individual measurements rather than robust aggregated long term monitoring data and should thus be treated with caution for settling ponds the literature data corresponds reasonably well with the relationship derived in this study especially at low and moderate inflow fe levels this is somewhat surprising considering the wide range of pond configurations ferrous ferric ratios and ph of the literature data notably settling ponds with higher inflow fe levels display higher areal fe removal rates relative to the extrapolated relationship presumably owing to homoaggregation effects as demonstrated in the preceding column experiments opitz et al 2022a the three outliers marked in fig 6 a correspond to exceptionally deep settling ponds z 2 5 m indicating a maximised residence time per unit area such mass flux effects are altogether disregarded by an area based approach further evaluation of fe oh 3 removal kinetics from the data in tab s2a is precluded by missing data on hrt and or pond geometry as well as the usually large fe ii fraction in the inflow for wetlands an inconclusive pattern is observed in fig 6b with literature reports scattered both below and above the relationship from this study largely well below the established sizing criteria the main difficulty in comparing and evaluating wetland performance is the heterogeneity in not only mine water chemistry ph fe loading ferrous ferric ratio etc but also wetland configuration shape water depth substrate amendment macrophyte species plant density hydraulic efficiency etc as noted in respective surveys e g cravotta and brady 2015 stark and williams 1995 tarutis et al 1999 wieder 1989 the concentration dependant relationship developed in this study applies to polishing of residual colloidal fe from pre treated ferruginous mine water in relatively deep reed planted wetlands and is to the best of our knowledge the first such relationship developed for mine water treatment wetlands 3 4 simulation of iron removal in full scale settling ponds coupling of contaminant removal and retention time is increasingly used to model fe transport transformation and removal in mining impacted waters e g baken et al 2015 cravotta 2021 garcia rios et al 2021 yazbek et al 2021 as noted above in depth evaluation of passive fe removal in full scale treatment systems regarding the underlying kinetics is however generally limited because only inflow and outflow datapoints are available having said that the marchand system in pennsylvania listed in tab s2 is one of the largest and best characterised passive mine water treatment systems worldwide consisting of six consecutive settling ponds a to f with a combined surface area of 2 5 ha followed by a 2 9 ha wetland hedin 2008 according to long term monitoring data from 2007 to 2012 the circumneutral and highly ferruginous discharge from the abandoned marchand coal mine is estimated at an average 426 m³ h with an inflow fe concentration of 72 4 mg l that is successfully lowered below the discharge limit of 3 mg l hedin 2013 the intermediate sampling points of the consecutive settling ponds provide a rare opportunity to model the underlying fe removal kinetics by relative least square fitting of the concentration development along the flow path fig 7 based on nominal hrt of the settling ponds and assuming 80 oxygen saturation as well as a moderate average temperature of 10 c k ox was fitted at 3 3 10 2 h 1 which corresponds to a ph of 6 7 this assorts well with the ph range 6 3 to 7 1 and temperature annual average 13 to 14 c reported by hedin 2008 the first order coefficient ksed was fitted at 3 8 10 2 h 1 exceeding estimates from this study and thus substantiating the general impression from fig 6a as further discussed below altogether the kinetics based model approach works quite well to reproduce the observed fe concentration levels especially considering the fluctuation of critical parameters flow rate inflow fe hrt etc as reported by hedin 2008 2013 4 implications 4 1 rate determining iron removal processes as noted in the introduction research on fe removal in passive mine water treatment systems initially focussed on fe ii oxidation as the assumed rate determining step e g kirby et al 1999 tarutis et al 1999 while this is certainly applicable in acidic mine drainage fe ii oxidation in circumneutral mine water occurs demonstrably rapid dietz and dempsey 2017 therefore it is assumed that fe ii oxidation is only rate determining for unfavourable conditions such as acidic ph suboxic conditions or low temperatures e g flanagan et al 1994 hedin 2008 sapsford 2013 based on the results of this study we are now able to approximatively delineate the rate determining fe removal process at moderate fe levels to that end overall fe removal via consecutive fe ii oxidation and fe oh 3 sedimentation is analytically described by coupled integration of eqs 2 and 3 with 15 f e o u t f e i i i n e k o x t k o x f e i i i n e k o x t e k s e d t k s e d k o x f e o h 3 i n e k s e d t for two consecutive processes of first order the process with the smaller reaction constant is considered rate limiting capellos and bielski 1980 as k ox increases hundredfold with a ph increase by one unit the ph is ultimately the critical parameter stumm and morgan 1996 as illustrated in fig 8 fe ii oxidation is rate determining for overall fe removal under acidic conditions ph 6 whereas fe oh 3 sedimentation becomes rate determining under neutral or alkaline conditions ph 7 as previously suggested by sapsford 2013 the two processes are roughly equally paced at weakly acidic conditions ph 6 to 7 where k ox and ksed converge and where variations in ph temperature or oxygenation may play a critical role 4 2 transferability the model approaches developed in this study were derived from and tailored to the site specific challenges and boundary conditions of the westfield site i e a fully oxygenated moderately ferruginous seepage water subject to a strict fe discharge limit this starting situation differs from classic coal mine discharges that often exhibit high ferrous fe levels and moderate fe discharge limits therefore the model approaches developed in this study explicitly provide a conservative basis for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in integrated passive systems focussing on low to moderate fe levels and aiming at utmost operational reliability in due consideration of strict discharge permit criteria in this context it is important to note that the kinetics based model approach for settling ponds oxidation and or sedimentation as combined in eq 15 disregards any catalytic effects such as heterogeneous fe ii oxidation dietz and dempsey 2017 aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation chikanda et al 2021 or biogeochemical processes kappler et al 2021 melton et al 2014 therefore the simplified model is expected to underestimate overall fe removal at higher fe levels by way of example the elevated ksed fitted in fig 7 is likely attributable to the much higher fe level throughout the marchand system where fe oh 3 is expected to peak at 25 mg l after 24 h in settling ponds b and c providing sufficient dispersed solids for aggregation driven sedimentation the tendency of the model approaches developed in this study to underestimate overall fe removal dynamics by either disregarding or simplifying catalytic effects is to a certain extent intentional and imperative not only for the sake of simplification but also because engineering model approaches are expected to intrinsically err on the conservative side to avoid operational failure and resultant pollution of receiving surface waters this is particularly important in light of the complex interrelation of fe ii oxidation dynamics with gas transfer processes o2 diffusion and co2 degassing aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation and actual rtd in passive systems as demonstrated by dempsey et al 2001 these aspects could not be investigated at the westfield site due to the seepage water chemistry and should thus be the focus of future studies on full scale systems to optimise the model approaches developed in this study 5 conclusions and outlook in light of the contemporary spreading of passive technologies whilst also tightening of environmental regulations worldwide it is inalienable to advance the sizing of passive mine water treatment systems the insights and quantitative results from the westfield pilot plant provide a novel scientific and technical basis for customised sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in due consideration of fe removal kinetics for settling ponds we propose utilising a kinetics based model approach for approximation of sedimentation driven fe oh 3 removal 16 a q ln fe out ln fe in k sed z the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed from the pilot scale settling ponds of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 corresponds well with previous laboratory reports the approach may be extended to further consider the preceding fe ii oxidation step according to eq 15 with only a small set of standard input parameters fe concentration flow rate ph and simplifying assumptions e g moderate temperature steady ph as well as technical pre conditions e g pre aeration sound hydraulic design required to estimate the necessary hrt and thus pond size for overall fe removal the kinetics based model approach provides a more realistic sizing foundation compared to assignment of a flat hrt or areal fe removal rate especially at low to moderate fe levels that are ultimately relevant for strict discharge criteria for wetlands we propose to advance the established area adjusted sizing approach in eq 1 by incorporating the concentration dependency parameterised in this study such practical simplification of complex natural mitigation processes is common in the field of waste water treatment where sizing of engineered systems is typically achieved by conservative empirical formulae 17 a q fe in fe out m fe in n the coefficients m and n were empirically determined as 0 2 and 1 4 respectively for reliable polishing of finely dispersed colloidal fe in dense reed stands following pre treatment in settling ponds under these conditions the extended areal approach provides a more realistic approximation of the complex sedimentation and filtration mechanisms compared to the established linear approach finally eqs 16 and 17 show that the pond or wetland size is expected to be linearly correlated with flow rate whereas fe removal per unit area exponentially increases with increasing fe concentration therefore dilution or blending of mine discharges should generally be avoided to minimise not only pollutant dispersion but also the overall effort and land consumption of passive mine water treatment

15000,the removal of dissolved and particulate iron fe from contaminated mine drainage is an omnipresent challenge in and legacy of the mining industry worldwide the sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands for passive fe removal from circumneutral ferruginous mine water is based either on a linear concentration independent area adjusted removal rate or flat assignment of an experience based retention time neither of which reflects the underlying fe removal kinetics in this study we evaluated the fe removal performance of a pilot scale passive system operating in three identical parallel lines for treatment of mining influenced ferruginous seepage water to determine and parameterise a robust application orientated model approach for sizing of settling ponds and surface flow wetlands each by systematically varying flow rates and thus residence time we were able to demonstrate that the sedimentation driven removal of particulate hydrous ferric oxides in settling ponds may be approximated by a simplified first order approach at low to moderate fe levels the first order coefficient was found in the order of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 which corresponds well with previous laboratory studies the sedimentation kinetics may be combined with the preceding fe ii oxidation kinetics to estimate the required residence time for pre treatment of ferruginous mine water in settling ponds in contrast fe removal in surface flow wetlands is more complex due to the phytologic component which is why we advanced the established area adjusted fe removal approach by parameterising the underlying concentration dependency for polishing of pre treated mine water the quantitative results of this study provide a novel conservative approach for customised sizing of

introduction industrial scale coal lignite and metal mining are commonly associated with the generation of contaminated mine drainage that requires treatment to protect receiving freshwater environments mine water treatment is increasingly facilitated in eco technological passive systems that harness and enhance natural biogeochemical and physical processes for removal of various contaminants skousen et al 2017 passive systems are often regarded as a more sustainable and cost effective approach for mine water treatment especially for circumneutral ferruginous mine waters that predominantly require the removal of iron fe as ubiquitous contaminant in mining environments hedin 2008 passive fe removal is commonly achieved in surface flow systems through oxidation of dissolved fe ii and subsequent sedimentation or filtration of the resultant particulate hydrous ferric oxides hereinafter fe oh 3 hedin et al 1994 skousen et al 2017 aerobic passive systems for iron removal commonly consist of consecutive aeration cascades for oxygenation settling ponds for pre treatment and surface flow wetlands for polishing hedin et al 1994 basically settling ponds provide retention time for oxidation of fe ii and sedimentation of the bulk fe oh 3 load whereas subsequent wetlands facilitate sedimentation or filtration of the remaining colloidal fe oh 3 in the dense vegetation to reliably meet specific discharge limits opitz et al 2021 the assembly of consecutive treatment stages in integrated systems for treatment of circumneutral ferruginous mine water is rather vaguely defined in the literature broadly aiming at 50 to 80 fe removal in settling ponds depending on fe loading to protect the subsequent wetlands from overloading kruse et al 2009 parker 2003 this latent ambiguity is attributable to the underlying sizing practice for both settling ponds and wetlands that is largely based on concentration independent rules of thumb which are ill defined for more customised designing and sizing of integrated passive systems banks 2003 sapsford 2013 only few approaches for sizing of settling ponds are to be found in the literature as compiled in tab s1a none of which became standard practice to date kruse et al 2009 early recommendations were derived from the wastewater sector for instance assigning an overflow rate of 1 10 5 m s to broadly allow for settling of clay sized particles national coal board 1982 however mine discharges often require additional retention time to allow for fe ii oxidation and it was also found that the aggregation and sedimentation behaviour of freshly precipitated fe oh 3 distinctly differs from soil or sewage particles hove et al 2008 sapsford 2013 commonest in the literature is the experience based assignment of either a flat hydraulic retention time hrt in the order of 8 to 48 h or a hydraulic loading rate in the order of 100 m² l s to broadly allow for both fe ii oxidation and settling of larger particles tab s1b overall banks 2003 noted that performance evaluation of settling ponds is rather scarce relative to wetlands which is why wetland sizing is at times transferred to settling ponds various sizing approaches for surface flow wetlands were developed for treatment of acidic and neutral mine water most of which are based on empirical area adjusted fe removal rates as compiled in tab s1b eventually a recommendation for areal sizing of wetlands was issued by the former us bureau of mines hedin et al 1994 that was henceforth adopted in various guidelines e g piramid consortium 2003 skousen et al 1998 watzlaf et al 2004 the wetland area a is calculated from fe loading and an empirical area adjusted sizing constant ra 1 a q f e i n f e o u t r a with q as volumetric flow rate and fe in and fe out as inflow and target effluent fe concentration respectively this approach suggests that fe removal rates in wetlands are constant over time and independent of concentration which corresponds to a zero order removal process the areal sizing coefficient ra was estimated from operational full scale wetlands ranging from 10 g m² d for formal approval procedures to 20 g m² d for basic water quality improvement at legacy mine sites however it should be noted that the established sizing criteria were derived from passive systems treating highly ferruginous mine discharges which is why hedin et al 1994 noted that the areal approach is subject to a loading limitation accordingly a wide range from 1 up to and above 50 g m² d were reported for full scale settling ponds and wetlands as compiled in tab s2 most observations are markedly below 10 g m² d and it was shown that areal fe removal is predominantly governed by fe loading and ph mayes et al 2009 younger 2000 although the areal approach is commonly considered and has proven to be relatively robust for classic ferruginous coal mine discharges there is general agreement that the multicausal relationship between overall fe removal on the one hand and the size of settling ponds or wetlands on the other hand is inadequately described by a linear relationship e g flanagan et al 1994 johnson and hallberg 2002 kruse et al 2009 mayes et al 2009 sapsford 2013 stark and williams 1995 from a process based perspective passive fe removal in settling ponds proceeds along two major presumably rate determining steps namely 1 oxidation of dissolved fe ii followed by 2 sedimentation of the resultant fe oh 3 the oxidative transition from ferrous to ferric fe has been investigated intensively and respective kinetics are well described in the literature e g millero et al 1987 stumm and morgan 1996 the basic homogeneous fe ii oxidation process may be approximated by the following kinetic equation where the oxidation constant kox is substituted by a pseudo first order constant k ox at stable ph and oxygen levels that is second order with respect to h or oh and first order with respect to o2 2 d f e i i d t k o x f e i i o 2 h 2 k o x f e i i this relationship was broadly confirmed for mining environments by extensive field studies dempsey et al 2001 kirby et al 1999 although it is important to note that the process is considerably accelerated in ferruginous mine waters by heterogeneous fe ii oxidation owing to the autocatalytic effect of omnipresent freshly precipitated fe oh 3 as demonstrated by dietz and dempsey 2017 a quantitative assessment of fe oh 3 sedimentation in mining environments was made by sapsford and watson 2011 and sapsford 2013 reporting that settling of these precipitates can be described by a first order process with rates varying for different mine waters 3 d f e o h 3 d t k s e d f e o h 3 the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed was initially estimated in the order of 9 4 10 3 to 3 2 10 1 h 1 based on column experiments by sapsford 2013 whereas laboratory experiments containing both ferrous and ferric fe displayed rather complex or inconclusive patterns a targeted experiment with oxygenated mine water containing only fe oh 3 displayed an exponential decay curve with ksed 2 3 10 2 h 1 sutton et al 2015 sapsford and warson 2011 noted that application of fe removal kinetics may be a way forward to describe the performance of passive mine water treatment systems more accurately encouraging abandonment of the established areal approach for more application orientated model approaches governed by hrt when designing integrated passive treatment schemes such empirical simplified first order models are frequently utilised in ecological engineering sciences above all for passive wastewater treatment systems to estimate the exponential removal or decay of dissolved and suspended compounds through natural biogeochemical and physical processes kadlec and wallace 2009 in a recent sedimentation study opitz et al 2022a we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 sedimentation across a wide concentration range 3 240 mg l may be described by a mixed first and second order model the sedimentation process is governed by two interrelated regimes with a rapid aggregation driven step of second order at high iron levels followed by a slower settling step of first order at lower iron levels the respective coefficients were determined with kr1 9 4 10 3 m³ g h and kr2 5 4 10 3 h 1 4 d f e o h 3 d t k r 2 f e o h 3 k r 1 f e o h 3 2 moreover we were able to demonstrate that fe oh 3 removal at moderate fe levels 10 mg l may be reasonably well approximated by the simplifying first order relationship in eq 3 as proposed by sapsford 2013 the respective sedimentation coefficient ksed was determined with 2 4 0 4 10 2 h 1 in column experiments opitz et al 2022a which is consistent with the initial estimates reported by sapsford 2013 and sutton et al 2015 in summary the current state of knowledge implies that it is necessary to advance the established sizing practices for both settling ponds and wetlands to account for fe removal dynamics especially in the face of progressively strict environmental regulation in this study we evaluated the fe oh 3 removal performance of a trifurcated pilot system for passive treatment of a mining influenced ferruginous seepage water variation of flow rates in the identical triplicate system lines allowed for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal as a function of mass flow further on fe oh 3 removal in the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands was evaluated regarding different model approaches as outlined above the overall objective was to determine and parameterise robust application orientated fe removal models that could also be used for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands the dual approach combining fundamental laboratory studies with pilot scale field trials offers considerable prospects to advance our knowledge on fe removal mechanisms and kinetics in passive mine water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and pilot plant the westfield study site is a former open pit in the historic lignite district of upper palatinate southeast germany the pit was only partly backfilled with waste rock and power plant ashes leaving a morphological depression behind seepage water collecting in a drainage pond at the lowest point of the former pit is ferruginous and highly mineralised owing to pyrite oxidation and lixiviation of soluble compounds from the backfill yet circumneutral due to the alkalising character of the dumped electrostatic precipitator ashes tab s3 the seepage water is continuously pumped out from the drainage pond for protection of adjacent aquifers to a conventional physico chemical treatment plant for fe removal opitz et al 2022b the westfield pilot plant was implemented in 2017 next to the operational conventional treatment plant to test an integrated three stage passive scheme with settling ponds for pre treatment surface flow wetlands for polishing and sediment filters for purification as long term alternative for treatment of the mining influenced seepage water fig 1 the three consecutive treatment stages were built as identical parallel triplicates such that hydraulic variation in the three system lines generated a comprehensive database the primary objective of the pilot plant was to lower total fe below the strict site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l the basic setup and performance of the multistage pilot plant for removal of relevant contaminants e g fe mn as nh4 turbidity are detailed in opitz et al 2022b in this study we focus on fe oh 3 removal in settling ponds and wetlands standard roll off containers 7 0 2 35 1 25 m were utilised as both settling ponds and wetlands with water depth adjusted to approx 1 0 and 0 45 m respectively the wetlands were planted with common reed at 20 plants m² in a sandy 0 3 m substrate the steel containers were embedded into the ground for isolation and connected by a polyethylene pipework system ten monitoring points mp01 mp10 for sensor installation and sample collection were installed in protected concrete manholes before and after the containers with settling ponds fed from mp01 settling pond outflows corresponding to wetland inflows mp02 mp04 and wetland outflows corresponding to sediment filter inflows mp05 mp07 as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the ferruginous seepage water is thoroughly oxygenated within the seepage water distribution system which is why the pilot plant s inflow fe concentration was relatively low with ferrous and total fe in the order of 1 and 8 mg l respectively thus the westfield pilot plant provided a comparatively rare opportunity to quantify fe oh 3 removal kinetics independent of fe ii oxidation 2 2 hydraulic characterisation flow rates in the three parallel system lines of the pilot plant were adjusted by ball valves and recorded by flowmeters stübbe dfm200 at a 30 s interval in the three feeding lines branching off mp01 fig 1 in addition impulse response tracer tests were conducted for hydraulic characterisation of the container based system several tracer tests were conducted in both settling ponds and wetlands at incremental steady flow rates by pulse injection of rhodamin wt acros organics into the inlets outflow fluorescence was recorded by a cyclops 7 fluorometer turner designs at a 30 s interval tracer tests were conducted in winter when plant density and thermal mixing are relatively low to obtain a conservative estimate of the actual residence time distribution rtd braskerud 2001 fluorescence measurements were corrected for temperature following smart and laidlaw 1977 and converted to tracer concentration following bodin et al 2012 to determine concentration normalised and cumulative rtd functions e t and f t 5 e t q c t i 1 n q c i t δ t 6 f t i 1 n e t δ t flow rate q and effluent tracer concentration c were averaged to a 10 min interval t for ease of handling and to smooth tracer response curves cumulative effluent tracer mass mout mean hrt tm and variance σ² were calculated as the zeroth first and second moments of the rtd to determine tracer recovery centroid and spread of the tracer response curves respectively 7 m o u t i 1 n q c i t δ t 8 t m i 1 n t e t δ t 9 σ 2 i 1 n t m t 2 e t δ t the hydraulic efficiency λ of settling ponds and wetlands was calculated as the ratio of nominal hrt tn and tracer peak time tp following persson et al 1999 with the intrinsic nominal hrt calculated from the container geometry with water depth z and volume v 10 t n a z q v q 11 λ t p t n 2 3 hydrochemical monitoring water samples for fe analysis were collected twice weekly at all measuring points over approx one year 07 2018 to 06 2019 two samples were collected one filtered at 0 45 µm and acidified with 150 µl of 1 m hcl to immediately quench fe ii oxidation the other unfiltered and acidified with 150 µl of 12 m hcl to additionally re dissolve dispersed fe oh 3 samples were cooled to 4 c before transport to the laboratory for spectrophotometric analysis at 512 nm hach dr 3800 vis using acetate buffer solution and 1 10 phenantroline filtered samples were analysed for dissolved fe ii and unfiltered samples for total fe using ascorbic acid for fe iii reduction this procedure allowed determination of not only dissolved species but also particulate and total fe opitz et al 2020 all chemicals used for stabilisation calibration or standards were analytical grade 2 4 data analysis fe removal in the pilot plant was evaluated based on inflow outflow fe concentration system geometry flow rate and hrt as illustrated in fig 2 to generate a comprehensive dataset flow rates in the three parallel system lines were alternated between 100 and 500 l h to vary hydraulic loading flow rates were aggregated as medians around the fe samplings to smooth hydraulic fluctuations thus the final semi weekly dataset based on fe analyses and respectively aggregated flow rates includes 270 measurements 90 per system line for settling ponds and wetlands each in a first step fe oh 3 removal rates in both settling ponds and wetlands were evaluated as the change in concentration from inflow to outflow over retention time assuming approximatively stationary conditions in the containers as fe ii was negligible throughout the pilot system total fe concentration fe was used for evaluation of fe oh 3 removal 12 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n as the surface area of the pilot scale settling ponds and wetlands remained constant throughout the study eq 12 basically evaluates fe mass flow through the system as governed by flow rate from this it follows that fe removal rates as fe t are directly proportional to the area adjusted fe removal rate ra from eq 1 13 δ f e δ t f e o u t f e i n t n f e i n f e o u t q a z r a z 1 the water depth z of settling ponds and especially wetlands is usually infinitesimal relative to length and width although it should be noted that water depth effects in shallow wetlands are complex and not yet fully understood guo and cui 2021 shih and wang 2020 in a second step the extensive datasets were used to assess fe removal kinetics in the westfield pilot system based on the preceding column experiments it is reasonable to assume that fe oh 3 removal in bare settling ponds is ultimately governed by sedimentation and may thus be approximated by the relationships provided by opitz et al 2022a as the inflow fe level of the westfield pilot plant was consistently below 15 mg l the simplified first order approach rather than the mixed first second order model was used with the coefficient ksed obtained through integration and rearrangement of eq 3 14 k s e d ln f e o u t f e i n t n 1 the investigation of contaminant removal kinetics in passive treatment systems is generally complicated by the fact that usually just two datapoints namely inflow and outflow are measured that can only be related to system geometry and or hrt as illustrated in fig 2 also the westfield pilot plant was inevitably subject to various technical environmental and hydrodynamic effects including but not limited to small constructional differences between the three parallel system lines increasing reed density in wetlands during the second vegetation period intermittent flow rates and fe spikes in the reservoir feed caused by filling flushes wind driven currents rainfall or buoyancy in the open system such intrinsic and external spatiotemporal effects are commonly the primary limitation of pilot scale field trials all the more because most efficiency and performance criteria are developed for full scale systems with small dispersion indices chang et al 2016 philips et al 2005 therefore three strategies were adopted in this study to minimise potential errors firstly a comprehensive dataset was gathered from a trifurcated system to smooth inevitable fluctuations secondly collection of data extended over one year to ensure that different environmental conditions are represented in the dataset thus avoiding seasonal phytologic or meteorologic biases thirdly tracer tests were conducted to assess potential hydraulic or hydrodynamic shortcomings of the pilot scale system 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulics generally both settling ponds and wetlands show unimodal positively skewed breakthrough curves with elongated tails the tracer tests were terminated after 192 h to minimise imminent re cycling of tracer dye to the pilot plant via the westfields seepage water distribution system the lengthy exponential tail of the curves was extrapolated beyond truncation if needed not only for the sake of completeness but also to ensure a conservative estimate of the median hrt headley and kadlec 2007 extrapolation accounted for a small dye fraction only e g an average of 3 4 of total tracer mass for wetlands in depth evaluation revealed significant differences between settling ponds and wetlands settling pond rtd curves are characterised by an early tracer peak after only 3 to 11 h that is broadly independent of flow rate followed by a pronounced tail fig 3 a the shape indicates that part of the dye was transported through advective zones and exited the container early whereas the remaining dye scattered throughout the container before slowly bleeding out of mixed or stagnant zones these findings are in accordance with visual observations of the spreading dye wetland rtd curves show a more consistent classic shape fig 3b stretching of the curves with decreasing flow rate indicates increased mixing which is substantiated by a negative correlation between flow rate and variance r² 0 80 apparently preferential flow paths that are relevant at higher flow rates are stalled at lower flow rates table 1 the tracer peak is observed close to the nominal hrt with tn tp ratios of 0 68 0 08 visual observations showed effective flow distribution by the dense reed stands with dead zones confined to edge areas although rhodamin wt may be lost in wetlands due to sorption or photolysis lin et al 2003 average tracer recovery was around 90 results compiled in table 1 should be regarded with caution as to potential re cycling of tracer dye and tailing effects which was particularly problematic for prolonged tracer retention in settling ponds stephenson and sheridan 2021 nevertheless the tracer tests provide valuable insights into the hydraulics and hydrodynamics of the pilot plant according to the classification by persson et al 1999 hydraulic efficiency was poor in settling ponds and satisfactory in wetlands poor settling pond hydraulics are likely attributable to the unfavourable geometry i e low surface to depth ratio that is prone to preferential flow and dead zones shih and wang 2020 better wetland hydraulics are likely attributable to the higher surface to depth ratio shih et al 2013 and flow distribution by the dense vegetation verschoren et al 2017 altogether the hydraulic and hydrodynamic limitations of the westfield pilot plant prevent a robust linking of temporal fe removal and rtd guo and cui 2021 sheridan et al 2014 von sperling 2002 consequently the nominal hrt was used as a simplistic yet conservative estimate of actual residence time for evaluation of inversely exponential fe oh 3 removal because the pre nominal water portion discharged from the containers is subject to the highest removal rates whereas the post nominal water portion is subject to receding removal rates sapsford 2013 wahl et al 2010 3 2 iron removal inflow fe levels ranged from 2 7 to 14 5 mg l average 8 3 2 2 mg l in settling ponds and 0 64 to 7 3 mg l average 2 4 1 0 mg l in subsequent wetlands combined with the respective flow rates fe loading of settling ponds and wetlands as first to third quartiles ranged from 41 4 to 67 9 and 9 3 to 21 2 g h respectively over the course of the study period the westfield pilot plant was successful in reducing effluent fe levels below the site specific discharge limit of 1 mg l fig s1 the excellent treatment performance and operational reliability are attributable to the multistage setup where residual effluent concentrations are reliably polished in the successive stage s thus optimising overall treatment performance and mitigating natural performance fluctuations in the open system opitz et al 2022b as noted in the introduction the major fe removal mechanisms are expected to be nonlinearly correlated with inflow concentration to examine the relevance of the initial fe level on removal the fe removal rates in settling ponds and wetlands are plotted against the respective initial fe concentration for all 270 samplings both datasets in fig 4 show a significant concentration dependency with fe removal rates increasing with increasing initial concentration for settling ponds the concentration dependency in fig 4 may be reasonably well described by a linear regression although the adumbrated increase of the slope at higher fe levels could be indicative of a transition from settling to aggregation driven fe removal as suggested by the mixed model in eq 4 unfortunately the range of inflow fe concentrations max 14 5 mg l is insufficient for respective in depth evaluation interestingly the x intercept of the regression at 1 5 mg l indicates that sedimentation based fe removal in settling ponds is inherently limited at residual fe levels which corresponds with similar observations in the preceding sedimentation experiments where a residual colloidal fraction remained suspended for long time spans opitz et al 2022a for wetlands the concentration dependency in fig 4 is best described by a superlinear regression implying that fe removal in densely vegetated wetlands follows a more complex overall mechanism compared to bare settling ponds the multicausal polishing process may include but not be limited to sedimentation filtration adsorption and heteroaggregation verschoren et al 2017 hence there is good reason to assume that fe removal in wetlands is inadequately described by the same sedimentation model approach as in bare settling ponds it is however interesting to note that the regression asymptotically approaches the origin illustrating that wetlands in contrast to settling ponds are effective in retaining even finely dispersed residual colloids in the dense hydrophyte stands altogether the direct juxtaposition of both treatment stages highlights the superior treatment efficiency of densely vegetated wetlands relative to unvegetated settling ponds especially for polishing at low fe levels a tentative indication of the order of fe removal can be obtained by the double logarithmic plot of fe removal rates vs initial fe concentration in fig 5 for settling ponds the plot provides limited information due to the relatively stable inflow fe level from the reservoir with 50 of datapoints clustered between 7 2 and 9 6 mg l nevertheless the slope in the order of 1 3 indicates that fe removal may be reasonably well approximated by the simplified first order model at low to moderate fe levels such as observed in the westfield pilot plant moreover it is conceivable that the slope of 1 3 may in fact split in slopes of 1 sedimentation driven and 2 aggregation driven at lower and higher fe levels respectively as observed in the preceding column experiments yet again fig 5 gives no indication of the development of fe removal kinetics at higher initial fe levels and thus no empirical confirmation of the aggregation driven increase of fe removal dynamics evaluation of the settling ponds dataset for first order removal via eq 14 yields an overall coefficient ksed of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 fig s1a which corresponds well with initial laboratory findings noted in the introduction the spread in ksed is attributable to a slight concentration dependency which is in accordance with the preceding column experiments that showed a similar effect due to receding homoaggregation of dispersed fe at lower fe levels opitz et al 2022a in wetlands the complexity of fe removal is substantiated by both the double logarithmic plot in fig 5 which clearly shows a broken order relationship over the dataset and by the scattering observed in fig s1b for the coefficient ksed as evaluated on a trial basis via eq 14 as fe removal in wetlands should also be expected to vary depending on ecological factors macrophyte species plant density water depth etc we propose to advance the established areal sizing approach by incorporating the concentration dependency empirically determined in this study rather than trying to establish an overall kinetic equation for the multicausal process to parameterise the extended areal fe removal model the removal rates in fig 4 were converted to areal fe removal rates following eq 13 the concentration dependency of ra for the pilot scale wetlands was fitted as r a m fe in n with m 0 2 and n 1 4 as illustrated by the superlinear regression in fig s2b 3 3 comparison with literature data in order to compare the westfield pilot plant data with literature data the area adjusted fe removal rates from tab s2 are compared to the converted areal fe removal rates from this study from fig s2 all passive systems compiled in tab s2 were implemented at abandoned coal mines in the anglo american area for treatment of ferruginous weakly acidic to weakly alkaline mine water ph range 4 7 to 8 1 it should be noted that the literature reports are often individual measurements rather than robust aggregated long term monitoring data and should thus be treated with caution for settling ponds the literature data corresponds reasonably well with the relationship derived in this study especially at low and moderate inflow fe levels this is somewhat surprising considering the wide range of pond configurations ferrous ferric ratios and ph of the literature data notably settling ponds with higher inflow fe levels display higher areal fe removal rates relative to the extrapolated relationship presumably owing to homoaggregation effects as demonstrated in the preceding column experiments opitz et al 2022a the three outliers marked in fig 6 a correspond to exceptionally deep settling ponds z 2 5 m indicating a maximised residence time per unit area such mass flux effects are altogether disregarded by an area based approach further evaluation of fe oh 3 removal kinetics from the data in tab s2a is precluded by missing data on hrt and or pond geometry as well as the usually large fe ii fraction in the inflow for wetlands an inconclusive pattern is observed in fig 6b with literature reports scattered both below and above the relationship from this study largely well below the established sizing criteria the main difficulty in comparing and evaluating wetland performance is the heterogeneity in not only mine water chemistry ph fe loading ferrous ferric ratio etc but also wetland configuration shape water depth substrate amendment macrophyte species plant density hydraulic efficiency etc as noted in respective surveys e g cravotta and brady 2015 stark and williams 1995 tarutis et al 1999 wieder 1989 the concentration dependant relationship developed in this study applies to polishing of residual colloidal fe from pre treated ferruginous mine water in relatively deep reed planted wetlands and is to the best of our knowledge the first such relationship developed for mine water treatment wetlands 3 4 simulation of iron removal in full scale settling ponds coupling of contaminant removal and retention time is increasingly used to model fe transport transformation and removal in mining impacted waters e g baken et al 2015 cravotta 2021 garcia rios et al 2021 yazbek et al 2021 as noted above in depth evaluation of passive fe removal in full scale treatment systems regarding the underlying kinetics is however generally limited because only inflow and outflow datapoints are available having said that the marchand system in pennsylvania listed in tab s2 is one of the largest and best characterised passive mine water treatment systems worldwide consisting of six consecutive settling ponds a to f with a combined surface area of 2 5 ha followed by a 2 9 ha wetland hedin 2008 according to long term monitoring data from 2007 to 2012 the circumneutral and highly ferruginous discharge from the abandoned marchand coal mine is estimated at an average 426 m³ h with an inflow fe concentration of 72 4 mg l that is successfully lowered below the discharge limit of 3 mg l hedin 2013 the intermediate sampling points of the consecutive settling ponds provide a rare opportunity to model the underlying fe removal kinetics by relative least square fitting of the concentration development along the flow path fig 7 based on nominal hrt of the settling ponds and assuming 80 oxygen saturation as well as a moderate average temperature of 10 c k ox was fitted at 3 3 10 2 h 1 which corresponds to a ph of 6 7 this assorts well with the ph range 6 3 to 7 1 and temperature annual average 13 to 14 c reported by hedin 2008 the first order coefficient ksed was fitted at 3 8 10 2 h 1 exceeding estimates from this study and thus substantiating the general impression from fig 6a as further discussed below altogether the kinetics based model approach works quite well to reproduce the observed fe concentration levels especially considering the fluctuation of critical parameters flow rate inflow fe hrt etc as reported by hedin 2008 2013 4 implications 4 1 rate determining iron removal processes as noted in the introduction research on fe removal in passive mine water treatment systems initially focussed on fe ii oxidation as the assumed rate determining step e g kirby et al 1999 tarutis et al 1999 while this is certainly applicable in acidic mine drainage fe ii oxidation in circumneutral mine water occurs demonstrably rapid dietz and dempsey 2017 therefore it is assumed that fe ii oxidation is only rate determining for unfavourable conditions such as acidic ph suboxic conditions or low temperatures e g flanagan et al 1994 hedin 2008 sapsford 2013 based on the results of this study we are now able to approximatively delineate the rate determining fe removal process at moderate fe levels to that end overall fe removal via consecutive fe ii oxidation and fe oh 3 sedimentation is analytically described by coupled integration of eqs 2 and 3 with 15 f e o u t f e i i i n e k o x t k o x f e i i i n e k o x t e k s e d t k s e d k o x f e o h 3 i n e k s e d t for two consecutive processes of first order the process with the smaller reaction constant is considered rate limiting capellos and bielski 1980 as k ox increases hundredfold with a ph increase by one unit the ph is ultimately the critical parameter stumm and morgan 1996 as illustrated in fig 8 fe ii oxidation is rate determining for overall fe removal under acidic conditions ph 6 whereas fe oh 3 sedimentation becomes rate determining under neutral or alkaline conditions ph 7 as previously suggested by sapsford 2013 the two processes are roughly equally paced at weakly acidic conditions ph 6 to 7 where k ox and ksed converge and where variations in ph temperature or oxygenation may play a critical role 4 2 transferability the model approaches developed in this study were derived from and tailored to the site specific challenges and boundary conditions of the westfield site i e a fully oxygenated moderately ferruginous seepage water subject to a strict fe discharge limit this starting situation differs from classic coal mine discharges that often exhibit high ferrous fe levels and moderate fe discharge limits therefore the model approaches developed in this study explicitly provide a conservative basis for sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in integrated passive systems focussing on low to moderate fe levels and aiming at utmost operational reliability in due consideration of strict discharge permit criteria in this context it is important to note that the kinetics based model approach for settling ponds oxidation and or sedimentation as combined in eq 15 disregards any catalytic effects such as heterogeneous fe ii oxidation dietz and dempsey 2017 aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation chikanda et al 2021 or biogeochemical processes kappler et al 2021 melton et al 2014 therefore the simplified model is expected to underestimate overall fe removal at higher fe levels by way of example the elevated ksed fitted in fig 7 is likely attributable to the much higher fe level throughout the marchand system where fe oh 3 is expected to peak at 25 mg l after 24 h in settling ponds b and c providing sufficient dispersed solids for aggregation driven sedimentation the tendency of the model approaches developed in this study to underestimate overall fe removal dynamics by either disregarding or simplifying catalytic effects is to a certain extent intentional and imperative not only for the sake of simplification but also because engineering model approaches are expected to intrinsically err on the conservative side to avoid operational failure and resultant pollution of receiving surface waters this is particularly important in light of the complex interrelation of fe ii oxidation dynamics with gas transfer processes o2 diffusion and co2 degassing aggregation driven fe oh 3 sedimentation and actual rtd in passive systems as demonstrated by dempsey et al 2001 these aspects could not be investigated at the westfield site due to the seepage water chemistry and should thus be the focus of future studies on full scale systems to optimise the model approaches developed in this study 5 conclusions and outlook in light of the contemporary spreading of passive technologies whilst also tightening of environmental regulations worldwide it is inalienable to advance the sizing of passive mine water treatment systems the insights and quantitative results from the westfield pilot plant provide a novel scientific and technical basis for customised sizing of settling ponds and wetlands in due consideration of fe removal kinetics for settling ponds we propose utilising a kinetics based model approach for approximation of sedimentation driven fe oh 3 removal 16 a q ln fe out ln fe in k sed z the first order sedimentation coefficient ksed from the pilot scale settling ponds of 2 1 0 7 10 2 h 1 corresponds well with previous laboratory reports the approach may be extended to further consider the preceding fe ii oxidation step according to eq 15 with only a small set of standard input parameters fe concentration flow rate ph and simplifying assumptions e g moderate temperature steady ph as well as technical pre conditions e g pre aeration sound hydraulic design required to estimate the necessary hrt and thus pond size for overall fe removal the kinetics based model approach provides a more realistic sizing foundation compared to assignment of a flat hrt or areal fe removal rate especially at low to moderate fe levels that are ultimately relevant for strict discharge criteria for wetlands we propose to advance the established area adjusted sizing approach in eq 1 by incorporating the concentration dependency parameterised in this study such practical simplification of complex natural mitigation processes is common in the field of waste water treatment where sizing of engineered systems is typically achieved by conservative empirical formulae 17 a q fe in fe out m fe in n the coefficients m and n were empirically determined as 0 2 and 1 4 respectively for reliable polishing of finely dispersed colloidal fe in dense reed stands following pre treatment in settling ponds under these conditions the extended areal approach provides a more realistic approximation of the complex sedimentation and filtration mechanisms compared to the established linear approach finally eqs 16 and 17 show that the pond or wetland size is expected to be linearly correlated with flow rate whereas fe removal per unit area exponentially increases with increasing fe concentration therefore dilution or blending of mine discharges should generally be avoided to minimise not only pollutant dispersion but also the overall effort and land consumption of passive mine water treatment

15001,many aquatic environments contain cohesive sediments that flocculate and create flocs with a wide range of sizes the population balance equation pbe flocculation model is designed to predict the time dependent floc size distribution and should be more complete than models based on median floc size however a pbe flocculation model includes many empirical parameters to represent important physical chemical and biological processes we report a systematic investigation of key model parameters of the open source pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney lafite claude brun cottan and le hir 2011 using the measured temporal floc size statistics reported by keyvani and strom 2014 at a constant turbulent shear rate s results show that the median floc size d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is insufficient to constrain the model parameters a comprehensive error analysis shows that the model is capable of predicting three floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 which also reveals a clear trend that the best calibrated fragmentation rate inverse of floc yield strength is proportional to the floc size statistics considered motivated by this finding the importance of floc yield strength is demonstrated in the predicted temporal evolution of floc size by modeling the floc yield strength as microflocs and macroflocs giving two corresponding fragmentation rates the model shows a significantly improved agreement in matching the measured floc size statistics keywords flocculation population balance equation cohesive sediment yield strength data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unlike non cohesive sediment such as sand cohesive sediments exhibit a unique physical process called flocculation that causes individual particles to stick together when two or more particles collide through flocculation the role of cohesive sediments in aquatic environments has a crucial impact on the ecosystem when particulate concentrations in the water column are high aquatic organisms face severe consequences due to the absence of photosynthesis low levels of dissolved oxygen and depletion of energy sources jones et al 2012 vaz et al 2019 simultaneously cohesive sediments exert a fundamental control on the fate of nutrients and organic matter and hence alter the water quality asmala et al 2022 furthermore low density hydrophobic substances such as oil droplets can be deposited on the seafloor due to flocculation with suspended particulate matters daly et al 2016 ye et al 2021 therefore studying flocculation dynamics of cohesive sediment is an important and thriving research subject in aquatic science and engineering flocculation is defined by two main processes that coexist simultaneously aggregation and fragmentation breakup aggregation may take place when cations from dissolved salt in water create surface bridging around clay particles and decrease their repulsion force sutherland et al 2015 moreover cohesion between particles can be significantly increased by bio cohesion such as extra cellular polymeric substance eps malpezzi et al 2013 passow and alldredge 1995 for energetic aquatic systems flow turbulence is considered as the dominant mechanism driving particle collision which is quantified by the turbulent shear rate mhashhash et al 2018 spicer and pratsinis 1996 this is directly responsible for floc formation and the growth of different floc sizes and their respective densities porosity e g lawrence et al 2022 simultaneous with the aggregation process the flocs can experience a fragmentation breakup that decreases their size due to turbulent shear in energetic environments flocs can maintain their complex structures up to a specific size because of the floc strength maintained by inter particle bonds bache et al 1999 jarvis et al 2005 the flocs become more fragile as their size increases and flocs can be broken up when a shear or tensile stress overcomes the floc strength yeung and pelton 1996 unfortunately quantifying the floc strength is not trivial due to difficulties in direct measurement and a variety of factors such as mineral types zeta potential floc structures turbulent shear must be quantified jarvis et al 2005 sharp et al 2006 spencer et al 2022 thus most of the numerical models use a constant value of the floc strength for simplicity maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 in this study we investigate the limitation of the constant floc yield strength assumption and begin to explore an alternative with satisfactory results the single floc size statistic method winterwerp 1998 is usually implemented to track the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 although this method has been used in many studies kuprenas et al 2018 son and hsu 2009 it is not designed to represent the complex floc size distribution on the other hand the most detailed method is to simulate flocculation using a grain resolved approach since it tracks all the individual cohesive particles in a fully resolving turbulence field vowinckel et al 2019 this allows to compute the floc strength and the fractal dimension by analyzing the bonds between the primary particles and the floc size shape the challenge lies in its limitation to represent practical flocculation problems due to its high computational cost the middle ground approaches are to model the floc size distributions the distribution based model maerz and wirtz 2009 requires the assumption of a fixed distribution which constrains the bimodal floc behaviors observed in aquatic systems lee et al 2011 manning and dyer 2007 soulsby et al 2013 this limitation can be overcome by solving population balance equations pbe that calculate the number of flocs for each given size class while maintaining the mass balance verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 many studies focus on calibrating multiple model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model using the equilibrium or temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 jeldres et al 2015 shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or floc size distribution at the equilibrium state coufort et al 2007 a systematic pbe model calibration was carried out by mietta et al 2011 using temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 and the equilibrium floc size distribution for a wide variety of compositions clay type salt type and different salinity importantly using the temporal evolution of d 50 this study showed an inverse proportionality between the collisional efficiency and the zeta potential however it is unclear whether the optimal model parameters can be well constrained by these limited physical quantities motivated by the increasing popularity of pbe flocculation models for cohesive sediment transport applications liu et al 2019 sherwood et al 2018 the main goal of this study is to advance the understanding of several key model parameters of the pbe flocculation model and how they determine the resulting temporal evolution of floc size statistics driven by a constant turbulent shear rate motivated by the earlier studies on pbe modeling verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 and floc yield strength e g jarvis et al 2005 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 confirm whether the median floc size statistics d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is sufficient to constrain the model parameters 2 investigate if the model parameters can be better constrained by using the temporal evolution of different floc size statistics and 3 understand the importance of floc yield strength in the predicted floc size statistics the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the pbe based size class flocculation model and the laboratory data used section 3 focuses on extensive model investigations and error analyses for predicting the measured data section 4 is dedicated to investigating the floc yield strength in the flocculation model and section 5 concludes this study 2 flocculation model description and configuration 2 1 pbe based size class flocculation model the pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney et al 2011 is adopted to study the physics of flocculation the model is based on solving pbes namely the temporal evolution of the number concentration of each floc size class i e number based distribution in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow and it can be written as 1 d n k d t g a g g r k g b r e a k s h e a r k l a g g r k l b r e a k s h e a r k where n unit m 3 is the number concentration number of flocs per unit volume of the k t h floc size class t is time s g and l with subscripts represent the gain and loss of class k flocs due to aggregation subscript a g g r or breakup induced by turbulent shear stress subscript b r e a k s h e a r in estuarine and coastal environments flows are generally energetic and the model assumes that the turbulent shear is the dominant mechanism driving flocculation other aggregation mechanisms resulting from brownian motion and differential settling are neglected maggi et al 2007 for the low sediment concentration considered in this study we also neglect the gain and loss of class k due to collision induced breakup the gain g a g g r and loss l a g g r by aggregation are written as 2 g a g g r k 1 2 i j k α a i j n i n j 3 l a g g r k i 1 n α a i k n i n k where a is the two body collision probability function for spherical particles and α is the collisional efficiency which parameterizes the sticking properties of flocs and other physical processes not modeled by a e g preferential accumulation that encourages collision or the effect of porosity this parameter α is assumed constant for the calibration process following verney et al 2011 since we assume that the main driving force for flocculation is the turbulent shear the two body collision probability function depends on the turbulent shear rate s and the diameters of two colliding flocs written as 4 a i j 1 6 s d i d j 3 where d i and d j are the spherical equivalent diameters of two colliding flocs of discrete classes i and j the gain g b r e a k s h e a r and loss l b r e a k s h e a r by breakup driven by turbulent shear stress s are defined as 5 g b r e a k s h e a r k i k 1 f d b s k i b i n i 6 l b r e a k s h e a r k b k n k where f d b s is the distribution function of fragmented flocs representing the gain of daughter flocs from larger floc size classes following verney et al 2011 we specify the binary distribution assuming that the mass of a floc after breakup is divided in half the rate at which flocs break due to the turbulent shear rate s is given by the function b and it is defined as 7 b i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d where d p is the primary particle diameter f d is the fractal dimension kranenburg 1994 for equivalent spherical diameter and β is the fragmentation rate the fragmentation rate is in fact a dimensional quantity s 1 2 m 1 and it is written as maggi et al 2007 winterwerp 1998 8 β e μ f y 1 2 where μ p a s is the dynamic viscosity of water e is an empirical dimensionless parameter and f y n is the floc yield strength although β is a dimensional quantity it is assumed to be an empirical constant in verney et al 2011 this inevitably presumes that the floc yield strength f y is a constant which is consistent with the fractal approach kranenburg 1994 because the direct measurement of floc yield strength is difficult the assumption of a constant f y is commonly adopted by many other studies e g maggi et al 2007 wang et al 2013 verney et al 2011 have pointed out that both the collisional efficiency α and fragmentation rate β are sensitive model parameters that need to be calibrated first with a given cohesive sediment sample although the fractal dimension f d has been estimated from many laboratory and field experiments e g manning et al 2010 to be around 2 to 2 5 and there may be a floc size dependency khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 such that larger flocs are more porous and the interparticle bonds are smaller assuming a constant fractal dimension within a given flocculation experiment remains to be the most practical approach to successfully calibrate these three empirical parameters concurrently for a given experiment sufficient information from the measured data is necessary and a proper calibration strategy may also benefit from a more thorough examination of the governing equations to be solved by substituting equations 2 to 6 into the equation 1 the resulting number concentration equation of each floc size class k is written as 9 d n k d t 1 2 i j k α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i i 1 n α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n k β s 3 2 d k d k d p d p 3 f d n k during the initial stage of the flocculation i e floc growth stage the breakup terms can be neglected the second and fourth term on the right hand side rhs of equation 9 since flocs must grow from small flocs or primary particles and the aggregation terms first and third terms on the rhs are dominant this means that a model calibration focusing on the initial flow growth stage allows us to mainly calibrate α mietta et al 2011 however beyond the initial floc growth stage the breakup terms must become important because there must be a balance between aggregation and breakup so that an equilibrium can be reached following the analysis presented in winterwerp 1998 mean equilibrium floc size must depend on the ratio of r α β and fractal dimension f d therefore both the equilibrium stage and the initial floc growth stage should be considered for a complete calibration procedure further insights into equilibrium floc size distribution can be gained by setting d n k d t 0 in equation 9 which renders an expression for number concentration of each floc size class as 10 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i 1 6 r s 1 2 i 1 n d i d j 3 n i d k d k d p d p 3 f d in addition to r α β and f d the breakup distributions functions f d b s k i also control the floc size distribution and must be considered in the calibration however the physical evidence of floc breakup distribution function is limited and most studies assume a binary breakup nevertheless if we focus on very large floc fractions e g macroflocs their gain due to breakup g b r e a k s h e a r and loss due to aggregation l a g g r can be assumed insignificant compared with the smaller size fraction therefore equation 10 for the very large floc size fraction can be reduced approximately to 11 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j d k d k d p d p 3 f d where the breakup distribution function f d b s k i disappears comparing the modeled large floc size statistic with measured data allows calibrating the parameters α β and f d with minimum impact of f d b s k i on the other hand the breakup distribution function f d b s k i must be important for fine floc fractions thus calibrating different size class statistics is valuable particularly for the coarse floc fraction to avoid uncertainty in f d b s k i additional analysis of equation 9 is performed to compare the aggregation and breakup timescales following winterwerp 1998 we estimate the initial floc growth timescale using the aggregation term in the equation 9 and it is written as 12 t agg 1 α s ϕ f k where ϕ f k is the volumetric concentration of floc of size class k the above expression shows that the collisional efficiency α controls the initial floc growth timescale and an appropriate calibration process for α should be based on the initial growth time series mietta et al 2011 on the other hand at the later stage of the floc growth before reaching equilibrium the floc breakup must play an important role to counteract aggregation we can examine the breakup timescale as inversely proportional to β and s 3 2 as 13 t b r k 1 β s 3 2 for example to expedite floc growth at the later transient stage the breakup timescale must be decreased by increasing β i e increase the effect of breakup which is equivalent to reducing floc yield strength this point will be revisited in section 4 2 2 experimental data keyvani and strom 2014 report a flocculation experiment in a mixing tank using a mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite clay the flocculation experiment was performed for approximately 1800 m i n by using a total sediment mass concentration of c 0 05 k g m 3 and a homogeneous turbulence shear rate s of 35 s 1 hence the study neglects more complex transport mechanism such as differential advection and settling although homogeneous turbulence is highly idealized it allows a comprehensive calibration of model parameters before the model can be used in conditions with increasing complexity in addition to the measured median floc diameter d 50 at equilibrium keyvani and strom 2014 also provide measured temporal evolutions of three different floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see fig 1 by computing a series of image ensemble every 1 to 5 minute depending on the phase growth or equilibrium this comprehensive dataset is selected to calibrate key empirical model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 we simulate three important aspects in the measured time series the equilibrium state t 700 m i n in fig 1 the floc growth stage t 200 m i n in fig 1 and the entire time series in particular matching the modeled initial floc growth stage with measured data allows us to evaluate the model s ability to predict the flocculation rate which has been used by other studies to further quantify the stickiness of flocs ye et al 2021 and to calibrate collisional efficiency mietta et al 2011 the abundance of measured data allows a deeper calibration of the model parameters 2 3 flocculation model configuration following keyvani and strom 2014 the total mass concentration and turbulent shear rate from the experiment are prescribed accordingly in the flocculation model the minimum floc size diameter is established as d min 4 μ m which corresponds to the diameter of the primary particle typically used for flocculation modeling winterwerp 1998 the maximum floc size is specified to be d max 300 μ m to ensure the modeled distribution is sufficiently wide and to avoid fluctuations in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see figure s1 in supplementary material since keyvani and strom 2014 did not discuss the initial floc size distribution our exploratory numerical experiments show that using a log normal distribution represents the experimental data better than punctual distribution especially at the early stage of floc growth see figure s2 in supplementary material following verney et al 2011 an explicit euler time integrator is implemented to solve the pbes equation 1 with an initial time step size equal to 1 s which is also specified as the maximum allowable time step size throughout the integration if this value is insufficient to preserve the total sediment mass within a threshold the time step is decreased by half and the cycle is recomputed until the mass conservation criterion is satisfied the flocculation model of verney et al 2011 requires the use of many classes to discretize the floc diameter distribution therefore establishing the minimum number needed for an accurate numerical solution of the size distribution is an important step the evaluation is carried out with different numbers of size class n c to discretize the distribution verney et al 2011 recommended n c 15 to be sufficient based on calibrating the median floc size d 50 at the equilibrium state however our results suggest that even at n c 25 the low resolution negatively affects the predicted temporal evolution and hence the flocculation rate see the first 80 minutes of floc growth in fig 2 a for fine median and coarse fractions another issue is the pronounced step like feature during the floc growth when n c is small careful examination of the model results indicates that the step like feature is due to coarse numerical discretization of the floc size distribution but not the time step the absence of certain size classes causes a jump in modeled size statistics during floc growth a converged solution can be obtained when n c 75 in fig 2b we evaluate this convergence by using the root mean square error r m s e c from the target solution using n c 200 large errors are observed when n c 15 especially for the coarse fraction r m s e c d 84 40 μ m by increasing the n c to 25 and 50 the errors decrease significantly our additional numerical experiments suggest that the convergence evaluation is not sensitive to a variation of model parameter of α β and f d within a reasonable range in the rest of the paper we use n c 75 to maintain an affordable computational time around 20 minutes per simulation in workstation with r m s e c d 16 50 84 0 5 3 μ m 3 results motivated by the previous study of verney et al 2011 we concurrently calibrate α and β to match measured data and evaluate if the resulting fractal dimension f d falls within the expected range 6 400 simulations were carried out using α 5 10 2 80 10 2 with an interval of 5 10 2 and β 2 10 3 80 10 3 with an interval of 2 10 3 for ten different fractal dimension values in the range of 1 7 to 2 9 all simulations use a computational time of 1800 m i n using the measured data keyvani and strom 2014 as reference three different rmse are computed to evaluate the model performance at the equilibrium state r m s e e q t 700 m i n the growth stage of flocculation r m s e f r t 200 m i n and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p for the tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see figures s3 s5 in the supplemental material in section 3 1 and 3 2 the search for the optimized parameters α β and f d is carried out exclusively to match measured d 50 by these three criteria namely minimizing the errors at the equilibrium state min r m s e e q d 50 at the initial growth stage of flocculation min r m s e f r d 50 and for the entire time series min r m s e f p d 50 in section 3 3 two more criteria are imposed objective functions by matching measured fine and coarse fractions i e min r m s e f p d 16 and min r m s e f p d 84 3 1 temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 the median floc size d 50 is the most widely reported quantity in laboratory experiments and field observations we analyze the model s capability to represent the flocculation process using exclusively d 50 with constraints of the parameters α β and f d moreover since many studies only report the median floc size in the equilibrium state it is important to investigate if the model can reproduce the entire measured time series by solely calibrating model parameters using the equilibrium median floc size using the measured data from keyvani and strom 2014 as reference the rsme at the equilibrium state r m s e e q d 50 t 700 m i n is calculated for the 6 400 simulations and results are summarized in fig 3 for all combinations of the parameters α β for any given f d each interaction between these parameters is examined in a simulation with the error magnitudes demarcated by a hot colormap the dark red color represents excellent agreement with measured d 50 in the equilibrium state importantly all the fractal dimensions f d 1 7 2 9 show multiple choices of α and β that are in very good agreement r m s e e q d 50 1 72 μ m the finite value of 1 72 μ m reflects the variabilities in the measured data with the measured d 50 at the equilibrium state clearly low error values cluster around a line with a constant slope for each fractal dimension indicating that the best agreement is obtained at a nearly constant α β ratio regardless of the individual α and β values this finding is consistent with that reported by verney et al 2011 in addition to the multiple choices of the α and β pair another important limitation of using only the equilibrium d 50 data to calibrate the flocculation model is that excellent agreement can be found for very large e g f d 2 9 or very low e g f d 1 7 fractal dimension values outside the typical range for mud as we will discuss next despite the multiple options for α and β pairs to match the equilibrium d 50 the predicted time series of d 50 for some of the options are not acceptable see fig 4 at this point we can conclude that sole measurement of d 50 in the equilibrium state is insufficient to narrow the values of α β and f d additional characteristics of the flocculation statistics should be considered for an improved model calibration since there are multiple pairs of α β values that satisfy minimizing errors in the equilibrium state with min rmseed50 1 72 μm we sequentially applied the second criterion of minimizing the error values at the initial stage of the flocculation t 200 min min rmsefrd50 the predicted time series associated with the best and the worst agreement with measured data for the initial stage of flocculation rmsefrd50 are presented for the fractal dimension in the range of f d 1 9 2 9 see fig 4 the calibrated parameter values and respective minimum errors at a given fractal dimension are detailed in table 1 the predicted time series using the pair of α β that matches the equilibrium d 50 but having large error of rmsefrd50 are clearly far from satisfactory see red lines in fig 4 this confirms that using solely the first criterion of minimizing the equilibrium median floc size errors is insufficient to predict the entire time series of median floc size evolution however applying first the criterion of min rmsefrd50 followed by the second criterion of min rmsefrd50 yields generally good agreement with the measured data for the entire time series when f d 2 2 2 7 see blue lines in figure 4c 4i with a rmsefrd50 2 8 μm see best in table 1 further analysis confirmed that the same results can be obtained by simply minimizing the errors of the entire flocculation time series i e using the objective function min rmsefpd50 nevertheless we emphasize our main point that one should proceed with caution when utilizing the equilibrium data as the only model calibration criterion this result also confirms the importance of matching the flocculation time series to obtain adequate aggregation timescale t a g g because it provides a nearly independent data to calibrate α mietta et al 2011 we further explore the benefits of simply minimizing the errors present at the initial floc growth stage the best calibrated model parameters and error values can be found in table 2 as expected this approach decreases the errors in the predicted flocculation rate cf rmsefrd50 in table 1 and table 2 the equilibrium state is affected negatively rmseeqd50 values increase from 1 72 μ m to 6 06 μ m for fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 but only slightly fig 5 illustrates visually these consequences where the floc growth stage is predicted well but the agreement in the equilibrium value is slightly reduced this approach also allows us to narrow down the choice of fractal dimension based on the best three min rmsefrd50 to be f d 2 4 2 5 2 6 when evaluating the agreement for the entire time series we observe that rmsefpd50 is around 5 7 μ m for f d 2 4 2 6 this is considered good agreement as only one criterion of min rmsefrd50 is adopted we can also conclude that the pbe based size class flocculation model has a good capability of predicting equilibrium median floc size once the key model parameters are calibrated for predicting the initial growth of flocculation i e the flocculation rate 3 2 tri temporal floc size statistics using min rmsefrd50 since the best calibrated cases that match the measured temporal evolution of median floc size are obtained for a wide range of fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 see fig 4 rmsefpd50 2 8 μm the selection of a unique set of α β parameters is not yet conclusive fortunately keyvani and strom 2014 provide two more measured floc size statistics of d 16 and d 84 and these are added to the model calibration to evaluate the possibility of further constraining the model parameters fig 6 illustrates the predicted tri temporal floc size statistics d 50 d 16 and d 84 at the six fractal dimension values f d 2 2 2 7 using the α β parameters that achieve the best agreement for the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 recall fig 4 at the initial floc growth stage t 30 m i n good agreement can be seen for both the fine d 16 and coarse d 84 fractions fig 6 however larger discrepancies arise before reaching the equilibrium stage 30 m i n t 200 m i n for the coarse floc fraction as discussed before see equation 13 this means that the breakup timescale t b r k for d 84 should be reduced increase the effect of breakup moreover it becomes clear that by minimizing the error for the median floc size d 50 the equilibrium floc statistics for the finer fraction d 16 is under predicted by the model while the coarse fraction d 84 is over predicted identifying the optimum parameters hierarchically to represent the tri temporal floc size statistics from fig 6 can be difficult based on its similar trend across the fractal dimension values therefore we evaluate the error values during the initial growth stage of the flocculation r m s e f r and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p in a wider range of fractal dimension f d 1 7 2 9 see fig 7 the r m s e f r confirms the discrimination process for the lowest f d 2 1 and highest f d 2 9 fractal dimension since their errors increase considerably regarding the fractal dimensions f d 2 2 2 7 the r m s e f r for the median floc size statistics d 50 behaves in a quasi stable way however the error values for d 16 and d 84 show opposite trends when one of them is minimized see f d 2 3 and f d 2 7 looking at the average performance for these floc fractions the first second and third option are f d 2 7 2 6 and 2 4 respectively see dashed black line in fig 7a this result can also be obtained when computing the mean value of r m s e f p see fig 7b 3 3 tri temporal floc size statistics using min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 through a systematic error analysis of d 50 for the initial floc growth and the entire flocculation process presented in the previous sections optimal model parameters are obtained however the predicted fine d 16 and coarse d 84 floc fractions are adversely affected that is better agreement in the fine fraction comes at the expense of worse agreement in the coarse fraction now we evaluate the possibility to narrow the flocculation model parameters and improve the overall agreement by minimizing the fine or coarse floc sizes statistic errors i e min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 using the same systematic error analysis the criterion of minimizing the fine fraction min r m s e f p d 16 produces non satisfactory results for the overall floc size statistics since the coarse fraction d 84 stands out for its high error values r m s e f p d 84 34 62 μ m this magnitude is higher than r m s e f p d 84 obtained by using the previous criterion min r m s e f p d 50 error comparisons are presented in the supplementary material figure s6 and they are not further discussed here conversely applying the criterion min r m s e f p d 84 shows satisfactory results especially in the r m s e f r values since the best value is distinguished from the other acceptable errors see f d 2 5 in fig 8 a however the minimum value of r m s e f p averaged over the three size statistics is located at f d 2 9 fig 8b this is a limitation in the flocculation model since f d 2 9 is a much higher than expected value for typical flocs considering the error analysis criterion for the initial floc growth stage the optimum fractal dimension is selected to be f d 2 5 see black line in fig 8a the tri temporal floc size statistics for three selected cases are presented in fig 9 we established previously for the equilibrium state that minimizing the median floc size errors leads to over and under predicted results for coarse and fine flocs respectively see also fig 9a and 9b hence the difference between case 1 with f d 2 4 and case 2 with f d 2 7 lies mainly in the degree of agreement to represent the coarse fraction d 84 see r m s e e q values in table 2 since case 2 with f d 2 7 shows 49 12 better agreement compared to case 1 this contrast can also be noticed in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see blue dashed line vs red solid line in fig 10 comparing with case 1 case 2 relocates a small amount of sediment mass in the coarse fraction to the median and fine fractions due to a relatively larger breakup effect signified by smaller r α β 7 432 value in case 2 using a lower fractal dimension of f d 2 5 in case 3 allows for an even lower r 6 7 i e the breakup is stronger in case 3 than in case 1 and 2 which significantly reduces the sediment mass in the coarse fraction see smaller d 84 in fig 9c and this is evidently due to a more significant relocation of mass from the coarse fraction to the finer fraction see a shift of sediment mass distribution to the left represented by the black dashed line in fig 10 case 3 proves the need of increasing the effect of breakup or lower breakup timescale t b r k for the coarse fraction which can be achieved by increase the fragmentation rate β section 4 investigates this possibility by considering a lower floc yield strength for larger flocs 4 discussion effect of floc yield strength the results presented in section 3 indicate that by rigorously calibrating the pbe based size class flocculation model against measured tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 we can identify several combinations of the model parameters α β and f d that show good agreement with measured data however there are still uncertainties in the selection of the best model parameters particularly in case 2 which has the best agreement but with a high value of the fractal dimension of 2 7 in this section we include one other significant physical quantity in the model parameters to improve the overall agreement to avoid overfitting model results the choice of the additional physics to be included must first be justified motivated by improving the limited capability of the model to represent the coarse and fine fractions simultaneously and the need to increase floc breakup or decrease t b r k for the coarse floc fraction we evaluate the effect of considering the fragmentation rate β as a function of floc size as shown in equation 8 the fragmentation rate β is a function of the empirical coefficient e fluid viscosity μ and floc yield strength f y the justification of treating β as a constant is to assume the floc yield strength is a constant in the literature floc yield strength is routinely assumed to be f y 10 10 n in flocculation modeling and the model calibrations are carried out either through the coefficient e or directly using the parameter β maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 however in the water quality literature jarvis et al 2015 presented a review of many laboratory measurements of floc yield strength or yield stress which indicated that the floc yield strength f y is inversely proportional to the floc size e g bache et al 1999 yeung and pelton 1996 in other words when a floc grows to a sufficient size the larger the floc size is the easier the floc can be broken by turbulent shear this fact is supported by our error analysis presented in section 3 fig 11 presents the best calibrated β values by minimizing the error in the three size fractions d 16 d 50 and d 84 plotted as a function of fractal dimension between 2 3 and 2 6 we observe a clear trend in each fractal dimension that the larger the size fraction when the error is minimized the larger β or smaller f y is required moreover this trend agrees with the need to decrease the breakup timescale t b r k for coarse fraction as has been stated in the previous section hence we investigate the effect of considering the floc yield strength f y inversely proportional to floc size since measuring the floc yield strength as a function of floc size can be difficult and most studies of cohesive sediment transport do not report such data as a first step we propose to model the floc yield strength in terms of microflocs and macroflocs manning and dyer 2007 and divide the fragmentation rate β into two different values accordingly to distinguish these two groups a floc size limit d l is defined such that the fragmentation rate of flocs with a size smaller larger than d l is specified as β micro while the fragmentation rate of flocs larger than d l is specified as β macro we investigate the effect of applying the two value fragmentation rate by simulating case 1a and case 3a which are variants of case 1 and case 3 having the same values of α and f d found in section 3 2 as for β micro and β macro the mean value between these two fragmentation rates in case 1a and case 3a match with the constant β value used in case 1 and case 3 respectively while satisfying the physical behavior of higher tendency for breakup in macroflocs with β macro β micro the use of the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case1a shows a remarkable improvement compared to using a constant β method in case 1 with f d 2 4 for the coarse fraction d 84 under the criterion min r m s e f p d 50 the over predicted errors r m s e f p d 84 for the entire time series in case 1 fig 12 a are significantly reduced from 16 43 μ m to 4 66 μ m nearly a factor 4 reduction of error compare table 3 and 4 the same improvement can be seen for the fine fraction d 16 with an error value r m s e f p d 16 reducing from 11 27 μ m to 3 38 μ m furthermore these improvements preserve the excellent agreement of d 50 because the r m s e e q d 50 maintains its low error values errors slightly increase by 5 from 2 54 μ m to 2 67 μ m for the floc growth stage using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case 1a significantly improves the agreement for the coarse fraction r m s e f r d 84 decreases from 20 3 μ m to 9 87 μ m about a factor 2 smaller while only marginally decreasing the agreement for the median 11 increase of error and fine 42 increase of error fraction evaluating the overall performance through the mean error values we observe a factor 3 reduction of errors for the entire time series m e a n r m s e f p reduces from 10 08 μ m to 3 57 μ m the improvement by using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate is particularly significant for equilibrium floc sizes relatively minor improvement is observed for case 3a f d 2 5 see table 4 when the two value fragmentation rate is applied see fig 12b this is partly because the agreement in the coarse fraction when using a single value β is already good see case 3 in table 3 e g r m s e f p for d 84 is only 3 77 μ m however the improvement for median fraction and fine fractions by using the two value fragmentation rate for the entire time series is evident as it is quantified by an error reduction from 10 15 μ m to 5 68 μ m and from 16 45 μ m to 11 3 μ m respectively as for the floc growth stage the two value fragmentation rate also reduces the errors by a factor of about 1 6 and 2 5 for d 16 and d 50 correspondingly however the error for the coarse fraction shows a small increase of 39 a numerical experiment has been carried out for case 2 with a high fractal dimension of 2 7 we obtain the similar conclusion that the improvement by using a two value fragmentation rate in case 2 is very good but not as effective as in case 1 the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state is another important characteristic that can be used to compare the two value fragmentation rate approach with the constant β approach see fig 12c and 12d when the fractal dimension is f d 2 4 a reduction of the mass concentration in case 1a is observed for floc classes lower than 55 25 μ m and higher than 118 μ m compare the red line with the black line in fig 12c as a result of mass conservation the mass concentration distribution over the floc size classes is squeezed laterally and the concentration between the floc classes 55 25 118 μ m increases consequently the equilibrium floc statistics for coarse d 84 fine d 16 fraction must decrease increase a similar behavior can be seen when the fractal dimension is f d 2 5 in case 3a but with a different feature for instance using a single value fragmentation rate the equilibrium floc size for the coarse fraction d 84 is already in good agreement with measured data interestingly the use of a two value fragmentation rate effectively decreases the mass concentration in the fine fraction and moves the mass toward the median fraction fig 12d while the coarse fraction is nearly unchanged specifically the mass concentration increases between 69 77 157 9 μ m see fig 12d and decreases in finer fraction d i 69 77 μ m there is a very small increase of mass concentration in the coarser fraction d i 157 9 μ m conclusion we present a systematic investigation of the key model parameters for the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 using the experimental data reported by keyvani and strom 2014 an analysis on constraining the key model parameters namely the collisional efficiency fragmentation rate and fractal dimension is first carried out for the median floc size statistics d 50 a criterion based on minimizing the equilibrium state median floc size errors provides multiple options of model parameters with many of them misleading since they fail to match the measured initial floc growth the agreement can be significantly improved by applying a second criterion sequentially minimizing the error for the floc growth stage or equivalently by minimizing the entire flocculation time series of d 50 interestingly utilizing the objective function of simply minimizing the error for the floc growth stage min r m s e f r d 50 shows generally good agreement with the entire measured time series of flocculation confirming a good predictive ability of the present pbe flocculation model the resulting model parameters are constrained to multiple options of fractal dimension in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 and we conclude that the median floc size d 50 alone is insufficient to constrain the flocculation model parameters the pbe flocculation model can reasonably predict d 16 and d 84 using solely the calibration results from the median floc sizes d 50 in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 the best two options with minimum errors are selected for f d 2 4 and f d 2 7 with the latter selected because of its good agreement with measured coarse fraction d 84 even though the f d value is higher than expected evaluating two different criteria based on minimizing the entire temporal floc size statistic errors of d 16 and d 84 indicates that minimizing the errors in the fine fraction is not viable due to the high errors in the coarse fraction on the contrary minimizing the error in the coarse fraction shows good agreement with the measured floc growth at f d 2 5 and suggests that the coarse fraction requires lower breakup timescale or increased breakup to balance the aggregation to improve the model s predictive ability for fine median and coarse fractions at typically expected fractal dimension ranges for cohesive sediment we propose a two value fragmentation rate approach floc yield strength is smaller for macroflocs than microflocs motivated by limited measured data in the water quality literature and the present model analysis for a single fragmentation rate β which clearly shows a positive correlation between calibrated β and floc size see fig 11 the results from the two value fragmentation rate approach demonstrate significant improvement in representing the tri temporal floc size statistics compared with data from using a constant β especially for the case of lower fractal dimension at f d 2 4 findings reported in this study are based on modeling the measured three floc size statistics in homogenous turbulence for a single type of clay reported by keyvani and strom 2014 therefore this work calls for future research on expanding the knowledge of floc yield strength for more diverse configurations for instance more laboratory data of temporal floc size distribution for a wide range of turbulence intensity and clay types are needed moreover direct measurements of floc yield strength as a function of floc size are needed for numerical modeling coupling the pbe model with a boundary layer sediment transport model to further investigate the role of flocculation dynamics on settling advection and turbulent suspension of

15001,many aquatic environments contain cohesive sediments that flocculate and create flocs with a wide range of sizes the population balance equation pbe flocculation model is designed to predict the time dependent floc size distribution and should be more complete than models based on median floc size however a pbe flocculation model includes many empirical parameters to represent important physical chemical and biological processes we report a systematic investigation of key model parameters of the open source pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney lafite claude brun cottan and le hir 2011 using the measured temporal floc size statistics reported by keyvani and strom 2014 at a constant turbulent shear rate s results show that the median floc size d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is insufficient to constrain the model parameters a comprehensive error analysis shows that the model is capable of predicting three floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 which also reveals a clear trend that the best calibrated fragmentation rate inverse of floc yield strength is proportional to the floc size statistics considered motivated by this finding the importance of floc yield strength is demonstrated in the predicted temporal evolution of floc size by modeling the floc yield strength as microflocs and macroflocs giving two corresponding fragmentation rates the model shows a significantly improved agreement in matching the measured floc size statistics keywords flocculation population balance equation cohesive sediment yield strength data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unlike non cohesive sediment such as sand cohesive sediments exhibit a unique physical process called flocculation that causes individual particles to stick together when two or more particles collide through flocculation the role of cohesive sediments in aquatic environments has a crucial impact on the ecosystem when particulate concentrations in the water column are high aquatic organisms face severe consequences due to the absence of photosynthesis low levels of dissolved oxygen and depletion of energy sources jones et al 2012 vaz et al 2019 simultaneously cohesive sediments exert a fundamental control on the fate of nutrients and organic matter and hence alter the water quality asmala et al 2022 furthermore low density hydrophobic substances such as oil droplets can be deposited on the seafloor due to flocculation with suspended particulate matters daly et al 2016 ye et al 2021 therefore studying flocculation dynamics of cohesive sediment is an important and thriving research subject in aquatic science and engineering flocculation is defined by two main processes that coexist simultaneously aggregation and fragmentation breakup aggregation may take place when cations from dissolved salt in water create surface bridging around clay particles and decrease their repulsion force sutherland et al 2015 moreover cohesion between particles can be significantly increased by bio cohesion such as extra cellular polymeric substance eps malpezzi et al 2013 passow and alldredge 1995 for energetic aquatic systems flow turbulence is considered as the dominant mechanism driving particle collision which is quantified by the turbulent shear rate mhashhash et al 2018 spicer and pratsinis 1996 this is directly responsible for floc formation and the growth of different floc sizes and their respective densities porosity e g lawrence et al 2022 simultaneous with the aggregation process the flocs can experience a fragmentation breakup that decreases their size due to turbulent shear in energetic environments flocs can maintain their complex structures up to a specific size because of the floc strength maintained by inter particle bonds bache et al 1999 jarvis et al 2005 the flocs become more fragile as their size increases and flocs can be broken up when a shear or tensile stress overcomes the floc strength yeung and pelton 1996 unfortunately quantifying the floc strength is not trivial due to difficulties in direct measurement and a variety of factors such as mineral types zeta potential floc structures turbulent shear must be quantified jarvis et al 2005 sharp et al 2006 spencer et al 2022 thus most of the numerical models use a constant value of the floc strength for simplicity maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 in this study we investigate the limitation of the constant floc yield strength assumption and begin to explore an alternative with satisfactory results the single floc size statistic method winterwerp 1998 is usually implemented to track the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 although this method has been used in many studies kuprenas et al 2018 son and hsu 2009 it is not designed to represent the complex floc size distribution on the other hand the most detailed method is to simulate flocculation using a grain resolved approach since it tracks all the individual cohesive particles in a fully resolving turbulence field vowinckel et al 2019 this allows to compute the floc strength and the fractal dimension by analyzing the bonds between the primary particles and the floc size shape the challenge lies in its limitation to represent practical flocculation problems due to its high computational cost the middle ground approaches are to model the floc size distributions the distribution based model maerz and wirtz 2009 requires the assumption of a fixed distribution which constrains the bimodal floc behaviors observed in aquatic systems lee et al 2011 manning and dyer 2007 soulsby et al 2013 this limitation can be overcome by solving population balance equations pbe that calculate the number of flocs for each given size class while maintaining the mass balance verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 many studies focus on calibrating multiple model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model using the equilibrium or temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 jeldres et al 2015 shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 or floc size distribution at the equilibrium state coufort et al 2007 a systematic pbe model calibration was carried out by mietta et al 2011 using temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 and the equilibrium floc size distribution for a wide variety of compositions clay type salt type and different salinity importantly using the temporal evolution of d 50 this study showed an inverse proportionality between the collisional efficiency and the zeta potential however it is unclear whether the optimal model parameters can be well constrained by these limited physical quantities motivated by the increasing popularity of pbe flocculation models for cohesive sediment transport applications liu et al 2019 sherwood et al 2018 the main goal of this study is to advance the understanding of several key model parameters of the pbe flocculation model and how they determine the resulting temporal evolution of floc size statistics driven by a constant turbulent shear rate motivated by the earlier studies on pbe modeling verney et al 2011 mietta et al 2011 and floc yield strength e g jarvis et al 2005 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 confirm whether the median floc size statistics d 50 in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth is sufficient to constrain the model parameters 2 investigate if the model parameters can be better constrained by using the temporal evolution of different floc size statistics and 3 understand the importance of floc yield strength in the predicted floc size statistics the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the pbe based size class flocculation model and the laboratory data used section 3 focuses on extensive model investigations and error analyses for predicting the measured data section 4 is dedicated to investigating the floc yield strength in the flocculation model and section 5 concludes this study 2 flocculation model description and configuration 2 1 pbe based size class flocculation model the pbe based size class flocculation model flocmod verney et al 2011 is adopted to study the physics of flocculation the model is based on solving pbes namely the temporal evolution of the number concentration of each floc size class i e number based distribution in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow and it can be written as 1 d n k d t g a g g r k g b r e a k s h e a r k l a g g r k l b r e a k s h e a r k where n unit m 3 is the number concentration number of flocs per unit volume of the k t h floc size class t is time s g and l with subscripts represent the gain and loss of class k flocs due to aggregation subscript a g g r or breakup induced by turbulent shear stress subscript b r e a k s h e a r in estuarine and coastal environments flows are generally energetic and the model assumes that the turbulent shear is the dominant mechanism driving flocculation other aggregation mechanisms resulting from brownian motion and differential settling are neglected maggi et al 2007 for the low sediment concentration considered in this study we also neglect the gain and loss of class k due to collision induced breakup the gain g a g g r and loss l a g g r by aggregation are written as 2 g a g g r k 1 2 i j k α a i j n i n j 3 l a g g r k i 1 n α a i k n i n k where a is the two body collision probability function for spherical particles and α is the collisional efficiency which parameterizes the sticking properties of flocs and other physical processes not modeled by a e g preferential accumulation that encourages collision or the effect of porosity this parameter α is assumed constant for the calibration process following verney et al 2011 since we assume that the main driving force for flocculation is the turbulent shear the two body collision probability function depends on the turbulent shear rate s and the diameters of two colliding flocs written as 4 a i j 1 6 s d i d j 3 where d i and d j are the spherical equivalent diameters of two colliding flocs of discrete classes i and j the gain g b r e a k s h e a r and loss l b r e a k s h e a r by breakup driven by turbulent shear stress s are defined as 5 g b r e a k s h e a r k i k 1 f d b s k i b i n i 6 l b r e a k s h e a r k b k n k where f d b s is the distribution function of fragmented flocs representing the gain of daughter flocs from larger floc size classes following verney et al 2011 we specify the binary distribution assuming that the mass of a floc after breakup is divided in half the rate at which flocs break due to the turbulent shear rate s is given by the function b and it is defined as 7 b i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d where d p is the primary particle diameter f d is the fractal dimension kranenburg 1994 for equivalent spherical diameter and β is the fragmentation rate the fragmentation rate is in fact a dimensional quantity s 1 2 m 1 and it is written as maggi et al 2007 winterwerp 1998 8 β e μ f y 1 2 where μ p a s is the dynamic viscosity of water e is an empirical dimensionless parameter and f y n is the floc yield strength although β is a dimensional quantity it is assumed to be an empirical constant in verney et al 2011 this inevitably presumes that the floc yield strength f y is a constant which is consistent with the fractal approach kranenburg 1994 because the direct measurement of floc yield strength is difficult the assumption of a constant f y is commonly adopted by many other studies e g maggi et al 2007 wang et al 2013 verney et al 2011 have pointed out that both the collisional efficiency α and fragmentation rate β are sensitive model parameters that need to be calibrated first with a given cohesive sediment sample although the fractal dimension f d has been estimated from many laboratory and field experiments e g manning et al 2010 to be around 2 to 2 5 and there may be a floc size dependency khelifa and hill 2006 maggi 2007 such that larger flocs are more porous and the interparticle bonds are smaller assuming a constant fractal dimension within a given flocculation experiment remains to be the most practical approach to successfully calibrate these three empirical parameters concurrently for a given experiment sufficient information from the measured data is necessary and a proper calibration strategy may also benefit from a more thorough examination of the governing equations to be solved by substituting equations 2 to 6 into the equation 1 the resulting number concentration equation of each floc size class k is written as 9 d n k d t 1 2 i j k α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i β s 3 2 d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i i 1 n α 1 6 s d i d j 3 n i n k β s 3 2 d k d k d p d p 3 f d n k during the initial stage of the flocculation i e floc growth stage the breakup terms can be neglected the second and fourth term on the right hand side rhs of equation 9 since flocs must grow from small flocs or primary particles and the aggregation terms first and third terms on the rhs are dominant this means that a model calibration focusing on the initial flow growth stage allows us to mainly calibrate α mietta et al 2011 however beyond the initial floc growth stage the breakup terms must become important because there must be a balance between aggregation and breakup so that an equilibrium can be reached following the analysis presented in winterwerp 1998 mean equilibrium floc size must depend on the ratio of r α β and fractal dimension f d therefore both the equilibrium stage and the initial floc growth stage should be considered for a complete calibration procedure further insights into equilibrium floc size distribution can be gained by setting d n k d t 0 in equation 9 which renders an expression for number concentration of each floc size class as 10 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j i k 1 f d b s k i d i d i d p d p 3 f d n i 1 6 r s 1 2 i 1 n d i d j 3 n i d k d k d p d p 3 f d in addition to r α β and f d the breakup distributions functions f d b s k i also control the floc size distribution and must be considered in the calibration however the physical evidence of floc breakup distribution function is limited and most studies assume a binary breakup nevertheless if we focus on very large floc fractions e g macroflocs their gain due to breakup g b r e a k s h e a r and loss due to aggregation l a g g r can be assumed insignificant compared with the smaller size fraction therefore equation 10 for the very large floc size fraction can be reduced approximately to 11 n k 1 12 r s 1 2 i j k d i d j 3 n i n j d k d k d p d p 3 f d where the breakup distribution function f d b s k i disappears comparing the modeled large floc size statistic with measured data allows calibrating the parameters α β and f d with minimum impact of f d b s k i on the other hand the breakup distribution function f d b s k i must be important for fine floc fractions thus calibrating different size class statistics is valuable particularly for the coarse floc fraction to avoid uncertainty in f d b s k i additional analysis of equation 9 is performed to compare the aggregation and breakup timescales following winterwerp 1998 we estimate the initial floc growth timescale using the aggregation term in the equation 9 and it is written as 12 t agg 1 α s ϕ f k where ϕ f k is the volumetric concentration of floc of size class k the above expression shows that the collisional efficiency α controls the initial floc growth timescale and an appropriate calibration process for α should be based on the initial growth time series mietta et al 2011 on the other hand at the later stage of the floc growth before reaching equilibrium the floc breakup must play an important role to counteract aggregation we can examine the breakup timescale as inversely proportional to β and s 3 2 as 13 t b r k 1 β s 3 2 for example to expedite floc growth at the later transient stage the breakup timescale must be decreased by increasing β i e increase the effect of breakup which is equivalent to reducing floc yield strength this point will be revisited in section 4 2 2 experimental data keyvani and strom 2014 report a flocculation experiment in a mixing tank using a mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite clay the flocculation experiment was performed for approximately 1800 m i n by using a total sediment mass concentration of c 0 05 k g m 3 and a homogeneous turbulence shear rate s of 35 s 1 hence the study neglects more complex transport mechanism such as differential advection and settling although homogeneous turbulence is highly idealized it allows a comprehensive calibration of model parameters before the model can be used in conditions with increasing complexity in addition to the measured median floc diameter d 50 at equilibrium keyvani and strom 2014 also provide measured temporal evolutions of three different floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see fig 1 by computing a series of image ensemble every 1 to 5 minute depending on the phase growth or equilibrium this comprehensive dataset is selected to calibrate key empirical model parameters in the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 we simulate three important aspects in the measured time series the equilibrium state t 700 m i n in fig 1 the floc growth stage t 200 m i n in fig 1 and the entire time series in particular matching the modeled initial floc growth stage with measured data allows us to evaluate the model s ability to predict the flocculation rate which has been used by other studies to further quantify the stickiness of flocs ye et al 2021 and to calibrate collisional efficiency mietta et al 2011 the abundance of measured data allows a deeper calibration of the model parameters 2 3 flocculation model configuration following keyvani and strom 2014 the total mass concentration and turbulent shear rate from the experiment are prescribed accordingly in the flocculation model the minimum floc size diameter is established as d min 4 μ m which corresponds to the diameter of the primary particle typically used for flocculation modeling winterwerp 1998 the maximum floc size is specified to be d max 300 μ m to ensure the modeled distribution is sufficiently wide and to avoid fluctuations in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see figure s1 in supplementary material since keyvani and strom 2014 did not discuss the initial floc size distribution our exploratory numerical experiments show that using a log normal distribution represents the experimental data better than punctual distribution especially at the early stage of floc growth see figure s2 in supplementary material following verney et al 2011 an explicit euler time integrator is implemented to solve the pbes equation 1 with an initial time step size equal to 1 s which is also specified as the maximum allowable time step size throughout the integration if this value is insufficient to preserve the total sediment mass within a threshold the time step is decreased by half and the cycle is recomputed until the mass conservation criterion is satisfied the flocculation model of verney et al 2011 requires the use of many classes to discretize the floc diameter distribution therefore establishing the minimum number needed for an accurate numerical solution of the size distribution is an important step the evaluation is carried out with different numbers of size class n c to discretize the distribution verney et al 2011 recommended n c 15 to be sufficient based on calibrating the median floc size d 50 at the equilibrium state however our results suggest that even at n c 25 the low resolution negatively affects the predicted temporal evolution and hence the flocculation rate see the first 80 minutes of floc growth in fig 2 a for fine median and coarse fractions another issue is the pronounced step like feature during the floc growth when n c is small careful examination of the model results indicates that the step like feature is due to coarse numerical discretization of the floc size distribution but not the time step the absence of certain size classes causes a jump in modeled size statistics during floc growth a converged solution can be obtained when n c 75 in fig 2b we evaluate this convergence by using the root mean square error r m s e c from the target solution using n c 200 large errors are observed when n c 15 especially for the coarse fraction r m s e c d 84 40 μ m by increasing the n c to 25 and 50 the errors decrease significantly our additional numerical experiments suggest that the convergence evaluation is not sensitive to a variation of model parameter of α β and f d within a reasonable range in the rest of the paper we use n c 75 to maintain an affordable computational time around 20 minutes per simulation in workstation with r m s e c d 16 50 84 0 5 3 μ m 3 results motivated by the previous study of verney et al 2011 we concurrently calibrate α and β to match measured data and evaluate if the resulting fractal dimension f d falls within the expected range 6 400 simulations were carried out using α 5 10 2 80 10 2 with an interval of 5 10 2 and β 2 10 3 80 10 3 with an interval of 2 10 3 for ten different fractal dimension values in the range of 1 7 to 2 9 all simulations use a computational time of 1800 m i n using the measured data keyvani and strom 2014 as reference three different rmse are computed to evaluate the model performance at the equilibrium state r m s e e q t 700 m i n the growth stage of flocculation r m s e f r t 200 m i n and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p for the tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 see figures s3 s5 in the supplemental material in section 3 1 and 3 2 the search for the optimized parameters α β and f d is carried out exclusively to match measured d 50 by these three criteria namely minimizing the errors at the equilibrium state min r m s e e q d 50 at the initial growth stage of flocculation min r m s e f r d 50 and for the entire time series min r m s e f p d 50 in section 3 3 two more criteria are imposed objective functions by matching measured fine and coarse fractions i e min r m s e f p d 16 and min r m s e f p d 84 3 1 temporal evolution of median floc size d 50 the median floc size d 50 is the most widely reported quantity in laboratory experiments and field observations we analyze the model s capability to represent the flocculation process using exclusively d 50 with constraints of the parameters α β and f d moreover since many studies only report the median floc size in the equilibrium state it is important to investigate if the model can reproduce the entire measured time series by solely calibrating model parameters using the equilibrium median floc size using the measured data from keyvani and strom 2014 as reference the rsme at the equilibrium state r m s e e q d 50 t 700 m i n is calculated for the 6 400 simulations and results are summarized in fig 3 for all combinations of the parameters α β for any given f d each interaction between these parameters is examined in a simulation with the error magnitudes demarcated by a hot colormap the dark red color represents excellent agreement with measured d 50 in the equilibrium state importantly all the fractal dimensions f d 1 7 2 9 show multiple choices of α and β that are in very good agreement r m s e e q d 50 1 72 μ m the finite value of 1 72 μ m reflects the variabilities in the measured data with the measured d 50 at the equilibrium state clearly low error values cluster around a line with a constant slope for each fractal dimension indicating that the best agreement is obtained at a nearly constant α β ratio regardless of the individual α and β values this finding is consistent with that reported by verney et al 2011 in addition to the multiple choices of the α and β pair another important limitation of using only the equilibrium d 50 data to calibrate the flocculation model is that excellent agreement can be found for very large e g f d 2 9 or very low e g f d 1 7 fractal dimension values outside the typical range for mud as we will discuss next despite the multiple options for α and β pairs to match the equilibrium d 50 the predicted time series of d 50 for some of the options are not acceptable see fig 4 at this point we can conclude that sole measurement of d 50 in the equilibrium state is insufficient to narrow the values of α β and f d additional characteristics of the flocculation statistics should be considered for an improved model calibration since there are multiple pairs of α β values that satisfy minimizing errors in the equilibrium state with min rmseed50 1 72 μm we sequentially applied the second criterion of minimizing the error values at the initial stage of the flocculation t 200 min min rmsefrd50 the predicted time series associated with the best and the worst agreement with measured data for the initial stage of flocculation rmsefrd50 are presented for the fractal dimension in the range of f d 1 9 2 9 see fig 4 the calibrated parameter values and respective minimum errors at a given fractal dimension are detailed in table 1 the predicted time series using the pair of α β that matches the equilibrium d 50 but having large error of rmsefrd50 are clearly far from satisfactory see red lines in fig 4 this confirms that using solely the first criterion of minimizing the equilibrium median floc size errors is insufficient to predict the entire time series of median floc size evolution however applying first the criterion of min rmsefrd50 followed by the second criterion of min rmsefrd50 yields generally good agreement with the measured data for the entire time series when f d 2 2 2 7 see blue lines in figure 4c 4i with a rmsefrd50 2 8 μm see best in table 1 further analysis confirmed that the same results can be obtained by simply minimizing the errors of the entire flocculation time series i e using the objective function min rmsefpd50 nevertheless we emphasize our main point that one should proceed with caution when utilizing the equilibrium data as the only model calibration criterion this result also confirms the importance of matching the flocculation time series to obtain adequate aggregation timescale t a g g because it provides a nearly independent data to calibrate α mietta et al 2011 we further explore the benefits of simply minimizing the errors present at the initial floc growth stage the best calibrated model parameters and error values can be found in table 2 as expected this approach decreases the errors in the predicted flocculation rate cf rmsefrd50 in table 1 and table 2 the equilibrium state is affected negatively rmseeqd50 values increase from 1 72 μ m to 6 06 μ m for fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 but only slightly fig 5 illustrates visually these consequences where the floc growth stage is predicted well but the agreement in the equilibrium value is slightly reduced this approach also allows us to narrow down the choice of fractal dimension based on the best three min rmsefrd50 to be f d 2 4 2 5 2 6 when evaluating the agreement for the entire time series we observe that rmsefpd50 is around 5 7 μ m for f d 2 4 2 6 this is considered good agreement as only one criterion of min rmsefrd50 is adopted we can also conclude that the pbe based size class flocculation model has a good capability of predicting equilibrium median floc size once the key model parameters are calibrated for predicting the initial growth of flocculation i e the flocculation rate 3 2 tri temporal floc size statistics using min rmsefrd50 since the best calibrated cases that match the measured temporal evolution of median floc size are obtained for a wide range of fractal dimension f d 2 2 2 7 see fig 4 rmsefpd50 2 8 μm the selection of a unique set of α β parameters is not yet conclusive fortunately keyvani and strom 2014 provide two more measured floc size statistics of d 16 and d 84 and these are added to the model calibration to evaluate the possibility of further constraining the model parameters fig 6 illustrates the predicted tri temporal floc size statistics d 50 d 16 and d 84 at the six fractal dimension values f d 2 2 2 7 using the α β parameters that achieve the best agreement for the temporal evolution of the median floc size d 50 recall fig 4 at the initial floc growth stage t 30 m i n good agreement can be seen for both the fine d 16 and coarse d 84 fractions fig 6 however larger discrepancies arise before reaching the equilibrium stage 30 m i n t 200 m i n for the coarse floc fraction as discussed before see equation 13 this means that the breakup timescale t b r k for d 84 should be reduced increase the effect of breakup moreover it becomes clear that by minimizing the error for the median floc size d 50 the equilibrium floc statistics for the finer fraction d 16 is under predicted by the model while the coarse fraction d 84 is over predicted identifying the optimum parameters hierarchically to represent the tri temporal floc size statistics from fig 6 can be difficult based on its similar trend across the fractal dimension values therefore we evaluate the error values during the initial growth stage of the flocculation r m s e f r and the entire flocculation time series r m s e f p in a wider range of fractal dimension f d 1 7 2 9 see fig 7 the r m s e f r confirms the discrimination process for the lowest f d 2 1 and highest f d 2 9 fractal dimension since their errors increase considerably regarding the fractal dimensions f d 2 2 2 7 the r m s e f r for the median floc size statistics d 50 behaves in a quasi stable way however the error values for d 16 and d 84 show opposite trends when one of them is minimized see f d 2 3 and f d 2 7 looking at the average performance for these floc fractions the first second and third option are f d 2 7 2 6 and 2 4 respectively see dashed black line in fig 7a this result can also be obtained when computing the mean value of r m s e f p see fig 7b 3 3 tri temporal floc size statistics using min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 through a systematic error analysis of d 50 for the initial floc growth and the entire flocculation process presented in the previous sections optimal model parameters are obtained however the predicted fine d 16 and coarse d 84 floc fractions are adversely affected that is better agreement in the fine fraction comes at the expense of worse agreement in the coarse fraction now we evaluate the possibility to narrow the flocculation model parameters and improve the overall agreement by minimizing the fine or coarse floc sizes statistic errors i e min r m s e f p d 16 or min r m s e f p d 84 using the same systematic error analysis the criterion of minimizing the fine fraction min r m s e f p d 16 produces non satisfactory results for the overall floc size statistics since the coarse fraction d 84 stands out for its high error values r m s e f p d 84 34 62 μ m this magnitude is higher than r m s e f p d 84 obtained by using the previous criterion min r m s e f p d 50 error comparisons are presented in the supplementary material figure s6 and they are not further discussed here conversely applying the criterion min r m s e f p d 84 shows satisfactory results especially in the r m s e f r values since the best value is distinguished from the other acceptable errors see f d 2 5 in fig 8 a however the minimum value of r m s e f p averaged over the three size statistics is located at f d 2 9 fig 8b this is a limitation in the flocculation model since f d 2 9 is a much higher than expected value for typical flocs considering the error analysis criterion for the initial floc growth stage the optimum fractal dimension is selected to be f d 2 5 see black line in fig 8a the tri temporal floc size statistics for three selected cases are presented in fig 9 we established previously for the equilibrium state that minimizing the median floc size errors leads to over and under predicted results for coarse and fine flocs respectively see also fig 9a and 9b hence the difference between case 1 with f d 2 4 and case 2 with f d 2 7 lies mainly in the degree of agreement to represent the coarse fraction d 84 see r m s e e q values in table 2 since case 2 with f d 2 7 shows 49 12 better agreement compared to case 1 this contrast can also be noticed in the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state see blue dashed line vs red solid line in fig 10 comparing with case 1 case 2 relocates a small amount of sediment mass in the coarse fraction to the median and fine fractions due to a relatively larger breakup effect signified by smaller r α β 7 432 value in case 2 using a lower fractal dimension of f d 2 5 in case 3 allows for an even lower r 6 7 i e the breakup is stronger in case 3 than in case 1 and 2 which significantly reduces the sediment mass in the coarse fraction see smaller d 84 in fig 9c and this is evidently due to a more significant relocation of mass from the coarse fraction to the finer fraction see a shift of sediment mass distribution to the left represented by the black dashed line in fig 10 case 3 proves the need of increasing the effect of breakup or lower breakup timescale t b r k for the coarse fraction which can be achieved by increase the fragmentation rate β section 4 investigates this possibility by considering a lower floc yield strength for larger flocs 4 discussion effect of floc yield strength the results presented in section 3 indicate that by rigorously calibrating the pbe based size class flocculation model against measured tri temporal floc size statistics d 16 d 50 and d 84 we can identify several combinations of the model parameters α β and f d that show good agreement with measured data however there are still uncertainties in the selection of the best model parameters particularly in case 2 which has the best agreement but with a high value of the fractal dimension of 2 7 in this section we include one other significant physical quantity in the model parameters to improve the overall agreement to avoid overfitting model results the choice of the additional physics to be included must first be justified motivated by improving the limited capability of the model to represent the coarse and fine fractions simultaneously and the need to increase floc breakup or decrease t b r k for the coarse floc fraction we evaluate the effect of considering the fragmentation rate β as a function of floc size as shown in equation 8 the fragmentation rate β is a function of the empirical coefficient e fluid viscosity μ and floc yield strength f y the justification of treating β as a constant is to assume the floc yield strength is a constant in the literature floc yield strength is routinely assumed to be f y 10 10 n in flocculation modeling and the model calibrations are carried out either through the coefficient e or directly using the parameter β maggi et al 2007 verney et al 2011 winterwerp 1998 however in the water quality literature jarvis et al 2015 presented a review of many laboratory measurements of floc yield strength or yield stress which indicated that the floc yield strength f y is inversely proportional to the floc size e g bache et al 1999 yeung and pelton 1996 in other words when a floc grows to a sufficient size the larger the floc size is the easier the floc can be broken by turbulent shear this fact is supported by our error analysis presented in section 3 fig 11 presents the best calibrated β values by minimizing the error in the three size fractions d 16 d 50 and d 84 plotted as a function of fractal dimension between 2 3 and 2 6 we observe a clear trend in each fractal dimension that the larger the size fraction when the error is minimized the larger β or smaller f y is required moreover this trend agrees with the need to decrease the breakup timescale t b r k for coarse fraction as has been stated in the previous section hence we investigate the effect of considering the floc yield strength f y inversely proportional to floc size since measuring the floc yield strength as a function of floc size can be difficult and most studies of cohesive sediment transport do not report such data as a first step we propose to model the floc yield strength in terms of microflocs and macroflocs manning and dyer 2007 and divide the fragmentation rate β into two different values accordingly to distinguish these two groups a floc size limit d l is defined such that the fragmentation rate of flocs with a size smaller larger than d l is specified as β micro while the fragmentation rate of flocs larger than d l is specified as β macro we investigate the effect of applying the two value fragmentation rate by simulating case 1a and case 3a which are variants of case 1 and case 3 having the same values of α and f d found in section 3 2 as for β micro and β macro the mean value between these two fragmentation rates in case 1a and case 3a match with the constant β value used in case 1 and case 3 respectively while satisfying the physical behavior of higher tendency for breakup in macroflocs with β macro β micro the use of the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case1a shows a remarkable improvement compared to using a constant β method in case 1 with f d 2 4 for the coarse fraction d 84 under the criterion min r m s e f p d 50 the over predicted errors r m s e f p d 84 for the entire time series in case 1 fig 12 a are significantly reduced from 16 43 μ m to 4 66 μ m nearly a factor 4 reduction of error compare table 3 and 4 the same improvement can be seen for the fine fraction d 16 with an error value r m s e f p d 16 reducing from 11 27 μ m to 3 38 μ m furthermore these improvements preserve the excellent agreement of d 50 because the r m s e e q d 50 maintains its low error values errors slightly increase by 5 from 2 54 μ m to 2 67 μ m for the floc growth stage using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate in case 1a significantly improves the agreement for the coarse fraction r m s e f r d 84 decreases from 20 3 μ m to 9 87 μ m about a factor 2 smaller while only marginally decreasing the agreement for the median 11 increase of error and fine 42 increase of error fraction evaluating the overall performance through the mean error values we observe a factor 3 reduction of errors for the entire time series m e a n r m s e f p reduces from 10 08 μ m to 3 57 μ m the improvement by using the two value β micro β macro fragmentation rate is particularly significant for equilibrium floc sizes relatively minor improvement is observed for case 3a f d 2 5 see table 4 when the two value fragmentation rate is applied see fig 12b this is partly because the agreement in the coarse fraction when using a single value β is already good see case 3 in table 3 e g r m s e f p for d 84 is only 3 77 μ m however the improvement for median fraction and fine fractions by using the two value fragmentation rate for the entire time series is evident as it is quantified by an error reduction from 10 15 μ m to 5 68 μ m and from 16 45 μ m to 11 3 μ m respectively as for the floc growth stage the two value fragmentation rate also reduces the errors by a factor of about 1 6 and 2 5 for d 16 and d 50 correspondingly however the error for the coarse fraction shows a small increase of 39 a numerical experiment has been carried out for case 2 with a high fractal dimension of 2 7 we obtain the similar conclusion that the improvement by using a two value fragmentation rate in case 2 is very good but not as effective as in case 1 the distributed mass concentration at the equilibrium state is another important characteristic that can be used to compare the two value fragmentation rate approach with the constant β approach see fig 12c and 12d when the fractal dimension is f d 2 4 a reduction of the mass concentration in case 1a is observed for floc classes lower than 55 25 μ m and higher than 118 μ m compare the red line with the black line in fig 12c as a result of mass conservation the mass concentration distribution over the floc size classes is squeezed laterally and the concentration between the floc classes 55 25 118 μ m increases consequently the equilibrium floc statistics for coarse d 84 fine d 16 fraction must decrease increase a similar behavior can be seen when the fractal dimension is f d 2 5 in case 3a but with a different feature for instance using a single value fragmentation rate the equilibrium floc size for the coarse fraction d 84 is already in good agreement with measured data interestingly the use of a two value fragmentation rate effectively decreases the mass concentration in the fine fraction and moves the mass toward the median fraction fig 12d while the coarse fraction is nearly unchanged specifically the mass concentration increases between 69 77 157 9 μ m see fig 12d and decreases in finer fraction d i 69 77 μ m there is a very small increase of mass concentration in the coarser fraction d i 157 9 μ m conclusion we present a systematic investigation of the key model parameters for the pbe based size class flocculation model of verney et al 2011 using the experimental data reported by keyvani and strom 2014 an analysis on constraining the key model parameters namely the collisional efficiency fragmentation rate and fractal dimension is first carried out for the median floc size statistics d 50 a criterion based on minimizing the equilibrium state median floc size errors provides multiple options of model parameters with many of them misleading since they fail to match the measured initial floc growth the agreement can be significantly improved by applying a second criterion sequentially minimizing the error for the floc growth stage or equivalently by minimizing the entire flocculation time series of d 50 interestingly utilizing the objective function of simply minimizing the error for the floc growth stage min r m s e f r d 50 shows generally good agreement with the entire measured time series of flocculation confirming a good predictive ability of the present pbe flocculation model the resulting model parameters are constrained to multiple options of fractal dimension in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 and we conclude that the median floc size d 50 alone is insufficient to constrain the flocculation model parameters the pbe flocculation model can reasonably predict d 16 and d 84 using solely the calibration results from the median floc sizes d 50 in the range of f d 2 2 2 7 the best two options with minimum errors are selected for f d 2 4 and f d 2 7 with the latter selected because of its good agreement with measured coarse fraction d 84 even though the f d value is higher than expected evaluating two different criteria based on minimizing the entire temporal floc size statistic errors of d 16 and d 84 indicates that minimizing the errors in the fine fraction is not viable due to the high errors in the coarse fraction on the contrary minimizing the error in the coarse fraction shows good agreement with the measured floc growth at f d 2 5 and suggests that the coarse fraction requires lower breakup timescale or increased breakup to balance the aggregation to improve the model s predictive ability for fine median and coarse fractions at typically expected fractal dimension ranges for cohesive sediment we propose a two value fragmentation rate approach floc yield strength is smaller for macroflocs than microflocs motivated by limited measured data in the water quality literature and the present model analysis for a single fragmentation rate β which clearly shows a positive correlation between calibrated β and floc size see fig 11 the results from the two value fragmentation rate approach demonstrate significant improvement in representing the tri temporal floc size statistics compared with data from using a constant β especially for the case of lower fractal dimension at f d 2 4 findings reported in this study are based on modeling the measured three floc size statistics in homogenous turbulence for a single type of clay reported by keyvani and strom 2014 therefore this work calls for future research on expanding the knowledge of floc yield strength for more diverse configurations for instance more laboratory data of temporal floc size distribution for a wide range of turbulence intensity and clay types are needed moreover direct measurements of floc yield strength as a function of floc size are needed for numerical modeling coupling the pbe model with a boundary layer sediment transport model to further investigate the role of flocculation dynamics on settling advection and turbulent suspension of

15002,the mechanistic study of soil and groundwater remediation in petroleum contaminated lands significantly demands rapid qualitative and quantitative identification of petroleum substances however most traditional detection methods cannot provide the on site or in situ information of petroleum compositions and contents simultaneously even with multi spot sampling and complex sample preparation in this work we developed a strategy for the on site detection of petroleum compositions and in situ monitoring of petroleum contents in soil and groundwater using dual excitation raman spectroscopy and microscopy the detection time was 0 5 h for the extraction raman spectroscopy method and one minute for the fiber raman spectroscopy method the limit of detection was 94 ppm for the soil samples and 0 46 ppm for the groundwater samples meanwhile the petroleum changes at the soil groundwater interface were successfully observed by raman microscopy during the in situ chemical oxidation remediation processes the results revealed that hydrogen peroxide oxidation released petroleum from the interior to the surface of soil particles and then to groundwater during the remediation process while persulfate oxidation only degraded petroleum on the soil surface and in groundwater this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method can shed light on the petroleum degradation mechanism in contaminated lands and facilitate the selection of suitable soil and groundwater remediation plans graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords petroleum contaminants soil and groundwater in

attracted tremendous attention for degrading petroleum substances in the soil and groundwater of contaminated lands shao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b 2021 2023 among the widely used oxidants alkaline activated persulfate treatment is often employed owing to its high redox potential convenience stability and relatively low cost liang and lei 2015 lin et al 2022 lominchar et al 2018 sra et al 2012 fenton reagents such as iron catalyzed h2o2 treatment is also a popular strategy to degrade the petroleum contaminants due to its high treatment efficiency quick process and wide application range bergendahl et al 2003 chen et al 2022 sutton et al 2014 usman et al 2022 in order to evaluate different isco remediation plans by monitoring the pollution levels of petroleum contaminated lands it is necessary to analyze the petroleum compositions and contents in soil and groundwater on the site and in situ on the site not necessarily in situ refers to the measurements at the field the accurate and efficient on site and in situ detection will facilitate understanding the remediation dynamics and targeting the remediation goal the current identification of petroleum substances usually requires complex laboratory operation of gas chromatography gc and or mass spectrometry ms bumbrah et al 2017 snyder et al 2016 wang et al 2022a they are not suitable for the on site or in situ detection gieg and suflita 2002 olsen et al 1982 the gravimetric method and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry uv vis can be utilized on the site to detect the total petroleum content due to their portability banan khorshid et al 2021 mills et al 1999 in addition in light of the sensitive fluorescence caused by the electronic transitions of the conjugated structures in the hydrocarbon mixture laser induced fluorescence lif spectroscopy has been developed to quantify the total petroleum content on the site fedotov et al 2019 mu et al 2016 however neither of them can provide specific information of the petroleum composition therefore there is still lack of rapid detection methods to simultaneously identify the petroleum compositions and contents on the site or in situ in contaminated soil and groundwater raman scattering provides abundant vibrational information of molecular bonds and may characteristically detect the petroleum composition ahmadjian and brown 1976 cialla may et al 2019 huang et al 2022 meanwhile raman spectroscopy is able to collect fluorescent emissions excited by appropriate laser sources allowing for the quantification of petroleum content based on the emission intensity in addition the device of raman spectroscopy can be portable for the facile on site and in situ detection by combining with microscopy raman spectroscopy may further visualize the in situ changes of petroleum distribution at the microscopic soil groundwater interface despite these many advantages raman spectroscopy is challenged by separating raman signals from fluorescent signals because the quantum yields of vibrational transitions are substantially lower than the electronic transitions it is not easy to simultaneously obtain a distinct raman spectrum for the composition characterization and an intense fluorescence spectrum for the content determination fortunately the lower excitation efficiency of fluorescence at longer wavelength rusk 2009 inspired us to develop a method of dual excitation raman spectroscopy microscopy to identify the petroleum composition based on distinct raman bands at 785 nm and to quantify the petroleum content based on fluorescent signals at 532 nm fig 1 using this methodology we obtained the petroleum compositions and contents of soil and groundwater samples in a contaminated land in yangtze delta of china and

rs the contaminated soil and groundwater samples were obtained from a land in nanjing at yangtze delta of china we extracted the soil and groundwater samples by organic solvent n hexane and obtained the petroleum substances as viscous solids fig 2 a since the major petroleum substances in the soil and groundwater samples were consisted of c12 c40 based on the gc characterization fig 2b to find out whether extraction rs was able to identify the property of hydrocarbon chain lengths we obtained three standard samples from the nearby providers for the comparative characterization the standard samples were paraffin diesel fuel and h gasoline heavy gasoline consistent with the literature reports cheng et al 2023 frança et al 2018 lominchar et al 2018 singh et al 2003 the major components of the paraffin diesel fuel and h gasoline samples were c29 c40 c12 c29 and c8 c12 respectively fig 2c based on extraction rs the auto fluorescence of petroleum substances was suppressed at 785 nm excitation and their raman vibrational fingerprints were clearly identified fig 2d the soil and groundwater petroleum had similar raman spectra representing the major characteristic peaks of ch stretch at 2900 cm 1 ch2 ch3 bend at 1450 cm 1 ch2 twist at 1305 cm 1 ch2 twist at 1150 cm 1 and terminal ch3 rock at 850 cm 1 respectively chung and ku 2000 cordeiro dantas et al 2017 li et al 2020 the spectral similarity evidenced their similar compositions in addition raman spectra of the soil and groundwater petroleum were similar to those of paraffin and diesel fuel instead of h gasoline this indicated the major components of the soil and groundwater petroleum were long chain hydrocarbons c12 c40 instead of short chain ones c8 c12 compared with the standard laboratory gc method extraction rs provided portable raman measurements for conveniently characterizing petroleum compositions in terms of hydrocarbon chain lengths 3 2 determination of total petroleum contents in soil and groundwater with extraction rs the fluorescent properties of petroleum contaminated soil and groundwater samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope fig 3 a and with a fluorimeter fig s5 different from the solid form soil the groundwater contained both micro size oil droplets and solid form substances the extracted solids were viscous and fluorescent with the high quantum yields of 0 75 and 2 69 for the soil and groundwater samples respectively these fluorescent properties were consistent with previous reports isak and eyring 1992 katoh et al 2009 magde et al 1979 and also agreed with those of another contaminated land in qingyang china fig s6 in the supporting information the consistent fluorescent properties of petroleum substances in representative contaminated lands validated the the method of quantifying the petroleum content according to the signal intensity the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph in this study was defined as the total petroleum contents of c10 c40 united states environmental protection agency 2007 international organization for standardization 2004 comite europeen de normalisation 2004 saari et al 2007 to quantify the tph contents of the samples we dissolved the petroleum extracts in dmso to obtain a series of standard samples representative picture in the insets of fig 3b and c when the standard samples were measured by extraction rs at 532 nm excitation the auto fluorescence of petroleum substances was clearly observed and utilized for the quantitative detection the signal intensity at the peak of 1000 cm 1 was selected for the quantification of the petroleum content the relative intensities of the bands at 1000 cm 1 were normalized to the raman peak of dmso at 868 cm 1 text s2 in the supporting information while the tph contents were independently determined by gc according to the comparison between the measured relative intensities and the gc tph contents the signals obtained by the extraction rs method were proportional to the tph contents thus the tph calibration curves produced a linear detection ranges of 0 00 1 51 104 ppm and 0 59 4 ppm for the soil and groundwater samples respectively considering the standard deviations of the blank soil and groundwater samples the limits of detection lod for soil and groundwater samples were determined to be 94 0 ppm and 0 460 ppm respectively text s1 in the supporting information in addition extraction rs was employed to determine the tph contents of engine oil offshore oil and anthracene fig s7 8 in the supporting information these results evidenced that extraction rs may provide a general method to rapidly measure the tph contents of petroleum related substances in complex environmental samples 3 3 rapid determination of petroleum contents in soil and groundwater with fiber rs in order to further improve the measurement simplicity and time efficiency we utilized a fiber optical raman spectroscopy fiber rs method qi and berger 2007 schorn et al 2021 to directly and rapidly measure the soil and groundwater samples from the same land without the extraction step fig s3 the measured signals were averaged for all the soil particles in the laser focus area and therefore could be used to reflect the soil petroleum content the standard gc method generally takes a couple of days to obtain the tph contents for soil and groundwater samples including the time for sample collection delivery and preparation in comparison the fiber rs measurements took about one minute using the portable raman spectroscopic instrument on the site to simplify data analysis we performed a two point calibration based on two standard samples containing relatively low and high tph contents in soil 1 73 102 and 4 51 103 ppm and in groundwater 0 150 and 82 2 ppm respectively fig 4 a after that six unknown soil and groundwater samples were measured by fiber rs the measured signal intensities versus the gc determined tph contents were compared with the calibration curves the detection accuracies were represented in fig 4b d the median and mean values of the disagreement between the extraction rs and gc methods were minor careful observation of the extraction rs results evidenced no data point outliers for the soil samples in the box plot of discrepancy there were 2 outliers in the 6 data points for the groundwater samples with high discrepancies of 17 and 19 which were not surprising due to their most diluted petroleum contents for the fiber rs method the median and mean values of the disagreement from the gc method were 24 and 22 for the soil samples and 5 and 1 for the groundwater samples although the average discrepancy levels were acceptable for the purpose of rapid on site or in situ detection the individual discrepancy values were distributed sparsely e g a few outliers far from the statistical prediction this is because the insoluble oily and or solid petroleum substances were distributed heterogeneously in soil and groundwater dependent on the local environment the higher discrepancy levels for the groundwater samples with very low petroleum content levels e g outlier points in fig 4b and for the soil samples e g larger boxes in fig 4b reflected their authentic heterogeneity compared with the gc method that minimized the influence of sample heterogeneity with such a capability of measuring local petroleum contents rapidly at different sampling locations fiber rs may evaluate the environmental quality risk of soil and groundwater more comprehensively in terms of simultaneously accessing the average petroleum contents and their heterogeneous distribution over the entire land 3 4 on site and in situ monitoring of petroleum remediation in soil and groundwater the isco method is an effective technique for degrading petroleum contaminants by injecting the remediation reagents in situ kim and lee 2012 sutton et al 2014 xu et al 2017 we conducted the isco remediation on the site and also simulated the process through the column experiment in the laboratory hou et al 2018 jia et al 2017 fig 5 two types of isco methods hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hydroxide activated persulfate naoh ps oxidation were employed for the soil and groundwater remediation by injecting h2o2 and naoh ps for multiple times shevah and waldman 1995 the on site land experiment was based on a large distance scale of meters and time scale of days fig 5a c the tph contents were then monitored by sampling the soil and groundwater for fiber rs measurements for the comparison the in situ column experiments were conducted on a smaller distance scale of centimeters and shorter time scale of hours fig 5d f we monitored the tph changes using in situ fiber rs by pointing the laser beam directly towards randomly selected soil or groundwater locations in the column during the land experiments the naoh ps method reduced the tph contents in soil and groundwater which was consistent with the expectation sutton et al 2014 the remediation rate was rapid within 6 days after the first addition of naoh ps after two additional naoh ps treatments the tph contents in soil and groundwater decreased by 94 and 83 respectively the soil tph was reduced to 232 ppm while the groundwater tph was reduced to 7 5 ppm at day 18 similar to the naoh ps remediation the soil tph significantly decreased after the first h2o2 addition however the soil and groundwater tph were not continuously degraded but fluctuated during the h2o2 treatments specifically the groundwater tph increased by 50 after the first h2o2 addition and then decreased dramatically to 5 after two additional h2o2 injections despite the tph fluctuations during the h2o2 isco process the soil tph was reduced to 237 ppm and the groundwater tph was reduced to 2 3 ppm at day 18 for the in situ column experiments similar tph decrease trends were observed for the soil and groundwater naoh ps remediation during the h2o2 isco column experiment we observed tph fluctuations again for the soil and groundwater remediation that included a tph decrease a resilience and a second decrease although the minimum and maximum tph occurred at different time points compared with the land experiments these more dynamic tph fluctuations were not fully tracked during the land experiment because the smaller volume scale and time scale phenomenon was concealed in the land experiment case we further studied the tph degradation kinetics fig 5g h by analyzing the column experimental data at the beginning 1 5 h of remediation processes and eliminating the influence of the mass transfer in the land experiments and the petroleum release caused by the h2o2 treatment based on the tph degradation rates of the column experiments h2o2 degraded petroleum substances 5 12 times faster than naoh ps these column experimental results inferred an insight to the groundwater tph increase for the first h2o2 treatment during the land experiments when h2o2 was in contact with groundwater and then diffused to soil it may vigorously degrade the existing petroleum in the local area of groundwater and soil surface simultaneously h2o2 might penetrate the soil particles react with them and release the inner petroleum to the soil surface and then into the groundwater thus we observed a more obvious tph increase in groundwater than in soil during the early stage of remediation in both the land and column experiments because the fast transfer of the released petroleum from soil to groundwater possibly overwhelmed the tph degradation in the groundwater 3 5 micro area in situ studies of petroleum remediation at the soil groundwaterinterface considering the complexity of land experiments on a macroscopic scale in situ observation of the soil and groundwater remediation on the microscopic scale may provide a deeper understanding of the remediation mechanism cao et al 2019 therefore we simulated the micro area of soil groundwater interface fig s4 and imaged its dynamic changes on the time scale of minutes during the remediation processes fig 6 a meanwhile we carefully observed the petroleum distribution on single soil particles after the remediation reagents were added fig 6b the signal intensity levels in the raman channels represented the in situ tph distribution distinct tph distribution interfaces were seen in the micro area raman images because the initial tph contents in the soil were significantly higher than those in the groundwater fig 5a and d in the case of naoh ps remediation the tph distribution interface remained stationary compared to the soil groundwater interface in the bright field images fig 6a top series after two naoh ps additions the tph redistributed in the soil and some petroleum aggregation and or particles started to diffuse into groundwater at the right bottom corner of the soil groundwater interface the total tph signals decreased slightly by 10 fig 6c this indicated a slow petroleum degradation on the time scale of minutes although the relative dosage of naoh ps was significantly higher than that in the land experiments and column experiments see text s3 and table s1 in the supporting information in comparison the h2o2 remediation produced a different result after two h2o2 additions the tph distribution interface continuously moved from the bulk soil towards groundwater while the soil groundwater interface remained stationary fig 6a bottom series the total signals increased significantly indicating new tph being generated in the imaged area fig 6c however for the soil particle imaging the signal on the particle surface decreased slightly after the h2o2 additions fig 6b bottom series and fig 6c these different observations indicated a possible petroleum generation on the soil particles and the subsequent fast transfer of the generated petroleum from the soil particles towards groundwater during the h2o2 treatment while on the surface of soil particles the petroleum degradation occurred simultaneously ossai et al 2020 inside the soil particles there might exist vigorous reaction with h2o2 causing the petroleum accumulation and the subsequent release from the soil interior to its surface and then to groundwater this prediction might account for the continuous tph increase over the large interface area based on the imaging results the soil particle size remained similar after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6d and s10 in the supporting information in agreement with the imaging results the average size of bulk soil particles changed slightly after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6e and s11d in the supporting information the results also found that the average specific surface area of the soil particles increased after they were treated by h2o2 but did not change after the naoh ps treatments these property changes of bulk soil particles inferred that h2o2 altered the particle morphologies while reducing their sizes and creating more pores but naoh ps did not impact these soil properties also see fig s11 in the supporting information suggesting that h2o2 was more reactive to the soil particles than naoh ps one of the reasons for the reactivity difference might relate to the hydrophilicity of the soil in contact with the reagents the hydrophilicity was 12 5 higher for the soil sample in contact with the h2o2 solution compared to that in contact with the naoh ps solution figs 6e s11a c and s12a in the supporting information it evidenced that h2o2 might enter the soil particles and get in contact with the petroleum substances more easily in addition h2o2 degraded petroleum substances faster than naoh ps figs 5g h and s13 in the supporting information which might be due to a larger amount of oh being produced fig s11e in the supporting information during the degradation process h2o2 was catalyzed by iron minerals in the soil sample to produce oh and ho2 o2 he et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 shao et al 2022 usman et al 2022 while oh was the major reactive species to degrade petroleum substances the side reactions also produced h in the soil sample to maintain a steady ph eqs 2 4 figs s11e and s12b in the supporting information however when naoh ps was catalyzed by oh or the iron minerals to degrade the petroleum substances eq 7 9 the system ph was basic and facilitated the mineral crystallization process fig 6e and fig s11f in the supporting information cristelo et al 2012 furman et al 2010 huang et al 2021 rao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2021 therefore the basic ph during the naoh ps treatment might yield a negative effect on the hydrophilicity of the soil sample and a higher mineral crystallization level on the soil surface might result in clogging the soil pores preventing the release of petroleum substances from the soil interior to its surface different from this the produced oxygen during the h2o2 treatment might generate pressure inside the soil particles break the particles into smaller pieces create more pores in the soil and then push the remaining petroleum substances from the interior to the surface 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 3 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 2 h o 2 4 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 h o 2 5 f e 3 o 2 f e

in this study we developed a raman spectroscopic and microscopic method to rapidly measure heterogeneous soil and groundwater in situ and visualized the dynamic tph distribution at the soil groundwater interface using extraction rs we determined the petroleum compositions and total petroleum contents with simple sample preparation for the soil and groundwater from a contaminated land using fiber rs we rapidly monitored the isco remediation dynamics for petroleum contaminated soil and groundwater on the site or in situ through the micro area raman imaging of the soil groundwater interface we observed the petroleum release in situ from the soil interior to it surface and then to the groundwater with the h2o2 treatment while the in situ dynamic information of land isco remediation processes is crucial for understanding the efficiency and effect of utilizing oxidants combined with the remediation goal for a petroleum contaminated land e g the reuse of the land for an industrial commercial or farming purpose this study may help the selection of an appropriate isco reagent and remediation plan by taking into account whether deep remediation is desirable the limitations of this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method may exist for future evaluation based on the current fiber rs instrumentation it is challenging to fully eliminate the reflected light from the optical fiber coupling interface cong et al 2017 and to significantly improve the probe depth and detection sensitivity meanwhile although two representative petroleum contaminated lands and a few organic pollutants were researched for validating this method fig s6 8 in the supporting information different lands may vary significantly in their soil and groundwater compositions ph and other physical chemical geographic information thus the method may require optimization or may work unsuccessfully according to specific studies in addition considering specific remediation strategies for specific lands e g using the injection well and pump to add the isco reagents h2o2 may not be very efficient and cause flue gas therefore the control of safety risk as well as economic expense possibly outweighs the consideration of achieving a deep remediation goal in such cases the significance becomes minor to study the in situ remediation process with the raman spectroscopic and

15002,the mechanistic study of soil and groundwater remediation in petroleum contaminated lands significantly demands rapid qualitative and quantitative identification of petroleum substances however most traditional detection methods cannot provide the on site or in situ information of petroleum compositions and contents simultaneously even with multi spot sampling and complex sample preparation in this work we developed a strategy for the on site detection of petroleum compositions and in situ monitoring of petroleum contents in soil and groundwater using dual excitation raman spectroscopy and microscopy the detection time was 0 5 h for the extraction raman spectroscopy method and one minute for the fiber raman spectroscopy method the limit of detection was 94 ppm for the soil samples and 0 46 ppm for the groundwater samples meanwhile the petroleum changes at the soil groundwater interface were successfully observed by raman microscopy during the in situ chemical oxidation remediation processes the results revealed that hydrogen peroxide oxidation released petroleum from the interior to the surface of soil particles and then to groundwater during the remediation process while persulfate oxidation only degraded petroleum on the soil surface and in groundwater this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method can shed light on the petroleum degradation mechanism in contaminated lands and facilitate the selection of suitable soil and groundwater remediation plans graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords petroleum contaminants soil and groundwater in

contaminated lands and therefore needs to be well controlled bruckberger et al 2020 kim et al 2013 li et al 2016 zakaria et al 2000 zhen et al 2021 in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation has attracted tremendous attention for degrading petroleum substances in the soil and groundwater of contaminated lands shao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b 2021 2023 among the widely used oxidants alkaline activated persulfate treatment is often employed owing to its high redox potential convenience stability and relatively low cost liang and lei 2015 lin et al 2022 lominchar et al 2018 sra et al 2012 fenton reagents such as iron catalyzed h2o2 treatment is also a popular strategy to degrade the petroleum contaminants due to its high treatment efficiency quick process and wide application range bergendahl et al 2003 chen et al 2022 sutton et al 2014 usman et al 2022 in order to evaluate different isco remediation plans by monitoring the pollution levels of petroleum contaminated lands it is necessary to analyze the petroleum compositions and contents in soil and groundwater on the site and in situ on the site not necessarily in situ refers to the measurements at the field the accurate and efficient on site and in situ detection will facilitate understanding the remediation dynamics and targeting the remediation goal the current identification of petroleum substances usually requires complex laboratory operation of gas chromatography gc and or mass spectrometry ms bumbrah et al 2017 snyder et al 2016 wang et al 2022a they are not suitable for the on site or in situ detection gieg and suflita 2002 olsen et al 1982 the gravimetric method and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry uv vis can be utilized on the site to detect the total petroleum content due to their portability banan khorshid et al 2021 mills et al 1999 in addition in light of the sensitive fluorescence caused by the electronic transitions of the conjugated structures in the hydrocarbon mixture laser induced fluorescence lif spectroscopy has been developed to quantify the total petroleum content on the site fedotov et al 2019 mu et al 2016 however neither of them can provide specific information of the petroleum composition therefore there is still lack of rapid detection methods to simultaneously identify the petroleum compositions and contents on the site or in situ in contaminated soil and groundwater raman scattering provides abundant vibrational information of molecular bonds and may characteristically detect the petroleum composition ahmadjian and brown 1976 cialla may et al 2019 huang et al 2022 meanwhile raman spectroscopy is able to collect fluorescent emissions excited by appropriate laser sources allowing for the quantification of petroleum content based on the emission intensity in addition the device of raman spectroscopy can be portable for the facile on site and in situ detection by combining with microscopy raman spectroscopy may further visualize the in situ changes of petroleum distribution at the microscopic soil groundwater interface despite these many advantages raman spectroscopy is challenged by separating raman signals from fluorescent signals because the quantum yields of vibrational transitions are substantially lower than the electronic transitions it is not easy to simultaneously obtain a distinct raman spectrum for the composition characterization and an intense fluorescence spectrum for the content determination fortunately the lower excitation efficiency of fluorescence at longer wavelength rusk 2009 inspired us to develop a method of dual excitation raman spectroscopy microscopy to identify the petroleum composition based on distinct raman bands at 785 nm and to quantify the petroleum content based on fluorescent signals at 532 nm fig 1 using this methodology we obtained the petroleum compositions and contents of soil and groundwater samples in a contaminated land in yangtze delta of china and

extraction rs results evidenced no data point outliers for the soil samples in the box plot of discrepancy there were 2 outliers in the 6 data points for the groundwater samples with high discrepancies of 17 and 19 which were not surprising due to their most diluted petroleum contents for the fiber rs method the median and mean values of the disagreement from the gc method were 24 and 22 for the soil samples and 5 and 1 for the groundwater samples although the average discrepancy levels were acceptable for the purpose of rapid on site or in situ detection the individual discrepancy values were distributed sparsely e g a few outliers far from the statistical prediction this is because the insoluble oily and or solid petroleum substances were distributed heterogeneously in soil and groundwater dependent on the local environment the higher discrepancy levels for the groundwater samples with very low petroleum content levels e g outlier points in fig 4b and for the soil samples e g larger boxes in fig 4b reflected their authentic heterogeneity compared with the gc method that minimized the influence of sample heterogeneity with such a capability of measuring local petroleum contents rapidly at different sampling locations fiber rs may evaluate the environmental quality risk of soil and groundwater more comprehensively in terms of simultaneously accessing the average petroleum contents and their heterogeneous distribution over the entire land 3 4 on site and in situ monitoring of petroleum remediation in soil and groundwater the isco method is an effective technique for degrading petroleum contaminants by injecting the remediation reagents in situ kim and lee 2012 sutton et al 2014 xu et al 2017 we conducted the isco remediation on the site and also simulated the process through the column experiment in the laboratory hou et al 2018 jia et al 2017 fig 5 two types of isco methods hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hydroxide activated persulfate naoh ps oxidation were employed for the soil and groundwater remediation by injecting h2o2 and naoh ps for multiple times shevah and waldman 1995 the on site land experiment was based on a large distance scale of meters and time scale of days fig 5a c the tph contents were then monitored by sampling the soil and groundwater for fiber rs measurements for the comparison the in situ column experiments were conducted on a smaller distance scale of centimeters and shorter time scale of hours fig 5d f we monitored the tph changes using in situ fiber rs by pointing the laser beam directly towards randomly selected soil or groundwater locations in the column during the land experiments the naoh ps method reduced the tph contents in soil and groundwater which was consistent with the expectation sutton et al 2014 the remediation rate was rapid within 6 days after the first addition of naoh ps after two additional naoh ps treatments the tph contents in soil and groundwater decreased by 94 and 83 respectively the soil tph was reduced to 232 ppm while the groundwater tph was reduced to 7 5 ppm at day 18 similar to the naoh ps remediation the soil tph significantly decreased after the first h2o2 addition however the soil and groundwater tph were not continuously degraded but fluctuated during the h2o2 treatments specifically the groundwater tph increased by 50 after the first h2o2 addition and then decreased dramatically to 5 after two additional h2o2 injections despite the tph fluctuations during the h2o2 isco process the soil tph was reduced to 237 ppm and the groundwater tph was reduced to 2 3 ppm at day 18 for the in situ column experiments similar tph decrease trends were observed for the soil and groundwater naoh ps remediation during the h2o2 isco column experiment we observed tph fluctuations again for the soil and groundwater remediation that included a tph decrease a resilience and a second decrease although the minimum and maximum tph occurred at different time points compared with the land experiments these more dynamic tph fluctuations were not fully tracked during the land experiment because the smaller volume scale and time scale phenomenon was concealed in the land experiment case we further studied the tph degradation kinetics fig 5g h by analyzing the column experimental data at the beginning 1 5 h of remediation processes and eliminating the influence of the mass transfer in the land experiments and the petroleum release caused by the h2o2 treatment based on the tph degradation rates of the column experiments h2o2 degraded petroleum substances 5 12 times faster than naoh ps these column experimental results inferred an insight to the groundwater tph increase for the first h2o2 treatment during the land experiments when h2o2 was in contact with groundwater and then diffused to soil it may vigorously degrade the existing petroleum in the local area of groundwater and soil surface simultaneously h2o2 might penetrate the soil particles react with them and release the inner petroleum to the soil surface and then into the groundwater thus we observed a more obvious tph increase in groundwater than in soil during the early stage of remediation in both the land and column experiments because the fast transfer of the released petroleum from soil to groundwater possibly overwhelmed the tph degradation in the groundwater 3 5 micro area in situ studies of petroleum remediation at the soil groundwaterinterface considering the complexity of land experiments on a macroscopic scale in situ observation of the soil and groundwater remediation on the microscopic scale may provide a deeper understanding of the remediation mechanism cao et al 2019 therefore we simulated the micro area of soil groundwater interface fig s4 and imaged its dynamic changes on the time scale of minutes during the remediation processes fig 6 a meanwhile we carefully observed the petroleum distribution on single soil particles after the remediation reagents were added fig 6b the signal intensity levels in the raman channels represented the in situ tph distribution distinct tph distribution interfaces were seen in the micro area raman images because the initial tph contents in the soil were significantly higher than those in the groundwater fig 5a and d in the case of naoh ps remediation the tph distribution interface remained stationary compared to the soil groundwater interface in the bright field images fig 6a top series after two naoh ps additions the tph redistributed in the soil and some petroleum aggregation and or particles started to diffuse into groundwater at the right bottom corner of the soil groundwater interface the total tph signals decreased slightly by 10 fig 6c this indicated a slow petroleum degradation on the time scale of minutes although the relative dosage of naoh ps was significantly higher than that in the land experiments and column experiments see text s3 and table s1 in the supporting information in comparison the h2o2 remediation produced a different result after two h2o2 additions the tph distribution interface continuously moved from the bulk soil towards groundwater while the soil groundwater interface remained stationary fig 6a bottom series the total signals increased significantly indicating new tph being generated in the imaged area fig 6c however for the soil particle imaging the signal on the particle surface decreased slightly after the h2o2 additions fig 6b bottom series and fig 6c these different observations indicated a possible petroleum generation on the soil particles and the subsequent fast transfer of the generated petroleum from the soil particles towards groundwater during the h2o2 treatment while on the surface of soil particles the petroleum degradation occurred simultaneously ossai et al 2020 inside the soil particles there might exist vigorous reaction with h2o2 causing the petroleum accumulation and the subsequent release from the soil interior to its surface and then to groundwater this prediction might account for the continuous tph increase over the large interface area based on the imaging results the soil particle size remained similar after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6d and s10 in the supporting information in agreement with the imaging results the average size of bulk soil particles changed slightly after the naoh ps additions but reduced considerably after the h2o2 additions figs 6e and s11d in the supporting information the results also found that the average specific surface area of the soil particles increased after they were treated by h2o2 but did not change after the naoh ps treatments these property changes of bulk soil particles inferred that h2o2 altered the particle morphologies while reducing their sizes and creating more pores but naoh ps did not impact these soil properties also see fig s11 in the supporting information suggesting that h2o2 was more reactive to the soil particles than naoh ps one of the reasons for the reactivity difference might relate to the hydrophilicity of the soil in contact with the reagents the hydrophilicity was 12 5 higher for the soil sample in contact with the h2o2 solution compared to that in contact with the naoh ps solution figs 6e s11a c and s12a in the supporting information it evidenced that h2o2 might enter the soil particles and get in contact with the petroleum substances more easily in addition h2o2 degraded petroleum substances faster than naoh ps figs 5g h and s13 in the supporting information which might be due to a larger amount of oh being produced fig s11e in the supporting information during the degradation process h2o2 was catalyzed by iron minerals in the soil sample to produce oh and ho2 o2 he et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 shao et al 2022 usman et al 2022 while oh was the major reactive species to degrade petroleum substances the side reactions also produced h in the soil sample to maintain a steady ph eqs 2 4 figs s11e and s12b in the supporting information however when naoh ps was catalyzed by oh or the iron minerals to degrade the petroleum substances eq 7 9 the system ph was basic and facilitated the mineral crystallization process fig 6e and fig s11f in the supporting information cristelo et al 2012 furman et al 2010 huang et al 2021 rao et al 2022 wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2021 therefore the basic ph during the naoh ps treatment might yield a negative effect on the hydrophilicity of the soil sample and a higher mineral crystallization level on the soil surface might result in clogging the soil pores preventing the release of petroleum substances from the soil interior to its surface different from this the produced oxygen during the h2o2 treatment might generate pressure inside the soil particles break the particles into smaller pieces create more pores in the soil and then push the remaining petroleum substances from the interior to the surface 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 3 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 2 h o 2 4 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 h o 2 5 f e 3 o 2 f e

in this study we developed a raman spectroscopic and microscopic method to rapidly measure heterogeneous soil and groundwater in situ and visualized the dynamic tph distribution at the soil groundwater interface using extraction rs we determined the petroleum compositions and total petroleum contents with simple sample preparation for the soil and groundwater from a contaminated land using fiber rs we rapidly monitored the isco remediation dynamics for petroleum contaminated soil and groundwater on the site or in situ through the micro area raman imaging of the soil groundwater interface we observed the petroleum release in situ from the soil interior to it surface and then to the groundwater with the h2o2 treatment while the in situ dynamic information of land isco remediation processes is crucial for understanding the efficiency and effect of utilizing oxidants combined with the remediation goal for a petroleum contaminated land e g the reuse of the land for an industrial commercial or farming purpose this study may help the selection of an appropriate isco reagent and remediation plan by taking into account whether deep remediation is desirable the limitations of this raman spectroscopic and microscopic method may exist for future evaluation based on the current fiber rs instrumentation it is challenging to fully eliminate the reflected light from the optical fiber coupling interface cong et al 2017 and to significantly improve the probe depth and detection sensitivity meanwhile although two representative petroleum contaminated lands and a few organic pollutants were researched for validating this method fig s6 8 in the supporting information different lands may vary significantly in their soil and groundwater compositions ph and other physical chemical geographic information thus the method may require optimization or may work unsuccessfully according to specific studies in addition considering specific remediation strategies for specific lands e g using the injection well and pump to add the isco reagents h2o2 may not be very efficient and cause flue gas therefore the control of safety risk as well as economic expense possibly outweighs the consideration of achieving a deep remediation goal in such cases the significance becomes minor to study the in situ remediation process with the raman spectroscopic and

15003,microplastics mps are increasingly released into the environment due to the widespread usage and improper management of plastics considerable research efforts have been devoted to the remediation of mps froth flotation has been demonstrated as an effective method to remove mps in water and sediment however there is a lack of knowledge on the regulation of the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of mps surfaces we found that exposure to the natural environment resulted in the increased hydrophilicity of mps the flotation efficiencies of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps decreased to zero after six months of natural incubation in rivers according to various characterizations the hydrophilization mechanism is mainly correlated with surface oxidation and the deposition of clay minerals inspired by surface wettability conversion we applied surfactants collectors to enhance mps hydrophobicity and flotation efficiency anionic sodium oleate naol and cationic dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac were used to regulate surface hydrophobicity the effects of collector concentration ph conditioning time and metal ions on mps flotation were thoroughly elucidated characterizations and adsorption experiments were performed to describe the heterogeneous adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the interaction between surfactants and mps was explained through density functional theory dft simulations the dispersion energy between hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains attracts collectors on the mps surface and the collector molecules wrap and laminate to mps surfaces flotation using naol exhibited a higher removal efficiency and naol was environmentally friendly subsequently we investigated the activation of ca2 fe3 and al3 to further improve the collecting efficiency of naol under the optimized conditions mps in natural rivers could be removed by froth flotation this study shows the great promise of froth flotation for the application of mps removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics removal froth flotation collector hydrophilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution is an emerging environmental issue due to its potentially harmful effects on ecosystems mps are plastic particles less than 5 mm in size with the increasing global production of plastics 4 8 12 7 million metric tons of mps are estimated to enter the ocean every year and approximately 80 of mps in the ocean are derived from land based sources rochman 2018 mps result in decreased feeding activity dwindling reserves altered immune and inflammatory responses and neurotoxic effects on organisms dawson et al 2018 some evidence has confirmed that the concentration of mps in human blood reaches 1 6 µg ml leslie et al 2022 and the correlation between mps and inflammatory bowel disease ibd status has been demonstrated to be significant yan et al 2022 in addition the accumulation of heavy metals organic pollutants and viruses may increase the toxicity of mps to biota tang et al 2021 in the past two decades worldwide research has contributed to advances concerning the sources transportation occurrence chemical behavior toxicology and ecological effects of mps fei et al 2022 due to human activity the abundance of mps in canal rivers can exceed 140 items l leslie et al 2017 researchers found that mps in the surface water of the yellow river even reached 930 items l han et al 2020 with the increase in mps contamination the development of mps removal technology is critical regarding mps separation from the aquatic environment many researchers have focused on quantitative analysis by using density extraction grause et al 2022 magnetic separation ramage et al 2022 adsorption luo et al 2022 electrostatic separation enders et al 2020 and oil separation scopetani et al 2020 however many methods are limited to the bench scale extraction of mps therefore several strategies for water treatment are considered such as chemical coagulation rajala et al 2020 electrocoagulation shen et al 2022 and membrane filtration nabi et al 2022 however many techniques have focused on the size and concentration of mps for removal but have neglected the surface hydrophobicity of mps the intrinsic hydrophobicity of plastic is stronger than that of environmental media therefore froth flotation developed for mineral separation has the potential to remove mps the adherence of air bubbles on mps forms an aggregation of mps and air bubbles which can float from water due to their lower density jiang et al 2020 flotation can remove mps of different densities in surface water and be applied to remediate localized contamination by mps several studies have investigated the flotation of mps real time monitoring of mp bubble interactions at the microscale and mp concentrations has been realized swart et al 2022 in addition modified or functionalized microbubbles have drawn much interest because of their efficiency in capturing mps increasing the effectiveness of removal zhang et al 2021a according to the findings of the life cycle assessment lca froth flotation had a significantly lower cost and environmental impact than that of alternative removal processes jiang et al 2022a however plastics undergo a series of surface changes in their natural environment that alter surface wettability this work assumes that mps increase hydrophilicity in natural water bodies and flotation removal can be achieved by restoring hydrophobicity through surfactant regulation mps can interact with environmental media and undergo oxidation and increasing oxygen containing groups and roughness can enhance the hydrophilicity of mps in addition mps may contain different active sites and exhibit varying sensitivities to oxidation zhang et al 2020 the interaction between mps and metal ions also depends on chelation with oxygen containing groups tang et al 2020 nevertheless low concentrations of organic matter and metal ions in the natural environment make it difficult for mps to be hydrophilic and sink in the flotation process zhang et al 2021b the energy barrier between mps and sediment particles can be weakened as a result of the bridge effect of metal ions which causes the spontaneous deposition of sediment particles on mps surfaces jiang et al 2022a it is possible that mps are easily hydrophilized in the environment and that flotation removal is significantly hampered however the hydrophilization process of mps in the natural environment has not been thoroughly investigated the development of mps flotation should resolve these major stumbling blocks given the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mps long chain surfactants with hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties may adhere to mps surfaces and enhance the hydrophobicity of mps through van der waals forces and the hydrophobic forces jiang et al 2022b because mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants namely collectors are often used in mineral engineering to selectively enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and separate them in flotation because of its great effectiveness low cost and environmental friendliness sodium oleate naol a typical anionic collector has been extensively employed in the flotation of oxide and silicate minerals gao et al 2022b apart from the essential contribution of hydrophobic interactions the electrostatic attraction may significantly enhance the adsorption between mps and the cationic collector shen et al 2021 compared to other cationic collectors quaternary ammonium salts are more stable are less hazardous and exhibit stronger collecting abilities thus we chose dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac as a promising candidate jiang et al 2018 herein this study aimed to investigate the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and its impact on subsequently applied froth flotation in the removal of mps for these purposes the main objectives were a to comprehensively simulate the natural exposure of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps b to systematically investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments c to study the flotation removal of mps using naol and dtac d to analyze the interaction between mps and collectors aided by density functional theory dft simulation and e to optimize the removal process by activating mps surfaces and verify the feasibility of mps flotation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mps and reagents polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet were derived from wastewater pipes textiles packages lampshades and bottles respectively these waste plastics were crushed into debris with a diameter of 500 1000 μm for the preparation of mps recently some reports mentioned that the mps in the surface water of the estuary region were larger 0 5 mm 81 9 due to more frequent human activities huang et al 2023 these mps were rinsed with distilled water and dried at room temperature all reagents used in this experiment included terpineol sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl sodium oleate naol dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac sodium chloride nacl calcium chloride cacl2 ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum chloride alcl3 figure s1 shows the structures of naol and dtac which are typical anionic and cationic collectors in mineral processing 2 2 natural incubation of mps we prepared round shrimp traps with a diameter of 40 cm and 100 mesh pore size 150 μm nylon bags first we placed 10 g of mps 500 1000 μm into the nylon sample bag and sealed it the mps in the bags can fully interact with the aquatic environment and the mps sample could not leak out fig 1 mps less than 74 μm for characterization were placed in 300 mesh pore size 53 μm sample bags the nylon bag was fixed at the bottom of the trap the shrimp cage was suspended 10 30 cm below the river surface as shown in fig 1 the outdoor exposure experiment of mps began in october 2021 and was conducted in the yudai river changsha china the mps in the bags were collected at 0 1 2 3 and 6 months the collected mps were washed with distilled water three times to remove sediment particles and animal and plant residues in sample bags guan et al 2020 then the mps were dried at room temperature for further flotation tests 2 3 flotation removal and surfactant regulation the flotation system consisted of a self designed flotation column with a diameter of 6 cm and a length of 50 cm an air pump and a sphere air stone naturally aged mps 0 1 g were mixed with 1 4 l of distilled water to simulate mps pollution in our pre experiment the mps concentration did not affect the removal efficiency fig s2 the concentration of mps used in this work was close to that of some rivers contaminated by mps leslie et al 2017 and a detailed discussion about mps concentration is provided in the supplementary materials text s1 terpineol 5 mg l was dosed in the flotation column to generate air bubbles and the bubbles and mps formed a lighter than water aggregate thus floating out of the flotation column after the exposure experiments hydrophilic mps might not float in the flotation process in the conditioning process we added collectors and stirred the mixed solution at 180 rpm for 2 min to restore the hydrophobicity of the mps then the mixed solution was poured into the column and flotation lasted for 4 min the floated mps were regarded as the removed mps in addition several factors including conditioning time 1 10 min ph 3 11 collector concentration 1 100 mg l na concentration 0 500 mg l and ca2 concentration 0 50 mg l were considered the presence of metal ions may promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 therefore we set an activation process before the conditioning and tried to reduce the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l trace amounts of ca2 0 05 0 5 mg l fe3 0 05 0 5 mg l or al3 0 05 0 5 mg l were added into the solution and stirred at 180 rpm the activation duration was regulated at 15 min to obtain the optimal efficiency figure s3 after the activation the flotation process was the same as the previous steps with a specific naol concentration 2 5 10 mg l finally an optimal condition was determined based on the removal efficiency 2 4 adsorption experiment the adsorption capacities of naol and dtac on mp surfaces were determined via the change in collector concentration in solution the adsorption capacities of the collectors were calculated as depicted by eq 1 1 c q v c 1 c 2 m where cq mg g is the adsorption capacity of the collector c1 mg l and c2 mg l are the initial and residual concentrations of the collector respectively m g was the mass of mps a total of 50 mg mps was mixed with 50 ml of specific concentrations 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of the collector after conditioning for 30 min the mixed solution was filtered by a ptfe membrane with a pore diameter of 0 22 μm and the residue collector concentration was determined by total organic carbon toc gao et al 2021a we employed langmuir and freundlich models to fit the adsorption isotherm results wang and guo 2020 a detailed description of these models is listed in the supplementary materials text s2 2 5 characterization a contact angle meter was used to measure the hydrophilicity of the mps surface jjc i changchun optical instrument factory china we employed a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 6700 thermofisher scientific usa to record the change of functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nicolet avatar 360 nicolet magua corporation usa was used to characterize the elemental composition of the mps we needed the high resolution spectra of c 1s and si 2p to describe the chemical state information of key elements on the mps surface and the quantification and analysis platform were provided by avantage xps software the surface morphology of mps before and after natural incubation was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope sem evo18 carl zeiss of germany the results of energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds can be obtained from sem scanning and we can obtain the element distribution on mps surfaces the composition of particles coated on mps was revealed by x ray diffraction xrd siemens electronic instruments d500 germany the concentration of collectors naol and dtac in the solution was determined by an automated total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan the uv spectrum of naol was obtained by a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan in a wavelength range between 190 and 400 nm and the formation of flocs changed the uv spectrum of naol gao et al 2021a density functional theory dft simulations were performed by using the gaussian 16 software package for geometry optimization frequency analysis and energy calculation of ps naol and dtac in order to investigate the interaction between mps and collectors detailed information about dft simulation was listed in supplementary materials text s3 the type and number of natural mps were characterized by a laser direct infrared spectroscopy ldir agilent 8700 usa and the detailed pretreatment was listed in supplementary materials text s4 the test of river water quality was presented in supplementary materials text s5 an optical microscope was used to observe the natural mps in water before and after the flotation olympus cx23 japan 2 6 bench scale flotation test surface water was taken from the xiangjiang river at the xiangjiang river changsha comprehensive hub changsha china the water sample was collected 10 30 cm below the surface water using a stainless steel water quality sampler hossain et al 2022 immediately the collected sample was then placed in a glass bottle and maintained at room temperature until further investigation one l of surface water was added to 0 1 mg l fe3 and stirred for 15 min after activation the solution was mixed with 2 5 mg l naol to enhance the hydrophobicity of the mps and 5 mg l terpineol was used as a frother the mixed solution was transferred to the flotation column after flotation particles after the same purification were analyzed by ldir 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface hydrophilization of mps induced by the aquatic environment to test the effectiveness of their removal by froth flotation and to characterize their functional groups elemental composition and surface topography we collected mps throughout various periods of natural incubation the floatability of mps served as an indication of the removal efficiency due to their intrinsic hydrophobicity the removal of original mps performed remarkably well in the flotation however plastic granules only gradually become hydrophilic after being incubated in an aquatic environment the removal efficiency of mps was in the order of pp pet ps pvc pvc floatability vanished within the first month fig 2 a after an incubation period of three months the removal efficiencies of pet and ps were completely eliminated however pp retains its floatability for the first two months and its floatability gradually decreases in the next four months given the abundance of nonpolar cc chains in pp mps we hypothesized that the low density and hydrophobic surface of pp mps might be the causes of their high floatability although the sensitivity of mps to incubation duration varies natural incubation can cause hydrophobic mps to gradually transform into their hydrophilic counterparts as shown in fig 2b 2e the surface of pvc mps has characteristic peaks of c cl 638 and 696 cm 1 and the asymmetric stretching vibration of aliphatic c h 2966 cm 1 raval et al 2018 pet mps possessed stretching vibration peaks of co 1727 and 1673 cm 1 stretching vibration peaks of c o c 1265 and 1124 cm 1 and the in plane deformation vibration of oco 976 cm 1 rivaton 1993a the following adsorption bands on ps are consistent with their composition stretching vibrations of aliphatic ch 2919 and 2848 cm 1 bending vibration of aromatic cc 1600 1582 1492 and 1449 cm 1 and vibration of aromatic ch 756 and 657 cm 1 cheng et al 2017 notably ft ir spectra implied that the pp mps contained abundant plasticizer the ft ir spectra of mps have similar profiles before and after natural incubation except for the co 1030 cm 1 and co 1672 cm 1 adsorption bands which is strong evidence for surface oxidation of mps table s2 also shows an increased proportion of o which was derived from surface oxidation and mineral deposition of mps as shown in fig 3 the xps spectra of synthetic polymers were composed of sp3 c 284 5 ev c o 286 2 ev and o co 289 ev aging is the main reason for the substitution of ch by co and co in the preincubated mps the contents of o co and co of pvc ps pet and pp dramatically rose after six months of natural incubation further demonstrating the occurrence of surface oxidation according to relevant literature ester bonds in pet mps can easily breakdown into co and co groups in an oxidative environment fávaro et al 2007 rivaton 1993b for ps mps the aliphatic ch is easily oxidized as co and oco groups with stable aromatic rings dupont gillain et al 2000 oxidation can introduce co and o co on pvc and pp mps through a chain reaction consisting of proton substitution and chain breaking where cc is a main intermediate product dong et al 2020 thanh truc and lee 2017 c o accounted for the major section on incremental oxygen containing functional groups additionally the amounts of si and al elements in polymer samples rose with the duration of incubation supporting the adherence of clay minerals to plastic surfaces table s2 the si 2p spectra of mps after the six months of natural incubation also confirmed the aluminosilicate on mps surfaces fig s4 according to the water quality the increase in n may be due to the adsorption of nh4 n on mps surfaces table s1 in addition the colonization of biofilms can increase n on mps surfaces guan et al 2020 but we did not detect s and p in xps and eds analyses fig s5 sem images also showed that mps surfaces were mainly covered by si containing particles compared with other work biofilm colonization may not be a major factor for mps hydrophilization in this experiment as seen in fig 4 the polymers in the control group exhibit a smooth and regular surface whereas the plastics that were incubated show a rough and granular surface with ridges pits fractures and scratches crack encircled debris may be scraped off of mps matrices to produce mps with tiny diameters according to the xrd patterns fig s6 yeelinite gismondine mirabilite quartz and calcite amorphous particles comprising ca si al and mg were found on the surface of mps the aging effect of mps introduced abundant oxygen containing functional groups co and oco subsequently chemical bonds with strong polarity induce mps to adsorb fine mineral particles in aquatic environments mahadevi and sastry 2013 some studies also mention that sediment particles can be spontaneously deposited onto the surface of plastics based on interaction energy calculations li et al 2019 in conclusion the incubation in aquatic environments leads to surface oxidation and deposition of aluminosilicate particles thereby resulting in the hydrophilization of mps therefore the hydrophilicity of mps is greatly enhanced and the adhesion of air bubbles on mps is weakened threfore there is an urgent need to restore the hydrophobicity of mps 3 2 hydrophobicity recovery of mps in mineral engineering when mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants are often used to enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and to selectively separate them in flotation de medeiros and baltar 2018 in this work we used naol as an anionic collector to restore the hydrophobicity of the aged mps ph collector concentration and conditioning time were key factors for the hydrophobicity recovery wei et al 2021 at the same concentration of naol pp showed higher removal efficiency than that of other mps because it was not completely hydrophilic after six months of natural exposure naol concentration significantly contributed to the increase in the removal efficiency of mps from 0 to approximately 80 fig 5 a notably the high concentration of naol 100 mg l was still less than the critical micelle concentration cmc of naol sun et al 2022 at the same naol concentration 50 mg l the flotation removal of pp pet and ps was more efficient in acidic environments alkalinity may inhibit the flotation process naol in solution can be hydrolyzed into na oleate in alkaline environments and oleic acid in acidic environments the oleic acid molecules play a vital role in the hydrophobicity recovery of mps in the alkaline environment the electrostatic repulsion between more negatively charged mps and oleate may be stronger gao et al 2022a interestingly the pvc removal efficiency increased with increasing ph and then gradually decreased at ph 9 fig 5b the previous xrd and sem results indicated the presence of caco3 filler on the pvc surface caco3 may generate ca2 in acid and form calcium oleate deposits which hinder the adsorption of oleate on the mps surface metal ions can activate mineral surfaces and promote the adsorption of some collectors gao et al 2021b the addition of na at high concentrations can significantly improve the removal efficiency fig 5c which followed the order of pp pet ps pvc metal ions in higher valence states can promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 ca2 inevitably adhered to the negatively charged surfaces of mps and activated mps surfaces therefore the electrostatic repulsion between oleate and mps can be weakened we assumed that electrostatic interactions could significantly affect the adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the low concentration of ca2 0 1 mg l promoted the removal of pp pet and ps but inhibited that of pvc fig 5d the ca2 on the mps surfaces strengthened the adsorption of oleate thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity recovery of mps however pvc has inherent ca2 on its surface due to the presence of caco3 filler furthermore the mixture of ca2 and naol might generate nanocolloid particles of calcium oleate feng et al 2018 because the uv absorbance of naol increased with the flocs and a higher ca2 concentration could form more calcium oleate fig 5f the addition of ca2 decreased the cmc of the solution and the formation of calcium oleate consumed some oleate thus the removal was less effective wang et al 2021 a low dosage of ca2 can improve mps flotation removal using naol while excessive ca2 might form flocs with oleate and hinder flotation the effect of the conditioning time on the removal efficiency was not significant fig 5e the hydrophobic recovery of mps was achieved almost instantaneously indicating a rapid adsorption of naol on mps to alleviate the electrostatic repulsion between mps and the collector we used cationic dtac to enhance the flotation removal of mps the promoting effect of dtac at low concentrations less than 50 mg l on mps removal was considerably higher than that of naol fig 6 a nevertheless the improvement in the removal efficiency of pvc was not as expected because ca2 leached from pvc interfered with the action of dtac besides the inherent hydrophilicity of naturally incubated pvc was strong and many collectors were needed to restore the hydrophobicity of pvc when the dtac concentration was further increased to 100 mg l approximately 80 of pp pet and ps could be removed which was close to the results of naol conditioning the collection capacity of dtac was affected by the ph value and a stark 2 4 fold increase in the removal efficiency of mps was observed as the ph value increased from 3 to 11 fig 6b the interaction between mps and dtac was stronger in alkaline environments ionic strength can enhance the electrostatic interaction between mps and naol gao et al 2021b conversely the presence of na did not improve the removal efficiency even though the flotation removal of ps was mildly inhibited fig 6c na could cause an increase in surface potentials on mps weakening the electrostatic interaction between mps and dtac the inhibition effect of ca2 was more significant and dtac showed almost no effect on pvc recovery at a ca2 concentration of 10 mg l fig 6d likewise dtac could efficiently restore the hydrophobicity of mps within 1 min fig 6e the activation of cations decreased the collection ability of dtac but increased that of naol previous research found that dtac concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l could cause genotoxicity in mammalian or plant cells ferk et al 2007 compared to cationic dtac anionic naol tended to be more biodegradable and less toxic tatini et al 2021 as a result naol has superior application potential in the flotation removal of mps 3 3 adsorption of naol and dtac we conducted adsorption isotherm experiments to investigate the interaction between collectors and mps the correlated fitting parameters and correlation coefficients are listed in table s3 based on ft ir and xps results all mps contained inherent oxygen containing groups which might improve the adsorption capacity of the collectors according to the naol conditioning the adsorption isotherm of mps was better fitted using the freundlich adsorption model r2 0 97 0 99 than the langmuir model r 2 0 90 0 99 physical adsorption may dominate the interactions between mps and collectors these results supported that the adsorption of naol molecules on mps surfaces was heterogeneous the adsorption capacity of naol followed the order pvc pp pet ps fig 7 a while this order was inconsistent with the removal efficiency the adsorption capacity of naol by pvc was greater than that of other mps which could be attributed to the higher proportion of oxygen containing groups and the polarity of the ccl bond zou et al 2020 although electrostatic repulsion might hinder the adsorption of naol on the mp surface van der waals forces and lewis acid ab attraction contribute to adsorption peng and wang 2022 sun et al 2023 at a dtac of 50 mg l the adsorption capacities of dtac of pvc pet ps and pp only reached 0 78 mg g 0 55 mg g 0 39 mg g and 0 65 mg g fig 7b respectively similarly the heterogeneous adsorption of dtac on mps was well described by the freundlich adsorption model r 2 0 96 and the adsorption was favorable n 1 text s2 a surfactant consists of a polar headgroup and a nonpolar tail and the polar groups provide electrostatic attraction or repulsion interestingly despite the stronger electrostatic attraction of cationic dtac to negatively charged mps the adsorption capacity of dtac was much lower than that of naol indicating that the contribution by polar groups was limited therefore the nonplar groups of the surfactant dominate the adsorption the longer chain length can generate stronger hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant and mps atkin et al 2003 due to the different lengths of hydrocarbon chains figure s1 the adsorption capacities of dtac and naol on mps vary 3 4 characterization of surfactant on mps after conditioning with naol intense peaks were observed at 1540 cm 1 2853 cm 1 and 2919 cm 1 on the pvc surface corresponding to the carboxyl cooh asymmetric and symmetric ch vibrations respectively which confirmed the highest adsorption capacity of naol on pvc fig 8 a besides the enhanced peaks of cooh and ch bonds appeared on the pet surfaces after the naol conditioning fig 8d due to the low adsorption capacity of naol the ft ir spectra of the treated ps showed only a weak change in cooh fig 8c no new peaks appeared under the effect of dtac on the one hand the adsorption capacity of dtac on mps was much lower than that of naol according to the previous adsorption results on the other hand the stretching of the cn bond at 1481 cm 1 and the bending vibration of the nh bond at 1140 cm 1 might overlap with the original peaks of hydrophilic mps warsi et al 2022 in addition the abundant ammonia nitrogen in natural water bodies may be adsorbed on the mps surfaces resulting in insignificant changes in the ft ir of naturally incubated mps after dtac conditioning li et al 2021 contact angle measurements provided a more visual indication of the hydrophilic variation on the mps surfaces the original mps exhibit hydrophobic surfaces with higher contact angles after natural incubation for 6 months the contact angles of mps significantly decreased fig 8e the adsorption of dtac and naol both contributed to the increased contact angles of mps indicating the enhanced hydrophobicity of mps by collectors according to fig 9 a and 9 c the extrema of electrostatic potential only exist in carboxyl groups and trimethylammoniums of collectors implying a slight electrostatic potential difference between ps and collector molecules the electrostatic potential difference is a driving factor for the molecular interaction which causes the ps and collectors to attract each other however there is no notable attraction between ps and collector molecules the visualized weak interaction energy reveals the combination of electrostatic repulsion and dispersion energy among mps and collectors fig 9b and 9d lu and chen 2021 the repulsion energy may be induced by the steric hindrance of aromatic rings and the dispersion energy is a main contributor to molecular attraction that may be attributed to hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains table s4 in addition the interactions between ps and collectors involve ambiguous hydrogen bond components therefore the hydrocarbon chains of oleic acid and dtac tend to laminate and wrap on the mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps 3 5 ionic activation to conserve naol considering the cost and pollution of reagents we wanted to confine the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l at this concentration active sludge exhibited a high tolerance to naol toxicity alves et al 2001 metal ions with higher valence have proven to be effective in improving flotation efficiency with the activation of ca2 the removal ratio of most mps was increased except for pvc as mentioned in our previous discussion due to the caco3 filler the surface of pvc discharged ca2 and excess ca2 generated calcium oleate that inhibited the collection process the removal efficiencies of pet pp and ps peaked at a ca2 concentration of 0 10 mg l fig s7 and gradually declined with increasing ca2 concentration in general it was difficult to achieve 80 removal of mps with the activation by ca2 interestingly metal ions with higher valences such as al3 and fe3 exhibited a more significant activation effect fig s7 in addition although the flotation of pvc could not be activated by ca2 over 80 pvc could be removed after the activation of 0 10 mg l al3 5 00 mg l naol or 0 10 mg l fe3 2 50 mg l naol higher concentrations of naol did not determine the highest removal ratio and the ratio of metal ions to naol also mattered under the combined effect of 0 05 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol approximately 100 of pvc could be removed by flotation due to the cost and sustainability of the reagents we determined 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol as the optimized conditions under these conditions the flotation removal process not only obtained high removal efficiency 80 of all mps but also reduced the environmental burden of reagent consumption according to figure s8 hydrophilic mps first experienced the activation of metal ions and the adsorption of abundant metal ions increased the surface potential of the mps the bridging effect of ions promoted the adsorption of oleate and oleic acid on mps finally air bubbles adhered to mps to form a bubble mps aggregate that floated out of the water 3 6 application of mps flotation we used fe3 to activate the collection of mps and performed flotation removal on natural water samples from the xiangjiang river flotation removal could reduce the turbidity of water to some extent however the comparison of microscope images suggested the presence of plastic fiber in untreated and treated water fig 10 a and b ldir was used to analyze the polymer content in water samples fig 10c shows that silicon resin accounted for the greatest proportion 59 0 of mps in the xiangjiang river followed by pu 34 1 silicon resin could originate from the coating of vessels because the xiangjiang river is an important waterway lagerström et al 2022 after flotation scarce plastic particles were observed in the water samples fig 10d flotation significantly reduced the numbers of silicon resin and pu and those of other mps fluctuated slightly the flotation removal of mps statistically reached 52 1 which is lower than that in the simulated removal experiments the collector can be adsorbed and consumed by suspended particles and we need to find a balance between collector dosage and pollution control besides the collision probability played a vital role in flotation removal and tiny mps might require smaller denser air bubbles to improve the collision probability therefore surfactant selectivity and nano bubble production may promote mps removal even so flotation removal has the potential to treat localized mps pollution such as the effluent of wastewater treatment plants the development of mps flotation would benefit from the technology of micro and nanobubbles 4 conclusion in this work we thoroughly investigated the application of flotation for mps removal and found that the hydrophilization of mps in the natural environment might obstruct flotation after naturally incubating mps in aquatic environments for six months the removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 0 the hydrophilization order of mps is as follows pvc ps pet pp several characterizations were employed to investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments which were induced by a rise in oxygen containing groups and clay mineral adhesion a collection process before flotation was necessary to enhance the hydrophobicity of mps we innovatively utilized cationic and anionic collectors namely naol and dtac for the flotation removal of mps the effects of ph reagent concentration time and ionic strength were thoroughly investigated the adsorption isotherm suggested that heterogeneous adsorption of naol and dtac on mps occurred considering the pollution and the applied range we preferred to use naol based on the dft analysis it could be concluded that the hydrocarbon chains of collectors tend to laminate and wrap on mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps furthermore the activation of metal ions was used to improve the flotation process and the optimal conditions were 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol the significant reduction in natural mps confirmed the utility of froth flotation these findings provide valuable insights into the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and the interaction mechanism of collectors

15003,microplastics mps are increasingly released into the environment due to the widespread usage and improper management of plastics considerable research efforts have been devoted to the remediation of mps froth flotation has been demonstrated as an effective method to remove mps in water and sediment however there is a lack of knowledge on the regulation of the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of mps surfaces we found that exposure to the natural environment resulted in the increased hydrophilicity of mps the flotation efficiencies of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps decreased to zero after six months of natural incubation in rivers according to various characterizations the hydrophilization mechanism is mainly correlated with surface oxidation and the deposition of clay minerals inspired by surface wettability conversion we applied surfactants collectors to enhance mps hydrophobicity and flotation efficiency anionic sodium oleate naol and cationic dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac were used to regulate surface hydrophobicity the effects of collector concentration ph conditioning time and metal ions on mps flotation were thoroughly elucidated characterizations and adsorption experiments were performed to describe the heterogeneous adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the interaction between surfactants and mps was explained through density functional theory dft simulations the dispersion energy between hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains attracts collectors on the mps surface and the collector molecules wrap and laminate to mps surfaces flotation using naol exhibited a higher removal efficiency and naol was environmentally friendly subsequently we investigated the activation of ca2 fe3 and al3 to further improve the collecting efficiency of naol under the optimized conditions mps in natural rivers could be removed by froth flotation this study shows the great promise of froth flotation for the application of mps removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics removal froth flotation collector hydrophilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution is an emerging environmental issue due to its potentially harmful effects on ecosystems mps are plastic particles less than 5 mm in size with the increasing global production of plastics 4 8 12 7 million metric tons of mps are estimated to enter the ocean every year and approximately 80 of mps in the ocean are derived from land based sources rochman 2018 mps result in decreased feeding activity dwindling reserves altered immune and inflammatory responses and neurotoxic effects on organisms dawson et al 2018 some evidence has confirmed that the concentration of mps in human blood reaches 1 6 µg ml leslie et al 2022 and the correlation between mps and inflammatory bowel disease ibd status has been demonstrated to be significant yan et al 2022 in addition the accumulation of heavy metals organic pollutants and viruses may increase the toxicity of mps to biota tang et al 2021 in the past two decades worldwide research has contributed to advances concerning the sources transportation occurrence chemical behavior toxicology and ecological effects of mps fei et al 2022 due to human activity the abundance of mps in canal rivers can exceed 140 items l leslie et al 2017 researchers found that mps in the surface water of the yellow river even reached 930 items l han et al 2020 with the increase in mps contamination the development of mps removal technology is critical regarding mps separation from the aquatic environment many researchers have focused on quantitative analysis by using density extraction grause et al 2022 magnetic separation ramage et al 2022 adsorption luo et al 2022 electrostatic separation enders et al 2020 and oil separation scopetani et al 2020 however many methods are limited to the bench scale extraction of mps therefore several strategies for water treatment are considered such as chemical coagulation rajala et al 2020 electrocoagulation shen et al 2022 and membrane filtration nabi et al 2022 however many techniques have focused on the size and concentration of mps for removal but have neglected the surface hydrophobicity of mps the intrinsic hydrophobicity of plastic is stronger than that of environmental media therefore froth flotation developed for mineral separation has the potential to remove mps the adherence of air bubbles on mps forms an aggregation of mps and air bubbles which can float from water due to their lower density jiang et al 2020 flotation can remove mps of different densities in surface water and be applied to remediate localized contamination by mps several studies have investigated the flotation of mps real time monitoring of mp bubble interactions at the microscale and mp concentrations has been realized swart et al 2022 in addition modified or functionalized microbubbles have drawn much interest because of their efficiency in capturing mps increasing the effectiveness of removal zhang et al 2021a according to the findings of the life cycle assessment lca froth flotation had a significantly lower cost and environmental impact than that of alternative removal processes jiang et al 2022a however plastics undergo a series of surface changes in their natural environment that alter surface wettability this work assumes that mps increase hydrophilicity in natural water bodies and flotation removal can be achieved by restoring hydrophobicity through surfactant regulation mps can interact with environmental media and undergo oxidation and increasing oxygen containing groups and roughness can enhance the hydrophilicity of mps in addition mps may contain different active sites and exhibit varying sensitivities to oxidation zhang et al 2020 the interaction between mps and metal ions also depends on chelation with oxygen containing groups tang et al 2020 nevertheless low concentrations of organic matter and metal ions in the natural environment make it difficult for mps to be hydrophilic and sink in the flotation process zhang et al 2021b the energy barrier between mps and sediment particles can be weakened as a result of the bridge effect of metal ions which causes the spontaneous deposition of sediment particles on mps surfaces jiang et al 2022a it is possible that mps are easily hydrophilized in the environment and that flotation removal is significantly hampered however the hydrophilization process of mps in the natural environment has not been thoroughly investigated the development of mps flotation should resolve these major stumbling blocks given the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mps long chain surfactants with hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties may adhere to mps surfaces and enhance the hydrophobicity of mps through van der waals forces and the hydrophobic forces jiang et al 2022b because mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants namely collectors are often used in mineral engineering to selectively enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and separate them in flotation because of its great effectiveness low cost and environmental friendliness sodium oleate naol a typical anionic collector has been extensively employed in the flotation of oxide and silicate minerals gao et al 2022b apart from the essential contribution of hydrophobic interactions the electrostatic attraction may significantly enhance the adsorption between mps and the cationic collector shen et al 2021 compared to other cationic collectors quaternary ammonium salts are more stable are less hazardous and exhibit stronger collecting abilities thus we chose dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac as a promising candidate jiang et al 2018 herein this study aimed to investigate the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and its impact on subsequently applied froth flotation in the removal of mps for these purposes the main objectives were a to comprehensively simulate the natural exposure of polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet mps b to systematically investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments c to study the flotation removal of mps using naol and dtac d to analyze the interaction between mps and collectors aided by density functional theory dft simulation and e to optimize the removal process by activating mps surfaces and verify the feasibility of mps flotation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mps and reagents polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet were derived from wastewater pipes textiles packages lampshades and bottles respectively these waste plastics were crushed into debris with a diameter of 500 1000 μm for the preparation of mps recently some reports mentioned that the mps in the surface water of the estuary region were larger 0 5 mm 81 9 due to more frequent human activities huang et al 2023 these mps were rinsed with distilled water and dried at room temperature all reagents used in this experiment included terpineol sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl sodium oleate naol dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac sodium chloride nacl calcium chloride cacl2 ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum chloride alcl3 figure s1 shows the structures of naol and dtac which are typical anionic and cationic collectors in mineral processing 2 2 natural incubation of mps we prepared round shrimp traps with a diameter of 40 cm and 100 mesh pore size 150 μm nylon bags first we placed 10 g of mps 500 1000 μm into the nylon sample bag and sealed it the mps in the bags can fully interact with the aquatic environment and the mps sample could not leak out fig 1 mps less than 74 μm for characterization were placed in 300 mesh pore size 53 μm sample bags the nylon bag was fixed at the bottom of the trap the shrimp cage was suspended 10 30 cm below the river surface as shown in fig 1 the outdoor exposure experiment of mps began in october 2021 and was conducted in the yudai river changsha china the mps in the bags were collected at 0 1 2 3 and 6 months the collected mps were washed with distilled water three times to remove sediment particles and animal and plant residues in sample bags guan et al 2020 then the mps were dried at room temperature for further flotation tests 2 3 flotation removal and surfactant regulation the flotation system consisted of a self designed flotation column with a diameter of 6 cm and a length of 50 cm an air pump and a sphere air stone naturally aged mps 0 1 g were mixed with 1 4 l of distilled water to simulate mps pollution in our pre experiment the mps concentration did not affect the removal efficiency fig s2 the concentration of mps used in this work was close to that of some rivers contaminated by mps leslie et al 2017 and a detailed discussion about mps concentration is provided in the supplementary materials text s1 terpineol 5 mg l was dosed in the flotation column to generate air bubbles and the bubbles and mps formed a lighter than water aggregate thus floating out of the flotation column after the exposure experiments hydrophilic mps might not float in the flotation process in the conditioning process we added collectors and stirred the mixed solution at 180 rpm for 2 min to restore the hydrophobicity of the mps then the mixed solution was poured into the column and flotation lasted for 4 min the floated mps were regarded as the removed mps in addition several factors including conditioning time 1 10 min ph 3 11 collector concentration 1 100 mg l na concentration 0 500 mg l and ca2 concentration 0 50 mg l were considered the presence of metal ions may promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 therefore we set an activation process before the conditioning and tried to reduce the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l trace amounts of ca2 0 05 0 5 mg l fe3 0 05 0 5 mg l or al3 0 05 0 5 mg l were added into the solution and stirred at 180 rpm the activation duration was regulated at 15 min to obtain the optimal efficiency figure s3 after the activation the flotation process was the same as the previous steps with a specific naol concentration 2 5 10 mg l finally an optimal condition was determined based on the removal efficiency 2 4 adsorption experiment the adsorption capacities of naol and dtac on mp surfaces were determined via the change in collector concentration in solution the adsorption capacities of the collectors were calculated as depicted by eq 1 1 c q v c 1 c 2 m where cq mg g is the adsorption capacity of the collector c1 mg l and c2 mg l are the initial and residual concentrations of the collector respectively m g was the mass of mps a total of 50 mg mps was mixed with 50 ml of specific concentrations 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of the collector after conditioning for 30 min the mixed solution was filtered by a ptfe membrane with a pore diameter of 0 22 μm and the residue collector concentration was determined by total organic carbon toc gao et al 2021a we employed langmuir and freundlich models to fit the adsorption isotherm results wang and guo 2020 a detailed description of these models is listed in the supplementary materials text s2 2 5 characterization a contact angle meter was used to measure the hydrophilicity of the mps surface jjc i changchun optical instrument factory china we employed a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 6700 thermofisher scientific usa to record the change of functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nicolet avatar 360 nicolet magua corporation usa was used to characterize the elemental composition of the mps we needed the high resolution spectra of c 1s and si 2p to describe the chemical state information of key elements on the mps surface and the quantification and analysis platform were provided by avantage xps software the surface morphology of mps before and after natural incubation was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope sem evo18 carl zeiss of germany the results of energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds can be obtained from sem scanning and we can obtain the element distribution on mps surfaces the composition of particles coated on mps was revealed by x ray diffraction xrd siemens electronic instruments d500 germany the concentration of collectors naol and dtac in the solution was determined by an automated total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan the uv spectrum of naol was obtained by a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan in a wavelength range between 190 and 400 nm and the formation of flocs changed the uv spectrum of naol gao et al 2021a density functional theory dft simulations were performed by using the gaussian 16 software package for geometry optimization frequency analysis and energy calculation of ps naol and dtac in order to investigate the interaction between mps and collectors detailed information about dft simulation was listed in supplementary materials text s3 the type and number of natural mps were characterized by a laser direct infrared spectroscopy ldir agilent 8700 usa and the detailed pretreatment was listed in supplementary materials text s4 the test of river water quality was presented in supplementary materials text s5 an optical microscope was used to observe the natural mps in water before and after the flotation olympus cx23 japan 2 6 bench scale flotation test surface water was taken from the xiangjiang river at the xiangjiang river changsha comprehensive hub changsha china the water sample was collected 10 30 cm below the surface water using a stainless steel water quality sampler hossain et al 2022 immediately the collected sample was then placed in a glass bottle and maintained at room temperature until further investigation one l of surface water was added to 0 1 mg l fe3 and stirred for 15 min after activation the solution was mixed with 2 5 mg l naol to enhance the hydrophobicity of the mps and 5 mg l terpineol was used as a frother the mixed solution was transferred to the flotation column after flotation particles after the same purification were analyzed by ldir 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface hydrophilization of mps induced by the aquatic environment to test the effectiveness of their removal by froth flotation and to characterize their functional groups elemental composition and surface topography we collected mps throughout various periods of natural incubation the floatability of mps served as an indication of the removal efficiency due to their intrinsic hydrophobicity the removal of original mps performed remarkably well in the flotation however plastic granules only gradually become hydrophilic after being incubated in an aquatic environment the removal efficiency of mps was in the order of pp pet ps pvc pvc floatability vanished within the first month fig 2 a after an incubation period of three months the removal efficiencies of pet and ps were completely eliminated however pp retains its floatability for the first two months and its floatability gradually decreases in the next four months given the abundance of nonpolar cc chains in pp mps we hypothesized that the low density and hydrophobic surface of pp mps might be the causes of their high floatability although the sensitivity of mps to incubation duration varies natural incubation can cause hydrophobic mps to gradually transform into their hydrophilic counterparts as shown in fig 2b 2e the surface of pvc mps has characteristic peaks of c cl 638 and 696 cm 1 and the asymmetric stretching vibration of aliphatic c h 2966 cm 1 raval et al 2018 pet mps possessed stretching vibration peaks of co 1727 and 1673 cm 1 stretching vibration peaks of c o c 1265 and 1124 cm 1 and the in plane deformation vibration of oco 976 cm 1 rivaton 1993a the following adsorption bands on ps are consistent with their composition stretching vibrations of aliphatic ch 2919 and 2848 cm 1 bending vibration of aromatic cc 1600 1582 1492 and 1449 cm 1 and vibration of aromatic ch 756 and 657 cm 1 cheng et al 2017 notably ft ir spectra implied that the pp mps contained abundant plasticizer the ft ir spectra of mps have similar profiles before and after natural incubation except for the co 1030 cm 1 and co 1672 cm 1 adsorption bands which is strong evidence for surface oxidation of mps table s2 also shows an increased proportion of o which was derived from surface oxidation and mineral deposition of mps as shown in fig 3 the xps spectra of synthetic polymers were composed of sp3 c 284 5 ev c o 286 2 ev and o co 289 ev aging is the main reason for the substitution of ch by co and co in the preincubated mps the contents of o co and co of pvc ps pet and pp dramatically rose after six months of natural incubation further demonstrating the occurrence of surface oxidation according to relevant literature ester bonds in pet mps can easily breakdown into co and co groups in an oxidative environment fávaro et al 2007 rivaton 1993b for ps mps the aliphatic ch is easily oxidized as co and oco groups with stable aromatic rings dupont gillain et al 2000 oxidation can introduce co and o co on pvc and pp mps through a chain reaction consisting of proton substitution and chain breaking where cc is a main intermediate product dong et al 2020 thanh truc and lee 2017 c o accounted for the major section on incremental oxygen containing functional groups additionally the amounts of si and al elements in polymer samples rose with the duration of incubation supporting the adherence of clay minerals to plastic surfaces table s2 the si 2p spectra of mps after the six months of natural incubation also confirmed the aluminosilicate on mps surfaces fig s4 according to the water quality the increase in n may be due to the adsorption of nh4 n on mps surfaces table s1 in addition the colonization of biofilms can increase n on mps surfaces guan et al 2020 but we did not detect s and p in xps and eds analyses fig s5 sem images also showed that mps surfaces were mainly covered by si containing particles compared with other work biofilm colonization may not be a major factor for mps hydrophilization in this experiment as seen in fig 4 the polymers in the control group exhibit a smooth and regular surface whereas the plastics that were incubated show a rough and granular surface with ridges pits fractures and scratches crack encircled debris may be scraped off of mps matrices to produce mps with tiny diameters according to the xrd patterns fig s6 yeelinite gismondine mirabilite quartz and calcite amorphous particles comprising ca si al and mg were found on the surface of mps the aging effect of mps introduced abundant oxygen containing functional groups co and oco subsequently chemical bonds with strong polarity induce mps to adsorb fine mineral particles in aquatic environments mahadevi and sastry 2013 some studies also mention that sediment particles can be spontaneously deposited onto the surface of plastics based on interaction energy calculations li et al 2019 in conclusion the incubation in aquatic environments leads to surface oxidation and deposition of aluminosilicate particles thereby resulting in the hydrophilization of mps therefore the hydrophilicity of mps is greatly enhanced and the adhesion of air bubbles on mps is weakened threfore there is an urgent need to restore the hydrophobicity of mps 3 2 hydrophobicity recovery of mps in mineral engineering when mineral particles are hydrophilic surfactants are often used to enhance the hydrophobicity of mineral particles and to selectively separate them in flotation de medeiros and baltar 2018 in this work we used naol as an anionic collector to restore the hydrophobicity of the aged mps ph collector concentration and conditioning time were key factors for the hydrophobicity recovery wei et al 2021 at the same concentration of naol pp showed higher removal efficiency than that of other mps because it was not completely hydrophilic after six months of natural exposure naol concentration significantly contributed to the increase in the removal efficiency of mps from 0 to approximately 80 fig 5 a notably the high concentration of naol 100 mg l was still less than the critical micelle concentration cmc of naol sun et al 2022 at the same naol concentration 50 mg l the flotation removal of pp pet and ps was more efficient in acidic environments alkalinity may inhibit the flotation process naol in solution can be hydrolyzed into na oleate in alkaline environments and oleic acid in acidic environments the oleic acid molecules play a vital role in the hydrophobicity recovery of mps in the alkaline environment the electrostatic repulsion between more negatively charged mps and oleate may be stronger gao et al 2022a interestingly the pvc removal efficiency increased with increasing ph and then gradually decreased at ph 9 fig 5b the previous xrd and sem results indicated the presence of caco3 filler on the pvc surface caco3 may generate ca2 in acid and form calcium oleate deposits which hinder the adsorption of oleate on the mps surface metal ions can activate mineral surfaces and promote the adsorption of some collectors gao et al 2021b the addition of na at high concentrations can significantly improve the removal efficiency fig 5c which followed the order of pp pet ps pvc metal ions in higher valence states can promote the adsorption of organic matter on mps surfaces lv et al 2023 ca2 inevitably adhered to the negatively charged surfaces of mps and activated mps surfaces therefore the electrostatic repulsion between oleate and mps can be weakened we assumed that electrostatic interactions could significantly affect the adsorption of surfactants on mps surfaces the low concentration of ca2 0 1 mg l promoted the removal of pp pet and ps but inhibited that of pvc fig 5d the ca2 on the mps surfaces strengthened the adsorption of oleate thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity recovery of mps however pvc has inherent ca2 on its surface due to the presence of caco3 filler furthermore the mixture of ca2 and naol might generate nanocolloid particles of calcium oleate feng et al 2018 because the uv absorbance of naol increased with the flocs and a higher ca2 concentration could form more calcium oleate fig 5f the addition of ca2 decreased the cmc of the solution and the formation of calcium oleate consumed some oleate thus the removal was less effective wang et al 2021 a low dosage of ca2 can improve mps flotation removal using naol while excessive ca2 might form flocs with oleate and hinder flotation the effect of the conditioning time on the removal efficiency was not significant fig 5e the hydrophobic recovery of mps was achieved almost instantaneously indicating a rapid adsorption of naol on mps to alleviate the electrostatic repulsion between mps and the collector we used cationic dtac to enhance the flotation removal of mps the promoting effect of dtac at low concentrations less than 50 mg l on mps removal was considerably higher than that of naol fig 6 a nevertheless the improvement in the removal efficiency of pvc was not as expected because ca2 leached from pvc interfered with the action of dtac besides the inherent hydrophilicity of naturally incubated pvc was strong and many collectors were needed to restore the hydrophobicity of pvc when the dtac concentration was further increased to 100 mg l approximately 80 of pp pet and ps could be removed which was close to the results of naol conditioning the collection capacity of dtac was affected by the ph value and a stark 2 4 fold increase in the removal efficiency of mps was observed as the ph value increased from 3 to 11 fig 6b the interaction between mps and dtac was stronger in alkaline environments ionic strength can enhance the electrostatic interaction between mps and naol gao et al 2021b conversely the presence of na did not improve the removal efficiency even though the flotation removal of ps was mildly inhibited fig 6c na could cause an increase in surface potentials on mps weakening the electrostatic interaction between mps and dtac the inhibition effect of ca2 was more significant and dtac showed almost no effect on pvc recovery at a ca2 concentration of 10 mg l fig 6d likewise dtac could efficiently restore the hydrophobicity of mps within 1 min fig 6e the activation of cations decreased the collection ability of dtac but increased that of naol previous research found that dtac concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l could cause genotoxicity in mammalian or plant cells ferk et al 2007 compared to cationic dtac anionic naol tended to be more biodegradable and less toxic tatini et al 2021 as a result naol has superior application potential in the flotation removal of mps 3 3 adsorption of naol and dtac we conducted adsorption isotherm experiments to investigate the interaction between collectors and mps the correlated fitting parameters and correlation coefficients are listed in table s3 based on ft ir and xps results all mps contained inherent oxygen containing groups which might improve the adsorption capacity of the collectors according to the naol conditioning the adsorption isotherm of mps was better fitted using the freundlich adsorption model r2 0 97 0 99 than the langmuir model r 2 0 90 0 99 physical adsorption may dominate the interactions between mps and collectors these results supported that the adsorption of naol molecules on mps surfaces was heterogeneous the adsorption capacity of naol followed the order pvc pp pet ps fig 7 a while this order was inconsistent with the removal efficiency the adsorption capacity of naol by pvc was greater than that of other mps which could be attributed to the higher proportion of oxygen containing groups and the polarity of the ccl bond zou et al 2020 although electrostatic repulsion might hinder the adsorption of naol on the mp surface van der waals forces and lewis acid ab attraction contribute to adsorption peng and wang 2022 sun et al 2023 at a dtac of 50 mg l the adsorption capacities of dtac of pvc pet ps and pp only reached 0 78 mg g 0 55 mg g 0 39 mg g and 0 65 mg g fig 7b respectively similarly the heterogeneous adsorption of dtac on mps was well described by the freundlich adsorption model r 2 0 96 and the adsorption was favorable n 1 text s2 a surfactant consists of a polar headgroup and a nonpolar tail and the polar groups provide electrostatic attraction or repulsion interestingly despite the stronger electrostatic attraction of cationic dtac to negatively charged mps the adsorption capacity of dtac was much lower than that of naol indicating that the contribution by polar groups was limited therefore the nonplar groups of the surfactant dominate the adsorption the longer chain length can generate stronger hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant and mps atkin et al 2003 due to the different lengths of hydrocarbon chains figure s1 the adsorption capacities of dtac and naol on mps vary 3 4 characterization of surfactant on mps after conditioning with naol intense peaks were observed at 1540 cm 1 2853 cm 1 and 2919 cm 1 on the pvc surface corresponding to the carboxyl cooh asymmetric and symmetric ch vibrations respectively which confirmed the highest adsorption capacity of naol on pvc fig 8 a besides the enhanced peaks of cooh and ch bonds appeared on the pet surfaces after the naol conditioning fig 8d due to the low adsorption capacity of naol the ft ir spectra of the treated ps showed only a weak change in cooh fig 8c no new peaks appeared under the effect of dtac on the one hand the adsorption capacity of dtac on mps was much lower than that of naol according to the previous adsorption results on the other hand the stretching of the cn bond at 1481 cm 1 and the bending vibration of the nh bond at 1140 cm 1 might overlap with the original peaks of hydrophilic mps warsi et al 2022 in addition the abundant ammonia nitrogen in natural water bodies may be adsorbed on the mps surfaces resulting in insignificant changes in the ft ir of naturally incubated mps after dtac conditioning li et al 2021 contact angle measurements provided a more visual indication of the hydrophilic variation on the mps surfaces the original mps exhibit hydrophobic surfaces with higher contact angles after natural incubation for 6 months the contact angles of mps significantly decreased fig 8e the adsorption of dtac and naol both contributed to the increased contact angles of mps indicating the enhanced hydrophobicity of mps by collectors according to fig 9 a and 9 c the extrema of electrostatic potential only exist in carboxyl groups and trimethylammoniums of collectors implying a slight electrostatic potential difference between ps and collector molecules the electrostatic potential difference is a driving factor for the molecular interaction which causes the ps and collectors to attract each other however there is no notable attraction between ps and collector molecules the visualized weak interaction energy reveals the combination of electrostatic repulsion and dispersion energy among mps and collectors fig 9b and 9d lu and chen 2021 the repulsion energy may be induced by the steric hindrance of aromatic rings and the dispersion energy is a main contributor to molecular attraction that may be attributed to hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains table s4 in addition the interactions between ps and collectors involve ambiguous hydrogen bond components therefore the hydrocarbon chains of oleic acid and dtac tend to laminate and wrap on the mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps 3 5 ionic activation to conserve naol considering the cost and pollution of reagents we wanted to confine the naol concentration to less than 10 mg l at this concentration active sludge exhibited a high tolerance to naol toxicity alves et al 2001 metal ions with higher valence have proven to be effective in improving flotation efficiency with the activation of ca2 the removal ratio of most mps was increased except for pvc as mentioned in our previous discussion due to the caco3 filler the surface of pvc discharged ca2 and excess ca2 generated calcium oleate that inhibited the collection process the removal efficiencies of pet pp and ps peaked at a ca2 concentration of 0 10 mg l fig s7 and gradually declined with increasing ca2 concentration in general it was difficult to achieve 80 removal of mps with the activation by ca2 interestingly metal ions with higher valences such as al3 and fe3 exhibited a more significant activation effect fig s7 in addition although the flotation of pvc could not be activated by ca2 over 80 pvc could be removed after the activation of 0 10 mg l al3 5 00 mg l naol or 0 10 mg l fe3 2 50 mg l naol higher concentrations of naol did not determine the highest removal ratio and the ratio of metal ions to naol also mattered under the combined effect of 0 05 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol approximately 100 of pvc could be removed by flotation due to the cost and sustainability of the reagents we determined 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol as the optimized conditions under these conditions the flotation removal process not only obtained high removal efficiency 80 of all mps but also reduced the environmental burden of reagent consumption according to figure s8 hydrophilic mps first experienced the activation of metal ions and the adsorption of abundant metal ions increased the surface potential of the mps the bridging effect of ions promoted the adsorption of oleate and oleic acid on mps finally air bubbles adhered to mps to form a bubble mps aggregate that floated out of the water 3 6 application of mps flotation we used fe3 to activate the collection of mps and performed flotation removal on natural water samples from the xiangjiang river flotation removal could reduce the turbidity of water to some extent however the comparison of microscope images suggested the presence of plastic fiber in untreated and treated water fig 10 a and b ldir was used to analyze the polymer content in water samples fig 10c shows that silicon resin accounted for the greatest proportion 59 0 of mps in the xiangjiang river followed by pu 34 1 silicon resin could originate from the coating of vessels because the xiangjiang river is an important waterway lagerström et al 2022 after flotation scarce plastic particles were observed in the water samples fig 10d flotation significantly reduced the numbers of silicon resin and pu and those of other mps fluctuated slightly the flotation removal of mps statistically reached 52 1 which is lower than that in the simulated removal experiments the collector can be adsorbed and consumed by suspended particles and we need to find a balance between collector dosage and pollution control besides the collision probability played a vital role in flotation removal and tiny mps might require smaller denser air bubbles to improve the collision probability therefore surfactant selectivity and nano bubble production may promote mps removal even so flotation removal has the potential to treat localized mps pollution such as the effluent of wastewater treatment plants the development of mps flotation would benefit from the technology of micro and nanobubbles 4 conclusion in this work we thoroughly investigated the application of flotation for mps removal and found that the hydrophilization of mps in the natural environment might obstruct flotation after naturally incubating mps in aquatic environments for six months the removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 0 the hydrophilization order of mps is as follows pvc ps pet pp several characterizations were employed to investigate the hydrophilization mechanism of mps in aquatic environments which were induced by a rise in oxygen containing groups and clay mineral adhesion a collection process before flotation was necessary to enhance the hydrophobicity of mps we innovatively utilized cationic and anionic collectors namely naol and dtac for the flotation removal of mps the effects of ph reagent concentration time and ionic strength were thoroughly investigated the adsorption isotherm suggested that heterogeneous adsorption of naol and dtac on mps occurred considering the pollution and the applied range we preferred to use naol based on the dft analysis it could be concluded that the hydrocarbon chains of collectors tend to laminate and wrap on mps surface and endow a hydrophobic surface for naturally incubated mps furthermore the activation of metal ions was used to improve the flotation process and the optimal conditions were 0 10 mg l fe3 and 2 50 mg l naol the significant reduction in natural mps confirmed the utility of froth flotation these findings provide valuable insights into the hydrophilization process of mps in the aquatic environment and the interaction mechanism of collectors

15004,co pollution of soil with pesticide residues and antibiotic resistance genes args is increasing due to the substantial usage of pesticides and organic fertilizers in greenhouse based agricultural production non antibiotic stresses including those from agricultural fungicides are potential co selectors for the horizontal transfer of args but the underlying mechanism remains unclear intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer systems of the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 were established to examine conjugative transfer frequency under stress from four widely used fungicides triadimefon chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim the mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry rt qpcr and rna seq techniques the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between escherichia coli strains increased with the rising exposure concentrations of chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim but was suppressed between e coli and pseudomonas putida by a high fungicide concentration 10 µg ml triadimefon did not significantly affect conjugative transfer frequency exploration of the underlying mechanisms revealed that i chlorothalonil exposure mainly promoted generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azoxystrobin and carbendazim primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on the plasmid these findings reveal the fungicide triggered mechanisms associated with plasmid conjugation and highlight the potential role of non bactericidal pesticides on the dissemination of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungicide antibiotic resistance gene conjugation conjugative plasmid rna seq data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is gradually becoming a global public health problem the estimated death toll attributable to antibiotic resistance will reach 10 million people by 2050 if no immediate action is taken o neill 2014 indeed antibiotic resistance has gone far beyond the clinical context and was ranked as number one of six emerging issues of environmental concern in frontiers 2017 by unep 2017 due to the discharge of municipal sewage and livestock manure antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args are rapidly transferred into aquatic and soil environments elder et al 2021 ondon et al 2021 these environments carrying args may also be contaminated by other organic and inorganic pollutants posing a more serious risk to the ecological environment and human health zhang et al 2022 zhou and hu 2017 zhou et al 2022 various studies have shown that horizontal gene transfer hgt is the main driver of the rapid spread of args in the environment larsson and flach 2022 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 args often relate to mobile genetic elements e g plasmids transposons integrative and conjugative elements and bacteriophages that can be shared between species via hgt partridge et al 2018 among the three horizontal transfer processes i e conjugation transformation and transduction plasmid mediated conjugation is considered to be the most efficient method for arg dissemination due to their prevalence in environment dang et al 2017 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 hgt of args is affected by several factors including temperature ph nutrients and external stresses qiu et al 2012 antibiotic stress is regarded as an important driving force for horizontal transfer of args larsson and flach 2022 conjugation of plasmid mediated args was enhanced by exposure to sublethal doses of some antibiotics e g levofloxacin cephalexin tetracycline and kanamycin wu et al 2020 fang et al 2015 reported that the abundance of args was related to the levels of residual antibiotics in agricultural soils moreover heavy metal stress can provide a co selective pressure for horizontal transfer of args in the environment beltrán de heredia et al 2023 zhou et al 2020 recent studies have characterized a variety of exogenous substances that enhance conjugation of plasmid borne args including disinfectants pharmaceuticals organic pollutants and microplastics ding et al 2022 lu et al 2020 2018 xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 these reports indicate that non antibiotic stress plays a crucial role in horizontal transmission of args pesticides are an important group of non antibiotic selectors for the environmental dissemination of args guo et al 2022 liao et al 2021 fungicides are pesticides that prevent fungal infestations of crops and most of which will eventually enter the environment zubrod et al 2019 triadimefon tdf chlorothalonil ctl azoxystrobin azo and carbendazim cbd are triazole chloronitrile strobilurin and benzimidazole fungicides respectively and dominate the fungicide market the environmental residual concentrations of these fungicides ranged from μg kg to mg kg tao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 which not only affected the population size community structure and enzyme activities of soil microorganisms but also shifted the pollution induced resistance to antibiotics in the microbial community for example the resistance of the soil bacterial community to chlortetracycline increased by 2 63 fold in the cbd treatment than that in the control fang et al 2016 furthermore exposure to these four fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils by about twice which was related to hgt mediated by mobile genetic elements e g conjugative plasmid r485 zhang et al 2020 in addition oxidative stress accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros is a common mechanism behind the toxicological effects of many pollutants including fungicides sharma et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 an increasing number of studies have shown that oxidative stress was crucial to the conjugation of plasmids between bacteria and accelerated the dissemination of args under non antibiotic stress ding et al 2022 liao et al 2021 wang et al 2019a it is therefore reasonable to speculate that these four fungicides may promote the spread of args through plasmid mediated conjugation however the underlying molecular mechanism involved in fungicide triggered hgt of plasmid mediated args remains unclear in this study intragenus from escherichia coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 and intergenus from e coli mg1655 to pseudomonas putida kt2440 conjugative transfer systems were established with the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 to examine conjugative transfer frequency under fungicide stress the underlying mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr and genome wide rna sequencing rna seq we hypothesize that i fungicides promote the transfer frequency of args via plasmid mediated conjugation as increases in args in fungicide polluted soil are closely related to mobile genetic elements and ii this effect on conjugative transfer frequency is related to the specific fungicide as different chemical structures will determine distinct mechanisms these findings will provide evidence for the involvement of fungicides in the spread of args in the agricultural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and culture media fungicide standards including tdf purity 98 5 ctl purity 99 0 azo purity 99 9 and cbd purity 99 0 were

as described above thiourea 100 μm was added before exposure to 1 0 µg ml fungicides to determine the capacity of the ros scavenger to prevent the excess accumulation of intracellular ros in addition

p 0 05 bar graphs volcano plots venn diagrams generatio plots and heatmaps were created using the ggplot2 and pheatmap packages all statistical analyses were performed in the r 3 6 0 environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 fungicides enhanced conjugative transfer frequency as expected mics and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that plasmid rp4 was successfully transferred into the recipients table s4 and figs s2 s5 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 from e coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 1 93 10 5 to 1 20 10 4 were significantly higher than from e coli mg1655 to p putida kt2440 1 27 10 6 to 3 21 10 5 p 0 01 anova table s10 this was highly consistent with previous studies reporting the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 within or across genera lu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in the intragenus system transfer frequencies under 10 µg ml ctl azo and cbd stress significantly increased to 2 62 2 38 and 3 03 fold respectively compared with the control fig 1 in the intergenus system the highest transfer frequencies were in the presence of 1 0 µg ml ctl azo and cbd with frequencies being 3 52 4 40 and 2 77 fold higher respectively table s11 by contrast no significant change in intragenus or intergenus conjugative transfer frequency was observed at any of the five tdf concentrations 0 001 to 10 µg ml these results support the hypothesis that fungicides are capable of increasing the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids they can also be viewd as molecular based evidence for our previous finding that exposure to fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils via hgt zhang et al 2020 moreover this enhancement of conjugative transfer frequency depended on the particular fungicide involved we initially hypothesized that the distinct enhancing effects of a fungicide can be attributed to its chemical structure fig s1 this is in agreement with a recent study that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 varied between non antibiotic pharmaceuticals including propranolol ibuprofen naproxen gemfibrozil and iopromide wang et al 2021 thus fungicides can increase the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids and exert selective pressure for the dissemination of plasmid borne args via conjugation 3 2 fungicides stimulated ros generation and sos response oxidative stress plays a role in promoting conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2021 in the presence of the four fungicides intracellular ros production in the donor e coli mg1655 and recipient e coli hb101 increased by 1 24 to 1 39 fold and by 1 06 to 1 25 fold respectively fig 2 a intracellular ros production in the recipient p putida kt2440 gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased except for tdf with the highest increase 2 33 fold being observed when the bacteria were exposed to 10 µg ml ctl similarly lu et al 2018 reported that triclosan triggered ros generation was involved in the increased conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 with and without an ros scavenger were also compared fig 2b as expected thiourea treatment significantly decreased both intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 indicating that ros production induced by fungicides is an important factor affecting conjugation lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a oxidative stress can induce two regulatory defense systems in most gram negative bacteria 1 the oxyr soxr and soxs systems and 2 the rpos related system we quantified the expression of the ros regulatory genes soxs soxr oxyr and rpos under fungicide stress figs s6 s9 the expression of these genes differing significantly between the intragenus and intergenus systems this may be related to the distinctly regulation of superoxide stress observed in p putida kt2440 and e coli park et al 2006 expression of soxs soxr oxyr and rpos was most strongly enhanced by the ctl and cbd treatments followed by azo while tdf treatment had no significant effect strong positive correlations were observed between gene expression levels and conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under fungicide stress fig 2c for example expression of soxs oxyr and rpos was significantly correlated with intragenus conjugative transfer frequency under cbd stress suggesting that cbd can promote conjugation transfer via up regulation of these genes xie et al 2019 rna seq results showed that a variety of ros related genes ahpc hmp and sodb in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka and soda in p putida kt2440 were up regulated after exposure to fungicides fig 2d it has also been reported that exposure to carbamazepine triclosan and copper silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of ahpc ahpf and sodb in bacteria lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a the sos response can be induced by various environmental factors and can increase conjugative transfer frequency beaber et al 2004 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in brief the enhancement by fungicides of lexa and umud gene expression was dependent on the conjugative transfer system the specific fungicide and fungicide concentration figs s10 s11 for example expression of lexa was significantly increased 1 35 to 3 55 fold in the presence of 0 01 µg ml ctl in the intragenus system but this effect was not statistically significant in the intergenus system similarly previous studies have indicated that exposure to fine particulate matter such as petrol and diesel exhaust particles stimulate expression of lexa and umud genes and accelerate horizontal transfer of plasmid mediated args xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the transcriptional expression of sos response related genes cho recx rpna rpnb rpnc yafn yafo and yebg in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka soda and ruva in p putida kt2440 increased following treatment with the four fungicides fig 2d this is consistent with a previous study showing that exposure to both silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of rexx and yebg genes in donor bacteria and promoted conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 overall the greatest increase in expression of genes related to ros and sos responses was observed when samples were treated with ctl suggesting that these responses are crucial for an increase in conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under ctl stress 3 3 fungicides increased cell membrane permeability increased production of intracellular ros during fungicide exposure can damage the bacterial cell membrane and increase its permeability jaime et al 2012 which could promote horizontal transfer of plasmids between bacteria wang et al 2021 bacterial cell membrane permeability varied depending on strain and fungicide treatment fig 3 a the cell membrane permeability of p putida kt2440 was more susceptible to fungicide treatment than e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 presumably due to differences between the two genera similarly lu et al 2020 reported that changes in cell membrane permeability were greater in p putida kt2440 than e coli le392 when treated with silver ions and nanoparticles furthermore the cell membrane boundary was clearly visible and the cytoplasm appeared compact in the control bacteria whereas some cell membranes were irregular and the boundary was incomplete in the treated samples indicating that the cell membrane was damaged by fungicide exposure figs 3b and s12 the most serious cell membrane damage was observed with 1 µg ml ctl treatment previous studies have reported increased cell membrane damage in donor and recipient bacteria following copper and aluminum nanoparticle treatments qiu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 although no significant change was observed in the number of bacteria exhibiting cell membrane damage in the intragenus systems with tdf and ctl damage i increased significantly with azo and cbd treatments it is concluded that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids between e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 is accelerated by exposure to high concentrations of azo and cbd lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the outer cell membrane is a formidable barrier that regulates the penetration of specific substrates delcour 2009 thus we quantified in two conjugative transfer systems exposed to fungicides the expression of three genes ompa ompc and ompf that encode the representative outer membrane porin proteins achouak et al 2001 choi and lee 2019 only a few significant changes in gene expression were detected in tdf treatment figs s13 s15 however when in the intragenus system was exposed to ctl azo or cbd the expression levels of the genes were increased with higher fungicide concentrations indicating concentration dependent expression of the outer membrane protein encoding genes within the same genus wang et al 2015 as shown in figs s14 s15 high concentrationof ctl and cbd 10 µg ml reduced the expression of ompc and ompf in the intergenus system which is consistent with a previous study showing ompf gene expression was suppressed by dimethyl phthalate 40 and 80 µg ml wang et al 2019b this may lead to the reduction of intergenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 when exposed to high concentrations of ctl and cbd moreover pearson correlation analysis showed that the intragenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 was positively related to the expression of ompa ompc and ompf after fungicide exposure fig 3c which was consistent with previous studies involving glyphosate microcystin and urban fine particulate matter stresses xie et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 additionally rna seq analysis showed that 12 and 19 genes relevant to the outer membrane were up regulated in e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 respectively after fungicide exposure fig 3d this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the expression of ompw ompt ompf yejo ompq pp 2069 and pp 2669 increased after exposure to copper nanoparticles carbamazepine silver ions and silver nanoparticles lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 under ctl treatment the expression of bhsa oprn yiad pagl i and tolb was even up to 309 73 times higher than the control which might be related to the effects on transport function observed under cbd stress fernandez et al 2009 machas et al 2021 roca et al 2008 it can be concluded that the fungicide induced up regulation of these outer membrane related genes increased cell membrane permeability and accelerated the conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a 2021 3 4 fungicides enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on plasmid rp4 the conjugative transfer of plasmids is regulated by the mating pair formation system dna transfer replication system and other regulators lessl et al 1993 expression of these genes in the intragenus system was higher than in the intergenus system which may explain the high frequency of conjugation within the same genus wang et al 2015 the expression of trbbp traf trfap traj and kila gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased fig 4 a this is consistent with a recent study showing that the expression of trbbp traf trfap and traj in e coli was enhanced by glyphosate in a concentration dependent manner zhang et al 2021 meanwhile expression of kora korb and kila in the presence of fungicides decreased in the intragenus system figs s16 s18 which may also enhance the conjugative transfer of plasmids thomson et al 1993 in the intergenus system exposure to ctl and azo had significant effects on expression of conjugation related genes but only a few significant changes were observed under tdf and cbd treatments furthermore some positive correlations were found between conjugative transfer frequency and the expression levels of the aforementioned genes fig 4b indicating that fungicide induced regulation of conjugative transfer related genes may have been involved in plasmid rp4 contains a variety of genes involved in the conjugation process miyakoshi et al 2020 wang et al 2019a compared with the control the four fungicide treatments 1 µg ml increased expression of the conjugation transfer regulatory factor genes trai tram and traj conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbh trbm and trbo conjugative transfer initiator gene trfa and conjugative transfer secretion protein related gene trak fig 4c similarly wang et al wang et al 2019a reported that carbamazepine treatment increased expression of trai tram and traj on plasmid rp4 and thus enhanced its conjugation transfer azo and cbd had a significant positive effect on expression of genes involved in plasmid conjugation transfer especially the conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbe trbf trbg trbi trbj trbl and trbn miyakoshi et al 2020 increased expression of these genes following azo and cbd exposure could result in the acceleration of plasmid conjugative transfer in addition the tdf and ctl treatments reduced the expression of the entry rejection protein encoding gene trbk which may facilitate higher frequency entry of the plasmid rp4 into recipient bacteria miyakoshi et al 2020 3 5 other factors contributing to conjugative transfer pilin increases bacteria mobility and contact between individual cells thus promoting plasmid conjugation transfer guglielmini et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the expression of ppdd in e coli mg1655 was 3 52 4 59 and 3 61 times higher when exposed to tdf ctl and azo respectively fig 5 a the ppdd gene encodes a precursor protein in the pili which are heavily involved in the type iv secretion system and play a role in cell adhesion and motility sauvonnet et al 2000 the expression of the pilin encoding sfma gene in the ctl and cbd treated donors was 2 27 and 1 47 times higher than that the control overexpression of this gene improves the adsorption capacity of the bacterial surface korea et al 2010 similarly expression of fimd pile pilf and piln in the recipient was up regulated by exposure to the four fungicides overexpression of these genes triggered by fungicides may have contributed to enhancement of plasmid conjugative transfer through the promotion of the assembly of bacterial pore proteins and type iv pilin biosynthesis proteins jain et al 2011 watson et al 1994 these results indicate that the increased expression of pilin encoding genes may be involved in the conjugative transfer of plasmids under fungicide stress wang et al 2015 differentially expressed genes were identified in the donor and recipient bacteria and used for kegg pathway enrichment analysis figs 5b and s19 s20 ctl azo and cbd treatments induced up regulation of the flagella assembly function in the recipient p putida kt2440 which could contribute to bacterial motility and increased contact and attachment of bacteria robertson et al 2019 thomson and pallen 2020 overall up regulation of flagellin gene expression under fungicide stress may also promote the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 but further study is required to verify this pathway 4 conclusions this study shows that fungicides are potential selectors for the dissemination of args via plasmid mediated conjugation the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid borne args was related to the type of fungicides the exposure concentration and the species of donor and recipient bacteria the underlying fungicide specific mechanisms were i ctl exposure mainly enhanced generation of intracellular ros stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azo and cbd primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on

15004,co pollution of soil with pesticide residues and antibiotic resistance genes args is increasing due to the substantial usage of pesticides and organic fertilizers in greenhouse based agricultural production non antibiotic stresses including those from agricultural fungicides are potential co selectors for the horizontal transfer of args but the underlying mechanism remains unclear intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer systems of the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 were established to examine conjugative transfer frequency under stress from four widely used fungicides triadimefon chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim the mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry rt qpcr and rna seq techniques the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between escherichia coli strains increased with the rising exposure concentrations of chlorothalonil azoxystrobin and carbendazim but was suppressed between e coli and pseudomonas putida by a high fungicide concentration 10 µg ml triadimefon did not significantly affect conjugative transfer frequency exploration of the underlying mechanisms revealed that i chlorothalonil exposure mainly promoted generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azoxystrobin and carbendazim primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on the plasmid these findings reveal the fungicide triggered mechanisms associated with plasmid conjugation and highlight the potential role of non bactericidal pesticides on the dissemination of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungicide antibiotic resistance gene conjugation conjugative plasmid rna seq data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is gradually becoming a global public health problem the estimated death toll attributable to antibiotic resistance will reach 10 million people by 2050 if no immediate action is taken o neill 2014 indeed antibiotic resistance has gone far beyond the clinical context and was ranked as number one of six emerging issues of environmental concern in frontiers 2017 by unep 2017 due to the discharge of municipal sewage and livestock manure antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args are rapidly transferred into aquatic and soil environments elder et al 2021 ondon et al 2021 these environments carrying args may also be contaminated by other organic and inorganic pollutants posing a more serious risk to the ecological environment and human health zhang et al 2022 zhou and hu 2017 zhou et al 2022 various studies have shown that horizontal gene transfer hgt is the main driver of the rapid spread of args in the environment larsson and flach 2022 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 args often relate to mobile genetic elements e g plasmids transposons integrative and conjugative elements and bacteriophages that can be shared between species via hgt partridge et al 2018 among the three horizontal transfer processes i e conjugation transformation and transduction plasmid mediated conjugation is considered to be the most efficient method for arg dissemination due to their prevalence in environment dang et al 2017 von wintersdorff et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 hgt of args is affected by several factors including temperature ph nutrients and external stresses qiu et al 2012 antibiotic stress is regarded as an important driving force for horizontal transfer of args larsson and flach 2022 conjugation of plasmid mediated args was enhanced by exposure to sublethal doses of some antibiotics e g levofloxacin cephalexin tetracycline and kanamycin wu et al 2020 fang et al 2015 reported that the abundance of args was related to the levels of residual antibiotics in agricultural soils moreover heavy metal stress can provide a co selective pressure for horizontal transfer of args in the environment beltrán de heredia et al 2023 zhou et al 2020 recent studies have characterized a variety of exogenous substances that enhance conjugation of plasmid borne args including disinfectants pharmaceuticals organic pollutants and microplastics ding et al 2022 lu et al 2020 2018 xia et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 these reports indicate that non antibiotic stress plays a crucial role in horizontal transmission of args pesticides are an important group of non antibiotic selectors for the environmental dissemination of args guo et al 2022 liao et al 2021 fungicides are pesticides that prevent fungal infestations of crops and most of which will eventually enter the environment zubrod et al 2019 triadimefon tdf chlorothalonil ctl azoxystrobin azo and carbendazim cbd are triazole chloronitrile strobilurin and benzimidazole fungicides respectively and dominate the fungicide market the environmental residual concentrations of these fungicides ranged from μg kg to mg kg tao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 which not only affected the population size community structure and enzyme activities of soil microorganisms but also shifted the pollution induced resistance to antibiotics in the microbial community for example the resistance of the soil bacterial community to chlortetracycline increased by 2 63 fold in the cbd treatment than that in the control fang et al 2016 furthermore exposure to these four fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils by about twice which was related to hgt mediated by mobile genetic elements e g conjugative plasmid r485 zhang et al 2020 in addition oxidative stress accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros is a common mechanism behind the toxicological effects of many pollutants including fungicides sharma et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 an increasing number of studies have shown that oxidative stress was crucial to the conjugation of plasmids between bacteria and accelerated the dissemination of args under non antibiotic stress ding et al 2022 liao et al 2021 wang et al 2019a it is therefore reasonable to speculate that these four fungicides may promote the spread of args through plasmid mediated conjugation however the underlying molecular mechanism involved in fungicide triggered hgt of plasmid mediated args remains unclear in this study intragenus from escherichia coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 and intergenus from e coli mg1655 to pseudomonas putida kt2440 conjugative transfer systems were established with the antibiotic resistant plasmid rp4 to examine conjugative transfer frequency under fungicide stress the underlying mechanisms were elucidated at the cellular and molecular levels using transmission electron microscopy flow cytometry real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr and genome wide rna sequencing rna seq we hypothesize that i fungicides promote the transfer frequency of args via plasmid mediated conjugation as increases in args in fungicide polluted soil are closely related to mobile genetic elements and ii this effect on conjugative transfer frequency is related to the specific fungicide as different chemical structures will determine distinct mechanisms these findings will provide evidence for the involvement of fungicides in the spread of args in the agricultural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and culture media fungicide standards including tdf purity 98 5 ctl purity 99 0 azo purity 99 9 and cbd purity 99 0 were

these were kindly provided by prof jian he from nanjing agricultural university china the plasmid carrying donor strain e coli mg1655 rp4 was constructed by transforming rp4 plasmid into e coli mg1655 using the heat shock method froger and hall 2007 2 3 antibiotic and fungicide susceptibility testing the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of antibiotics and fungicides for the donor and recipient strains were determined by the broth microdilution procedure using 96 well microtiter plates eucast 2003 briefly an overnight culture of each strain was diluted to approximately 106 cfu ml and exposed to antibiotics at 1 1024 µg ml using two fold serial dilution treatments excluding antibiotic or fungicide were used as controls the mic was defined as the minimum concentration of antibiotic or fungicide at which no growth of the indicator strain was observed after 24 h incubation tables s2 s3 2 4 conjugative experiments donor and recipient bacteria were grown overnight in lb

concentration of transconjugants cfu ml and n s is the concentration of recipients cfu ml 2 5 validation of plasmid conjugation to confirm successful conjugation of the plasmid rp4 mics of randomly selected transconjugants to antibiotics were measured using antibiotic susceptibility testing plasmids of transconjugants were extracted using a hipure bac dna mini kit magen biotech china the marker gene trag and antibiotic resistance genes teta and apha in the transconjugants were amplified by pcr both plasmid and amplicons were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis pcr primers are listed in table s5 2 6 determination of reactive oxygen species and cell membrane permeability the intracellular ros production of donor and recipients was measured using 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da briefly bacterial suspensions approximately 106 cfus ml were stained with dcfh da 10 μm for 30 min in the dark the cells were washed three times with pbs and exposed to the fungicides for 2 h as described above thiourea 100 μm was added before exposure to 1 0 µg ml fungicides to determine the capacity of the ros scavenger to prevent the excess accumulation of intracellular ros in addition the bacterial suspensions approximately 106 cfus ml were also treated with propidium iodide pi 10 μg ml to determine bacterial cell membrane permeability the fluorescence intensities of dcfh da and pi were measured using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman coulter usa all tests were performed in triplicate 2 7 transmission electron microscopy tem to characterize the cell and membrane morphologies of donor and recipient bacteria exposed to the fungicides the conjugation system was established as described above using 1 0 µg ml fungicides treatment excluding the fungicides was used as a negative control after 2 h incubation the samples were processed as follows collection double fixation dehydration infiltration embedding ultrathin sectioning and staining detailed protocols are described in

kila and potential functional genes ros related genes rpos soxs soxr oxyr sos related genes lexa umud and outer membrane protein genes ompa ompc ompf were quantified using rt qpcr samuels et al 2000 thomson et al 1993 zatyka et al 1997 total rna was extracted from bacteria in the conjugation systems using a transzol up plus rna kit transgen biotech china the rna samples were reverse transcribed

qpcr primers and results of the standard curve assay are summarized in tables s6 s7 2 9 transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis rna seq was performed to characterize the transcription expression levels in the donor recipient and plasmid rp4 in the intergenus conjugation systems with fungicide concentrations of 0 and 1 μg ml rna isolation rrna removal strand specific cdna library construction and sequencing were conducted by novogene co ltd beijing china the raw data were filtered to discard low quality reads using the ngs qc toolkit patel and jain 2012 the clean data were mapped to the reference genomes of e coli k12 nc 000913 1 and p putida kt2440 nc 002947 4 and the rp4 plasmid nc 001621 1 retrieved from national center for biotechnology information ncbi htseq software anders et al 2015 was used to calculate gene expression levels using the unit fpkm fragments per kilobase of a gene per million mapped reads tables s8 s9 changes between treatments were calculated using log2 fold change values with a false positive correction test 2 10 statistical analysis statistical differences in the conjugative transfer frequency and gene expression levels between treatments were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd significant differences between treatments are indicated by lowercase letters p 0 05 bar graphs volcano plots venn diagrams generatio plots and heatmaps were created using the ggplot2 and pheatmap packages all statistical analyses were performed in the r 3 6 0 environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 fungicides enhanced conjugative transfer frequency as expected mics and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that plasmid rp4 was successfully transferred into the recipients table s4 and figs s2 s5 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 from e coli mg1655 to e coli hb101 1 93 10 5 to 1 20 10 4 were significantly higher than from e coli mg1655 to p putida kt2440 1 27 10 6 to 3 21 10 5 p 0 01 anova table s10 this was highly consistent with previous studies reporting the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 within or across genera lu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in the intragenus system transfer frequencies under 10 µg ml ctl azo and cbd stress significantly increased to 2 62 2 38 and 3 03 fold respectively compared with the control fig 1 in the intergenus system the highest transfer frequencies were in the presence of 1 0 µg ml ctl azo and cbd with frequencies being 3 52 4 40 and 2 77 fold higher respectively table s11 by contrast no significant change in intragenus or intergenus conjugative transfer frequency was observed at any of the five tdf concentrations 0 001 to 10 µg ml these results support the hypothesis that fungicides are capable of increasing the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids they can also be viewd as molecular based evidence for our previous finding that exposure to fungicides increased the abundance of args in agricultural soils via hgt zhang et al 2020 moreover this enhancement of conjugative transfer frequency depended on the particular fungicide involved we initially hypothesized that the distinct enhancing effects of a fungicide can be attributed to its chemical structure fig s1 this is in agreement with a recent study that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 varied between non antibiotic pharmaceuticals including propranolol ibuprofen naproxen gemfibrozil and iopromide wang et al 2021 thus fungicides can increase the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids and exert selective pressure for the dissemination of plasmid borne args via conjugation 3 2 fungicides stimulated ros generation and sos response oxidative stress plays a role in promoting conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2021 in the presence of the four fungicides intracellular ros production in the donor e coli mg1655 and recipient e coli hb101 increased by 1 24 to 1 39 fold and by 1 06 to 1 25 fold respectively fig 2 a intracellular ros production in the recipient p putida kt2440 gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased except for tdf with the highest increase 2 33 fold being observed when the bacteria were exposed to 10 µg ml ctl similarly lu et al 2018 reported that triclosan triggered ros generation was involved in the increased conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 between e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 the conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 with and without an ros scavenger were also compared fig 2b as expected thiourea treatment significantly decreased both intragenus and intergenus conjugative transfer frequencies of plasmid rp4 indicating that ros production induced by fungicides is an important factor affecting conjugation lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a oxidative stress can induce two regulatory defense systems in most gram negative bacteria 1 the oxyr soxr and soxs systems and 2 the rpos related system we quantified the expression of the ros regulatory genes soxs soxr oxyr and rpos under fungicide stress figs s6 s9 the expression of these genes differing significantly between the intragenus and intergenus systems this may be related to the distinctly regulation of superoxide stress observed in p putida kt2440 and e coli park et al 2006 expression of soxs soxr oxyr and rpos was most strongly enhanced by the ctl and cbd treatments followed by azo while tdf treatment had no significant effect strong positive correlations were observed between gene expression levels and conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under fungicide stress fig 2c for example expression of soxs oxyr and rpos was significantly correlated with intragenus conjugative transfer frequency under cbd stress suggesting that cbd can promote conjugation transfer via up regulation of these genes xie et al 2019 rna seq results showed that a variety of ros related genes ahpc hmp and sodb in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka and soda in p putida kt2440 were up regulated after exposure to fungicides fig 2d it has also been reported that exposure to carbamazepine triclosan and copper silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of ahpc ahpf and sodb in bacteria lu et al 2020 2018 wang et al 2019a the sos response can be induced by various environmental factors and can increase conjugative transfer frequency beaber et al 2004 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019a in brief the enhancement by fungicides of lexa and umud gene expression was dependent on the conjugative transfer system the specific fungicide and fungicide concentration figs s10 s11 for example expression of lexa was significantly increased 1 35 to 3 55 fold in the presence of 0 01 µg ml ctl in the intragenus system but this effect was not statistically significant in the intergenus system similarly previous studies have indicated that exposure to fine particulate matter such as petrol and diesel exhaust particles stimulate expression of lexa and umud genes and accelerate horizontal transfer of plasmid mediated args xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the transcriptional expression of sos response related genes cho recx rpna rpnb rpnc yafn yafo and yebg in e coli mg1655 and tpx srka soda and ruva in p putida kt2440 increased following treatment with the four fungicides fig 2d this is consistent with a previous study showing that exposure to both silver ions and nanoparticles increased the expression of rexx and yebg genes in donor bacteria and promoted conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 overall the greatest increase in expression of genes related to ros and sos responses was observed when samples were treated with ctl suggesting that these responses are crucial for an increase in conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 under ctl stress 3 3 fungicides increased cell membrane permeability increased production of intracellular ros during fungicide exposure can damage the bacterial cell membrane and increase its permeability jaime et al 2012 which could promote horizontal transfer of plasmids between bacteria wang et al 2021 bacterial cell membrane permeability varied depending on strain and fungicide treatment fig 3 a the cell membrane permeability of p putida kt2440 was more susceptible to fungicide treatment than e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 presumably due to differences between the two genera similarly lu et al 2020 reported that changes in cell membrane permeability were greater in p putida kt2440 than e coli le392 when treated with silver ions and nanoparticles furthermore the cell membrane boundary was clearly visible and the cytoplasm appeared compact in the control bacteria whereas some cell membranes were irregular and the boundary was incomplete in the treated samples indicating that the cell membrane was damaged by fungicide exposure figs 3b and s12 the most serious cell membrane damage was observed with 1 µg ml ctl treatment previous studies have reported increased cell membrane damage in donor and recipient bacteria following copper and aluminum nanoparticle treatments qiu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 although no significant change was observed in the number of bacteria exhibiting cell membrane damage in the intragenus systems with tdf and ctl damage i increased significantly with azo and cbd treatments it is concluded that the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmids between e coli mg1655 and e coli hb101 is accelerated by exposure to high concentrations of azo and cbd lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the outer cell membrane is a formidable barrier that regulates the penetration of specific substrates delcour 2009 thus we quantified in two conjugative transfer systems exposed to fungicides the expression of three genes ompa ompc and ompf that encode the representative outer membrane porin proteins achouak et al 2001 choi and lee 2019 only a few significant changes in gene expression were detected in tdf treatment figs s13 s15 however when in the intragenus system was exposed to ctl azo or cbd the expression levels of the genes were increased with higher fungicide concentrations indicating concentration dependent expression of the outer membrane protein encoding genes within the same genus wang et al 2015 as shown in figs s14 s15 high concentrationof ctl and cbd 10 µg ml reduced the expression of ompc and ompf in the intergenus system which is consistent with a previous study showing ompf gene expression was suppressed by dimethyl phthalate 40 and 80 µg ml wang et al 2019b this may lead to the reduction of intergenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 when exposed to high concentrations of ctl and cbd moreover pearson correlation analysis showed that the intragenus conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 was positively related to the expression of ompa ompc and ompf after fungicide exposure fig 3c which was consistent with previous studies involving glyphosate microcystin and urban fine particulate matter stresses xie et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 additionally rna seq analysis showed that 12 and 19 genes relevant to the outer membrane were up regulated in e coli mg1655 and p putida kt2440 respectively after fungicide exposure fig 3d this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the expression of ompw ompt ompf yejo ompq pp 2069 and pp 2669 increased after exposure to copper nanoparticles carbamazepine silver ions and silver nanoparticles lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 under ctl treatment the expression of bhsa oprn yiad pagl i and tolb was even up to 309 73 times higher than the control which might be related to the effects on transport function observed under cbd stress fernandez et al 2009 machas et al 2021 roca et al 2008 it can be concluded that the fungicide induced up regulation of these outer membrane related genes increased cell membrane permeability and accelerated the conjugative transfer of plasmids lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a 2021 3 4 fungicides enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on plasmid rp4 the conjugative transfer of plasmids is regulated by the mating pair formation system dna transfer replication system and other regulators lessl et al 1993 expression of these genes in the intragenus system was higher than in the intergenus system which may explain the high frequency of conjugation within the same genus wang et al 2015 the expression of trbbp traf trfap traj and kila gradually increased as fungicide concentrations increased fig 4 a this is consistent with a recent study showing that the expression of trbbp traf trfap and traj in e coli was enhanced by glyphosate in a concentration dependent manner zhang et al 2021 meanwhile expression of kora korb and kila in the presence of fungicides decreased in the intragenus system figs s16 s18 which may also enhance the conjugative transfer of plasmids thomson et al 1993 in the intergenus system exposure to ctl and azo had significant effects on expression of conjugation related genes but only a few significant changes were observed under tdf and cbd treatments furthermore some positive correlations were found between conjugative transfer frequency and the expression levels of the aforementioned genes fig 4b indicating that fungicide induced regulation of conjugative transfer related genes may have been involved in plasmid rp4 contains a variety of genes involved in the conjugation process miyakoshi et al 2020 wang et al 2019a compared with the control the four fungicide treatments 1 µg ml increased expression of the conjugation transfer regulatory factor genes trai tram and traj conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbh trbm and trbo conjugative transfer initiator gene trfa and conjugative transfer secretion protein related gene trak fig 4c similarly wang et al wang et al 2019a reported that carbamazepine treatment increased expression of trai tram and traj on plasmid rp4 and thus enhanced its conjugation transfer azo and cbd had a significant positive effect on expression of genes involved in plasmid conjugation transfer especially the conjugative transfer protein encoding genes trbe trbf trbg trbi trbj trbl and trbn miyakoshi et al 2020 increased expression of these genes following azo and cbd exposure could result in the acceleration of plasmid conjugative transfer in addition the tdf and ctl treatments reduced the expression of the entry rejection protein encoding gene trbk which may facilitate higher frequency entry of the plasmid rp4 into recipient bacteria miyakoshi et al 2020 3 5 other factors contributing to conjugative transfer pilin increases bacteria mobility and contact between individual cells thus promoting plasmid conjugation transfer guglielmini et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the expression of ppdd in e coli mg1655 was 3 52 4 59 and 3 61 times higher when exposed to tdf ctl and azo respectively fig 5 a the ppdd gene encodes a precursor protein in the pili which are heavily involved in the type iv secretion system and play a role in cell adhesion and motility sauvonnet et al 2000 the expression of the pilin encoding sfma gene in the ctl and cbd treated donors was 2 27 and 1 47 times higher than that the control overexpression of this gene improves the adsorption capacity of the bacterial surface korea et al 2010 similarly expression of fimd pile pilf and piln in the recipient was up regulated by exposure to the four fungicides overexpression of these genes triggered by fungicides may have contributed to enhancement of plasmid conjugative transfer through the promotion of the assembly of bacterial pore proteins and type iv pilin biosynthesis proteins jain et al 2011 watson et al 1994 these results indicate that the increased expression of pilin encoding genes may be involved in the conjugative transfer of plasmids under fungicide stress wang et al 2015 differentially expressed genes were identified in the donor and recipient bacteria and used for kegg pathway enrichment analysis figs 5b and s19 s20 ctl azo and cbd treatments induced up regulation of the flagella assembly function in the recipient p putida kt2440 which could contribute to bacterial motility and increased contact and attachment of bacteria robertson et al 2019 thomson and pallen 2020 overall up regulation of flagellin gene expression under fungicide stress may also promote the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 but further study is required to verify this pathway 4 conclusions this study shows that fungicides are potential selectors for the dissemination of args via plasmid mediated conjugation the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid borne args was related to the type of fungicides the exposure concentration and the species of donor and recipient bacteria the underlying fungicide specific mechanisms were i ctl exposure mainly enhanced generation of intracellular ros stimulated the sos response and increased cell membrane permeability while ii azo and cbd primarily enhanced expression of conjugation related genes on the plasmid these findings provide novel insights into the potential role of agricultural fungicides in the spread of args in the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
