14465,this study was conducted to evaluate the degradation of high concentrations of formaldehyde in the chemical less uvc vuv photo reactor 99 5 degradation and 94 chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde was achieved in the uvc vuv photo reactor at reaction time of 60 min and solution ph of 7 the effect of water anions such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrate chloride sulfate and phosphate was examined on degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde nitrate and carbonate exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on the process besides treatment of formaldehyde contaminated tap water was also investigated and formaldehyde removal was decreased from 99 5 is aqueous solution to 86 2 in tap water the findings of radical scavenging tests revealed that hydroxyl radical was the most predominant oxidizing agent contributed in degradation of formaldehyde it is concluded therefore that the uvc vuv process as a unique chemical less process efficient for advanced degradation of high concentrations of formaldehyde keywords advanced photo oxidation formaldehyde degradation cod removal hydroxyl radical vacuum uv 1 introduction as a human carcinogen formaldehyde is a toxic chemical imposing adverse effects on public health and environment there has been numerous case reports related to formaldehyde induced poisoning and cancer 1 formaldehyde belongs to group i of hazardous substances based on the international agency for research on cancer iarc 2 nevertheless it is still widely used in resin industry preservative production chemical and petrochemical industry disinfection and sterilizing clinical analyzing laboratory textile and wood processing etc 1 3 besides within formaldehyde manufacturing industries a liquid waste containing high concentration of formaldehyde is left behind as a result of either oxidation or dehydrogenation of methyl alcohol 4 subsequently it enters industrial wastewaters thereby enters aquatic environment with varying concentrations based on literatures formaldehyde concentration in effluents may range between 100 10000 mg l crying out for an efficient treatment before discharge into the environment 1 ec50 of formaldehyde for dominant microorganisms in the sewage treatment plants has been reported to be 34 1 mg l 1 5 furthermore safe concentration of formaldehyde for ecosystem is 1 61 mg l 1 there have been reports of successful degradation of formaldehyde in low to moderate concentrations in biological processes for instance jin et al 6 investigated formaldehyde degradation using pseudomonas putida iofa1 and up to 100 mg l formaldehyde was degraded during 40 min 6 however the bioprocesses cannot provide sufficient degradation of formaldehyde in the concentrated effluents 3 this is because of formaldehyde reaction with dna rna and protein leading to death of microorganisms 1 several studies have reported application of the advanced oxidation processes aops which generally involve activation of an oxidant o3 h2o2 s2o8 2 hso5 etc by means of one or combination of activators transition metal catalysts uv ultrasound electrolysis carbon catalysts etc for the generation of radicals with high oxidation potentials typically hydroxyl and sulfate radicals 7 8 moussavi et al 9 conducted a study on degradation of formaldehyde in high concentration 4000 mg l using electro fenton process followed by a biological step as post treatment they concluded that electro fenton process was a highly efficient process for degradation of high concentrations of formaldehyde in a way that its effluent did not inhibited the subsequent biological treatment process for further mineralization 9 advanced photochemical oxidation apo processes are amongst aops including uv h2o2 1 uv persulfate 10 uv o3 11 photo catalysis 12 14 etc which have been applied for the removal of formaldehyde apo processes have attracted much attention due to their versatility and applicability in combination with other processes amongst apo processes vacuum uv vuv one is superior by which significantly high degradation and mineralization efficiencies can be obtained without the necessity of adding any external chemical as oxidant catalyst etc 15 16 in fact emmiting uv in vacuum spectral range 100 200 nm is promising for the purpose of organic pollutants degradation 17 within this spectral region oxygen strongly absorbs the radiation which leads to homolysis of chemical bonds in water and oxygen molecules as shown in eqs 1 and 4 17 based on eq 1 homolysis of water molecule is superior which brings about direct production of hydroxyl radical with high density comparable to other advanced oxidation processes surrounding the organics and oxidising them towards mineralization 15 17 18 in addition hydroxyl radical can be generated through the photo ionization of water as shown in eq 2 electron is also generated as in eqs 2 and 3 which provides advanced reduction of reducable organic and inorganic pollutants 10 19 based on eqs 4 and 5 the photolysis of oxygen results in formation of ozone molecule which can contribute in degradation of organics in low ph levels although its oxidation potential is significantly less than that of hydroxyl radical 11 15 16 1 h 2 o h v λ 185 n m h h o 2 h 2 o h v λ 185 n m h h o e a q 3 h h 2 o h 3 o e a q 4 o 2 h v 185 n m 2 o

process a promising and unique advanced oxidation reduction technique for treatmet of toxic contaminants in this work treatment of high concentrations 200 500 mg l of formaldehyde in aquous solution was investigated using the uvc vuv process the effect of solution ph formaldehyd concentration reaction time and water anions was examined on degradation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal of formaldehyde in the uvc vuv process in addition treatment of formaldehyde contaminated tap water was investigated kinetics of formaldehyde degradation and its cod removal reactions were also evaluated the dominate oxidation specie was determined using the radical scavenging tests significant results were achieved in degradation and chemical oxygen demand removal of formaldehyde 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals used in this study were all of analytical grade and distilled water was used for preparing the solutions paraformaldehyde cas no 30525 89 4 was purchased from merck salicylic acid was provided from sigma aldrich inc sodium salts including na2so4 nano3 na3po4 na2co3 nahco3 and nacl were all purchased from merck formaldehyde stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of paraformaldehyde in 1 l of distilled water the working formaldehyde solutions were prepared by serially dilution of the aliquots of the stock solution for ph adjustment either sodium hydroxide 0 1 n or sulfuric acid 0 1 n was used 2 2 experimental setup and procedure experiments were conducted in a cylindrical pyrex photo reactor 400 mm height and 30 mm i d operated in circular mode 20 a low pressure mercury uv lamp 5 7 w of uvc output heraeus co was vertically placed at the center of the reactor and was encompassed with a quartz sleeve uv lamp emitted uv radiation both at 254 nm uvc and 185 nm vuv 10 the process was operated in semi continuous solution recirculation mode a peristaltic pump heidolph instrument pd 5201 was used to provide the solution recirculation for each test 200 ml of aqueous solution having the desired composition was transferred to the inlet tank the lamp was turned on and the solution was recalculated in the process for the predetermined time the solution was sampled at the desired time intervals and the formaldehyde and cod residual concentrations were measured the effects of ph 4 0 12 initial formaldehyde concentration 200 500 mg l water anions sulfate nitrate chloride carbonate bicarbonate and phosphate and reaction time were evaluated on efficacy of the process a set of experiments were also carried out with formaldehyde spiked tap water having following concentrations of anions cl 58 mg l so4 2 16 mg l no3 11 mg l and alkalinity 68 mg caco3 l scavenging tests using salicylic acid as an strong hydroxyl radical scavenger were conducted to determine the degradation mechanism and identify the dominant radical species all experiments were conducted in lab normal temperature 2 3 analytical methods formaldehyde concentration was spectrophotometrically unico uv vis spectrophotometer measured based on hantzch method at 412 nm 21 the concentration of cod was measured based on the colorimetric procedure using the standard methods 22 the degradation and cod removal efficiencies of formaldehyde were calculated using eq 6 6 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct stand for formaldehyde or cod concentrations before and after the reaction respectively the kinetics of degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde for different initial concentrations were evaluated by fitting the pseudo first order pfo kinetic model eq 7 with the experimental results 7 ln c t c 0 k o b s t where c0 and ct are as above defined kobs is the observed reaction rate constant for either formaldehyde degradation or cod removal the observed removal rates robs of formaldehyde and its cod were calculated from eq 8 9 8 r o b s k o b s c 0 anions concentrations were measured based on the standard methods 22 ph was measured using a jenway 3505 ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial solution ph the effect of solution ph between 4 and 12 was investigated on the performance of the uvc vuv process for degradation and cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde removal as can be seen in fig 1 ph has had no significant effect on formaldehyde degradation while it notably influenced the cod removal ranging from 33 7 to about 82 5 for solution phs from 4 to 12 as a variable ph is considered to influence the process in two ways a ph can determine the domination of reactive oxygen species ross 2 ph influences the speciation or distribution of contaminate regarding its pka it is known that ozone in alkaline condition is decomposed to hydroxyl radical 3 on the other hand considering formaldehyde pka 13 3 at 25 c formaldehyde dissociation was not affected by the studied range of ph 4 0 12 0 therefore although formaldehyde was degraded as a result of hydroxyl radical attack and of direct photolysis the remaining organic contents still exhibited cod the c h bond in formaldehyde is a relatively strong bond that is more difficult to be broken in comparison with the co bond 23 thus lower cod removal efficiency might have been attributed to the remaining of organic content in form of c h 23 as can be seen in fig 1 cod removal increased rapidly from 33 7 to 77 by increasing the solution ph from 4 0 to 7 0 while further increase of ph to 12 caused slightly improvement of cod removal to 82 5 the increase in cod removal as a function of solution ph can be related to the dissociation of ozone generated in the photo reactor eq 5 to hydroxyl radical in higher phs particularly in alkaline condition which has a higher oxidation potential as compared to molecular ozone besides formaldehyde is a saturated compound so that it has a low tendency to react with molecular ozone 3 accordingly alkaline ph was superior for formaldehyde degradation in uvc vuv photo reactor due to domination of hydroxyl radical and dissociation of ozone to hydroxyl radical the change in solution ph during the uvc vuv process was also illustrated in fig 1 it is seen in fig 1 that final ph slightly decreased from its initial level the decrease in solution ph after the uvc vuv process can be related to the generation of protons eqs 2 and 3 and also to the formation of acidic intermediates from formaldehyde degradation 3 2 effect of initial formaldehyde concentration taking the stoichiometric aspect into account for degradation it is of high importance to consider the ratio of oxidizing agent to oxidizable pollutant typically here referred to mainly the hydroxyl radical and formaldehyde respectively to evaluate the effect of initial formaldehyde concentration on its degradation and cod removal efficiencies the concentration of formaldehyde was varied between 200 mg l and 500 mg l and the corresponding results are depicted in figs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 2 increase of formaldehyde concentration led to expectedly decrease of its degradation over 99 of 200 mg l formaldehyde was degraded in the uvc vuv process within 60 min reaction time in comparison the degradation of 300 400 and 500 mg l formaldehyde was 98 7 96 3 and 90 8 respectively under similar experimental conditions fig 3 depicts the cod removal of different formaldehyde concentrations in the uvc vuv process as a function of the reaction time the same trend of formaldehyde degradation fig 2 is observed for cod removal fig 3 the cod removal efficiency in the uvc vuv process at the highest tested reaction time of 60 min was 94 86 3 81 0 and 74 2 for initial formaldehyde concentrations of 200 300 400 and 500 mg l formaldehyde respectively comparing figs 2 and 3 indicates that removal of cod was lower than the degradation of formaldehyde at any specific similar experimental conditions considering the constant amount of uv photons emitted from the lamp the reduction in the degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde with increase in initial formaldehyde concentration at any reaction time can be related to the decrease in amount of photons absorbed per mass unit of formaldehyde as the concentration of formaldehyde was increased 24 furthermore the mass ratio of ross especially the hydroxyl radical to formaldehyde could be decreased as a result of increase of formaldehyde concentration the lower cod removal compared to the formaldehyde degradation can be attributed to formation of degradation organic intermediates containing relatively high strength of c h bonds 23 3 3 kinetics of degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde kinetics of degradation and cod removal of different concentrations of formaldehyde in the uvc vuv process were evaluated under optimum conditions given in figs 2 and 3 both formaldehyde degradation and its cod removal were in good agreement with pseudo first order pfo kinetic model with determination coefficients r2 0 9 the results of kinetics evaluation are summarized in table 1 as mentioned in table 1 increase of formaldehyde concentration from 200 to 500 mg l led to decrease of the rate constants of formaldehyde degradation from 0 092 to 0 048 min 1 and of its cod removal from 0 054 to 0 026 min 1 moussavi et al 3 studied the degradation of formaldehyde using o3 mgo h2o2 process and reported a kobs value of 0 015 min 1 3 in another study conducted for formaldehyde removal 25 the reported rate constants were 0 048 min 1 and 1 017 min 1 using electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes respectively 3 4 effect of water anions the effect of sulfate nitrate carbonate bicarbonate chloride or phosphate anions was evaluated on the performance of uvc vuv process in degradation and cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde these experiments were conducted at optimum solution ph of 7 and the reaction time of 60 min at the presence of 100 mg l each of selected anions as illustrated in fig 4 formaldehyde removal efficiency was not significantly affected in presence of all selected anions except nitrate in case of cod inhibitory effect of anions was noticeable following this order carbonate nitrate bicarbonate phosphate sulfate chloride the formaldehyde removal efficiency considerably decreased from 99 5 in absence to 42 7 in presence of nitrate indeed nitrate is supposed to decrease the efficiency of uv based aops due to its strong uv absorbance as shown in eqs 9 and 10 by absorbing uv radiation nitrate suppresses both direct photolysis of formaldehyde and mainly water homolysis thus hydroxyl radical formation through which the process efficiency decreased the corresponding reactions are as follows 26 9 n o 3 h v n o 2 1 2 o 2 10 n o 2 o 3 n o 3 o 2 the reaction of hydroxyl radical with carbonate and bicarbonate leads to formation of carbonate radical whose oxidation potential 1 63 v is much less than that of hydroxyl radical 27 besides in comparison with bicarbonate carbonate reacts with hydroxyl radical with a higher rate as given in eqs 11 and 12 which is in agreement with the obtained results 26 11 h o h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 12 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 o h k 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 sulfate and chloride exhibited the lowest inhibitory effect on cod removal in presence of sulfate formaldehyde removal was not suppressed probably due to minute formation of sulfate radical as a consequence of sulfate reaction with hydroxyl radical 28 while cod removal considerably decreased from 94 to 48 6 and 46 5 in presence of sulfate and chloride respectively in presence of chloride formaldehyde removal efficiency slightly decreased from 99 5 to 96 5 this can be explained by formation of less reactive oxidants of cl and cloh as compared to the hydroxyl radical as a result of the reaction of chloride with the hydroxyl radical 29 in fact cloh is an unstable intermediate which quickly dissociates back to hydroxyl radical 30 the corresponding reactions are presented in eqs 13 16 besides it has been reported that presence of chloride ion leads to halogenation of organic compounds in water as an electrophilic atom chloride can be added to unsaturated bonds of organic compounds 31 this phenomenon results in higher persistence of the organic compounds and lower cod removal efficiency 28 13 c l h o c l o h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 14 c l o h c l h o k 6 1

tap water containing all of the selected anions was also examined as illustrated in fig 5 formaldehyde and cod removal efficiencies decreased from 99 5 and 94 in aqueous solution distilled water to 86 2 and 82 5 in tap water respectively kinetics of degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde from distilled water and spiked tap water was compared based on the results given in fig 5 kinetic information is presented in table 2 similar to the distilled water formaldehyde and cod removal efficiencies from tap water were also in good agreement r2 0 97 with pfo kinetic model eq 7 as given in table 2 the formaldehyde degradation rate constant decreased from 0 093 min 1 for aqueous solution to 0 036 min 1 for tap water also cod removal rate constant decreased from 0 054 min 1 for aqueous solution to 0 032 min 1 for tap water as it was formerly discussed anions decrease the performance of uv based aops through two main mechanisms 1 decrease of water molecule homolysis and formaldehyde photolysis as a result of uv absorbance by the anionic species especially nitrate 2 scavenging hydroxyl radicals by some anions such as carbonate and bicarbonate 3 5 effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger as discussed above several mechanisms including direct photolysis interaction with molecular ozone and reaction with ross mainly hydroxyl radical might be involved in formaldehyde degradation in the uvc vuv process although the generation of hydroxyl radical and oxidation of formaldehyde with this reactive specie was proposed as the main mechanism involved in degradation and cod removal in the uvc vuv photo reactor in order to verify the proposed mechanism the degradation of formaldehyde was compared in absence and presence of salicylic acid as a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger with a reaction rate constant of 2 2 1010 m 1 s 1 15 fig 6 the formaldehyde removal efficiency decreased in the uvc vuv process from 99 5 in absence of salicylic acid to 17 2 in its presence under the selected conditions it is clearly found that the degradation of formaldehyde was strongly suppressed in the presence of salicylic acid table 3 compares the kinetic parameters of formaldehyde degradation in absence and presence of salicylic acid which was also in good agreement with pfo model based on information given in table 3 the presence of salicylic acid considerably decreased the formaldehyde degradation rate constant from 0 0926 to 0 0015 min 1 since salicylic acid is known as a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger 25 the finding confirms that reaction with hydroxyl radical was the main mechanism involved in degradation of formaldehyde in the uvc vuv process under the selected conditions apart from hydroxyl radical other ross such as superoxide radical might be formed and contributed in the transformation reactions although the reaction rate of salicylic acid with hydroxyl radical is 106 times more than that with superoxide radical 32 furthermore ozone could also be formed in the uvc vuv process eq 5 and thus might be contributed in direct oxidation of formaldehyde only in low ph ranges 16 at acidic phs molecular ozone directly and selectively attacks the carbon carbon double bonds 33 in alkaline condition ozone is decomposed to the hydroxyl radical with an oxidation potential much greater than that of molecular ozone 33 since formaldehyde is a saturated compound with no carbon carbon double bond and considering neutral ph as the optimum condition in the uvc vuv process it is deduced that molecular ozone had negligible direct influence on the obtained formaldehyde degradation 4 conclusion application of uvc vuv photoreactor brought about the 99 5 degradation and 94 0 cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde within 60 min at optimum solution ph of 7 the degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde followed pseudo first order kinetic model amongst anions carbonates and nitrate had the highest inhibition on cod removal in the uvc vuv photo reactor formaldehyde removal efficiency decreased from 99 5 in distilled water to 86 2 in tap water degradation mechanism was deduced using salicylic acid as a strong scavenger of hydroxyl radical and the finding confirmed that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidative specie involved in degradation of formaldehyde under the selected conditions accordingly it can be concluded that the uvc vuv process is a promising chemical less aop for degrading high concentrations of formaldehyde acknowledgment the authors sincerely acknowledge the financial and technical support provided by tarbiat modares

14465,this study was conducted to evaluate the degradation of high concentrations of formaldehyde in the chemical less uvc vuv photo reactor 99 5 degradation and 94 chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde was achieved in the uvc vuv photo reactor at reaction time of 60 min and solution ph of 7 the effect of water anions such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrate chloride sulfate and phosphate was examined on degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde nitrate and carbonate exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on the process besides treatment of formaldehyde contaminated tap water was also investigated and formaldehyde removal was decreased from 99 5 is aqueous solution to 86 2 in tap water the findings of radical scavenging tests revealed that hydroxyl radical was the most predominant oxidizing agent contributed in degradation of formaldehyde it is concluded therefore that the uvc vuv process as a unique chemical less process efficient for advanced degradation of

the dominate oxidation specie was determined using the radical scavenging tests significant results were achieved in degradation and chemical oxygen demand removal of formaldehyde 2 materials and

measured using a jenway 3505 ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial solution ph the effect of solution ph between 4 and 12 was investigated on the performance of the uvc vuv process for degradation and cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde removal as can be seen in fig 1 ph has had no significant effect on formaldehyde degradation while it notably influenced the cod removal ranging from 33 7 to about 82 5 for solution phs from 4 to 12 as a variable ph is considered to influence the process in two ways a ph can determine the domination of reactive oxygen species ross 2 ph influences the speciation or distribution of contaminate regarding its pka it is known that ozone in alkaline condition is decomposed to hydroxyl radical 3 on the other hand considering formaldehyde pka 13 3 at 25 c formaldehyde dissociation was not affected by the studied range of ph 4 0 12 0 therefore although formaldehyde was degraded as a result of hydroxyl radical attack and of direct photolysis the remaining organic contents still exhibited cod the c h bond in formaldehyde is a relatively strong bond that is more difficult to be broken in comparison with the co bond 23 thus lower cod removal efficiency might have been attributed to the remaining of organic content in form of c h 23 as can be seen in fig 1 cod removal increased rapidly from 33 7 to 77 by increasing the solution ph from 4 0 to 7 0 while further increase of ph to 12 caused slightly improvement of cod removal to 82 5 the increase in cod removal as a function of solution ph can be related to the dissociation of ozone generated in the photo reactor eq 5 to hydroxyl radical in higher phs particularly in alkaline condition which has a higher oxidation potential as compared to molecular ozone besides formaldehyde is a saturated compound so that it has a low tendency to react with molecular ozone 3 accordingly alkaline ph was superior for formaldehyde degradation in uvc vuv photo reactor due to domination of hydroxyl radical and dissociation of ozone to hydroxyl radical the change in solution ph during the uvc vuv process was also illustrated in fig 1 it is seen in fig 1 that final ph slightly decreased from its initial level the decrease in solution ph after the uvc vuv process can be related to the generation of protons eqs 2 and 3 and also to the formation of acidic intermediates from formaldehyde degradation 3 2 effect of initial formaldehyde concentration taking the stoichiometric aspect into account for degradation it is of high importance to consider the ratio of oxidizing agent to oxidizable pollutant typically here referred to mainly the hydroxyl radical and formaldehyde respectively to evaluate the effect of initial formaldehyde concentration on its degradation and cod removal efficiencies the concentration of formaldehyde was varied between 200 mg l and 500 mg l and the corresponding results are depicted in figs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 2 increase of formaldehyde concentration led to expectedly decrease of its degradation over 99 of 200 mg l formaldehyde was degraded in the uvc vuv process within 60 min reaction time in comparison the degradation of 300 400 and 500 mg l formaldehyde was 98 7 96 3 and 90 8 respectively under similar experimental conditions fig 3 depicts the cod removal of different formaldehyde concentrations in the uvc vuv process as a function of the reaction time the same trend of formaldehyde degradation fig 2 is observed for cod removal fig 3 the cod removal efficiency in the uvc vuv process at the highest tested reaction time of 60 min was 94 86 3 81 0 and 74 2 for initial formaldehyde concentrations of 200 300 400 and 500 mg l formaldehyde respectively comparing figs 2 and 3 indicates that removal of cod was lower than the degradation of formaldehyde at any specific similar experimental conditions considering the constant amount of uv photons emitted from the lamp the reduction in the degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde with increase in initial formaldehyde concentration at any reaction time can be related to the decrease in amount of photons absorbed per mass unit of formaldehyde as the concentration of formaldehyde was increased 24 furthermore the mass ratio of ross especially the hydroxyl radical to formaldehyde could be decreased as a result of increase of formaldehyde concentration the lower cod removal compared to the formaldehyde degradation can be attributed to formation of degradation organic intermediates containing relatively high strength of c h bonds 23 3 3 kinetics of degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde kinetics of degradation and cod removal of different concentrations of formaldehyde in the uvc vuv process were evaluated under optimum conditions given in figs 2 and 3 both formaldehyde degradation and its cod removal were in good agreement with pseudo first order pfo kinetic model with determination coefficients r2 0 9 the results of kinetics evaluation are summarized in table 1 as mentioned in table 1 increase of formaldehyde concentration from 200 to 500 mg l led to decrease of the rate constants of formaldehyde degradation from 0 092 to 0 048 min 1 and of its cod removal from 0 054 to 0 026 min 1 moussavi et al 3 studied the degradation of formaldehyde using o3 mgo h2o2 process and reported a kobs value of 0 015 min 1 3 in another study conducted for formaldehyde removal 25 the reported rate constants were 0 048 min 1 and 1 017 min 1 using electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes respectively 3 4 effect of water anions the effect of sulfate nitrate carbonate bicarbonate chloride or phosphate anions was evaluated on the performance of uvc vuv process in degradation and cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde these experiments were conducted at optimum solution ph of 7 and the reaction time of 60 min at the presence of 100 mg l each of selected anions as illustrated in fig 4 formaldehyde removal efficiency was not significantly affected in presence of all selected anions except nitrate in case of cod inhibitory effect of anions was noticeable following this order carbonate nitrate bicarbonate phosphate sulfate chloride the formaldehyde removal efficiency considerably decreased from 99 5 in absence to 42 7 in presence of nitrate indeed nitrate is supposed to decrease the efficiency of uv based aops due to its strong uv absorbance as shown in eqs 9 and 10 by absorbing uv radiation nitrate suppresses both direct photolysis of formaldehyde and mainly water homolysis thus hydroxyl radical formation through which the process efficiency decreased the corresponding reactions are as follows 26 9 n o 3 h v n o 2 1 2 o 2 10 n o 2 o 3 n o 3 o 2 the reaction of hydroxyl radical with carbonate and bicarbonate leads to formation of carbonate radical whose oxidation potential 1 63 v is much less than that of hydroxyl radical 27 besides in comparison with bicarbonate carbonate reacts with hydroxyl radical with a higher rate as given in eqs 11 and 12 which is in agreement with the obtained results 26 11 h o h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 12 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 o h k 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 sulfate and chloride exhibited the lowest inhibitory effect on cod removal in presence of sulfate formaldehyde removal was not suppressed probably due to minute formation of sulfate radical as a consequence of sulfate reaction with hydroxyl radical 28 while cod removal considerably decreased from 94 to 48 6 and 46 5 in presence of sulfate and chloride respectively in presence of chloride formaldehyde removal efficiency slightly decreased from 99 5 to 96 5 this can be explained by formation of less reactive oxidants of cl and cloh as compared to the hydroxyl radical as a result of the reaction of chloride with the hydroxyl radical 29 in fact cloh is an unstable intermediate which quickly dissociates back to hydroxyl radical 30 the corresponding reactions are presented in eqs 13 16 besides it has been reported that presence of chloride ion leads to halogenation of organic compounds in water as an electrophilic atom chloride can be added to unsaturated bonds of organic compounds 31 this phenomenon results in higher persistence of the organic compounds and lower cod removal efficiency 28 13 c l h o c l o h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 14 c l o h c l h o k 6 1

tap water containing all of the selected anions was also examined as illustrated in fig 5 formaldehyde and cod removal efficiencies decreased from 99 5 and 94 in aqueous solution distilled water to 86 2 and 82 5 in tap water respectively kinetics of degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde from distilled water and spiked tap water was compared based on the results given in fig 5 kinetic information is presented in table 2 similar to the distilled water formaldehyde and cod removal efficiencies from tap water were also in good agreement r2 0 97 with pfo kinetic model eq 7 as given in table 2 the formaldehyde degradation rate constant decreased from 0 093 min 1 for aqueous solution to 0 036 min 1 for tap water also cod removal rate constant decreased from 0 054 min 1 for aqueous solution to 0 032 min 1 for tap water as it was formerly discussed anions decrease the performance of uv based aops through two main mechanisms 1 decrease of water molecule homolysis and formaldehyde photolysis as a result of uv absorbance by the anionic species especially nitrate 2 scavenging hydroxyl radicals by some anions such as carbonate and bicarbonate 3 5 effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger as discussed above several mechanisms including direct photolysis interaction with molecular ozone and reaction with ross mainly hydroxyl radical might be involved in formaldehyde degradation in the uvc vuv process although the generation of hydroxyl radical and oxidation of formaldehyde with this reactive specie was proposed as the main mechanism involved in degradation and cod removal in the uvc vuv photo reactor in order to verify the proposed mechanism the degradation of formaldehyde was compared in absence and presence of salicylic acid as a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger with a reaction rate constant of 2 2 1010 m 1 s 1 15 fig 6 the formaldehyde removal efficiency decreased in the uvc vuv process from 99 5 in absence of salicylic acid to 17 2 in its presence under the selected conditions it is clearly found that the degradation of formaldehyde was strongly suppressed in the presence of salicylic acid table 3 compares the kinetic parameters of formaldehyde degradation in absence and presence of salicylic acid which was also in good agreement with pfo model based on information given in table 3 the presence of salicylic acid considerably decreased the formaldehyde degradation rate constant from 0 0926 to 0 0015 min 1 since salicylic acid is known as a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger 25 the finding confirms that reaction with hydroxyl radical was the main mechanism involved in degradation of formaldehyde in the uvc vuv process under the selected conditions apart from hydroxyl radical other ross such as superoxide radical might be formed and contributed in the transformation reactions although the reaction rate of salicylic acid with hydroxyl radical is 106 times more than that with superoxide radical 32 furthermore ozone could also be formed in the uvc vuv process eq 5 and thus might be contributed in direct oxidation of formaldehyde only in low ph ranges 16 at acidic phs molecular ozone directly and selectively attacks the carbon carbon double bonds 33 in alkaline condition ozone is decomposed to the hydroxyl radical with an oxidation potential much greater than that of molecular ozone 33 since formaldehyde is a saturated compound with no carbon carbon double bond and considering neutral ph as the optimum condition in the uvc vuv process it is deduced that molecular ozone had negligible direct influence on the obtained formaldehyde degradation 4 conclusion application of uvc vuv photoreactor brought about the 99 5 degradation and 94 0 cod removal of 200 mg l formaldehyde within 60 min at optimum solution ph of 7 the degradation and cod removal of formaldehyde followed pseudo first order kinetic model amongst anions carbonates and nitrate had the highest inhibition on cod removal in the uvc vuv photo reactor formaldehyde removal efficiency decreased from 99 5 in distilled water to 86 2 in tap water degradation mechanism was deduced using salicylic acid as a strong scavenger of hydroxyl radical and the finding confirmed that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidative specie involved in degradation of formaldehyde under the selected conditions accordingly it can be concluded that the uvc vuv process is a promising chemical less aop for degrading high concentrations of formaldehyde acknowledgment the authors sincerely acknowledge the financial and technical support provided by tarbiat modares

14466,the current research investigates the removal of endocrine disruptor compounds edc in the absence and presence of organic matter in aqueous solution and natural water in addition the interactions of different fractions of natural organic matter nom and fulvic acid fa in 17α estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa were assessed the interaction experiments between organic matter show that e3 has a higher sorption coefficient koc in fa 0 0921 l mgc 1 with concentrations around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 while at nom e2 has a major interaction with koc of 0 0840 l mgc 1 and binding concentration in the range of 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 the photolysis experiment to 2 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration with absence of organic matter shows that ee2 e2 e3 and e1 have high removal with 95 96 97 and 80 after 180 min respectively on the other hand the degradation of bpa at the same concentration was 53 in the presence of nom 1 0 mg l 1 e1 degradation was around 2 times faster than aqueous solution and fa 1 0 mg l 1 the results of e1 degradation between nom with 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 had removal of 77 and 69 respectively in the natural water the degradation of e2 and e3 was much faster than aqueous solution these results could extend our knowledge on the photodegradation behaviours of edc in natural waters keywords photodegradation fulvic acid natural organic matter endocrine disruptor compounds 1 introduction the increasing contamination of natural water systems worldwide is a result of continuous discharge of natural and anthropogenic chemicals derived mainly from industrial activities and discharge of wastewater treatment plants 1 which partially remove these contaminants 2 among these contaminants are the emerging contaminants ec described by several authors as substances commonly found in environmental samples but are not routinely monitored despite their risks to the environment and human health 3 5 the ec is a group of chemical substances that encompass many compounds such as pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disruptors pesticides and herbicides 3 6 7 numerous studies suggest that among these compounds the endocrine disruptor compounds edc may affect several aquatic organisms in natural waters effects such as intersex feminization and unusual territorial behavior reported in fish 8 10 likewise recent studies describe some effects of these compounds in the human body 11 12 the endocrine disruptor is represented by 17α estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 and estriol e3 whereas bisphenol a bpa is a compound with estrogenic activity at very low concentration and considered a major problem for water quality 13 15 these contaminants are stable in the environment 16 17 therefore it is highly important to assess their degradation in the aquatic system the environmental fate and occurrence of these harmful substances in natural waters is dependent mainly on physical chemical and biological processes 18 thus edc needs to be treated in its primary source however most current technologies are not fully effective for the complete removal of these compounds therefore new treatment methods should be initiated and incorporated into the treatment plants both for water and sewage once present in natural waters edc are exposed to several transformation removal processes namely photodegradation sunlight biodegradation and sorption 19 therefore sunlight photolysis is an important chemical process that can lead to the degradation of organic contaminants in natural waters 20 21 several studies report the solar photolysis 22 23 and artificial light photolysis 24 27 in removing these endocrine disruptors however some of these processes have a low efficiency in total removal of above mentioned contaminants and many articles have ignored the role of organic material in the degradation of edc once the photodegradation of these compounds in the environment can be affected by the dissolved organic matter dom 28 29 dom is a heterogeneous blend of a diversity of organic compounds with different sizes and structural and functional properties solar degradation of endocrine disrupters may occur by direct or indirect photolysis during direct photolysis the absorption of a photon by the target compound results in bond cleavage or rearrangement to form a new stable product in indirect photolysis sunlight is absorbed by photoactive compounds called photosensitizers such as chromophoric groups of dom which absorb light and produce a series of reactive species which can play an important role in photodegradation pathways in environmental systems 19 30 the reactive species includes hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet dom 3dom and peroxyl radicals which can induce degradation of contaminant 31 32 within this context the purpose of this work was to evaluate the removal of different edc such as 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa employing artificial light since photodegradation is being increasingly employed as a pre or post treatment process to improve the efficiency of industrial effluent treatment plants photodegradation experiments were performed to assess the role of natural organic matter in edc degradation in ultrapure and natural water samples in addition the binding between edc and natural organic matter was studied to determine the sorption coefficient using the fluorescence quenching fq method 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 purity 98 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa purity 99 were purchased from sigma acetonitrile acn of hplc grade purity 99 9 was purchased from j t baker mexico mexico sodium chloride pa was obtained from vetec the natural organic matter employed included standard fulvic acid fa and standard natural organic matter nom isolated from suwannee river and obtained from international humic substance standard ihss boulder co 2 2 binding experiments for edc and natural organic matter the binding experiments were performed on a mechanical 5 axis agitator dits brazil with 50 ml of edc solution concentration fixed at 1 0 mg l 1 the concentration used for natural organic matter and fulvic acid were 0 0 5 2 0 5 0 and 10 mg l 1 the experiments were kept under stirring of 200 rpm at room temperature in the dark for 24 h at ph 6 5 the ionic strength was maintained using the electrolyte sodium chloride nacl 0 02 mol l 1 the studies were performed for each endocrine disrupter in triplicate edc fluorescence measurements were performed using the fluorescence quenching fq to determine the binding between edc and organic matter the edc fluorescence intensity fi was performed on a spectrofluorimeter shimadzu rf 5301 pc using a xenon lamp xe900 as excitation source the scan speed was set at 500 nm min 1 in wavelengths from 220 to 450 nm the slits were set to 5 nm for both excitation and emission with excitation wavelength λ ex of 280 nm the fluorescence intensity of edc solution was measured at 310 nm all of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate 2 3 photolysis experiments photolysis experiments were performed using a reactor coupled with exhaust fans and a high pressure mercury lamp 250 w the experiments were conducted in a glass flask with a volume of 50 ml during 3 h of treatment firstly the experiments were performed with e1 e2 ee2 e3 and bpa at different initial concentration 0 7 1 0 1 8 e 2 5 mg l 1 with absence of natural organic matter secondly in this study were also assessed the e1 degradation with different initial concentration 0 7 1 0 1 8 e 2 5 mg l 1 in the presence of organic matter fa and nom 1 0 mg l 1 lastly with the objective to investigate the effect of a higher concentration of organic matter at photodegradation photolysis experiments of e1 ee2 and e2 with 1 0 mg l 1 were carried out with fa and nom with a fixed concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 at selected times aliquots were taken to determine the concentrations of edc by molecular fluorescence following methodology described in section 2 2 2 4 influence of the natural water on photodegradation of edc photodegradation experiment of e2 and e3 was carried out with surface water samples collected in november 2017 from patos lagoon brazil this study had the objective to assess the influence of natural organic matter present in aquatic environmental matrices in degradation of edc the patos lagoon estuary is situated in the south of brazil and is considered the largest choked coastal lagoon in the world 33 connected to the south atlantic ocean it receives a large freshwater discharge during austral winter spring 34 immediately after the collection the entire sample was filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane unifil and stored in glass bottles under refrigeration each of the replicate collected water samples was spiked with 1 0 mg l 1 of e2 and e3 concentration distributed in a glass flask and irradiated as described in section 2 3 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using statistical software statistica statsoft anova one way analysis of variance and tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test were applied and differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 binding of edc to natural organic matter the interaction processes were evaluated by fluorescence quenching fq of the edc in the presence of organic matter this technique is used for chemicals substances with fluorescent characteristics in order to study their properties and chemical physical interactions with other compounds the fluorescence quenching is based on fluorescence response quenched or decreased after the interactions between chemicals substances 35 the method has often been employed to determine the koc value sorption coefficient of hydrophobic organic compounds 36 39 fluorescence quenching is described in terms of the stern volmer s v equation eq 1 1 f 0 f 1 k oc q mgc l 1 where f and f0 values indicate the fluorescence intensity of edc in the presence and absence of natural organic matter fa or nom koc is the sorption coefficient and q is the concentration of suppressor in the solution the ratio f0 f was plotted versus organic matter concentration to obtain koc with units of l mgc 1 the sorption coefficient reflects on the suppression efficiency or the accessibility of the fluorophores to the suppressor low koc value indicates the shielding of the fluorophore and a high value indicates a stronger interaction involving some type of interactions mechanism such as static or dynamic quenching 35 this parameter also increases with increasing hydrophobicity of a substance to investigate the effect of hydrophobicity on the koc values of the compounds the fluorescence intensity fi of edc was measured with fa and nom shown in fig 1 the linear behavior of stern volmer plot in fig 1 suggests a mechanism static quenching was responsible for the fluorescence quenching of edc by the fa and nom the values of koc and linearity of each edc with natural organic matter is demonstrated in table 1 according to the results the compound e3 presented a higher koc value about 0 0921 l mgc 1 when it interacted with fa these results are supported by the work of lee et al 40 which demonstrated that fa is more susceptible to interact with the edc since it presents a greater amount of carboxylic groups in its structure as demonstrated in table 2 this favors the π π interactions which are formed by the lateral overlap of two parallel p orbitals in nom the higher suppression was observed in e2 with k oc equal 0 0840 l mgc 1 this was probably due to the π π interaction and hydrogen bonding between e2 and nom phenolic groups result of the highest log kow value for e2 yamamoto et al 41 reported that a phenolic functional group and aromaticity were factors influencing the sorption of e2 the phenolic group of nom is higher than that of fa the bound concentration of each edc was calculated by fluorescence intensity illustrated in fig 2 the binding capacities of each edc with the organic matter were according to previous data in fig 2a the results show that e3 majorly interacts with fa with concentrations around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 corresponding to 75 of it is initial concentration this result correlates with the chemical structure of e3 which has the highest number of hydroxyl radicals among the studied edc which explains the higher e3 binding with fa furthermore in fig 2 b is observed that the nom e2 has a major interaction and bound concentration around 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 representing 71 of the initial concentration studied these results enable us to better understand the interaction of each edc with the organic matter present in the solution according to the literature the amount of organic matter is another element that affects the binding between organic matter and organic compounds 39 since this factor affects the bioavailability of the compound in the solution moreover the literature shows that the hydrophobic distribution is one of the most dominant mechanisms responsible for binding compounds with log kow 5 0 however it is important to note that most of the endocrine disrupter compounds studied in this work show log kow 3 0 table 3 and can be considered relatively persistent in aquatic environments 36 thus these binding results help the comprehension of the interaction between these contaminants with the organic matter present in the environmental system 3 2 photodegradation of aqueous solution edc with absence of natural organic matter to study the photolysis kinetics and the effect of initial concentration of edc solutions of each edc containing 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively were irradiated by a high pressure mercury vapor lamp the photolysis essay results are shown in figs 3 and 4 degradation of the 17α ethynylestradiol estriol and 17β estradiol was rapid in the first 15 min over irradiation light with removal of 82 58 and 50 respectively at the concentration of 0 7 mg l 1 on the other hand the bpa and e3 had removal about 4 and 15 respectively to 0 7 mg l 1 in addition with increasing edc initial concentration the final removal was not significantly different with removal of approximately 95 96 and 97 after 180 min of the exposition light to the ee2 e2 and e3 respectively to 2 5 mg l 1 the literature highlights that the photodegradation of estrone e1 and estradiol e2 is caused by breakage and oxidation of benzene rings contained in the molecular structure leading to compounds with carbonyl groups 42 on the contrary under irradiation the estrone and bisphenol a were the edcs that had lower degradation which were more stable the irradiation of artificial light fig 3 a and e it was found that concentration of e1 decreased in aqueous solution during the light irradiation with total removal of about 62 63 76 and 80 to 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 to bpa the major removal was to the concentration 0 7 and 1 0 mg l 1 with 63 and 64 removal after 180 min under light exposition respectively the low degradation of bpa can be explained by its molecular structure table 3 as compounds such as unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbons and their similar products have strong absorption to short wave uv light whereas bisphenol a has only two unsaturated benzene rings in its structure which are responsible for almost no absorption in uva and uvb with a wavelength longer than 290 nm while there is a strong absorption of uvc with a wavelength shorter than 290 nm therefore the degradation of the bpa with long wavelength and visible light radiation does not result in the high degradation rather the exposition to short wavelength can result in a break by photolysis 43 for bpa similar removals were found by goulart et al 44 with 55 removal after 120 min under a low pressure mercury vapor 45 lamp 36 w these results show the high recalcitrance of bpa by photolysis treatments comparable degradation was obtained by zhang et al 24 to e1 and e2 with removal of 97 in the reactor with irradiation of 150 w over 4 h and 98 in reactor with 15 w over 1 h these results are due to the shorter wavelength of uv light employed in the photodegradation experiment according to the results the photodegradation of edc in aqueous solution followed first order kinetics for all initial concentrations tested with a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 773 to 0 987 table 4 pseudo first order kinetics is common in organic compounds photodegradation by photolysis as reported in previous work 46 48 for the bisphenol a compound the rate constant decreased slightly a 30 reduction in rate constant for a 4 fold increase in concentration with increasing initial concentration this is a common trend in the photochemical process of organic compounds where the photolysis is slower at higher concentrations due to photon limitations over the contaminant on the other hand the same was not observed in e1 ee2 e2 and e3 where generally the rate constants increase with increasing concentration considering these aspects the rate constant of edc degradation follows the ascending order to 2 5 mg l 1 bpa e1 ee2 e3 e2 this highlights the longest half life for bpa approximately 126 min which shows the potential risk of this compound to the environment the results in this work show greater degradation of edc than has previously been reported in the literature for example ren et al 46 obtained limited photodegradation of ee2 in ultrapure water with a rate constant of 1 13 10 4 min 1 using a solar simulator as irradiation source 500 w silva et al 19 performed degradation with an arc xenon lamp 1500 w to e2 and ee2 degradation and obtained rate constants of the 2 52 10 4 min 1 and 1 26 10 4 min 1 for ee2 and e2 respectively in addition chowdhury et al 49 also carried out experimental studies with an xenon lamp 1000 w to e2 and show a rate constant around 9 81 10 4 min 1 with t1 2 11 h oliveira et al 28 used an arc xenon lamp 1500 w on e3 solution with a rate constant of 2 30 10 4 min 1 indicating a slow degradation of e3 in ultrapure water with t1 2 calculated as 50 h the contrast in the obtained values can be attributed to differences in the experimental conditions such the use of mercury lamp and the initial edc concentration the high pressure mercury lamp was chosen because it is inexpensive and shows great results in photolysis experiment information reported from the literature 45 shows that these lamps have enough energy to break chemical bonds of various organic compounds furthermore the energy of the chemical bonds of most organic molecules is in the range of 150 to 600 kj which correspond the possible degradation with photons with wavelengths of 800 to 200 nm respectively therefore in this research was observed that the high pressure vapor lamp have excellent performance in photolysis degradation on edc compounds when compared with xenon lamp employed in most literature studies 3 3 photodegradation of aqueous solution edc in present natural organic matter in order to investigate the effect of nom and fa on the e1 photodegradation we used a fraction of 1 0 mg l 1 of organic matter and a concentration of 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 of e1 fig 5 this compound was chosen because it presented the low degradation compared to the other studied anova one way test and tukey p 0 05 show that the treatment between e1 e1 with fa and e1 with nom had significant differences at total removal when compared to the photolysis experiment with concentrations of 0 7 1 0 and 1 8 mg l 1 for 2 5 mg l 1 concentration significant differences were obtained when the experiments are compared with absence e1 and presence of organic matter e1 nom or e1 fa on the other hand the degradation between e1 nom and e1 fa was considered statistically equal photodegradation of e1 in the presence of nom 1 mg l 1 k 0 0239 min 1 t1 2 29 min was quicker than degradation in fa 1 mg l 1 k 0 0175 min 1 t1 2 39 61 min and ultrapure water solution k 0 0134 min 1 t1 2 51 72 min with total removal of approximately 94 92 and 80 respectively after 180 min to 2 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration specifically the degradation rate constant of e1 was 2 times faster with presence of 2 5 mg l 1 of nom than in ultrapure water table 5 the better degradation of e1 in higher concentration can be explained due to competing incident photons between nom and the compound in solution these results can also be attributed to less significant binding of edc with nom leading the compound to receive directly the photons incident by the radiation source resulting in an easier break by photolysis likewise the degradation also depends on the structure of organic matter carboxyl aromatic groups and carbonyl type chromophores meaning a possible reaction with irradiation light to form photosensitisers which induce the photodegradation of the compounds present in the solution 50 in the aquatic environmental system these mechanisms of indirect photolysis are responsible for degradation of organic compounds since the organic matter reacts with solar irradiation generating free radicals that cause the molecule to break 30 with the objective to investigate the effect of a higher concentration of nom and fa on e1 ee2 and e2 1 0 mg l 1 photodegradation was used with 5 0 mg l 1 of each fraction of natural organic matter fig 6 these results show that the photodegradation of ee2 and e2 followed the same pattern of treatment with absence and presence of organic matter with no statistically difference between the processes the total removal of ee2 and e2 was 94 and 93 to nom and 94 and 95 to fa respectively in other words degradation did not significantly increase with 5 0 mg l 1 nom or fa therefore no tests were performed with e3 and bpa these results are different those found by some author in the literature leech et al 23 observed that different fractions of organic matter increased two times degradation of e2 027 mg l 1 ren et al 46 also observed that the presence of organic matter in reactive medium during photodegradation increase the removal of ee2 silva et al 51 observed increased removal of e2 and ee2 6 95 for e2 and 16 94 for ee2 in absence and presence of organic matter respectively the contrast between present results and those reported in literature may attribute to differences in initial edc concentration and mainly the irradiation source for e1 1 0 mg l 1 the results of degradation were statistically different between two fraction studies of nom 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 with removal of 77 and 69 respectively the difference in obtained values is explained by interactions between the e1 and organic matter a higher concentration of organic matter may compete with the light reducing the photons available to the compound comparing the degradation of e1 1 0 mg l 1 with different fractions of fa 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 we observed that the total removal was not statically different with values around 72 and 70 3 4 influence of the natural water on photodegradation of edc experimental results for the photodegradation of e2 and e3 in the environmental aquatic matrices were fitted following the pseudo first order kinetic model and degradation curves which are presented in fig 7 these compounds were selected for to represent the class of endocrine disruptor compounds studied in the environmental aquatic matrices an acceleration degradation of e2 and e3 was observed with 100 removal after 120 min over irradiation light in this context was observed that the natural water used in degradation has organic matter which contributes to rapid degradation of e2 and e3 in other words the photodegradation is assisted by the reaction of photosensitisers under indirect photolysis which forms due to the type and content of organic matter present in the water used in this essay thereby other aspects may also be responsible for increasing photolysis since photosensitising agents e g nitrites and other organic and inorganic chromophores may also induce photochemical reactions leading to the formation of reactive species which can cause rapid compound degradation 28 52 53 additionally based on the obtained results it is possible predict that the molecules of organic matter from patos lagoon are more bioavailable and less protected from light allowing better and more rapid degradation of edc than aqueous solutions these results are important as natural water photodegradation is predominantly attributed to the photosensitisation effect caused by oxidative species under irradiation sunlight above 340 nm likewise in the aquatic environment the presence of organic matter directly affects the absorption and degradation of contaminants considering that light attenuation exponentially decreases with increasing wavelength this is due to the absorption of light by the chromophore groups present in the dissolved organic matter which implies the reduction of the incident light available for the contaminants present in water 31 4 environmental implications although the concentration of edc employed in this study exceeded environmental levels it is justified because this study had the objective of explore and understand the photochemical behavior of some substances omnipresent in aquatic environmental thus the study of edc degradation is important since the adverse effects and toxicity of these compounds is already well established for various aquatic organisms in addition the study aims to demonstrate that photolysis technique with use of high pressure vapor lamp has low cost and can be inserted in treatment plants of water and sewage the photolysis technique could improve the current treatment system to ensure total remove edc in sewage treatment plants which is reported as one of main source of these substances into environmental system 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that e1 e2 ee2 e3 and bpa are photodegraded by direct photolysis in addition the experiment highlighted that among edcs e3 presented a higher interaction with fa with bound concentration around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 corresponding to 75 of it is initial concentration and e2 with 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 representing 71 of initial concentration to nom photodegradation of edc in aqueous solution occurred under the photolysis treatment and each experiment followed first order kinetics among the compounds studied the lowest degradation was obtained for estrone and bisphenol with maximum removals of 80 14 and 63 respectively to ee2 e2 and e3 degradation was around 97 96 and 98 respectively after 120 min the experimental study carried out with nom and fa on the e1 photodegradation shows that nom had significant difference at total removal when compared to the edc studied concentration results on the photodegradation of e2 and e3 in the environmental aquatic matrices demonstrated acceleration degradation with 100 removal after 120 min over irradiation light for both compounds these results highlight that organic matter might play an important role on organic compounds photodegradation in aquatic environmental systems finally this study has shown that direct photolysis is an effective alternative for edc degradation representing a successful

14466,the current research investigates the removal of endocrine disruptor compounds edc in the absence and presence of organic matter in aqueous solution and natural water in addition the interactions of different fractions of natural organic matter nom and fulvic acid fa in 17α estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa were assessed the interaction experiments between organic matter show that e3 has a higher sorption coefficient koc in fa 0 0921 l mgc 1 with concentrations around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 while at nom e2 has a major interaction with koc of 0 0840 l mgc 1 and binding concentration in the range of 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 the photolysis experiment to 2 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration with absence of organic matter shows that ee2 e2 e3 and e1 have high removal with 95 96 97 and 80 after 180 min respectively on the other hand the degradation of bpa at the same concentration was 53 in the presence of nom 1 0 mg l 1 e1 degradation was around 2 times faster than aqueous solution and fa 1 0 mg l 1 the results of e1 degradation between nom with 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 had removal of 77 and 69 respectively in the natural water the degradation of e2 and e3 was much faster than aqueous solution these results could extend our knowledge on the photodegradation behaviours of edc in natural waters keywords photodegradation fulvic acid natural organic matter endocrine disruptor compounds 1 introduction the increasing contamination of natural water systems worldwide is a result of continuous discharge of natural and anthropogenic chemicals derived mainly from industrial activities and discharge of wastewater treatment plants 1 which partially remove these contaminants 2 among these contaminants are the emerging contaminants ec described by several authors as substances commonly found in environmental samples but are not routinely monitored despite their risks to the environment and human health 3 5 the ec is a group of chemical substances that encompass many compounds such as pharmaceuticals personal care products endocrine disruptors pesticides and herbicides 3 6 7 numerous studies suggest that among these compounds the endocrine disruptor compounds edc may affect several aquatic organisms in natural waters effects such as intersex feminization and unusual territorial behavior reported in fish 8 10 likewise recent studies describe some effects of these compounds in the human body 11 12 the endocrine disruptor is represented by 17α estradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 and estriol e3 whereas bisphenol a bpa is a compound with estrogenic activity at very low concentration and considered a major problem for water quality 13 15 these contaminants are stable in the environment 16 17 therefore it is highly important to assess their degradation in the aquatic system the environmental fate and occurrence of these harmful substances in natural waters is dependent mainly on physical chemical and biological processes 18 thus edc needs to be treated in its primary source however most current technologies are not fully effective for the complete removal of these compounds therefore new treatment methods should be initiated and incorporated into the treatment plants both for water and sewage once present in natural waters edc are exposed to several transformation removal processes namely photodegradation sunlight biodegradation and sorption 19 therefore sunlight photolysis is an important chemical process that can lead to the degradation of organic contaminants in natural waters 20 21 several studies report the solar photolysis 22 23 and artificial light photolysis 24 27 in removing these endocrine disruptors however some of these processes have a low efficiency in total removal of above mentioned contaminants and many articles have ignored the role of organic material in the degradation of edc once the photodegradation of these compounds in the environment can be affected by the dissolved organic matter dom 28 29 dom is a heterogeneous blend of a diversity of organic compounds with different sizes and structural and functional properties solar degradation of endocrine disrupters may occur by direct or indirect photolysis during direct photolysis the absorption of a photon by the target compound results in bond cleavage or rearrangement to form a new stable product in indirect photolysis sunlight is absorbed by photoactive compounds called photosensitizers such as chromophoric groups of dom which absorb light and produce a series of reactive species which can play an important role in photodegradation pathways in environmental systems 19 30 the reactive species includes hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet dom 3dom and peroxyl radicals which can induce degradation of contaminant 31 32 within this context the purpose of this work was to evaluate the removal of different edc such as 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa employing artificial light since photodegradation is being increasingly employed as a pre or post treatment process to improve the efficiency of industrial effluent treatment plants photodegradation experiments were performed to assess the role of natural organic matter in edc degradation in ultrapure and natural water samples in addition the binding between edc and natural organic matter was studied to determine the sorption coefficient using the fluorescence quenching fq method 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 17β estradiol e2 purity 98 estrone e1 estriol e3 and bisphenol a bpa purity 99 were purchased from sigma acetonitrile acn of hplc grade purity 99 9 was purchased from j t baker mexico mexico sodium chloride pa was obtained from vetec the natural organic matter employed included standard fulvic acid fa and standard natural organic matter nom isolated from suwannee river and obtained from international humic substance standard ihss boulder co 2 2 binding experiments for edc and natural organic matter the binding experiments were performed on a mechanical 5 axis agitator dits brazil with 50 ml of edc solution concentration fixed at 1 0 mg l 1 the concentration used for natural organic matter and fulvic acid were 0 0 5 2 0 5 0 and 10 mg l 1 the experiments were kept under stirring of 200 rpm at room temperature in the dark for 24 h at ph 6 5 the ionic strength was maintained using the electrolyte sodium chloride nacl 0 02 mol l 1 the studies were performed for each endocrine disrupter in triplicate edc fluorescence measurements were performed using the fluorescence quenching fq to determine the binding between edc and organic matter the edc fluorescence intensity fi was performed on a spectrofluorimeter shimadzu rf 5301 pc using a xenon lamp xe900 as excitation source the scan speed was set at 500 nm min 1 in wavelengths from 220 to 450 nm the slits were set to 5 nm for both excitation and emission with excitation wavelength λ ex of 280 nm the fluorescence intensity of edc solution was measured at 310 nm all of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate 2 3 photolysis experiments photolysis experiments were performed using a reactor coupled with exhaust fans and a high pressure mercury lamp 250 w the experiments were conducted in a glass flask with a volume of 50 ml during 3 h of treatment firstly the experiments were performed with e1 e2 ee2 e3 and bpa at different initial concentration 0 7 1 0 1 8 e 2 5 mg l 1 with absence of natural organic matter secondly in this study were also assessed the e1 degradation with different initial concentration 0 7 1 0 1 8 e 2 5 mg l 1 in the presence of organic matter fa and nom 1 0 mg l 1 lastly with the objective to investigate the effect of a higher concentration of organic matter at photodegradation photolysis experiments of e1 ee2 and e2 with 1 0 mg l 1 were carried out with fa and nom with a fixed concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 at selected times aliquots were taken to determine the concentrations of edc by molecular fluorescence following methodology described in section 2 2 2 4 influence of the natural water on photodegradation of edc photodegradation experiment of e2 and e3 was carried out with surface water samples collected in november 2017 from patos lagoon brazil this study had the objective to assess the influence of natural organic matter present in aquatic environmental matrices in degradation of edc the patos lagoon estuary is situated in the south of brazil and is considered the largest choked coastal lagoon in the world 33 connected to the south atlantic ocean it receives a large freshwater discharge during austral winter spring 34 immediately after the collection the entire sample was filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane unifil and stored in glass bottles under refrigeration each of the replicate collected water samples was spiked with 1 0 mg l 1 of e2 and e3 concentration distributed in a glass flask and irradiated as described in section 2 3 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using statistical software statistica statsoft anova one way analysis of variance and tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test were applied and differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 binding of edc to natural organic matter the interaction processes were evaluated by fluorescence quenching fq of the edc in the presence of organic matter this technique is used for chemicals substances with fluorescent characteristics in order to study their properties and chemical physical interactions with other compounds the fluorescence quenching is based on fluorescence response quenched or decreased after the interactions between chemicals substances 35 the method has often been employed to determine the koc value sorption coefficient of hydrophobic organic compounds 36 39 fluorescence quenching is described in terms of the stern volmer s v equation eq 1 1 f 0 f 1 k oc q mgc l 1 where f and f0 values indicate the fluorescence intensity of edc in the presence and absence of natural organic matter fa or nom koc is the sorption coefficient and q is the concentration of suppressor in the solution the ratio f0 f was plotted versus organic matter concentration to obtain koc with units of l mgc 1 the sorption coefficient reflects on the suppression efficiency or the accessibility of the fluorophores to the suppressor low koc value indicates the shielding of the fluorophore and a high value indicates a stronger interaction involving some type of interactions mechanism such as static or dynamic quenching 35 this parameter also increases with increasing hydrophobicity of a substance to investigate the effect of hydrophobicity on the koc values of the compounds the fluorescence intensity fi of edc was measured with fa and nom shown in fig 1 the linear behavior of stern volmer plot in fig 1 suggests a mechanism static quenching was responsible for the fluorescence quenching of edc by the fa and nom the values of koc and linearity of each edc with natural organic matter is demonstrated in table 1 according to the results the compound e3 presented a higher koc value about 0 0921 l mgc 1 when it interacted with fa these results are supported by the work of lee et al 40 which demonstrated that fa is more susceptible to interact with the edc since it presents a greater amount of carboxylic groups in its structure as demonstrated in table 2 this favors the π π interactions which are formed by the lateral overlap of two parallel p orbitals in nom the higher suppression was observed in e2 with k oc equal 0 0840 l mgc 1 this was probably due to the π π interaction and hydrogen bonding between e2 and nom phenolic groups result of the highest log kow value for e2 yamamoto et al 41 reported that a phenolic functional group and aromaticity were factors influencing the sorption of e2 the phenolic group of nom is higher than that of fa the bound concentration of each edc was calculated by fluorescence intensity illustrated in fig 2 the binding capacities of each edc with the organic matter were according to previous data in fig 2a the results show that e3 majorly interacts with fa with concentrations around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 corresponding to 75 of it is initial concentration this result correlates with the chemical structure of e3 which has the highest number of hydroxyl radicals among the studied edc which explains the higher e3 binding with fa furthermore in fig 2 b is observed that the nom e2 has a major interaction and bound concentration around 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 representing 71 of the initial concentration studied these results enable us to better understand the interaction of each edc with the organic matter present in the solution according to the literature the amount of organic matter is another element that affects the binding between organic matter and organic compounds 39 since this factor affects the bioavailability of the compound in the solution moreover the literature shows that the hydrophobic distribution is one of the most dominant mechanisms responsible for binding compounds with log kow 5 0 however it is important to note that most of the endocrine disrupter compounds studied in this work show log kow 3 0 table 3 and can be considered relatively persistent in aquatic environments 36 thus these binding results help the comprehension of the interaction between these contaminants with the organic matter present in the environmental system 3 2 photodegradation of aqueous solution edc with absence of natural organic matter to study the photolysis kinetics and the effect of initial concentration of edc solutions of each edc containing 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively were irradiated by a high pressure mercury vapor lamp the photolysis essay results are shown in figs 3 and 4 degradation of the 17α ethynylestradiol estriol and 17β estradiol was rapid in the first 15 min over irradiation light with removal of 82 58 and 50 respectively at the concentration of 0 7 mg l 1 on the other hand the bpa and e3 had removal about 4 and 15 respectively to 0 7 mg l 1 in addition with increasing edc initial concentration the final removal was not significantly different with removal of approximately 95 96 and 97 after 180 min of the exposition light to the ee2 e2 and e3 respectively to 2 5 mg l 1 the literature highlights that the photodegradation of estrone e1 and estradiol e2 is caused by breakage and oxidation of benzene rings contained in the molecular structure leading to compounds with carbonyl groups 42 on the contrary under irradiation the estrone and bisphenol a were the edcs that had lower degradation which were more stable the irradiation of artificial light fig 3 a and e it was found that concentration of e1 decreased in aqueous solution during the light irradiation with total removal of about 62 63 76 and 80 to 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 to bpa the major removal was to the concentration 0 7 and 1 0 mg l 1 with 63 and 64 removal after 180 min under light exposition respectively the low degradation of bpa can be explained by its molecular structure table 3 as compounds such as unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbons and their similar products have strong absorption to short wave uv light whereas bisphenol a has only two unsaturated benzene rings in its structure which are responsible for almost no absorption in uva and uvb with a wavelength longer than 290 nm while there is a strong absorption of uvc with a wavelength shorter than 290 nm therefore the degradation of the bpa with long wavelength and visible light radiation does not result in the high degradation rather the exposition to short wavelength can result in a break by photolysis 43 for bpa similar removals were found by goulart et al 44 with 55 removal after 120 min under a low pressure mercury vapor 45 lamp 36 w these results show the high recalcitrance of bpa by photolysis treatments comparable degradation was obtained by zhang et al 24 to e1 and e2 with removal of 97 in the reactor with irradiation of 150 w over 4 h and 98 in reactor with 15 w over 1 h these results are due to the shorter wavelength of uv light employed in the photodegradation experiment according to the results the photodegradation of edc in aqueous solution followed first order kinetics for all initial concentrations tested with a coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 773 to 0 987 table 4 pseudo first order kinetics is common in organic compounds photodegradation by photolysis as reported in previous work 46 48 for the bisphenol a compound the rate constant decreased slightly a 30 reduction in rate constant for a 4 fold increase in concentration with increasing initial concentration this is a common trend in the photochemical process of organic compounds where the photolysis is slower at higher concentrations due to photon limitations over the contaminant on the other hand the same was not observed in e1 ee2 e2 and e3 where generally the rate constants increase with increasing concentration considering these aspects the rate constant of edc degradation follows the ascending order to 2 5 mg l 1 bpa e1 ee2 e3 e2 this highlights the longest half life for bpa approximately 126 min which shows the potential risk of this compound to the environment the results in this work show greater degradation of edc than has previously been reported in the literature for example ren et al 46 obtained limited photodegradation of ee2 in ultrapure water with a rate constant of 1 13 10 4 min 1 using a solar simulator as irradiation source 500 w silva et al 19 performed degradation with an arc xenon lamp 1500 w to e2 and ee2 degradation and obtained rate constants of the 2 52 10 4 min 1 and 1 26 10 4 min 1 for ee2 and e2 respectively in addition chowdhury et al 49 also carried out experimental studies with an xenon lamp 1000 w to e2 and show a rate constant around 9 81 10 4 min 1 with t1 2 11 h oliveira et al 28 used an arc xenon lamp 1500 w on e3 solution with a rate constant of 2 30 10 4 min 1 indicating a slow degradation of e3 in ultrapure water with t1 2 calculated as 50 h the contrast in the obtained values can be attributed to differences in the experimental conditions such the use of mercury lamp and the initial edc concentration the high pressure mercury lamp was chosen because it is inexpensive and shows great results in photolysis experiment information reported from the literature 45 shows that these lamps have enough energy to break chemical bonds of various organic compounds furthermore the energy of the chemical bonds of most organic molecules is in the range of 150 to 600 kj which correspond the possible degradation with photons with wavelengths of 800 to 200 nm respectively therefore in this research was observed that the high pressure vapor lamp have excellent performance in photolysis degradation on edc compounds when compared with xenon lamp employed in most literature studies 3 3 photodegradation of aqueous solution edc in present natural organic matter in order to investigate the effect of nom and fa on the e1 photodegradation we used a fraction of 1 0 mg l 1 of organic matter and a concentration of 0 7 1 0 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 of e1 fig 5 this compound was chosen because it presented the low degradation compared to the other studied anova one way test and tukey p 0 05 show that the treatment between e1 e1 with fa and e1 with nom had significant differences at total removal when compared to the photolysis experiment with concentrations of 0 7 1 0 and 1 8 mg l 1 for 2 5 mg l 1 concentration significant differences were obtained when the experiments are compared with absence e1 and presence of organic matter e1 nom or e1 fa on the other hand the degradation between e1 nom and e1 fa was considered statistically equal photodegradation of e1 in the presence of nom 1 mg l 1 k 0 0239 min 1 t1 2 29 min was quicker than degradation in fa 1 mg l 1 k 0 0175 min 1 t1 2 39 61 min and ultrapure water solution k 0 0134 min 1 t1 2 51 72 min with total removal of approximately 94 92 and 80 respectively after 180 min to 2 5 mg l 1 of initial concentration specifically the degradation rate constant of e1 was 2 times faster with presence of 2 5 mg l 1 of nom than in ultrapure water table 5 the better degradation of e1 in higher concentration can be explained due to competing incident photons between nom and the compound in solution these results can also be attributed to less significant binding of edc with nom leading the compound to receive directly the photons incident by the radiation source resulting in an easier break by photolysis likewise the degradation also depends on the structure of organic matter carboxyl aromatic groups and carbonyl type chromophores meaning a possible reaction with irradiation light to form photosensitisers which induce the photodegradation of the compounds present in the solution 50 in the aquatic environmental system these mechanisms of indirect photolysis are responsible for degradation of organic compounds since the organic matter reacts with solar irradiation generating free radicals that cause the molecule to break 30 with the objective to investigate the effect of a higher concentration of nom and fa on e1 ee2 and e2 1 0 mg l 1 photodegradation was used with 5 0 mg l 1 of each fraction of natural organic matter fig 6 these results show that the photodegradation of ee2 and e2 followed the same pattern of treatment with absence and presence of organic matter with no statistically difference between the processes the total removal of ee2 and e2 was 94 and 93 to nom and 94 and 95 to fa respectively in other words degradation did not significantly increase with 5 0 mg l 1 nom or fa therefore no tests were performed with e3 and bpa these results are different those found by some author in the literature leech et al 23 observed that different fractions of organic matter increased two times degradation of e2 027 mg l 1 ren et al 46 also observed that the presence of organic matter in reactive medium during photodegradation increase the removal of ee2 silva et al 51 observed increased removal of e2 and ee2 6 95 for e2 and 16 94 for ee2 in absence and presence of organic matter respectively the contrast between present results and those reported in literature may attribute to differences in initial edc concentration and mainly the irradiation source for e1 1 0 mg l 1 the results of degradation were statistically different between two fraction studies of nom 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 with removal of 77 and 69 respectively the difference in obtained values is explained by interactions between the e1 and organic matter a higher concentration of organic matter may compete with the light reducing the photons available to the compound comparing the degradation of e1 1 0 mg l 1 with different fractions of fa 1 0 mg l 1 and 5 0 mg l 1 we observed that the total removal was not statically different with values around 72 and 70 3 4 influence of the natural water on photodegradation of edc experimental results for the photodegradation of e2 and e3 in the environmental aquatic matrices were fitted following the pseudo first order kinetic model and degradation curves which are presented in fig 7 these compounds were selected for to represent the class of endocrine disruptor compounds studied in the environmental aquatic matrices an acceleration degradation of e2 and e3 was observed with 100 removal after 120 min over irradiation light in this context was observed that the natural water used in degradation has organic matter which contributes to rapid degradation of e2 and e3 in other words the photodegradation is assisted by the reaction of photosensitisers under indirect photolysis which forms due to the type and content of organic matter present in the water used in this essay thereby other aspects may also be responsible for increasing photolysis since photosensitising agents e g nitrites and other organic and inorganic chromophores may also induce photochemical reactions leading to the formation of reactive species which can cause rapid compound degradation 28 52 53 additionally based on the obtained results it is possible predict that the molecules of organic matter from patos lagoon are more bioavailable and less protected from light allowing better and more rapid degradation of edc than aqueous solutions these results are important as natural water photodegradation is predominantly attributed to the photosensitisation effect caused by oxidative species under irradiation sunlight above 340 nm likewise in the aquatic environment the presence of organic matter directly affects the absorption and degradation of contaminants considering that light attenuation exponentially decreases with increasing wavelength this is due to the absorption of light by the chromophore groups present in the dissolved organic matter which implies the reduction of the incident light available for the contaminants present in water 31 4 environmental implications although the concentration of edc employed in this study exceeded environmental levels it is justified because this study had the objective of explore and understand the photochemical behavior of some substances omnipresent in aquatic environmental thus the study of edc degradation is important since the adverse effects and toxicity of these compounds is already well established for various aquatic organisms in addition the study aims to demonstrate that photolysis technique with use of high pressure vapor lamp has low cost and can be inserted in treatment plants of water and sewage the photolysis technique could improve the current treatment system to ensure total remove edc in sewage treatment plants which is reported as one of main source of these substances into environmental system 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that e1 e2 ee2 e3 and bpa are photodegraded by direct photolysis in addition the experiment highlighted that among edcs e3 presented a higher interaction with fa with bound concentration around 0 753 mg l 1 0 0367 corresponding to 75 of it is initial concentration and e2 with 0 713 mg l 1 0 0106 representing 71 of initial concentration to nom photodegradation of edc in aqueous solution occurred under the photolysis treatment and each experiment followed first order kinetics among the compounds studied the lowest degradation was obtained for estrone and bisphenol with maximum removals of 80 14 and 63 respectively to ee2 e2 and e3 degradation was around 97 96 and 98 respectively after 120 min the experimental study carried out with nom and fa on the e1 photodegradation shows that nom had significant difference at total removal when compared to the edc studied concentration results on the photodegradation of e2 and e3 in the environmental aquatic matrices demonstrated acceleration degradation with 100 removal after 120 min over irradiation light for both compounds these results highlight that organic matter might play an important role on organic compounds photodegradation in aquatic environmental systems finally this study has shown that direct photolysis is an effective alternative for edc degradation representing a successful

14467,this study investigates the arsenic v removal capacities of composite adsorbents made of silicate flakes of zirconium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles which are then coated onto alumina tubes as an alternative method for arsenic v removal as part of the study the adsorption isotherms interference of coexisting ions stability of adsorbents and recovery of arsenic v were examined the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide reveals a quite fast adsorption through which 92 of the arsenic v was removed within 5 min the both adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide reveal good stability and removal performance at neutral ph the both adsorbents were arsenic v selective in presence of coexisting anions however the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide exhibits higher selectivity for arsenic v in presence of cations the adsorption capacities were found to be 1 2 mmol g 1 305 mg g 1 for zirconium oxide and 0 5 mmol g 1 125 mg g 1 for titanium oxide and finally 0 52 mmol g 1 129 mg g 1 for zirconium oxide in case of tube coating the test results indicate that although the both adsorbents are suitable for arsenic v removal the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide has superior properties owing to its rapid adsorption higher capacity and selectivity additionally it is demonstrated that coating alumina tubes with adsorbents could serve as an alternative method for arsenic v removal keywords arsenic v adsorption composite adsorbent metal oxide nanoparticles alumina tube coating 1 introduction arsenic occurs naturally in air water and soil in many parts of the world as a metalloid and as chemical compounds it occurs mostly with valence states of 3 0 3 arsenite and 5 arsenate however the valence states of 3 and 0 are rarely present in the nature most of arsenic compounds in aqueous environments are inorganic species as arsenite arsenic iii or arsenate arsenic v 1 in oxygen saturated water the predominating species is arsenic v 2 whereas it is arsenic acid h2aso4 and haso4 2 in natural waters at ph levels ranging from 5 to 9 3 groundwater containing considerable concentrations of arsenic and being used as drinking water causes acute and chronic symptoms in many countries especially in bangladesh china mongolia and taiwan many other parts of the world are also affected by this problem including the usa central europe argentina chile vietnam nepal and turkey 4 8 recently arsenic limit in drinking water was reduced to 10 μg l 1 by european union and world health organization because of the concerns related to the chronic toxic effect of arsenic arsenic cannot be destroyed it can only be transformed into different forms or combined with other elements for conversion into insoluble compounds currently a variety of methods have been developed for removing arsenic from drinking water including coagulation electrocoagulation and precipitation with metal hydroxides ferric salt and aluminum salt 9 12 adsorption onto metal oxides and those nanoparticles 13 15 adsorption on organic solution containing dispersed ultrafine magnetite fe3o4 16 composite resin beads containing magnetite crystals 17 aggregates of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles for improved magnetic properties 18 although most of these methods allow the removal of arsenic significantly each has some advantages and disadvantages which limit the application such as generation of solid or liquid waste sludge 9 need for ph adjustment 19 and serious inhibition in the presence of coexisting ions 20 21 on the other hand adsorption process may provide several advantages for arsenic separation from aqueous samples such as high selectivity high removal efficiency and allowing concentrating and recovery 22 efficiency of an adsorbent depends on two main factors adsorption capacity and mass transport kinetics 13 recently nanoparticles have been used commonly owing to their large surface area high reactivity and catalytic potential 23 in this context nanoparticles and their aggregations may provide a large contact area and a rapid contact for adsorption by enhancing the internal mass transport however the use of fine nanoparticles in powder or gel form is difficult because their separation from water may not be easily applied at industrial scale recently there have been significant efforts to cope with this problem through the impregnation of nanoparticles into porous materials such as resins and polymers 24 25 activated carbon 26 and bentonite 27 or through coatings onto materials in sand form 28 30 however the researches on coated ceramic supports and membranes are quite limited 31 32 in this research it was aimed to create an efficient easy to handle and arsenic v selective separation system through the combination of a layered material having a large surface area and nanoparticles of metal oxides which are likely to have selective adsorption properties for this purpose micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes and nanoparticles of zirconium oxide or titanium oxide were selected as base materials adsorption isotherms effect of ph dissolution of components and influence from coexisting ions were investigated to characterize the adsorbents developed finally as an alternative application the adsorbents were coated onto alumina support tubes and tested for the separation of arsenic v the recovery of arsenic v from the adsorbents was also studied 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical methods solutions of arsenic and other metals were prepared by diluting the commercial standard solutions

3 arsenic v were placed into tubes with stoppers and agitated by a mechanical shaker after a definite time the shaking was stopped and the contents of the tubes were filtered through a mixed cellulose ester membrane filter 0 2 μm ϕ25 mm 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm solutions with various arsenic v concentrations 15 ml were placed in tubes with stoppers and each tube was added 0 1 g of adsorbent a buffer solution of 0 01 m mes was used to stabilize the acidity of arsenic v solution at ph 6 5 sodium chloride 0 1 m was used to keep ionic strength constant the tubes were shaken till equilibrium 24 h and 48 h for the adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide respectively and then contents of the tubes were filtered through mixed cellulose ester membrane filters 0 2 μm ϕ25 mm the equilibrium ph and the amount of arsenic v in the aqueous phase were analyzed the distribution of arsenic v between solid phase and aqueous phase was explained by langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was calculated according to the langmuir isotherm equation 2 2 2 distribution coefficient kd the adsorbability was expressed as a distribution coefficient kd which was calculated by the following equation 1 k d v a w a s i a s e a s e where va denotes the volume of the aqueous phase and w is the weight of adsorbent subscripts i and e indicate the initial and equilibrium concentration of arsenic v respectively 2 2 3 cation and anion interference selectivity of the adsorbents on arsenic v were investigated by batch adsorption experiments in the presence of other ions procedure of the anion interference experiments was as follows 15 ml of initial solution containing 1 10 4 m arsenic v and salt nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 nah2po4 in a range of 1 10 5 to 1 10 1 m were placed

separation problems of nanoparticles in powder form for this purpose alumina support tubes were prepared and coated with the adsorbents 2 3 1 preparation of alumina support tube alumina support tubes having 2 mm diameter were prepared in accordance with the patented procedure 33 alumina slurry was prepared by using α alumina powder having 0 1 μm polysulfone surfactant and solvent then a cylinder hollow tube maker was used to prepare alumina tubes by coagulation tubes were kept in water for 1 h for rinsing and then sintered in oven at 1530 c for 60 min then the prepared alumina tubes with 2 mm diameter 0 1 0 15 μm pore size and around 38 porosity were used as a support material in further experiments 2 3 2 coating and calcination one end of alumina tubes were closed with polyepoxide adhesive then the tubes were dipped into the composite adsorbent solution containing zirconia silicate surfactant n dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and polyvinyl alcohol the proportion of zirconia and silicate was selected as decided in batchwise studies surfactant was added in the amount of the 10 of the total silicate and zirconia the polyvinyl alcohol was added in the amount of the 3 of the total solution furthermore the adsorbent was modified by the addition of a larger size 0 09 μm zirconia to increase the permeability for this purpose tz 8y tosoh corporation japan was used at variable percentages like 10 20 and 30 of the total zirconia the tubes were dried in room temperature and calcinated at 400 c in oxygen supplied oven to remove organics and to form voids 2 4 chromatographic separation experiments chromatographic separation experiments for arsenic v removal were carried out on a column and on coated tubes arsenic v solution at ph 6 5 was continuously fed to the column or coated tubes by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected by a fraction collector to analyze arsenic v concentrations for this purpose a column was prepared using a glass tube having 4 mm inner diameter and 0 5 g of adsorbent whose size ranged from 7 μm to 100 μm was filled between support beds in order to carry out chromatographic separation of arsenic v with the coated tubes one end of the tube was closed and the other end was attached to a glass tube with polyepoxide adhesive the tube was then placed in a larger glass tube as seen in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization adsorption properties are affected by material properties for this reason several adsorbents with varied ratios of metal oxides and micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes were prepared then the morphologies were examined by using sem to determine the layered structure and composition as seen in the surface and cross section observations of sem both the composite adsorbents containing 30 metal oxide nanoparticles of zirconium oxide or titanium oxide and the ones with 70 silicate flakes were layered material fig 2 therefore the ratios of the metal oxide nanoparticles in the composite adsorbent were decided to be 30 the surface area of the composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of tio2 was measured to be 305 m2 g 1 which is much higher than the values reported for crystalline tio2 degussa p25 in the literature 34 35 but on a similar level to the values reported for nanocrystalline tio2 35 and tio2 anatase powder hombikat uv100 34 the surface area of the composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of zro2 was measured to be 270 m2 g 1 which reveals a similar level to the mesoporous hydrous of zirconium oxide 302 hzo 36 and composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of tio2 prepared in this study in general the surface areas of the both composite adsorbents are found to be higher than the other types of adsorbents developed for as v removal such as ferrihydrite 28 fepo4 amorphous and crystalline 37 and activated alumina grains 38 higher surface areas obtained in this study may be explained with the properties of the developed composite adsorbents as an indication of functioning achieved with the ratio of leaf shaped silicate flakes and nanoparticles 3 2 properties of the adsorbents effect of shaking time and effect of ph on the prepared adsorbents were evaluated in batchwise experiments the adsorption of arsenic v increased in parallel with the increase in the shaking time and reached to the equilibrium within 24 h for the case of adsorbent containing zirconium oxide the adsorption was quite fast 92 of the arsenic v content was removed within 5 min and overall arsenic v removal was 97 on the other hand as for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide the equilibrium for arsenic v adsorption was reached within 48 h and the total arsenic v removal was 91 the effect of shaking time on the adsorption of arsenic v was illustrated in fig 3 a arsenic v adsorption was studied as a function of ph to evaluate the dependency on the ph the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide revealed an efficient adsorption for arsenic v at ph values ranging from 4 to 10 whereas the ph values from 1 to 7 were favorable for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide fig 3b the highest log kd value obtained for the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide was 4 4 at ph 6 5 eq 1 whereas the adsorbent containing titanium dioxide revealed the highest log kd value of 3 6 at ph 2 2 the log kd value of only the silicate flakes was found to be 0 04 100 of the micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes the trend of the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide indicates that the affinity of the adsorbent matches with the h2aso4 and haso4 2 species while the trend of the adsorbent containing titanium oxide indicates that the affinity of the adsorbent matches with the h3aso4 h2aso4 and haso4 2 species general adsorption mechanism of metal oxides is based on the strong bond between oh groups on the surfaces of the metal oxides with the oh group of the arsenic v species 39 in this respect the decrease of arsenic v adsorption at high ph levels may be explained with the decrease of hydroxyl groups both in the adsorbent and in the arsenic v anions stability of the adsorbents was also studied through the eluted element as a function of ph the adsorbent containing titanium oxide started to dissolve at ph levels over 10 while the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide had high dissolution of zirconium oxide at ph levels below 4 fig 4 the elution of zirconium at low log kd values at the indicated ph ranges fig 3b is consistent with this phenomenon 3 3 effect of coexisting ions on arsenic v adsorption presence of the ions can affect the removal of arsenic v depending on the selectivity of the adsorbent therefore arsenic v adsorbability was investigated in the presence of diverse anions and cations the effect of anions on arsenic v adsorption is illustrated in fig 5 a as can be seen in the figure the arsenic v adsorption was not affected in the presence of chloride and sulfate whereas it decreased in the presence of phosphate at a high concentration due to the similar properties of phosphate and arsenate the effects of coexisting diverse metal cations on arsenic v adsorption and the adsorptions of these cations are shown in fig 5b and c respectively particularly the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide was highly selective for the arsenic v in the presence of coexisting cations a slight adsorption of cobalt and nickel was also observed however their adsorption did not affect adsorption of arsenic v the arsenic v selectivity of the adsorbent containing titanium oxide was lower than that of the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide the arsenic v adsorption decreased in the presence of manganese and cobalt 3 4 alternative application separation by coated alumina tube use of nanoparticles in powder form may pose difficulty in terms of handling and applying therefore alumina tubes were fabricated and coated with the developed adsorbents as an alternative application for this purpose alumina tubes were dipped into the solution of adsorbents for outer coating furthermore the adsorbent was slightly modified by the inclusion of larger size zirconia lsz at variable ratios to increase permeability belsorp adsorption desorption data analysis was made to determine the surface area of the modified adsorbents distribution coefficients were also analyzed with batchwise experiments table 1 the results revealed that the surface area of the modified adsorbent was less than that of the adsorbent containing only nanoparticles of zirconia however the ratio of larger size zirconia did not significantly affect the surface area under the given experimental conditions furthermore there was no significant difference in the observed distribution coefficients of the modified adsorbents the sem observations of the alumina support and the tube coated with the modified adsorbent 20 of lsz are given below in the fig 6 the water permeability values of the coated alumina tubes are given in table 2 the water permeability value of the zirconium oxide adsorbent with only nanoparticles was found to be very low 0 23 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the permeability values increase along with the increase of lsz ratios as can be seen in the table however the increase was drastic in case of the adsorbent containing 30 lsz which can be attributed to the formation of large pores and easy water passage through these pores 3 5 adsorption capacity 3 5 1 adsorption capacities of adsorbents the relationship between the arsenic v concentration in the adsorbent and the arsenic v remaining in aqueous phase was evaluated by batchwise experiments the adsorption of arsenic v suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was calculated according to the langmuir isotherm equation langmuir equation 40 given below was applied to quantify the maximum arsenic v adsorption capacities of the powder adsorbents and the coated tubes 2 1 q e 1 q max 1 q max b 1 c e qe amount of arsenic adsorbed mol g 1 qmax maximum adsorption capacity mol g 1 b langmuir constant l mol 1 ce concentration of arsenic in solution mol l 1 the results indicate that the higher the arsenic v concentration in aqueous phase the closer the adsorbent to its maximum capacity which is accompanied by a slowing slope in the graph fig 7 a b the adsorption capacities were estimated with the eq 2 as follows 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent 91 4 mg g 1 adsorbent 305 mg g 1 zirconium oxide for the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide and 0 5 mmol g 1 adsorbent 37 5 mg g 1 adsorbent 125 mg g 1 titanium oxide for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide the estimated adsorption capacity of the composite adsorbent tio2 developed in this study was found to be slightly higher than the adsorbents having similar surface areas such as nanocrystalline tio2 with particle size of 6 6 nm 30 mg g 1 41 hydrous tio2 with particle size of 10 8 nm 22 33 4 mg g 1 42 and anatase modified tio2 with particle size of 10 nm hombikat uv100 22 5 mg g 1 34 in the case of the composite adsorbent zro2 the estimated adsorption capacity was higher than the amorphous zirconium oxide 50 3 mg g 1 43 mesoporous fe modified zro2 45 mg g 1 44 zirconium impregnated activated carbon 42 6 mg g 1 43 and at similar level to the porous resin loaded with crystalline hydrous zirconium oxide 1 2 mmol g 1 24 higher adsorption capacities obtained with the composite adsorbents developed in this study may be attributed to the use of nanoparticles together with leaf shaped silicate flakes adsorption capacities of the adsorbents containing larger size zirconia 10 20 30 of total zirconia were also determined with batchwise experiments similarly their arsenic v adsorptions also suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the estimated capacities of the adsorbents containing modified zro2 nanoparticles decreased almost to the half of the capacity of the adsorbent containing only nanoparticles of zro2 on the other hand the results indicated that the ratio of zirconia particles under the given conditions did not make a significant effect on the adsorption of arsenic v in powder form the estimated adsorption capacities were found to be very similar which were 0 50 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 10 lsz 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 20 lsz and 0 49 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 30 lsz fig 7b 3 6 chromatographic separation of arsenic v 3 6 1 column separation chromatographic separation of arsenic v was studied on the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide which was more selective and efficient in arsenic v separation compared to the adsorbent containing titanium oxide under the given conditions initial solution containing 1 10 3 m of arsenic v was continuously fed to the column then leachates were collected and arsenic v concentrations were analyzed breakthrough curve is illustrated in fig 8 the total amount of adsorbed arsenic v was 0 6 mmol and the capacity was calculated to be 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent 305 mg g 1 zirconium oxide which is consistent with the value obtained from the batchwise adsorption experiment 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent the breakthrough point of 5 height was calculated to be 350 ml and the breakthrough capacity was estimated to be 0 9 mmol g 1 adsorbent 3 6 2 separation with the coated alumina tube chromatographic separation of arsenic v was carried out only on the alumina tubes coated with the adsorbents containing 20 and 30 lsz skipping the adsorbent with 10 lsz due to its insignificant permeability increase for this purpose initial solution containing 1 10 5 m of arsenic v was continuously fed to the coated tubes and permeate was collected and analyzed for arsenic v concentration breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 9 in the case of the 20 lsz coated tube the total amount of adsorbed arsenic v was found to be 4 4 10 3 mmol and adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent 129 mg g 1 zirconium oxide which was consistent with the value obtained from the batchwise experiment 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent the estimated adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 61 mg g 1 for the tube breakthrough point was derived to be 79 ml and breakthrough capacity was estimated to be 0 11 mmol g 1 adsorbent although the adsorption capacity of the coated tube was lower than the values obtained for the adsorbent in powder form it was still higher than the values reported in the literature for coated materials for example the adsorption capacity of iron oxide coated sand is reported to be 0 0183 mg g 1 28 and 0 012 mg g 1 30 in the literature in the case of the 30 lsz coated tube the total amount of adsorbed as v was 7 5 10 4 mmol and the adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 05 mmol g 1adsorbent which is significantly lower than the value of 0 49 mmol g 1 adsorbent obtained for its powder form the low adsorption capacity can be attributed to the formation of some large pores that prevent the feed water from passing easily through all the pores which is consistent with the very high permeability value obtained for the tube coated with 30 lsz breakthrough capacity of the tube coated with 30 lsz could not be calculated because of the very rapid increase in the arsenic v concentration of the permeate as can be seen in the fig 9b adsorption capacities obtained by batchwise and continuous separation tests for the developed adsorbents and coated tubes are summarized in table 3 along with the values reported about similar materials and applications in the literature 3 7 recovery of arsenic v at the end of the adsorption tests arsenic v recovery was studied with batchwise and continuous experiments desorption with strong acid was not preferred due to the dissolution of zirconium oxide at ph levels below 4 for this reason alkaline solutions at different concentrations were tested for the desorption of arsenic v the recovery ratio of arsenic v and dissolution of zirconium is presented in table 4 as can be seen in the results there was no significant difference in the recovery efficiency at low concentrations of naoh in batchwise experiments the highest recovery 90 was attained with the 5 m naoh while some of the zirconia dissolved continuous desorption of arsenic v was also studied on the column and coated tube by using the 5 m naoh in which the highest recovery was attained firstly 10 ml of naoh was fed to the system and left overnight and then the eluent was continuously fed to the column as a result the total amount of the recovered arsenic v was 0 32 mmol while the amount loaded onto the adsorbent was 0 6 mmol in the case of arsenic v recovery from the column the efficiency of arsenic v recovery was estimated to be about 52 fig 10 which was much lower than that attained in the batchwise experiment with the same eluent it is estimated that strong bindings during chromatographic adsorption may have effect on this phenomenon in the case of arsenic v recovery from the coated tubes the tube was dipped and kept for 24 h in 30 ml 5 m naoh before the efficiency of recovery was calculated the calculation revealed that the total amount of recovered arsenic v was 3 57 10 3 mmol while the loaded amount was 4 4 10 3 indicating a recovery efficiency of 81 4 conclusion in this study composite adsorbents based on zirconium oxide or titanium oxide nanoparticles and silicate flakes were prepared and tested for arsenic v removal in addition for easy use of nanoparticles the prepared adsorbents were coated onto alumina tubes and tested for arsenic v removal as an alternative method both of the composite adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles exhibited high selectivity for arsenic v a wide working range of ph and a good stability at neutral ph the adsorption of arsenic v suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide revealed a very fast adsorbtion where 92 of arsenic v was removed within 5 min and the overall arsenic v removal was 97 the adsorption capacities were 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent and 0 5 mmol g 1 adsorbent for zirconium oxide and titanium oxide containing composite adsorbents respectively the adsorption capacity of the coated alumina tube was 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent 0 6 mg g 1 tube which was compatible with the capacity of its powder form using alkaline eluent 90 of the as v was recovered in powder form in the batchwise test on the other hand 52 of as v was recovered in the column by chromatographic separation while 81 of the as v was recovered with the coated alumina tubes by chromatographic separation the results demonstrate that both of the composite adsorbents developed in this study have high surface areas comparable capacities easy handling properties and high arsenic v selectivities and may be applicable for the separation of arsenic v from aqueous samples furthermore the adsorbent coated alumina tubes may also have a potential as an alternative application in future acknowledgements this study was financially supported by japanese international cooperation agency jica and carried out in

14467,this study investigates the arsenic v removal capacities of composite adsorbents made of silicate flakes of zirconium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles which are then coated onto alumina tubes as an alternative method for arsenic v removal as part of the study the adsorption isotherms interference of coexisting ions stability of adsorbents and recovery of arsenic v were examined the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide reveals a quite fast adsorption through which 92 of the arsenic v was removed within 5 min the both adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide reveal good stability and removal performance at neutral ph the both adsorbents were arsenic v selective in presence of coexisting anions however the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide exhibits higher selectivity for arsenic v in presence of cations the adsorption capacities were found to be 1 2 mmol g 1 305 mg g 1 for zirconium oxide and 0 5 mmol g 1 125 mg g 1 for titanium oxide and finally 0 52 mmol g 1 129 mg g 1 for zirconium oxide in case of tube coating the test results indicate that although the both adsorbents are suitable for arsenic v removal the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide has superior properties owing to its rapid adsorption higher capacity and selectivity additionally it is demonstrated that coating alumina tubes with adsorbents could serve as an alternative method for arsenic v removal keywords arsenic v adsorption composite adsorbent metal oxide nanoparticles alumina tube coating 1 introduction arsenic occurs naturally in air water and soil in many parts of the world as a metalloid and as chemical compounds it occurs mostly with valence states of 3 0 3 arsenite and 5 arsenate however the valence states of 3 and 0 are rarely present in the nature most of arsenic compounds in aqueous environments are inorganic species as arsenite arsenic iii or arsenate arsenic v 1 in oxygen saturated water the predominating species is arsenic v 2 whereas it is arsenic acid h2aso4 and haso4 2 in natural waters at ph levels ranging from 5 to 9 3 groundwater containing considerable concentrations of arsenic and being used as drinking water causes acute and chronic symptoms in many countries especially in bangladesh china mongolia and taiwan many other parts of the world are also affected by this problem including the usa central europe argentina chile vietnam nepal and turkey 4 8 recently arsenic limit in drinking water was reduced to 10 μg l 1 by european union and world health organization because of the concerns related to the chronic toxic effect of arsenic arsenic cannot be destroyed it can only be transformed into different forms or combined with other elements for conversion into insoluble compounds currently a variety of methods have been developed for removing arsenic from drinking water including coagulation electrocoagulation and precipitation with metal hydroxides ferric salt and aluminum salt 9 12 adsorption onto metal oxides and those nanoparticles 13 15 adsorption on organic solution containing dispersed ultrafine magnetite fe3o4 16 composite resin beads containing magnetite crystals 17 aggregates of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles for improved magnetic properties 18 although most of these methods allow the removal of arsenic significantly each has some advantages and disadvantages which limit the application such as generation of solid or liquid waste sludge 9 need for ph adjustment 19 and serious inhibition in the presence of coexisting ions 20 21 on the other hand adsorption process may provide several advantages for arsenic separation from aqueous samples such as high selectivity high removal efficiency and allowing concentrating and recovery 22 efficiency of an adsorbent depends on two main factors adsorption capacity and mass transport kinetics 13 recently nanoparticles have been used commonly owing to their large surface area high reactivity and catalytic potential 23 in this context nanoparticles and their aggregations may provide a large contact area and a rapid contact for adsorption by enhancing the internal mass transport however the use of fine nanoparticles in powder or gel form is difficult because their separation from water may not be easily applied at industrial scale recently there have been significant efforts to cope with this problem through the impregnation of nanoparticles into porous materials such as resins and polymers 24 25 activated carbon 26 and bentonite 27 or through coatings onto materials in sand form 28 30 however the researches on coated ceramic supports and membranes are quite limited 31 32 in this research it was aimed to create an efficient easy to handle and arsenic v selective separation system through the combination of a layered material having a large surface area and nanoparticles of metal oxides which are likely to have selective adsorption properties for this purpose micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes and nanoparticles of zirconium oxide or titanium oxide were selected as base materials adsorption isotherms effect of ph dissolution of components and influence from coexisting ions were investigated to characterize the adsorbents developed finally as an alternative application the adsorbents were coated onto alumina support tubes and tested for the separation of arsenic v the recovery of arsenic v from the adsorbents was also studied 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical methods solutions of arsenic and other metals were prepared by diluting the commercial standard solutions

particle size or dispersion of titanium oxide tks 203 tayca japan having 6 nm crystal size the solutions were dried at 90 c afterwards they were grinded and sieved through 100 μm filter morphologies of the adsorbents were observed by a japanese hitachi s 800 scanning electron microscope sem surface areas of the adsorbents were measured by belsorp max bel japan inc arsenic v concentrations were measured by an icp optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes seiko sps 1500r 2 2 batchwise adsorption experiments the 15 ml aqueous buffered solutions containing 0 1 g adsorbent and 1 10 4 m m mol dm 3 arsenic v were placed into tubes with stoppers and agitated by a mechanical shaker after a definite time the shaking was stopped and the contents of the tubes were filtered through a mixed cellulose ester membrane filter 0 2 μm ϕ25 mm 2 2 1 adsorption isotherm solutions with various arsenic v concentrations 15 ml were placed in tubes with stoppers and each tube was added 0 1 g of adsorbent a buffer solution of 0 01 m mes was used to stabilize the acidity of arsenic v solution at ph 6 5 sodium chloride 0 1 m was used to keep ionic strength constant the tubes were shaken till equilibrium 24 h and 48 h for the adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide respectively and then contents of the tubes were filtered through mixed cellulose ester membrane filters 0 2 μm ϕ25 mm the equilibrium ph and the amount of arsenic v in the aqueous phase were analyzed the distribution of arsenic v between solid phase and aqueous phase was explained by langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was calculated according to the langmuir isotherm equation 2 2 2 distribution coefficient kd the adsorbability was expressed as a distribution coefficient kd which was calculated by the following equation 1 k d v a w a s i a s e a s e where va denotes the volume of the aqueous phase and w is the weight of adsorbent subscripts i and e indicate the initial and equilibrium concentration of arsenic v respectively 2 2 3 cation and anion interference selectivity of the adsorbents on arsenic v were investigated by batch adsorption experiments in the presence of other ions procedure of the anion interference experiments was as follows 15 ml of initial solution containing 1 10 4 m arsenic v and salt nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 nah2po4 in a range of 1 10 5 to 1 10 1 m were placed in tubes which contained 0 1 g adsorbent the ph value was kept at 6 5 for chloride and sulfate anions and at 7 0 for phosphate anion by using buffers procedure of the cation interference experiments was as follows cations ba ii ca ii co ii cu ii mg ii mn ii ni ii la iii and zn ii of 1 10 4 m were added in 1 10 4 m arsenic v initial solution 15 ml of solution was placed in a tube with 0 1 g adsorbent the ph was kept at 5 0 by acetate buffer the tubes were shaken till equilibrium and then filtered finally arsenic v concentrations and coexisting metal concentration in the aqueous solutions were measured 2 3 preparation of alumina support tubes and their coating by adsorbent in this study the developed composite adsorbent was coated onto an alumina tube as an alternative to cope with the separation problems of nanoparticles in powder form for this purpose alumina support tubes were prepared and coated with the adsorbents 2 3 1 preparation of alumina support tube alumina support tubes having 2 mm diameter were prepared in accordance with the patented procedure 33 alumina slurry was prepared by using α alumina powder having 0 1 μm polysulfone surfactant and solvent then a cylinder hollow tube maker was used to prepare alumina tubes by coagulation tubes were kept in water for 1 h for rinsing and then sintered in oven at 1530 c for 60 min then the prepared alumina tubes with 2 mm diameter 0 1 0 15 μm pore size and around 38 porosity were used as a support material in further experiments 2 3 2 coating and calcination one end of alumina tubes were closed with polyepoxide adhesive then the tubes were dipped into the composite adsorbent solution containing zirconia silicate surfactant n dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and polyvinyl alcohol the proportion of zirconia and silicate was selected as decided in batchwise studies surfactant was added in the amount of the 10 of the total silicate and zirconia the polyvinyl alcohol was added in the amount of the 3 of the total solution furthermore the adsorbent was modified by the addition of a larger size 0 09 μm zirconia to increase the permeability for this purpose tz 8y tosoh corporation japan was used at variable percentages like 10 20 and 30 of the total zirconia the tubes were dried in room temperature and calcinated at 400 c in oxygen supplied oven to remove organics and to form voids 2 4 chromatographic separation experiments chromatographic separation experiments for arsenic v removal were carried out on a column and on coated tubes arsenic v solution at ph 6 5 was continuously fed to the column or coated tubes by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected by a fraction collector to analyze arsenic v concentrations for this purpose a column was prepared using a glass tube having 4 mm inner diameter and 0 5 g of adsorbent whose size ranged from 7 μm to 100 μm was filled between support beds in order to carry out chromatographic separation of arsenic v with the coated tubes one end of the tube was closed and the other end was attached to a glass tube with polyepoxide adhesive the tube was then placed in a larger glass tube as seen in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization adsorption properties are affected by material properties for this reason several adsorbents with varied ratios of metal oxides and micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes were prepared then the morphologies were examined by using sem to determine the layered structure and composition as seen in the surface and cross section observations of sem both the composite adsorbents containing 30 metal oxide nanoparticles of zirconium oxide or titanium oxide and the ones with 70 silicate flakes were layered material fig 2 therefore the ratios of the metal oxide nanoparticles in the composite adsorbent were decided to be 30 the surface area of the composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of tio2 was measured to be 305 m2 g 1 which is much higher than the values reported for crystalline tio2 degussa p25 in the literature 34 35 but on a similar level to the values reported for nanocrystalline tio2 35 and tio2 anatase powder hombikat uv100 34 the surface area of the composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of zro2 was measured to be 270 m2 g 1 which reveals a similar level to the mesoporous hydrous of zirconium oxide 302 hzo 36 and composite adsorbent of nanoparticles of tio2 prepared in this study in general the surface areas of the both composite adsorbents are found to be higher than the other types of adsorbents developed for as v removal such as ferrihydrite 28 fepo4 amorphous and crystalline 37 and activated alumina grains 38 higher surface areas obtained in this study may be explained with the properties of the developed composite adsorbents as an indication of functioning achieved with the ratio of leaf shaped silicate flakes and nanoparticles 3 2 properties of the adsorbents effect of shaking time and effect of ph on the prepared adsorbents were evaluated in batchwise experiments the adsorption of arsenic v increased in parallel with the increase in the shaking time and reached to the equilibrium within 24 h for the case of adsorbent containing zirconium oxide the adsorption was quite fast 92 of the arsenic v content was removed within 5 min and overall arsenic v removal was 97 on the other hand as for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide the equilibrium for arsenic v adsorption was reached within 48 h and the total arsenic v removal was 91 the effect of shaking time on the adsorption of arsenic v was illustrated in fig 3 a arsenic v adsorption was studied as a function of ph to evaluate the dependency on the ph the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide revealed an efficient adsorption for arsenic v at ph values ranging from 4 to 10 whereas the ph values from 1 to 7 were favorable for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide fig 3b the highest log kd value obtained for the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide was 4 4 at ph 6 5 eq 1 whereas the adsorbent containing titanium dioxide revealed the highest log kd value of 3 6 at ph 2 2 the log kd value of only the silicate flakes was found to be 0 04 100 of the micrometer size leaf shaped silicate flakes the trend of the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide indicates that the affinity of the adsorbent matches with the h2aso4 and haso4 2 species while the trend of the adsorbent containing titanium oxide indicates that the affinity of the adsorbent matches with the h3aso4 h2aso4 and haso4 2 species general adsorption mechanism of metal oxides is based on the strong bond between oh groups on the surfaces of the metal oxides with the oh group of the arsenic v species 39 in this respect the decrease of arsenic v adsorption at high ph levels may be explained with the decrease of hydroxyl groups both in the adsorbent and in the arsenic v anions stability of the adsorbents was also studied through the eluted element as a function of ph the adsorbent containing titanium oxide started to dissolve at ph levels over 10 while the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide had high dissolution of zirconium oxide at ph levels below 4 fig 4 the elution of zirconium at low log kd values at the indicated ph ranges fig 3b is consistent with this phenomenon 3 3 effect of coexisting ions on arsenic v adsorption presence of the ions can affect the removal of arsenic v depending on the selectivity of the adsorbent therefore arsenic v adsorbability was investigated in the presence of diverse anions and cations the effect of anions on arsenic v adsorption is illustrated in fig 5 a as can be seen in the figure the arsenic v adsorption was not affected in the presence of chloride and sulfate whereas it decreased in the presence of phosphate at a high concentration due to the similar properties of phosphate and arsenate the effects of coexisting diverse metal cations on arsenic v adsorption and the adsorptions of these cations are shown in fig 5b and c respectively particularly the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide was highly selective for the arsenic v in the presence of coexisting cations a slight adsorption of cobalt and nickel was also observed however their adsorption did not affect adsorption of arsenic v the arsenic v selectivity of the adsorbent containing titanium oxide was lower than that of the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide the arsenic v adsorption decreased in the presence of manganese and cobalt 3 4 alternative application separation by coated alumina tube use of nanoparticles in powder form may pose difficulty in terms of handling and applying therefore alumina tubes were fabricated and coated with the developed adsorbents as an alternative application for this purpose alumina tubes were dipped into the solution of adsorbents for outer coating furthermore the adsorbent was slightly modified by the inclusion of larger size zirconia lsz at variable ratios to increase permeability belsorp adsorption desorption data analysis was made to determine the surface area of the modified adsorbents distribution coefficients were also analyzed with batchwise experiments table 1 the results revealed that the surface area of the modified adsorbent was less than that of the adsorbent containing only nanoparticles of zirconia however the ratio of larger size zirconia did not significantly affect the surface area under the given experimental conditions furthermore there was no significant difference in the observed distribution coefficients of the modified adsorbents the sem observations of the alumina support and the tube coated with the modified adsorbent 20 of lsz are given below in the fig 6 the water permeability values of the coated alumina tubes are given in table 2 the water permeability value of the zirconium oxide adsorbent with only nanoparticles was found to be very low 0 23 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the permeability values increase along with the increase of lsz ratios as can be seen in the table however the increase was drastic in case of the adsorbent containing 30 lsz which can be attributed to the formation of large pores and easy water passage through these pores 3 5 adsorption capacity 3 5 1 adsorption capacities of adsorbents the relationship between the arsenic v concentration in the adsorbent and the arsenic v remaining in aqueous phase was evaluated by batchwise experiments the adsorption of arsenic v suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was calculated according to the langmuir isotherm equation langmuir equation 40 given below was applied to quantify the maximum arsenic v adsorption capacities of the powder adsorbents and the coated tubes 2 1 q e 1 q max 1 q max b 1 c e qe amount of arsenic adsorbed mol g 1 qmax maximum adsorption capacity mol g 1 b langmuir constant l mol 1 ce concentration of arsenic in solution mol l 1 the results indicate that the higher the arsenic v concentration in aqueous phase the closer the adsorbent to its maximum capacity which is accompanied by a slowing slope in the graph fig 7 a b the adsorption capacities were estimated with the eq 2 as follows 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent 91 4 mg g 1 adsorbent 305 mg g 1 zirconium oxide for the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide and 0 5 mmol g 1 adsorbent 37 5 mg g 1 adsorbent 125 mg g 1 titanium oxide for the adsorbent containing titanium oxide the estimated adsorption capacity of the composite adsorbent tio2 developed in this study was found to be slightly higher than the adsorbents having similar surface areas such as nanocrystalline tio2 with particle size of 6 6 nm 30 mg g 1 41 hydrous tio2 with particle size of 10 8 nm 22 33 4 mg g 1 42 and anatase modified tio2 with particle size of 10 nm hombikat uv100 22 5 mg g 1 34 in the case of the composite adsorbent zro2 the estimated adsorption capacity was higher than the amorphous zirconium oxide 50 3 mg g 1 43 mesoporous fe modified zro2 45 mg g 1 44 zirconium impregnated activated carbon 42 6 mg g 1 43 and at similar level to the porous resin loaded with crystalline hydrous zirconium oxide 1 2 mmol g 1 24 higher adsorption capacities obtained with the composite adsorbents developed in this study may be attributed to the use of nanoparticles together with leaf shaped silicate flakes adsorption capacities of the adsorbents containing larger size zirconia 10 20 30 of total zirconia were also determined with batchwise experiments similarly their arsenic v adsorptions also suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the estimated capacities of the adsorbents containing modified zro2 nanoparticles decreased almost to the half of the capacity of the adsorbent containing only nanoparticles of zro2 on the other hand the results indicated that the ratio of zirconia particles under the given conditions did not make a significant effect on the adsorption of arsenic v in powder form the estimated adsorption capacities were found to be very similar which were 0 50 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 10 lsz 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 20 lsz and 0 49 mmol g 1 adsorbent for the adsorbent containing 30 lsz fig 7b 3 6 chromatographic separation of arsenic v 3 6 1 column separation chromatographic separation of arsenic v was studied on the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide which was more selective and efficient in arsenic v separation compared to the adsorbent containing titanium oxide under the given conditions initial solution containing 1 10 3 m of arsenic v was continuously fed to the column then leachates were collected and arsenic v concentrations were analyzed breakthrough curve is illustrated in fig 8 the total amount of adsorbed arsenic v was 0 6 mmol and the capacity was calculated to be 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent 305 mg g 1 zirconium oxide which is consistent with the value obtained from the batchwise adsorption experiment 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent the breakthrough point of 5 height was calculated to be 350 ml and the breakthrough capacity was estimated to be 0 9 mmol g 1 adsorbent 3 6 2 separation with the coated alumina tube chromatographic separation of arsenic v was carried out only on the alumina tubes coated with the adsorbents containing 20 and 30 lsz skipping the adsorbent with 10 lsz due to its insignificant permeability increase for this purpose initial solution containing 1 10 5 m of arsenic v was continuously fed to the coated tubes and permeate was collected and analyzed for arsenic v concentration breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 9 in the case of the 20 lsz coated tube the total amount of adsorbed arsenic v was found to be 4 4 10 3 mmol and adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent 129 mg g 1 zirconium oxide which was consistent with the value obtained from the batchwise experiment 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent the estimated adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 61 mg g 1 for the tube breakthrough point was derived to be 79 ml and breakthrough capacity was estimated to be 0 11 mmol g 1 adsorbent although the adsorption capacity of the coated tube was lower than the values obtained for the adsorbent in powder form it was still higher than the values reported in the literature for coated materials for example the adsorption capacity of iron oxide coated sand is reported to be 0 0183 mg g 1 28 and 0 012 mg g 1 30 in the literature in the case of the 30 lsz coated tube the total amount of adsorbed as v was 7 5 10 4 mmol and the adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0 05 mmol g 1adsorbent which is significantly lower than the value of 0 49 mmol g 1 adsorbent obtained for its powder form the low adsorption capacity can be attributed to the formation of some large pores that prevent the feed water from passing easily through all the pores which is consistent with the very high permeability value obtained for the tube coated with 30 lsz breakthrough capacity of the tube coated with 30 lsz could not be calculated because of the very rapid increase in the arsenic v concentration of the permeate as can be seen in the fig 9b adsorption capacities obtained by batchwise and continuous separation tests for the developed adsorbents and coated tubes are summarized in table 3 along with the values reported about similar materials and applications in the literature 3 7 recovery of arsenic v at the end of the adsorption tests arsenic v recovery was studied with batchwise and continuous experiments desorption with strong acid was not preferred due to the dissolution of zirconium oxide at ph levels below 4 for this reason alkaline solutions at different concentrations were tested for the desorption of arsenic v the recovery ratio of arsenic v and dissolution of zirconium is presented in table 4 as can be seen in the results there was no significant difference in the recovery efficiency at low concentrations of naoh in batchwise experiments the highest recovery 90 was attained with the 5 m naoh while some of the zirconia dissolved continuous desorption of arsenic v was also studied on the column and coated tube by using the 5 m naoh in which the highest recovery was attained firstly 10 ml of naoh was fed to the system and left overnight and then the eluent was continuously fed to the column as a result the total amount of the recovered arsenic v was 0 32 mmol while the amount loaded onto the adsorbent was 0 6 mmol in the case of arsenic v recovery from the column the efficiency of arsenic v recovery was estimated to be about 52 fig 10 which was much lower than that attained in the batchwise experiment with the same eluent it is estimated that strong bindings during chromatographic adsorption may have effect on this phenomenon in the case of arsenic v recovery from the coated tubes the tube was dipped and kept for 24 h in 30 ml 5 m naoh before the efficiency of recovery was calculated the calculation revealed that the total amount of recovered arsenic v was 3 57 10 3 mmol while the loaded amount was 4 4 10 3 indicating a recovery efficiency of 81 4 conclusion in this study composite adsorbents based on zirconium oxide or titanium oxide nanoparticles and silicate flakes were prepared and tested for arsenic v removal in addition for easy use of nanoparticles the prepared adsorbents were coated onto alumina tubes and tested for arsenic v removal as an alternative method both of the composite adsorbents containing zirconium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles exhibited high selectivity for arsenic v a wide working range of ph and a good stability at neutral ph the adsorption of arsenic v suited well with the langmuir isotherm model the adsorbent containing zirconium oxide revealed a very fast adsorbtion where 92 of arsenic v was removed within 5 min and the overall arsenic v removal was 97 the adsorption capacities were 1 2 mmol g 1 adsorbent and 0 5 mmol g 1 adsorbent for zirconium oxide and titanium oxide containing composite adsorbents respectively the adsorption capacity of the coated alumina tube was 0 52 mmol g 1 adsorbent 0 6 mg g 1 tube which was compatible with the capacity of its powder form using alkaline eluent 90 of the as v was recovered in powder form in the batchwise test on the other hand 52 of as v was recovered in the column by chromatographic separation while 81 of the as v was recovered with the coated alumina tubes by chromatographic separation the results demonstrate that both of the composite adsorbents developed in this study have high surface areas comparable capacities easy handling properties and high arsenic v selectivities and may be applicable for the separation of arsenic v from aqueous samples furthermore the adsorbent coated alumina tubes may also have a potential as an alternative application in future acknowledgements this study was financially supported by japanese international cooperation agency jica and carried out in

14468,it is well known that natural organic matter nom is the major precursor of disinfection by products dbps when inadequately removed nom reacts with the disinfectant during chlorination and chloramination special interest in the dbp precursors is justified as it is essential to understand the reactivity and character of the precursors responsible for the formation of dbps this is vital in order to develop processes that will enhance precursor removal during drinking water treatment the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the characteristics of nom within an oligotrophic water source on the formation of trihalomethanes thms during drinking water treatment at rand water specific ultraviolet absorbance suva and molecular size distribution msd were the main nom characterisation techniques utilised during this study the msd was investigated by making use of high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec the msd results showed a significant correlation between the high molecular weight hmw fraction of nom and tthm formation specifically during the summer months the positive correlation existing between suva and full scale nom removal indicates that suva can be used to indicate nom treatability during water treatment a link between chloroform formation and the hmw fraction of nom was also observed however the formation of bromodichloromethane bdcm was not due to the hwm fraction as indicated by a weak regression coefficient the results displayed are an indication that the aromatic fraction of nom was the main precursor to tthm formation more prominently during summer keywords disinfection by products molecular size distribution natural organic matter uv254 1 introduction since the discovery of disinfection by products dbps in the early 1970s it is well known that natural organic matter nom is the major precursor to dbp formation when residual nom reacts with the disinfectant during chlorination and chloramination 1 hence the aim of many organic matter studies is to reduce dbp formation without compromising final drinking water quality and public health rand water the largest bulk water utility in south africa operates various conventional water treatment plants wtps where the treatment train utilises chlorination and chloramination as the disinfection step over the years chlorine has been proven successful in controlling microbiological growth and maintaining a chlorine residual throughout the distribution system the two main groups of halogenated dbps in chlorinated water of concern are haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes 2 with the trihalomethanes thms individually regulated in south africa according to the south african national standard sans for drinking water 3 four thms are formed as a result of chlorination in the presence of organic matter namely tribromomethane bromoform trichloromethane chloroform bromodichloromethane bdcm and dibromochloromethane dbcm the sum of the concentrations of these thms is known as total trihalomethane tthm according to the world health organization 4 and the south african national standard 3 the maximum allowable concentration for individual thms in drinking water is 100 μg l for bromoform 300 μg l for chloroform 100 μg l for dibromochloromethane dbcm and 60 μg l for bromodichloromethane bdcm not only do surface water sources throughout various geographical areas differ from each other in relation to colour ultraviolet uv absorbance and polarity 5 but more importantly the structure and molecular size distribution msd of natural organic matter varies greatly 6 the composition of organic matter influences nom removal efficiency and the different fractions of nom affect its reactivity to form dbps 7 8 the character composition of nom influences its treatability while the uv absorbing fractions of organic matter are often the main contributors to the formation of dbps 9 although nom is often recognised as the main dbp precursor nom is a complex mixture of heterogeneous organic compounds that vary in size structure and functionality more importantly the molecular weight of nom is associated with thm formation 10 nom characterisation techniques are imperative as it provides information on the reactivity of the individual nom fractions during the various water treatment processes and indicates the change in nom character during treatment 6 7 characterisation of nom using high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec entails the separation of humic substances based on their molecular size by eluting molecules that are bigger than the gel pores first and eluting the smaller molecules last 6 11 the size of molecular compounds is often associated with the formation and type of dbps forming during chlorination and chloramination 10 12 13 the use of headspace gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd for thm analysis is preferred over both liquid liquid extraction and purge and trap analysis due to its ease of automation and sensitivity 14 15 in this study thm formation was used as an indicator of dbp formation potential due to the observation that thms occur in high concentration levels thus being the dbp predominantly formed during chlorination chloramination 2 16 and due to the fact that thms are currently the only dbp regulated in terms of the sans 241 drinking water specification the objective of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of different molecular weight fractions of nom on the formation and speciation of thms after chlorination and chloramination in the wtp 2 methods 2 1 drinking water process train and sample collection at rand water the treatment steps consist of screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation carbonation filtration followed by primary chlorination and secondary disinfection by addition of ammonia chloramination a chlorine dosage ranging between 3 and 4 mg l is applied at primary disinfection free chlorine residuals were measured during disinfection at the primary and secondary disinfection stages surface water from the vaal dam was sampled at the intake of the full scale water treatment plant the water downstream of each of the treatment processes as well as within the wtp process flow system was sampled at the sampling points as indicated in fig 1 after sampling at the selected sampling points the samples were transported to the laboratory in a cooler box with ice packs and the samples were refrigerated at 4 c until analysed to measure the thms present at the time of sampling the residual chlorine of the treated water was reduced by adding ascorbic acid to the sample bottles surface and treated water samples were collected during a 12 month study period with a time interval of 14 days between each sampling run 2 2 raw water characterisation and total organic content samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and the bulk nom within the surface water was analysed by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc and ultraviolet absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm uv254 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva that is the ratio of uv254 to doc concentration was calculated for raw water to indicate its aromaticity the suva value gives an indication of the composition of nom within a sample with regard to its hydrophilicity molecular weight and aromaticity 17 the high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec method was followed to determine the msd distribution of the molecular weight fractions of nom within the water samples 6 the msd was measured in all the samples collected during autumn winter spring and summer a hewlett packard 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system was used to analyse the samples by separating the molecular fractions on a tsk g3000sw column 7 5 mm x 300 mm at a flow rate of 0 65 ml min and an injection volume of 20 μl the mobile phase was 0 01 m sodium acetate and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 using acetic acid calibration of the tsk g3000sw column was performed using a standard protein mix containing 4 proteins thyroglobulin bovine gamma globulin ovalbumin ribonuclease a with molecular weights ranging between 15 600 kda and a low molecular weight marker p aminobenzoic acid 137 da the peak area of each fraction was measured with uv detection set to 254 nm and expressed as milli absorbance units mau 2 3 trihalomethane analysis water samples for thm analysis were collected downstream of the treatment processes that is immediately post chlorination at the primary disinfection plant as well as of the flow passing between the chlorination and chloramination stages and immediately post chloramination at the secondary disinfection plant as indicated by sampling points d e and f respectively in fig 1 a headspace sampler agilent 7697 a coupled to a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n was used to analyse the water samples collected after the final water treatment stage namely disinfection the thms in the samples were separated using a capillary gas chromatography column followed by detection using an electron capture detector

the gc ecd running conditions indicated in table 1 using internal standard calibration 1 2 dibromoethane to ensure reliable and repeatable results the method detection limits were as follows bromoform 0 36 μg l chloroform 0 21 μg l dbcm 0 33 μg l and bdcm 0 27 μg l 2 4 data availability the authors confirm that all relevant data are included in the paper and or its supplementary information files 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw water characterisation according to table 2 the source water had an aromatic content of 24 3 m 1 measured by uv254 mean doc of 5 7 mg l suva value of 4 1 l mg m and a medium colour 89 6 cu each of the hpsec peaks represents a nom fraction according to the time minutes the fraction was eluted and the peak formed generally six peaks i ii iii iv v and vi were eluted with peaks i and ii representing high molecular weight hmw nom peaks iii and iv the intermediate molecular weight imw nom and low molecular weight lmw nom being represented by peaks v and vi 6 18 previous studies investigating the effect of nom on thm formation suggest that the hmw nom fraction is characterised by a molecular weight that is 3 kda and the lmw nom fraction is characterised by a molecular weight 1 kda 10 12 fig 2 indicates typical hpsec chromatograms of the source and final treated water samples with the peak heights being the uv absorbance response from the detector the average peak heights from the msd evaluation of the water samples after each treatment step are indicated in fig 3 typical removals of the nom fractions are indicated by the change in msd during full scale treatment as shown in fig 3 the hmw components of nom were more readily removed this is indicated by a greater reduction of peaks i and ii as compared to peak vi lmw nom fraction it is evident from a comparative analysis of the source water sample and the water samples obtained after the secondary disinfection stage see fig 3 that the quantity of the lmw components of nom was found to remain constant during treatment this is indicated by similar peak heights peaks iv v and vi that were recorded in all samples data from the hpsec analysis indicating peak heights and the percentage of the total area of each fraction is presented in table 3 in vaal dam source water samples table 3 fig 3 peaks i and ii were on average 22 5 and 26 7 respectively of the total area of nom fractions in source water table 3 when comparing the percentage distribution of the individual fractions of the source water to the treated water after secondary disinfection it is evident that peaks i and ii hmw nom were mainly reduced by the wtp table 3 the distribution of the molecular sizes observed in this study is comparable to those of other studies where it was also shown that the higher molecular weight fractions of nom 3 kda and coloured fractions tend to be selectively removed by the coagulation process 9 11 18 the selective removal of the higher molecular weight fractions of nom has also been confirmed in other studies indicating that lmw fractions are not being removed by coagulation 11 the percentage of each fraction removed after the various treatment steps was calculated using the peak heights given in table 3 and the subsequent percentage of each fraction remaining after treatment sedimentation and filtration is illustrated in fig 4 the percentage hmw nom peaks i and ii remaining in the water after sedimentation filtration was observed to be on average 63 1 and 67 8 during the study period fig 4 it can be concluded that only a selective percentage of the high molecular weight humic acid fractions is removed by the treatment processes in this water treatment plant a further decrease is also observed in peaks i to iii hmw and imw nom post disinfection as compared to peaks iv to vi fig 4 this additional reduction of hmw nom was observed post chlorination indicating the reactivity of hmw nom with chlorine the seasonal variability of the msd of nom in the source water is presented in fig 5 indicating a slight variation in msd data over the four seasons such a variation in the composition of nom in the surface water during the different seasons is not surprising and has been reported in other studies 19 20 a decrease in nom was observed during the summer months which is indicated by a decline in the height of the various peaks peaks i to vi fig 5 molecular weight distributions of nom are affected by seasonal changes and a similar seasonal molecular weight distribution was observed in source water analysed by other researchers 11 21 to this end an increase in the total organic content towards the winter months and lowest levels of the fractions during the summer months was recorded 11 21 according to fig 5 it is evident that as summer approaches a decrease in the lmw fractions peaks v and vi not removed by conventional treatment processes is observed in the source water it has already been established that a change in the msd following treatment of nom by a suite of treatment processes gives an indication of the effectiveness of that particular process towards the treatment of nom 11 18 nonetheless msd data can also be used to determine the molecular weight fraction that contributes to the formation of thms apart from the size distribution of nom that revealed variability during the different seasons a significant correlation between hmw nom of the source water and tthm formation was observed data relating to the individual molecular weight fractions see fig 6 portray a strong and positive correlation between peak i and the formation of chloroform as indicated by r2 0 9633 p 0 05 this correlation is statistically significant as indicated by a p value that is below 0 05 the correlation between the hmw nom and dbp formation has also been established in other studies this was evidenced by a direct relationship between chloroform formation and hmw nom within the relevant source water 12 13 a reasonable correlation between hmw nom and chloroform formation during the winter months which was supported by a correlation coefficient value of 0 5872 p 0 05 fig 6 has also been established more definite and stronger correlations were observed between higher molecular weight nom and thms formed in the final water during the warmer summer months fig 7 these correlations indicate that tthm formation more specifically chloroform formation is highly influenced by the presence of hmw nom in the source water figs 6 and 7 similar results have also been confirmed by other research studies which have demonstrated hmw hydrophobic nom as the leading precursor in the formation of chloroform 7 8 it is evident from fig 8 that a reasonable correlation was found to exist between peak iv imw nom and the amount of thm formed during winter as indicated by a regression coefficient of 0 656 p 0 05 the correlation between chloroform and peak v lmw nom during winter was also moderate r2 0 5887 p 0 05 fig 9 during the summer months weak associations were evident between the intermediate and lower molecular weight fractions and chloroform indicated by correlation coefficients in the region of 0 259 figs 8 and 9 different from lmw nom hmw nom is strongly correlated with uv254 and suva 12 17 lower molecular weight fractions are often associated with low suva values 2 l mg m 8 10 during summer november to february a stronger correlation exists between the percentage uv254 removed and source water suva fig 10 r2 0 9369 p 0 05 a good correlation was observed between the aromatic fraction of nom uv254 and the uv254 percentage removal during both summer and winter seasons figs 10 and 11 this finding indicates that increased aromaticity of nom in the source water results in increased nom removal using full scale treatment however no correlation was established between aromatic nom suva or uv254 and the thms formed during the study period it can therefore be concluded that uv absorbing properties of organic matter are not the sole precursor that contributes to the formation of thms in the final treated water similar conclusions have been drawn from other studies which indicate that suva is a weak indicator of thm formation 22 23 however strong correlations were observed between trihalomethane formation potential thmfp and aromatic nom when the relationship between the characteristics of nom and its treatability was investigated 9 24 3 2 thm speciation the four thm species quantified in the final water samples were bromoform chloroform dbcm and bdcm with the sum of their concentrations reported as a total tthm in μg l bromoform and dbcm measurements are below the detection limits of 0 36 μg l and 0 33 μg l respectively and are therefore not presented in the relevant graphs the low formation of the brominated thms bromoform and dbcm is expected due to the low bromide concentration in the water 8 25 after chlorination primary disinfection the chloroform concentration constituted 67 5 of the total thm yield compared to 77 2 after secondary disinfection i e chloramination fig 12 the bdcm concentrations after primary and secondary disinfection were found to be 32 5 and 22 8 of the total thm concentration respectively fig 12 this partitioning of thm formation concurs with data published in other research studies where chloroform and bdcm were documented as the two major thm species formed during chlorination chloramination 12 15 26 the maxima and minima of each of the individual thms at each sampling point is indicated by the upper and lower lines within the box and whisker plots figs 13 16 during all four seasons an increase was observed in the concentrations of tthm chloroform and bdcm within the wtp process flow system as the contact time between nom and chlorine increased fig 13 the highest thm concentrations during chlorination are expected in distribution systems with the longest water residence times water age due to increased contact time with chlorine even though the largest proportion of thm formation occurs within the first 6 h of the chlorine dose 27 it should also be noted that the increase in thms measured at the chloramination sampling point secondary disinfection is due to the longer residence time associated with chlorine and not due to the addition of monochloramine as formation of thms during chloramination is minimal 28 29 diurnal differences in thm concentrations are also not as prominent in chloraminated systems as thms do not increase with water age compared to chlorinated systems 27 from figs 13 to 16 it is evident that the thm concentration in the chlorinated chloraminated system increases in the order bdcm chloroform the average concentration of tthm was 17 0 μg l at the primary disinfection sampling point while it was 39 2 μg l at the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages and 67 1 μg l at secondary disinfection fig 16 these mean thm values in the final treated water are well below the limits for thm content in terms of the south african national standard for drinking water sans 241 2015 indicating effective nom removal by the wtp the temperature of the water sampled in the distribution system during winter spring and summer is presented in fig 17 at the primary disinfection plant chlorine dosage and chlorine demand showed minimal variance during the study period fig 18 chlorine dosage ranged between 3 0 and 4 3 mg l with a mean value of 3 4 mg l fig 18 as chlorine dosage was fairly constant at the full scale plant it can be concluded that disinfectant dosage did not have an effect on the thms formed during the study period fig 13 when relating the free chlorine residuals measured during disinfection reduced chlorine residuals were observed in samples from the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages as compared to water sampled at primary disinfection due to increased contact time fig 19 the depletion of chlorine is in accordance with the increase in thms observed at the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages fig 13 although chlorine dosage and nom contact time have an effect on thm formation 8 25 the formation of thms within the wtp process flow system was primarily due to contact time of nom fractions with chlorine as the chlorine dosage displayed minimal variance during the study period fig 18 4 conclusions although it is well recognised that nom is the major precursor to the formation of thms during chlorination and chloramination the specific nom fraction responsible for thm formation during vaal dam surface water treatment has not been identified to date this study investigated the effect of the characteristics of source water nom molecular size distribution on the formation of thms during disinfection at one of south africa s bulk water treatment plants although thm chloroform formation in summer was primarily due to hmw aromatic nom the weak correlation between suva and tthm suggests that the aromatic nom fractions were not the main thm precursors throughout all seasons the mean tthm concentrations detected after disinfection in potable water were well below the standard as stipulated in the sans 241 specifications the key finding of this paper is that analysis of the molecular size distribution msd of nom using hpsec revealed a significant correlation between the hmw fraction of nom and thm formation especially during the warmer summer months this indicates that chloroform formation is largely influenced by hmw nom in vaal dam surface water the positive correlation existing between suva and nom removal indicates the use of suva as an indicator of average percentage removal of aromatic nom this finding will be valuable to wtp personnel as the suva value of the source water can be used to predict the percentage removal of aromatic nom that will likely occur during coagulation in a full scale wtp the impact of this work is that surface water suva can be used to indicate the treatability of hmw nom the hydrophobic aromatic fraction during full scale plant operation at south africa s largest bulk water utility declaration

character composition of nom influences its treatability while the uv absorbing fractions of organic matter are often the main contributors to the formation of dbps 9 although nom is often recognised as the main dbp precursor nom is a complex mixture of heterogeneous organic compounds that vary in size structure and functionality more importantly the molecular weight of nom is associated with thm formation 10 nom characterisation techniques are imperative as it provides information on the reactivity of the individual nom fractions during the various water treatment processes and indicates the change in nom character during treatment 6 7 characterisation of nom using high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec entails the separation of humic substances based on their molecular size by eluting molecules that are bigger than the gel pores first and eluting the smaller molecules last 6 11 the size of molecular compounds is often associated with the formation and type of dbps forming during chlorination and chloramination 10 12 13 the use of headspace gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd for thm analysis is preferred over both liquid liquid extraction and purge and trap analysis due to its ease of automation and sensitivity 14 15 in this study thm formation was used as an indicator of dbp formation potential due to the observation that thms occur in high concentration levels thus being the dbp predominantly formed during chlorination chloramination 2 16 and due to the fact that thms are currently the only dbp regulated in terms of the sans 241 drinking water specification the objective of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of different molecular weight fractions of nom on the formation and speciation of thms after chlorination and chloramination in the wtp 2 methods 2 1 drinking water process train and sample collection at rand water the treatment steps consist of screening coagulation flocculation sedimentation carbonation filtration followed by primary chlorination and secondary disinfection by addition of ammonia chloramination a chlorine dosage ranging between 3 and 4 mg l is applied at primary disinfection free chlorine residuals were measured during disinfection at the primary and secondary disinfection stages surface water from the vaal dam was sampled at the intake of the full scale water treatment plant the water downstream of each of the treatment processes as well as within the wtp process flow system was sampled at the sampling points as indicated in fig 1 after sampling at the selected sampling points the samples were transported to the laboratory in a cooler box with ice packs and the samples were refrigerated at 4 c until analysed to measure the thms present at the time of sampling the residual chlorine of the treated water was reduced by adding ascorbic acid to the sample bottles surface and treated water samples were collected during a 12 month study period with a time interval of 14 days between each sampling run 2 2 raw water characterisation and total organic content samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and the bulk nom within the surface water was analysed by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc and ultraviolet absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm uv254 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva that is the ratio of uv254 to doc concentration was calculated for raw water to indicate its aromaticity the suva value gives an indication of the composition of nom within a sample with regard to its hydrophilicity molecular weight and aromaticity 17 the high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec method was followed to determine the msd distribution of the molecular weight fractions of nom within the water samples 6 the msd was measured in all the samples collected during autumn winter spring and summer a hewlett packard 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system was used to analyse the samples by separating the molecular fractions on a tsk g3000sw column 7 5 mm x 300 mm at a flow rate of 0 65 ml min and an injection volume of 20 μl the mobile phase was 0 01 m sodium acetate and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 using acetic acid calibration of the tsk g3000sw column was performed using a standard protein mix containing 4 proteins thyroglobulin bovine gamma globulin ovalbumin ribonuclease a with molecular weights ranging between 15 600 kda and a low molecular weight marker p aminobenzoic acid 137 da the peak area of each fraction was measured with uv detection set to 254 nm and expressed as milli absorbance units mau 2 3 trihalomethane analysis water samples for thm analysis were collected downstream of the treatment processes that is immediately post chlorination at the primary disinfection plant as well as of the flow passing between the chlorination and chloramination stages and immediately post chloramination at the secondary disinfection plant as indicated by sampling points d e and f respectively in fig 1 a headspace sampler agilent 7697 a coupled to a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n was used to analyse the water samples collected after the final water treatment stage namely disinfection the thms in the samples were separated using a capillary gas chromatography column followed by detection using an electron capture detector ecd for the separation an hp 1 methyl siloxane fused silica capillary column 30 m x 0 530 mm x 0 5 μm film thickness j w scientific was used bromoform chloroform dbcm and bdcm were quantified under the gc ecd running conditions indicated in table 1 using internal standard calibration 1 2 dibromoethane to ensure reliable and repeatable results the method detection limits were as follows bromoform 0 36 μg l chloroform 0 21 μg l dbcm 0 33 μg l and bdcm 0 27 μg l 2 4 data availability the authors confirm that all relevant data are included in the paper and or its supplementary information files 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw water characterisation according to table 2 the source water had an aromatic content of 24 3 m 1 measured by uv254 mean doc of 5 7 mg l suva value of 4 1 l mg m and a medium colour 89 6 cu each of the hpsec peaks represents a nom fraction according to the time minutes the fraction was eluted and the peak formed generally six peaks i ii iii iv v and vi were eluted with peaks i and ii representing high molecular weight hmw nom peaks iii and iv the intermediate molecular weight imw nom and low molecular weight lmw nom being represented by peaks v and vi 6 18 previous studies investigating the effect of nom on thm formation suggest that the hmw nom fraction is characterised by a molecular weight that is 3 kda and the lmw nom fraction is characterised by a molecular weight 1 kda 10 12 fig 2 indicates typical hpsec chromatograms of the source and final treated water samples with the peak heights being the uv absorbance response from the detector the average peak heights from the msd evaluation of the water samples after each treatment step are indicated in fig 3 typical removals of the nom fractions are indicated by the change in msd during full scale treatment as shown in fig 3 the hmw components of nom were more readily removed this is indicated by a greater reduction of peaks i and ii as compared to peak vi lmw nom fraction it is evident from a comparative analysis of the source water sample and the water samples obtained after the secondary disinfection stage see fig 3 that the quantity of the lmw components of nom was found to remain constant during treatment this is indicated by similar peak heights peaks iv v and vi that were recorded in all samples data from the hpsec analysis indicating peak heights and the percentage of the total area of each fraction is presented in table 3 in vaal dam source water samples table 3 fig 3 peaks i and ii were on average 22 5 and 26 7 respectively of the total area of nom fractions in source water table 3 when comparing the percentage distribution of the individual fractions of the source water to the treated water after secondary disinfection it is evident that peaks i and ii hmw nom were mainly reduced by the wtp table 3 the distribution of the molecular sizes observed in this study is comparable to those of other studies where it was also shown that the higher molecular weight fractions of nom 3 kda and coloured fractions tend to be selectively removed by the coagulation process 9 11 18 the selective removal of the higher molecular weight fractions of nom has also been confirmed in other studies indicating that lmw fractions are not being removed by coagulation 11 the percentage of each fraction removed after the various treatment steps was calculated using the peak heights given in table 3 and the subsequent percentage of each fraction remaining after treatment sedimentation and filtration is illustrated in fig 4 the percentage hmw nom peaks i and ii remaining in the water after sedimentation filtration was observed to be on average 63 1 and 67 8 during the study period fig 4 it can be concluded that only a selective percentage of the high molecular weight humic acid fractions is removed by the treatment processes in this water treatment plant a further decrease is also observed in peaks i to iii hmw and imw nom post disinfection as compared to peaks iv to vi fig 4 this additional reduction of hmw nom was observed post chlorination indicating the reactivity of hmw nom with chlorine the seasonal variability of the msd of nom in the source water is presented in fig 5 indicating a slight variation in msd data over the four seasons such a variation in the composition of nom in the surface water during the different seasons is not surprising and has been reported in other studies 19 20 a decrease in nom was observed during the summer months which is indicated by a decline in the height of the various peaks peaks i to vi fig 5 molecular weight distributions of nom are affected by seasonal changes and a similar seasonal molecular weight distribution was observed in source water analysed by other researchers 11 21 to this end an increase in the total organic content towards the winter months and lowest levels of the fractions during the summer months was recorded 11 21 according to fig 5 it is evident that as summer approaches a decrease in the lmw fractions peaks v and vi not removed by conventional treatment processes is observed in the source water it has already been established that a change in the msd following treatment of nom by a suite of treatment processes gives an indication of the effectiveness of that particular process towards the treatment of nom 11 18 nonetheless msd data can also be used to determine the molecular weight fraction that contributes to the formation of thms apart from the size distribution of nom that revealed variability during the different seasons a significant correlation between hmw nom of the source water and tthm formation was observed data relating to the individual molecular weight fractions see fig 6 portray a strong and positive correlation between peak i and the formation of chloroform as indicated by r2 0 9633 p 0 05 this correlation is statistically significant as indicated by a p value that is below 0 05 the correlation between the hmw nom and dbp formation has also been established in other studies this was evidenced by a direct relationship between chloroform formation and hmw nom within the relevant source water 12 13 a reasonable correlation between hmw nom and chloroform formation during the winter months which was supported by a correlation coefficient value of 0 5872 p 0 05 fig 6 has also been established more definite and stronger correlations were observed between higher molecular weight nom and thms formed in the final water during the warmer summer months fig 7 these correlations indicate that tthm formation more specifically chloroform formation is highly influenced by the presence of hmw nom in the source water figs 6 and 7 similar results have also been confirmed by other research studies which have demonstrated hmw hydrophobic nom as the leading precursor in the formation of chloroform 7 8 it is evident from fig 8 that a reasonable correlation was found to exist between peak iv imw nom and the amount of thm formed during winter as indicated by a regression coefficient of 0 656 p 0 05 the correlation between chloroform and peak v lmw nom during winter was also moderate r2 0 5887 p 0 05 fig 9 during the summer months weak associations were evident between the intermediate and lower molecular weight fractions and chloroform indicated by correlation coefficients in the region of 0 259 figs 8 and 9 different from lmw nom hmw nom is strongly correlated with uv254 and suva 12 17 lower molecular weight fractions are often associated with low suva values 2 l mg m 8 10 during summer november to february a stronger correlation exists between the percentage uv254 removed and source water suva fig 10 r2 0 9369 p 0 05 a good correlation was observed between the aromatic fraction of nom uv254 and the uv254 percentage removal during both summer and winter seasons figs 10 and 11 this finding indicates that increased aromaticity of nom in the source water results in increased nom removal using full scale treatment however no correlation was established between aromatic nom suva or uv254 and the thms formed during the study period it can therefore be concluded that uv absorbing properties of organic matter are not the sole precursor that contributes to the formation of thms in the final treated water similar conclusions have been drawn from other studies which indicate that suva is a weak indicator of thm formation 22 23 however strong correlations were observed between trihalomethane formation potential thmfp and aromatic nom when the relationship between the characteristics of nom and its treatability was investigated 9 24 3 2 thm speciation the four thm species quantified in the final water samples were bromoform chloroform dbcm and bdcm with the sum of their concentrations reported as a total tthm in μg l bromoform and dbcm measurements are below the detection limits of 0 36 μg l and 0 33 μg l respectively and are therefore not presented in the relevant graphs the low formation of the brominated thms bromoform and dbcm is expected due to the low bromide concentration in the water 8 25 after chlorination primary disinfection the chloroform concentration constituted 67 5 of the total thm yield compared to 77 2 after secondary disinfection i e chloramination fig 12 the bdcm concentrations after primary and secondary disinfection were found to be 32 5 and 22 8 of the total thm concentration respectively fig 12 this partitioning of thm formation concurs with data published in other research studies where chloroform and bdcm were documented as the two major thm species formed during chlorination chloramination 12 15 26 the maxima and minima of each of the individual thms at each sampling point is indicated by the upper and lower lines within the box and whisker plots figs 13 16 during all four seasons an increase was observed in the concentrations of tthm chloroform and bdcm within the wtp process flow system as the contact time between nom and chlorine increased fig 13 the highest thm concentrations during chlorination are expected in distribution systems with the longest water residence times water age due to increased contact time with chlorine even though the largest proportion of thm formation occurs within the first 6 h of the chlorine dose 27 it should also be noted that the increase in thms measured at the chloramination sampling point secondary disinfection is due to the longer residence time associated with chlorine and not due to the addition of monochloramine as formation of thms during chloramination is minimal 28 29 diurnal differences in thm concentrations are also not as prominent in chloraminated systems as thms do not increase with water age compared to chlorinated systems 27 from figs 13 to 16 it is evident that the thm concentration in the chlorinated chloraminated system increases in the order bdcm chloroform the average concentration of tthm was 17 0 μg l at the primary disinfection sampling point while it was 39 2 μg l at the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages and 67 1 μg l at secondary disinfection fig 16 these mean thm values in the final treated water are well below the limits for thm content in terms of the south african national standard for drinking water sans 241 2015 indicating effective nom removal by the wtp the temperature of the water sampled in the distribution system during winter spring and summer is presented in fig 17 at the primary disinfection plant chlorine dosage and chlorine demand showed minimal variance during the study period fig 18 chlorine dosage ranged between 3 0 and 4 3 mg l with a mean value of 3 4 mg l fig 18 as chlorine dosage was fairly constant at the full scale plant it can be concluded that disinfectant dosage did not have an effect on the thms formed during the study period fig 13 when relating the free chlorine residuals measured during disinfection reduced chlorine residuals were observed in samples from the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages as compared to water sampled at primary disinfection due to increased contact time fig 19 the depletion of chlorine is in accordance with the increase in thms observed at the sampling point between the chlorination and chloramination stages fig 13 although chlorine dosage and nom contact time have an effect on thm formation 8 25 the formation of thms within the wtp process flow system was primarily due to contact time of nom fractions with chlorine as the chlorine dosage displayed minimal variance during the study period fig 18 4 conclusions although it is well recognised that nom is the major precursor to the formation of thms during chlorination and chloramination the specific nom fraction responsible for thm formation during vaal dam surface water treatment has not been identified to date this study investigated the effect of the characteristics of source water nom molecular size distribution on the formation of thms during disinfection at one of south africa s bulk water treatment plants although thm chloroform formation in summer was primarily due to hmw aromatic nom the weak correlation between suva and tthm suggests that the aromatic nom fractions were not the main thm precursors throughout all seasons the mean tthm concentrations detected after disinfection in potable water were well below the standard as stipulated in the sans 241 specifications the key finding of this paper is that analysis of the molecular size distribution msd of nom using hpsec revealed a significant correlation between the hmw fraction of nom and thm formation especially during the warmer summer months this indicates that chloroform formation is largely influenced by hmw nom in vaal dam surface water the positive correlation existing between suva and nom removal indicates the use of suva as an indicator of average percentage removal of aromatic nom this finding will be valuable to wtp personnel as the suva value of the source water can be used to predict the percentage removal of aromatic nom that will likely occur during coagulation in a full scale wtp the impact of this work is that surface water suva can be used to indicate the treatability of hmw nom the hydrophobic aromatic fraction during full scale plant operation at south africa s largest bulk water utility declaration

14469,the need to elucidate the influence of the presence of the major components i e organic matter phosphate and nitrate of nutrient rich wastewater on the process of nutrient recovery using calcined gastropod shell cgs necessitated this study the time concentration profiles of the recovery of organic matter phosphate and nitrate were studied in synthetic feed water that contained single adsorbate of interest both the single and binary component equilibrium isotherm parameters were derived to explicate and quantify the impact of the presence of each constituent of the nutrient rich wastewater on the process of resource recovery the time concentration profiles of all the recovery processes showed that the process of nitrate recovery is the rate limiting step in the use of cgs as the reactive material the pseudo second order kinetic equation gave the best description of both the nutrient and organic matter recovery but the processes were described by different equilibrium isotherm equations the determination of the efficiency of interference on nutrient recovery showed that nitrate and organic matter exhibited minimal influence on phosphate recovery but the presence of phosphate and organic matter significantly impacted nitrate recovery the recovery of organic matter was not vitiated by the presence of either phosphate or nitrate the real life implications of the findings from this study showed that the use of cgs as a reactive material in resource recovery from a nutrient rich wastewater would provide a double pronged approach for resource recovery and appreciable treatment of wastewater for reuse keywords nutrient efficiency of interference organic matter phosphate nitrate eutrophication 1 introduction the new concept of ecological sanitation which perceived nutrient rich wastewater as a valuable resource engendered the research into the development of sustainable nutrient i e nitrogen n and phosphorus p recovery protocols aside the high nutrient fraction this wastewater is also replete with other constituents e g organic matter pathogens and inorganic salts that limit the application as fertilizers in agricultural practice some of these non nutrient fractions are non ecofriendly thus the direct application on soils is discouraged to preclude the possible attendant challenges e g salinity aesthetic and odour concerns the bids to develop efficacious nutrient recovery procedures have produced techniques that hinged on solid phase extraction procedures this procedure is a simple conveyance of nutrient from the aqueous phase to a solid phase matrix array of materials that have been used in solid phase extraction of nutrient and nutrient fractions include woodchip acid mine drainage treatment residuals and steel slag 1 polonite and blast furnace slag 2 agar alginate algal blocks 3 porous mgo biochar nanocomposites 4 clinoptilolite 5 raw and calcined shell of african land snail 6 14 the affinity of the surface of a solid matrix for ionic specie and the extent of interaction between them are predisposed to the presence of other ionic species in the system it has been posited 8 that the presence of other ionic species aside the ion of interest impacts the process of removal either synergistically antagonistically or non interactive synergistic and antagonistic actions of interfering ionic components in the adsorption of oxoanions from aqueous system have been reported 9 12 15 in nutrient rich wastewaters suspended and dissolved organic matter are amongst the major constituents therefore it is imperative that sustainable technologies for nutrient recovery should define how the presence of each of the major constituents of the wastewater influences the process of nutrient recovery generally organic matter is a complex heterogeneous mixture consisting of plants and animal remains at various stages of decomposition it comprises organic constituents such as humic acids ha and fulvic acids these organic constituents are coloured aromatic and hydrophobic in nature it also comprises low molecular weight portions that are hydrophilic including aliphatic and nitrogenous compounds such as amino acids carbohydrates and proteins 1 using the hydrochemistry of natural organic matter i e nom as a premise it was postulated that the high adsorption propensity of organic matter on an adsorbent s surface can significantly alter the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and possibly envelopes the reactive sites on the adsorbent 4 6 it is also noteworthy that the deprotonation of carboxylic and phenolic groups on organic matter occurs within the natural ph value of water i e in weakly acidic to basic medium 7 this ultimately conferred negative charges on the molecules of the organic matter thus in the aqua matrix the nutrient fractions and the deprotonated organic matter molecules bear similar charges consequent upon the high concentration of organic matter in nutrient rich wastewaters the predilection of organic matter to alter the surface chemistry of solid surfaces and the similarity in their surface charges with that of the nutrient fractions in the aqua matrix we hereby hypothesize that competition may be induced between the nutrient and the organic matter fractions in the aqueous solution for the available reactive sites on the adsorbent which vitiates the efficiency of the nutrient recovery process the promise of the calcined shell of a gastropod cgs as a green and sustainable reactive material in the recovery of phosphorus from aquaculture wastewater has been previously reported 11 in order to verify our hypothesis the influence of the presence of each of the major constituents of nutrient rich wastewater i e organic matter nitrate and phosphate on the process of recovery of each fraction i e organic matter nitrate and phosphate by cgs shall be elucidated the time concentration profiles of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and organic matter shall be studied in a synthetic nutrient rich water that contains single adsorbate i e po4 3 no3 and organic matter and binary i e po4 3 no3 po4 3 ha and no3 ha synthetic feed water both the single and binary component equilibrium isotherm parameters shall be derived to elucidate and quantify the impacts of the presence of each constituent of the nutrient rich wastewater on the process of resource recovery using cgs the implications of the findings from this study shall be related to the real life nutrient recovery process from nutrient rich wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of gs premised on earlier findings 11 pulverized shell of gastropod derived from african giant land snail achatina achatina was calcined at 750 in the furnace for 2 h to obtain the cgs the bet surface area of the cgs was determined using an asap 2010 micromeritics instrument by brunauer emmett teller bet method the elemental and the mineralogical profiles were determined using x ray fluorescence xrf and x ray diffractometer xrd respectively the surface architecture and elemental composition were determined using scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive analysis of x rays edax while the chemical functionalities on the surface of the cgs were determined using ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa 2 2 nutrient and organic matter recovery process the study on the influence of organic matter on nutrient recovery efficiency was carried out by dissolving varying concentrations mg l of ha in deionised water nutrient rich water was prepared from the dissolution of appropriate potassium salt of the respective nutrient fraction i e kh2po4 and kno3 in deionised water the salts of similar cation were chosen to even out the influence of the index cation of the respective nutrient fraction on the recovery process the rate of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and organic matter were determined by the addition of 0 5 g of cgs into 1 0 l of the synthetic feed water that contains a known concentration of any of the adsorbates of interest i e po4 3 no3 and ha the concentration range of the nutrient fractions i e po4 3 and no3 was between 5 and 50 mg l while that of ha was between 2 5 and 30 mg l the concentration range chosen for each adsorbate represents the low and medium range values of the adsorbate in real life system 16 20 the adsorbate adsorbent mixture was agitated at 200 rpm on a thermostatic shaker and samples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals that ranged between 0 and 60 min for po4 3 and ha and between 0 and 8 h for no3 shorter withdrawal time intervals were chosen for both po4 3 and ha because of the faster rate of attainment of equilibrium time relative to no3 the withdrawn samples were filtered using 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane and the residual concentration of the respective adsorbate i e po4 3 no3 and ha was determined using the appropriate standard methods highlighted below in both the single and binary solution systems the equilibrium isotherm analysis of the process of resource recovery was conducted by contacting 0 1 g of the cgs with 50 ml solution of known adsorbate concentration the adsorbate concentrations ranged between 5 and 50 mg l for po3 2 and no3 and 2 5 and 30 mg l for ha the different concentrations of the adsorbate of interest and the interfering ionic species used in the preparation of the binary and single solutions systems are presented in supplementary information table 1 6 si table the mixture was stirred on a thermostatic shaker at 200 rpm until the attainment of the equilibrium time samples were withdrawn filtered using 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane and the residual adsorbate concentration was analysed in each case as highlighted below the concentration of phosphate in the filtered sample was determined by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method 21 nitrate was determined using the cadmium reduction method 21 and ha was quantified using the uv254 absorbance determination at λmax 254 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer 21 the amount of each adsorbate recovered per unit mass of the cgs in mg g was quantified using the mass balance equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of materials the results of the xrf analysis table 1 of the cgs affirmed the erstwhile claim that the cgs is a calcium rich material 6 13 the diffractogram of the cgs fig 1 revealed the crystalline architecture consequent upon the fact that caco3 is the principal component of the shells of gastropods 13 and 14 the miller indices of the three polymorphs of caco3 aragonite calcite and vaterite were used as the diagnostic tools in the interpretation of the prominent peaks in the diffractogram of the cgs fig 1 the miller indices employed were 111 and 221 for aragonite 104 and 113 for calcite and 110 112 114 300 224 and 211 for vaterite 22 in the diffractogram of the cgs the vaterite peaks appeared at 63 19 2 1 1 and 72 68 3 0 0 while the calcite peak appeared at 43 70 1 1 3 none of the aragonite peaks was observed in the diffractogram of the cgs previously from the xrd analysis of the raw gs the presence of the three polymorphs of caco3 at 26 26 1 1 1 and 46 03 2 2 1 for aragonite 52 89 1 1 3 for calcite and 37 93 1 1 2 for vaterite was reported 11 juxtaposing the results from the xrd analysis of both the raw gs and cgs showed the total disappearance of the aragonite peaks in the cgs this is an indication that the transformation of the polymorphs of the caco3 in one form to another occurred with thermal treatment in the ftir spectra of the cgs the peaks of the n hstr that appeared at 2978 2877 and 3452 cm 1 were attributed to ammonium ions and primary amines from complex protein i e conchin in the outer shells of gastropods conchin is amongst the organic macromolecules primarily proteins and polysaccharides that form the microenvironment where the caco3 crystals nucleated and grew the multiple co3 2 peaks cm 1 at 2588 2515 2372 2314 2133 1801 1624 1419 and 871 were attributed to the presence of the different caco3 polymorphs in addition to the presence of multiple co3 2 peaks that were identified in the cgs a single cao peaks was also identified at 3630 cm 1 the mineralogical assemblage of the cgs fig 1 did not reflect the presence of cao which supports the claim that the conversion of caco3 to cao occurs only at temperatures above 900 c the inability of the xrd to identify the presence of cao in the cgs could be ascribed to the fact that the magnitude of this metal oxide in the cgs must be insignificant fig 2 the sem image fig 3 a showed that the surface of the cgs is made up of a grooved surface with sharp and rough edges oladoja et al 11 suggested from their studies that the calcination of raw gs at 750 could enhance surface defects that increase the number of atoms with highly defective coordination environments on the surface of the material these atoms are located on the surface of the cgs and they possess partially filled valence orbitals which provide them with rich active sites for the uptake of phosphate from the aqua matrix the results of the edax analysis showed ca c and o as the major identifiable elements in cgs fig 3b this is a confirmation of the rich caco3 nature of the material the specific surface area of the cgs obtained through bet method was 4 44 m2 g the value of the single point adsorption total pore volume of pores was 0 012604 cm³ g while the value of adsorption average pore width 4 v a by bet was 113 5256 å 3 2 time concentration profiles of the recovery process 3 2 1 phosphate and ha recovery in single solute solution system the time concentration profiles of the recovery of each ionic species of interest from the synthetic feed water are presented in fig 4 a c the appraisal of time concentration profiles of the three ionic species showed that the rate and time of attainment of the state of equilibrium varied the processes of recovery of phosphate and ha were faster than that of nitrate thus the states of equilibrium were attained faster in phosphate and ha recovery than in nitrate recovery within the initial phosphate concentrations studied the attainment of the state of equilibrium was almost instantaneous fig 4a the process of recovery of ha attained equilibrium in less than 30 min fig 4c while the equilibrium state was attained after six hours 6 h in nitrate recovery fig 4b a in all the adsorbate studied the attainment of the state of equilibrium was not initial concentration dependent rather the magnitude of adsorbate recovered per gram of the adsorbent depended on the initial adsorbate concentrations the rate parameters of the recovery process were derived from the fittings of the data obtained from the determination of the time concentration profiles to the pseudo first order eq 1 23 and pseudo second order eq 2 24 kinetic equations 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where qe is the adsorption capacity mg g of the cgs at equilibrium and qt is the adsorption capacity mg g of the cgs at time t k 1 is the overall rate constants g mg min of pseudo first order pfo equation and k 2 is the overall rate constants g mg min of pseudo second order equation pso the fittings of the time concentration profile data of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and ha to the two kinetic equations table 2 revealed that the pso equation described the process better r2 0 9 than the pfo equation r2 0 90 the values of the qe mg g increased linearly with increasing initial adsorbate concentration the values of the pso rate constant k2 also increased with increasing initial adsorbate concentration but the increment was not directly related to the initial adsorbate concentration the non rectilinear profile of the k2 values with the initial adsorbate concentration contradicted the commonly reported trends as a rule the k2 value is expected to decrease with the increasing initial adsorbate concentrations this is the common assumption that is related to the interpretation of k2 as a time scaling factor i e the higher the initial adsorbate concentrations the longer the system is required to reach the state of equilibrium 25 28 despite the assumption that the values of k2 is strongly dependent on the initial adsorbate concentration cases where k2 values are independent of initial adsorbate concentrations have also been reported 29 36 consequent upon the conflicting trends in the relationship between k2 and the initial adsorbate concentrations a theoretical analysis of the kinetic models of adsorption for the system that obeys the pso kinetic equation was performed azizian et al 37 the results obtained from this theoretical analysis showed that the observed k2 values for any system is a complex function of the initial concentration of adsorbate 34 previously it has been elucidated that one of the underlying mechanism of phosphorus recovery from aqua system using calcined gs was chemisorption due to the higher fitting of the pso kinetic equation 11 other experimental and theoretical evidences were also reported to affirm the occurrence of precipitation reaction in addition to the chemisorption mode of adsorption 11 hitherto a critical analysis of the mechanisms that underlie ha recovery using a multivalent cation rich material as a reactive material i e nano mgo revealed that the possible reaction mechanisms could be attributed to a series of reactions that involved precipitation complexation and destructive adsorption 38 it has been advanced that in a high ionic aqueous medium with multivalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 the coagulation of ha molecule is activated 38 39 considering the fact that cgs is a predominantly multivalent cation i e ca2 the core mechanism of ha recovery using cgs as the reactive material can be ascribed to ha precipitation and or adsorption on the surface of cao or hydrated cao and the possible carbonation products as enunciated previously 40 on the strength of the evidences that precipitation reaction is one of the core mechanisms of ha and phosphate recoveries the time concentration profiles of the recoveries of ha and phosphate were also fitted to the avrami fractional kinetic equation this enabled the determination of the kinetics parameters for the possible precipitate formations the theoretical basis of the avrami fractional kinetic equation hinged on the description of changes in the volume of crystals as function of time during the process of crystallization 11 41 the linearized form of this equation by simple linear regression is presented in eq 3 3 ln ln 1 f ln b k ln t where f is the fraction adsorbed qt qe at time t b is a temperature dependent constant similar to a rate constant while k is the avrami exponent which reflects the dimensionality of crystal growth the avrami exponent k value can be 3 k 4 for three dimensional growth 2 k 3 for two dimensional growth or 1 k 2 for one dimensional growth the kinetic parameters obtained from the fittings of the avrami fractional kinetic equation to ha and phosphate recoveries are presented in table 2 in relation to the other kinetic equations fitted to the process of recoveries of ha and phosphate this equation the avrami equation gave a good description of the recovery of both phosphate and ha from aqueous streams the values of the coefficient of determination r2 obtained were higher than those obtained from the fitting of the pfo kinetic equation but fell below those obtained from the pso kinetic equation the values of the avrami exponent k which ranged between 0 077and 0 72 for phosphate recovery and 0 427 and 0 558 for ha recovery showed that the propagation of the precipitate formed from the interaction of both phosphate and ha with the cgs occurred in one dimension 3 2 2 nitrate recovery a preliminary evaluation of the possible interactions between the aqueous phase nitrate and the cgs showed that nitrate recovery using cgs cannot be effected through precipitation reaction or any form of phase change reactions considering the theoretical basis for the derivation of the avrami fractional kinetic equation and the possible underlying mechanisms of nitrate recovery from the aqua phase it was considered inappropriate to fit the time concentration profile data of the nitrate recovery process to the avrami fractional kinetic equation 41 thus the time concentration profile data were analyzed using pfo and pso kinetic equations only table 2 at present the higher fittings of the pseudo second order kinetic equation table 2 to the process of nitrate recovery r2 0 9 indicated the role of chemisorption or ion exchange as an important reaction mechanism in the recovery process in order to define the possible modes of interactions between the cgs and nitrate in the aqua matrix the speciation of the aqua phase nitrate and the surface chemistry of the cgs were elucidated using medusa make equilibrium diagrams using sophisticated algorithms and hydra hydrochemical equilibrium constant database 42 this software was used to calculate the chemical equilibrium data within the operational ph value 7 0 of the recovery process the chemical equilibrium data fig 4b b showed that the prevailing ionic species in the reacting mixture were ca2 and no3 but the products of interactions between these ionic species were cano3 and ca no3 2 at ph value 8 8 the formation of caoh occurred which also provided an active site for electrostatic interaction with nitrate using the information derived from the chemical equilibrium data the possible interactions between the cgs and no3 is hereby proposed as a combination of both specific and non specific adsorption the chemical equations that depict the two modes of adsorption are presented below specific adsorption 4a ca2 no3 cano3 4b ca2 2no3 ca no3 2 non specific adsorption ph value 8 8 4c caoh no3 caoh no3 3 3 equilibrium isotherm analysis of the recovery process in order to define the characteristics of the mode of interactions of cgs with the different ionic species in the aqua system the linear forms of the following equilibrium isotherm equations eq 4 9 were used to analyze the process of recovery of each of the ionic species the theoretical basis of each equilibrium isotherm equation is presented in the supplementary information file si 1 5 l a n g m u i r c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m 6 f r e u n d l i c h l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e 7 t e m k i n q e b 1 l

results presented in table 3 indicated that the process of recovery of each adsorbate was described by different equilibrium isotherm equations used the process of phosphate r2 0 9386 and ha recovery r2 0 9782 were best described by the harkins jura equilibrium isotherm equation while the process of nitrate recovery was best described r2 0 9787 by the freundlich isotherm equation the description of the recovery process by different isotherm equations indicated that the mode of adsorbent adsorbate interactions in each case was different the harkins jura adsorption isotherm can be expressed 43 11 1 q e 2 b a 1 a l o g c e it accounts for multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent and the distribution of heterogeneous pores on the adsorbent the parameters of the isotherm equation are obtained from the plot of 1 q e 2 versus l o g c e the freundlich equation for adsorption isotherm is purely an empirical isotherm having no theoretical basis and its validity extends to non uniformity of the adsorption surfaces 44 it indicates the surface heterogeneity of the sorbent the linearized form of the isotherm is expressed thus 12 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e where kf and n are freundlich coefficients obtainable from the plots of l o g q e versus l o g c e the fittings of both the phosphate and ha to the harkins jura equation is an indication that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions occurred through a multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent and there is a distribution of the adsorbate on the heterogeneous pores on the adsorbent considering the theoretical basis for the derivation of freundlich equilibrium isotherm the process of recovery of nitrate must have occurred on the heterogeneous sites on the cgs 3 4 determination of efficiency of interference on the process of recovery in order to evaluate the effects of interfering ionic species on the resource recovery profiles of the cgs the recovery of each of the major constituents of the nutrient rich wastewater was simulated in aqua matrix that contained varying concentrations of the constituent of interest while the presence of any of the other major constituents of no interest is regarded as interference the efficiency of competition of interfering ionic specie was evaluated by using eq 11 proposed by deb and datta 45 13 e f f i c i e n c y o f i n t e r f e r i n g i o n 1 s o r b a t e u p t a k e i n t

interfering ion versus the initial concentrations of the interfering ionic species in each case were plotted fig 5 7 3 4 1 efficiency of interference on phosphate recovery the efficiency of interference of nitrate on phosphate recovery was studied at initial phosphate concentrations that ranged between 5 2 mg l and 53 1 mg l while the concentrations of the interfering nitrate ranged between 6 2 mg l and 53 4 mg l the influence of each interfering ion on the phosphate recovery process is presented in fig 5 within the initial phosphate concentrations studied the presence of nitrate showed no appreciable impact on the magnitude of phosphate recovered especially at the low level initial phosphate concentrations that ranged between 5 2 and 21 5 mg l above 21 5 mg l phosphate concentration the presence of nitrate minimally reduced the magnitude of phosphate recovered and the value of the efficiency of interfering nitrate was 5 previously it has been established 11 using experimental and literature evidences that the essential mechanisms of phosphate removal from aqua matrix using cgs are adsorption specific and non specific and precipitation reaction viz specific adsorption 14a ca2 hpo4 2 cahpo4 14b ca2 po4 3 capo4 non specific adsorption 14c ca2 hpo4 2 ca2 hpo4 2 precipitation reaction 14d 5ca2 3po4 3 ca5 po4 3oh in the present study the fitting of the time concentration profiles of the nitrate recovery to the pseudo second order kinetic equation implied that the process is controlled by chemisorption considering the very fast recovery rate of phosphate in the single phosphate solution which has also been previously reported 11 the role of precipitation is also assured in the present phosphate recovery process an overview of the chemical equations eq 4a 4c and 14a 14d presented above that highlighted the fundamental mechanisms of phosphate and nitrate recoveries showed that the two ionic species interacted with the cgs through different reaction mechanisms albeit both specific and non specific adsorptions are common occurrences in the recoveries of the two adsorbates but phosphate precipitation is also a prime recovery procedure it has been hypothesised 46 that the interaction between phosphate and the surface of calcium rich materials entails the adsorption of small amounts of phosphate and ensuing precipitation of calcium phosphate going by the understanding that phosphate can be recovered from the aqua phase through precipitation reaction and the minimal effects of interference by nitrate on phosphate recovery it could be inferred that the phosphate precipitation reaction predominated during the phosphate recovery process thus the competition between nitrate and phosphate was minimal the effects of the interfering organic matter on the phosphate recovery process only manifested on the phosphate recovery at higher initial phosphate concentrations i e 20 6 mg l at this higher initial phosphate concentrations the values of the efficiencies of the interfering ha ranged between 1 9 and 7 6 a peep into the essential mechanisms of phosphate and ha recoveries revealed that precipitation reaction dominated the processes this was also affirmed by the very fast rate of recovery of each species from the aqua phase due to the similarities in the underlying mechanisms of the processes of the recovery of these two ionic species they are bound to compete for the available precipitating agent ca2 in the aqua system for the precipitation reaction to take effect the results presented in fig 5 showed that at relatively low phosphate concentration i e 20 6 mg l the available ca2 in the system could effectively precipitate both phosphate and ha thus the efficiency of interference was insignificant at high phosphate concentrations 20 6 mg l the available precipitating agent became insufficient for an effective synchronous precipitation of the two ionic species the results presented in fig 5 indicated that the ca2 precipitating agent showed higher affinity for ha than for phosphate in the aqua matrix thus the precipitation of ha took precedence over the phosphate precipitation and the efficiency of competition of the ha became positive 3 4 2 efficiency of interference on nitrate recovery the results of the determinations of the efficiencies of phosphate and organic matter competition on nitrate recovery are presented in fig 6 the presence of phosphate appreciably impacted the magnitude of nitrate recovery this impact was visible within all the interfering phosphate concentrations studied the values of efficiency of interference ranged between 20 3 at the lowest initial nitrate concentration 6 2 mg l and 70 4 at the highest initial nitrate concentrations 53 4 mg l studied the presence of interfering organic matter also significantly influenced the process of nitrate recovery the efficiency of the interfering organic matter was positive and ranged between 14 and 55 within the initial nitrate concentration range studied appraisals of the impacts of the interference of both phosphate and ha on the magnitude of nitrate recovery showed that the presence of these two interfering ions significantly reduced the magnitude of nitrate recovery it has been highlighted that the mechanisms of the recoveries of the two interfering ionic species were totally different from that of nitrate recovery in precipitation reaction the reaction mechanism is faster thus the available reactive material i e cgs for nitrate recovery is quickly depleted from the aqua matrix the precipitation reaction accounted for the very fast recovery rate of both phosphate and ha from the aqua phase subsequent to the fast depletion of the available reactive species in the aqua matrix in the presence of either ha or phosphate the aqua phase nitrate has limited reactive species to bind with thereby causing the appreciable impact of the interfering ion on the magnitude of nitrate recovery 3 4 3 efficiency of interfering ions on organic matter recovery the results of the determination of the efficiencies of interfering phosphate and nitrate separately on organic matter recovery are presented in fig 7 an overview of the results showed that the two interfering nutrient fractions did not show appreciable impact on the recovery of organic matter at low ha concentrations 6 mg l both interfering ionic species reduced the magnitude of organic matter recovery nevertheless higher concentrations of ha nullified the efficiencies of the two nutrient fractions to interfere in ha recovery the time concentration profiles of the recovery of ha showed that the rate of ha recovery was observed to be very fast it has been suggested that high ionic strengths and the presence of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 promote ha coagulation 47 in aqueous solution considering the nature of the adsorbent used the role of precipitation reaction in ha recovery is assured in the determination of the role of the presence of ha in phosphate recovery it was glaring that the precipitation of ha took precedent over phosphate the observation here also attested to this fact thereby the efficiency of competition of phosphate for ha recovery was negligible fig 7 in the case of the interference of nitrogen since the mode of recovery is different the fast precipitation reaction impeded the reaction that favoured nitrate removal thereby nullifying the competitive ability of nitrate in ha recovery 3 5 implication of interference on the process of resource recovery the evaluation of the recoveries of both the nutrient fractions and organic matter from the synthetic feed water showed that the recovery of organic matter took dominance over any other constituents of the nutrient rich water amongst the nutrient fractions the recovery of phosphate took dominance over nitrate the recovery of organic matter and phosphate are very fast while process of nitrate recovery is rather long thus the recovery of the nitrate fraction of the nutrient rich wastewater may be considered as the rate limiting step if cgs is used as the reactive material albeit in nutrient recovery nitrate and phosphate are usually the ionic species of interests in nutrient rich wastewater but the recovery of organic matter cannot be jettisoned taking into cognizance the surface chemistry and the hydrochemistry of organic matter they naturally provide veritable sites for nutrient fractions and the essential microelements to bind thereby serving as a reservoir of nutrient and microelements required for agricultural operations albeit the high binding capacity of the organic fraction of the wastewater can be advantageous but this binding capacity can also be a disadvantage if there are undesirable ionic species present in the wastewater amongst the shortcomings of struvite crystallization for nutrient recovery that have been identified 46 is the issue of securing the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for fertilizer applications because of the co precipitation of possible undesirable constituents e g pharmaceuticals of the nutrient rich wastewater further research is recommended to evaluate the extent of uptake of undesirable fractions of nutrient rich wastewater in the use of cgs as the reactive material in nutrient recovery amongst the different processes for nutrient recovery struvite precipitation is the leading procedure one of the major limitations of struvite precipitation is that it does not allow for optimal recovery of nitrogen from the nutrient rich wastewater 49 it has been reported that the current implemented struvite recovery technologies only recover less than 3 percent of the n and up to 15 percent of the p found in wastewater 46 for example the concentration of n in urine far exceeds that of p but the struvite precipitation only removes n and p in a 1 1 m ratio necessitating the combination with adsorbent materials to increase the n recovery 46 in the present procedure using synthetic nutrient rich wastewater the nitrate recovery efficiency of the cgs is relatively low when compared with the phosphate and ha recovery nonetheless the procedure still showed higher nitrate recovery efficiency when compared with that of the struvite crystallization procedure because it recovers more than 50 of the available nitrate in the aqua matrix the optimal nitrate recovery capacity of the cgs needs to be properly appraised in real life nutrient rich wastewater to ascertain this claim in terms of the quality characteristics of the treated water the high organic matter recovery propensity of this procedure is also an added advantage consequent upon the high organic matter recovery potential of the cgs a clearer and cleaner water is produced from this procedure thus this procedure have the potential to serve a dual purpose of resource recovery and improved water quality characteristics furthermore the procedure can be a step towards the development of a dual purpose procedure for resource recovery and the development of water recirculation system especially in aquaculture practice were large quantity of water is required for the operations 4 conclusions different reaction mechanism s underlie the recovery of nitrate phosphate and organic matter from aqua matrix using cgs phosphate and organic matter recovery capacities of the cgs were far higher than that of nitrate the process of nitrate recovery is the rate limiting step in nutrient recovery using cgs as the reactive material at low ha concentrations the recovery is minimally impacted by the presence of either phosphate or nitrate the cgs showed higher affinity for ha than either phosphate or nitrate thus organic matter is preferentially recovered over either phosphate or nitrate from aqueous solution onto the cgs appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org

14469,the need to elucidate the influence of the presence of the major components i e organic matter phosphate and nitrate of nutrient rich wastewater on the process of nutrient recovery using calcined gastropod shell cgs necessitated this study the time concentration profiles of the recovery of organic matter phosphate and nitrate were studied in synthetic feed water that contained single adsorbate of interest both the single and binary component equilibrium isotherm parameters were derived to explicate and quantify the impact of the presence of each constituent of the nutrient rich wastewater on the process of resource recovery the time concentration profiles of all the recovery processes showed that the process of nitrate recovery is the rate limiting step in the use of cgs as the reactive material the pseudo second order kinetic equation gave the best description of both the nutrient and organic matter recovery but the processes were described by different equilibrium isotherm equations the determination of the efficiency of interference on nutrient recovery showed that nitrate and organic matter exhibited minimal influence on phosphate recovery but the presence of phosphate and organic matter significantly impacted nitrate recovery the recovery of organic matter was not vitiated by the presence of either phosphate or nitrate the real life implications of the findings from this study showed that the use of cgs as a reactive material in resource recovery from a nutrient rich wastewater would provide a double pronged approach for resource recovery and appreciable treatment of wastewater for reuse keywords nutrient efficiency of interference organic matter phosphate nitrate eutrophication 1 introduction the new concept of ecological sanitation which perceived nutrient rich wastewater as a valuable resource engendered the research into the development of sustainable nutrient i e nitrogen n and phosphorus p recovery protocols aside the high nutrient fraction this wastewater is also replete with other constituents e g organic matter pathogens and inorganic salts that limit the application as fertilizers in agricultural practice some of these non nutrient fractions are non ecofriendly thus the direct application on soils is discouraged to preclude the possible attendant challenges e g salinity aesthetic and odour concerns the bids to develop efficacious nutrient recovery procedures have produced techniques that hinged on solid phase extraction procedures this procedure is a simple conveyance of nutrient from the aqueous phase to a solid phase matrix array of materials that have been used in solid phase extraction of nutrient and nutrient fractions include woodchip acid mine drainage treatment residuals and steel slag 1 polonite and blast furnace slag 2 agar alginate algal blocks 3 porous mgo biochar nanocomposites 4 clinoptilolite 5 raw and calcined shell of african land snail 6 14 the affinity of the surface of a solid matrix for ionic specie and the extent of interaction between them are predisposed to the presence of other ionic species in the system it has been posited 8 that the presence of other ionic species aside the ion of interest impacts the process of removal either synergistically antagonistically or non interactive synergistic and antagonistic actions of interfering ionic components in the adsorption of oxoanions from aqueous system have been reported 9 12 15 in nutrient rich wastewaters suspended and dissolved organic matter are amongst the major constituents therefore it is imperative that sustainable technologies for nutrient recovery should define how the presence of each of the major constituents of the wastewater influences the process of nutrient recovery generally organic matter is a complex heterogeneous mixture consisting of plants and animal remains at various stages of decomposition it comprises organic constituents such as humic acids ha and fulvic acids these organic constituents are coloured aromatic and hydrophobic in nature it also comprises low molecular weight portions that are hydrophilic including aliphatic and nitrogenous compounds such as amino acids carbohydrates and proteins 1 using the hydrochemistry of natural organic matter i e nom as a premise it was postulated that the high adsorption propensity of organic matter on an adsorbent s surface can significantly alter the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and possibly envelopes the reactive sites on the adsorbent 4 6 it is also noteworthy that the deprotonation of carboxylic and phenolic groups on organic matter occurs within the natural ph value of water i e in weakly acidic to basic medium 7 this ultimately conferred negative charges on the molecules of the organic matter thus in the aqua matrix the nutrient fractions and the deprotonated organic matter molecules bear similar charges consequent upon the high concentration of organic matter in nutrient rich wastewaters the predilection of organic matter to alter the surface chemistry of solid surfaces and the similarity in their surface charges with that of the nutrient fractions in the aqua matrix we hereby hypothesize that competition may be induced between the nutrient and the organic matter fractions in the aqueous solution for the available reactive sites on the adsorbent which vitiates the efficiency of the nutrient recovery process the promise of the calcined shell of a gastropod cgs as a green and sustainable reactive material in the recovery of phosphorus from aquaculture wastewater has been previously reported 11 in order to verify our hypothesis the influence of the presence of each of the major constituents of nutrient rich wastewater i e organic matter nitrate and phosphate on the process of recovery of each fraction i e organic matter nitrate and phosphate by cgs shall be elucidated the time concentration profiles of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and organic matter shall be studied in a synthetic nutrient rich water that contains single adsorbate i e po4 3 no3 and organic matter and binary i e po4 3 no3 po4 3 ha and no3 ha synthetic feed water both the single and binary component equilibrium isotherm parameters shall be derived to elucidate and quantify the impacts of the presence of each constituent of the nutrient rich wastewater on the process of resource recovery using cgs the implications of the findings from this study shall be related to the real life nutrient recovery process from nutrient rich wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of gs premised on earlier findings 11 pulverized shell of gastropod derived from african giant land snail achatina achatina was calcined at 750 in the furnace for 2 h to obtain the cgs the bet surface area of the cgs was determined using an asap 2010 micromeritics instrument by brunauer emmett teller bet method the elemental and the mineralogical profiles were determined using x ray fluorescence xrf and x ray diffractometer xrd respectively the surface architecture and elemental composition were determined using scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive analysis of x rays edax while the chemical functionalities on the surface of the cgs were determined using ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa 2 2 nutrient and organic matter recovery process the study on the influence of organic matter on nutrient recovery efficiency was carried out by dissolving varying concentrations mg l of ha in deionised water nutrient rich water was prepared from the dissolution of appropriate potassium salt of the respective nutrient fraction i e kh2po4 and kno3 in deionised water the salts of similar cation were chosen to even out the influence of the index cation of the respective nutrient fraction on the recovery process the rate of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and organic matter were determined by the addition of 0 5 g of cgs into 1 0 l of the synthetic feed water that contains a known concentration of any of the adsorbates of interest i e po4 3 no3 and ha the concentration range of the nutrient fractions i e po4 3 and no3 was between 5 and 50 mg l while that of ha was between 2 5 and 30 mg l the concentration range chosen for each adsorbate represents the low and medium range values of the adsorbate in real life system 16 20 the adsorbate adsorbent mixture was agitated at 200 rpm on a thermostatic shaker and samples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals that ranged between 0 and 60 min for po4 3 and ha and between 0 and 8 h for no3 shorter withdrawal time intervals were chosen for both po4 3 and ha because of the faster rate of attainment of equilibrium time relative to no3 the withdrawn samples were filtered using 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane and the residual concentration of the respective adsorbate i e po4 3 no3 and ha was determined using the appropriate standard methods highlighted below in both the single and binary solution systems the equilibrium isotherm analysis of the process of resource recovery was conducted by contacting 0 1 g of the cgs with 50 ml solution of known adsorbate concentration the adsorbate concentrations ranged between 5 and 50 mg l for po3 2 and no3 and 2 5 and 30 mg l for ha the different concentrations of the adsorbate of interest and the interfering ionic species used in the preparation of the binary and single solutions systems are presented in supplementary information table 1 6 si table the mixture was stirred on a thermostatic shaker at 200 rpm until the attainment of the equilibrium time samples were withdrawn filtered using 0 45 μm polypropylene membrane and the residual adsorbate concentration was analysed in each case as highlighted below the concentration of phosphate in the filtered sample was determined by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method 21 nitrate was determined using the cadmium reduction method 21 and ha was quantified using the uv254 absorbance determination at λmax 254 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer 21 the amount of each adsorbate recovered per unit mass of the cgs in mg g was quantified using the mass balance equation 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of materials the results of the xrf analysis table 1 of the cgs affirmed the erstwhile claim that the cgs is a calcium rich material 6 13 the diffractogram of the cgs fig 1 revealed the crystalline architecture consequent upon the fact that caco3 is the principal component of the shells of gastropods 13 and 14 the miller indices of the three polymorphs of caco3 aragonite calcite and vaterite were used as the diagnostic tools in the interpretation of the prominent peaks in the diffractogram of the cgs fig 1 the miller indices employed were 111 and 221 for aragonite 104 and 113 for calcite and 110 112 114 300 224 and 211 for vaterite 22 in the diffractogram of the cgs the vaterite peaks appeared at 63 19 2 1 1 and 72 68 3 0 0 while the calcite peak appeared at 43 70 1 1 3 none of the aragonite peaks was observed in the diffractogram of the cgs previously from the xrd analysis of the raw gs the presence of the three polymorphs of caco3 at 26 26 1 1 1 and 46 03 2 2 1 for aragonite 52 89 1 1 3 for calcite and 37 93 1 1 2 for vaterite was reported 11 juxtaposing the results from the xrd analysis of both the raw gs and cgs showed the total disappearance of the aragonite peaks in the cgs this is an indication that the transformation of the polymorphs of the caco3 in one form to another occurred with thermal treatment in the ftir spectra of the cgs the peaks of the n hstr that appeared at 2978 2877 and 3452 cm 1 were attributed to ammonium ions and primary amines from complex protein i e conchin in the outer shells of gastropods conchin is amongst the organic macromolecules primarily proteins and polysaccharides that form the microenvironment where the caco3 crystals nucleated and grew the multiple co3 2 peaks cm 1 at 2588 2515 2372 2314 2133 1801 1624 1419 and 871 were attributed to the presence of the different caco3 polymorphs in addition to the presence of multiple co3 2 peaks that were identified in the cgs a single cao peaks was also identified at 3630 cm 1 the mineralogical assemblage of the cgs fig 1 did not reflect the presence of cao which supports the claim that the conversion of caco3 to cao occurs only at temperatures above 900 c the inability of the xrd to identify the presence of cao in the cgs could be ascribed to the fact that the magnitude of this metal oxide in the cgs must be insignificant fig 2 the sem image fig 3 a showed that the surface of the cgs is made up of a grooved surface with sharp and rough edges oladoja et al 11 suggested from their studies that the calcination of raw gs at 750 could enhance surface defects that increase the number of atoms with highly defective coordination environments on the surface of the material these atoms are located on the surface of the cgs and they possess partially filled valence orbitals which provide them with rich active sites for the uptake of phosphate from the aqua matrix the results of the edax analysis showed ca c and o as the major identifiable elements in cgs fig 3b this is a confirmation of the rich caco3 nature of the material the specific surface area of the cgs obtained through bet method was 4 44 m2 g the value of the single point adsorption total pore volume of pores was 0 012604 cm³ g while the value of adsorption average pore width 4 v a by bet was 113 5256 å 3 2 time concentration profiles of the recovery process 3 2 1 phosphate and ha recovery in single solute solution system the time concentration profiles of the recovery of each ionic species of interest from the synthetic feed water are presented in fig 4 a c the appraisal of time concentration profiles of the three ionic species showed that the rate and time of attainment of the state of equilibrium varied the processes of recovery of phosphate and ha were faster than that of nitrate thus the states of equilibrium were attained faster in phosphate and ha recovery than in nitrate recovery within the initial phosphate concentrations studied the attainment of the state of equilibrium was almost instantaneous fig 4a the process of recovery of ha attained equilibrium in less than 30 min fig 4c while the equilibrium state was attained after six hours 6 h in nitrate recovery fig 4b a in all the adsorbate studied the attainment of the state of equilibrium was not initial concentration dependent rather the magnitude of adsorbate recovered per gram of the adsorbent depended on the initial adsorbate concentrations the rate parameters of the recovery process were derived from the fittings of the data obtained from the determination of the time concentration profiles to the pseudo first order eq 1 23 and pseudo second order eq 2 24 kinetic equations 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where qe is the adsorption capacity mg g of the cgs at equilibrium and qt is the adsorption capacity mg g of the cgs at time t k 1 is the overall rate constants g mg min of pseudo first order pfo equation and k 2 is the overall rate constants g mg min of pseudo second order equation pso the fittings of the time concentration profile data of the recovery of the nutrient fractions and ha to the two kinetic equations table 2 revealed that the pso equation described the process better r2 0 9 than the pfo equation r2 0 90 the values of the qe mg g increased linearly with increasing initial adsorbate concentration the values of the pso rate constant k2 also increased with increasing initial adsorbate concentration but the increment was not directly related to the initial adsorbate concentration the non rectilinear profile of the k2 values with the initial adsorbate concentration contradicted the commonly reported trends as a rule the k2 value is expected to decrease with the increasing initial adsorbate concentrations this is the common assumption that is related to the interpretation of k2 as a time scaling factor i e the higher the initial adsorbate concentrations the longer the system is required to reach the state of equilibrium 25 28 despite the assumption that the values of k2 is strongly dependent on the initial adsorbate concentration cases where k2 values are independent of initial adsorbate concentrations have also been reported 29 36 consequent upon the conflicting trends in the relationship between k2 and the initial adsorbate concentrations a theoretical analysis of the kinetic models of adsorption for the system that obeys the pso kinetic equation was performed azizian et al 37 the results obtained from this theoretical analysis showed that the observed k2 values for any system is a complex function of the initial concentration of adsorbate 34 previously it has been elucidated that one of the underlying mechanism of phosphorus recovery from aqua system using calcined gs was chemisorption due to the higher fitting of the pso kinetic equation 11 other experimental and theoretical evidences were also reported to affirm the occurrence of precipitation reaction in addition to the chemisorption mode of adsorption 11 hitherto a critical analysis of the mechanisms that underlie ha recovery using a multivalent cation rich material as a reactive material i e nano mgo revealed that the possible reaction mechanisms could be attributed to a series of reactions that involved precipitation complexation and destructive adsorption 38 it has been advanced that in a high ionic aqueous medium with multivalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 the coagulation of ha molecule is activated 38 39 considering the fact that cgs is a predominantly multivalent cation i e ca2 the core mechanism of ha recovery using cgs as the reactive material can be ascribed to ha precipitation and or adsorption on the surface of cao or hydrated cao and the possible carbonation products as enunciated previously 40 on the strength of the evidences that precipitation reaction is one of the core mechanisms of ha and phosphate recoveries the time concentration profiles of the recoveries of ha and phosphate were also fitted to the avrami fractional kinetic equation this enabled the determination of the kinetics parameters for the possible precipitate formations the theoretical basis of the avrami fractional kinetic equation hinged on the description of changes in the volume of crystals as function of time during the process of crystallization 11 41 the linearized form of this equation by simple linear regression is presented in eq 3 3 ln ln 1 f ln b k ln t where f is the fraction adsorbed qt qe at time t b is a temperature dependent constant similar to a rate constant while k is the avrami exponent which reflects the dimensionality of crystal growth the avrami exponent k value can be 3 k 4 for three dimensional growth 2 k 3 for two dimensional growth or 1 k 2 for one dimensional growth the kinetic parameters obtained from the fittings of the avrami fractional kinetic equation to ha and phosphate recoveries are presented in table 2 in relation to the other kinetic equations fitted to the process of recoveries of ha and phosphate this equation the avrami equation gave a good description of the recovery of both phosphate and ha from aqueous streams the values of the coefficient of determination r2 obtained were higher than those obtained from the fitting of the pfo kinetic equation but fell below those obtained from the pso kinetic equation the values of the avrami exponent k which ranged between 0 077and 0 72 for phosphate recovery and 0 427 and 0 558 for ha recovery showed that the propagation of the precipitate formed from the interaction of both phosphate and ha with the cgs occurred in one dimension 3 2 2 nitrate recovery a preliminary evaluation of the possible interactions between the aqueous phase nitrate and the cgs showed that nitrate recovery using cgs cannot be effected through precipitation reaction or any form of phase change reactions considering the theoretical basis for the derivation of the avrami fractional kinetic equation and the possible underlying mechanisms of nitrate recovery from the aqua phase it was considered inappropriate to fit the time concentration profile data of the nitrate recovery process to the avrami fractional kinetic equation 41 thus the time concentration profile data were analyzed using pfo and pso kinetic equations only table 2 at present the higher fittings of the pseudo second order kinetic equation table 2 to the process of nitrate recovery r2 0 9 indicated the role of chemisorption or ion exchange as an important reaction mechanism in the recovery process in order to define the possible modes of interactions between the cgs and nitrate in the aqua matrix the speciation of the aqua phase nitrate and the surface chemistry of the cgs were elucidated using medusa make equilibrium diagrams using sophisticated algorithms and hydra hydrochemical equilibrium constant database 42 this software was used to calculate the chemical equilibrium data within the operational ph value 7 0 of the recovery process the chemical equilibrium data fig 4b b showed that the prevailing ionic species in the reacting mixture were ca2 and no3 but the products of interactions between these ionic species were cano3 and ca no3 2 at ph value 8 8 the formation of caoh occurred which also provided an active site for electrostatic interaction with nitrate using the information derived from the chemical equilibrium data the possible interactions between the cgs and no3 is hereby proposed as a combination of both specific and non specific adsorption the chemical equations that depict the two modes of adsorption are presented below specific adsorption 4a ca2 no3 cano3 4b ca2 2no3 ca no3 2 non specific adsorption ph value 8 8 4c caoh no3 caoh no3 3 3 equilibrium isotherm analysis of the recovery process in order to define the characteristics of the mode of interactions of cgs with the different ionic species in the aqua system the linear forms of the following equilibrium isotherm equations eq 4 9 were used to analyze the process of recovery of each of the ionic species the theoretical basis of each equilibrium isotherm equation is presented in the supplementary information file si 1 5 l a n g m u i r c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m 6 f r e u n d l i c h l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e 7 t e m k i n q e b 1 l

results presented in table 3 indicated that the process of recovery of each adsorbate was described by different equilibrium isotherm equations used the process of phosphate r2 0 9386 and ha recovery r2 0 9782 were best described by the harkins jura equilibrium isotherm equation while the process of nitrate recovery was best described r2 0 9787 by the freundlich isotherm equation the description of the recovery process by different isotherm equations indicated that the mode of adsorbent adsorbate interactions in each case was different the harkins jura adsorption isotherm can be expressed 43

occurred through a multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent and there is a distribution of the adsorbate on the heterogeneous pores on the adsorbent considering the theoretical basis for the derivation of freundlich equilibrium isotherm the process of recovery of nitrate must have occurred on the heterogeneous sites on the cgs 3 4 determination of efficiency of interference on the process of recovery in order to evaluate the effects of interfering ionic species on the resource recovery profiles of the cgs the recovery of each of the major constituents of the nutrient rich wastewater was simulated in aqua matrix that contained varying concentrations of the constituent of interest while the presence of any of the other major constituents of no interest is regarded as interference the efficiency of competition of interfering ionic specie was evaluated by using eq 11 proposed by deb and datta 45 13 e f f i c i e n c y o f i n t e r f e r i n g i o n 1 s o r b a t e u p t a k e i n t

interfering ion versus the initial concentrations of the interfering ionic species in each case were plotted fig 5 7 3 4 1 efficiency of interference on phosphate recovery the efficiency of interference of nitrate on phosphate recovery was studied at initial phosphate concentrations that ranged between 5 2 mg l and 53 1 mg l while the concentrations of the interfering nitrate ranged between 6 2 mg l and 53 4 mg l the influence of each interfering ion on the phosphate recovery process is presented in fig 5 within the initial phosphate concentrations studied the presence of nitrate showed no appreciable impact on the magnitude of phosphate recovered especially at the low level initial phosphate concentrations that ranged between 5 2 and 21 5 mg l above 21 5 mg l phosphate concentration the presence of nitrate minimally reduced the magnitude of phosphate recovered and the value of the efficiency of interfering nitrate was 5 previously it has been established 11 using experimental and literature evidences that the essential mechanisms of phosphate removal from aqua matrix using cgs are adsorption specific and non specific and precipitation reaction viz specific adsorption 14a ca2 hpo4 2 cahpo4 14b ca2 po4 3 capo4 non specific adsorption 14c ca2 hpo4 2 ca2 hpo4 2 precipitation reaction 14d 5ca2 3po4 3 ca5 po4 3oh in the present study the fitting of the time concentration profiles of the nitrate recovery to the pseudo second order kinetic equation implied that the process is controlled by chemisorption considering the very fast recovery rate of phosphate in the single phosphate solution which has also been previously reported 11 the role of precipitation is also assured in the present phosphate recovery process an overview of the chemical equations eq 4a 4c and 14a 14d presented above that highlighted the fundamental mechanisms of phosphate and nitrate recoveries showed that the two ionic species interacted with the cgs through different reaction mechanisms albeit both specific and non specific adsorptions are common occurrences in the recoveries of the two adsorbates but phosphate precipitation is also a prime recovery procedure it has been hypothesised 46 that the interaction between phosphate and the surface of calcium rich materials entails the adsorption of small amounts of phosphate and ensuing precipitation of calcium phosphate going by the understanding that phosphate can be recovered from the aqua phase through precipitation reaction and the minimal effects of interference by nitrate on phosphate recovery it could be inferred that the phosphate precipitation reaction predominated during the phosphate recovery process thus the competition between nitrate and phosphate was minimal the effects of the interfering organic matter on the phosphate recovery process only manifested on the phosphate recovery at higher initial phosphate concentrations i e 20 6 mg l at this higher initial phosphate concentrations the values of the efficiencies of the interfering ha ranged between 1 9 and 7 6 a peep into the essential mechanisms of phosphate and ha recoveries revealed that precipitation reaction dominated the processes this was also affirmed by the very fast rate of recovery of each species from the aqua phase due to the similarities in the underlying mechanisms of the processes of the recovery of these two ionic species they are bound to compete for the available precipitating agent ca2 in the aqua system for the precipitation reaction to take effect the results presented in fig 5 showed that at relatively low phosphate concentration i e 20 6 mg l the available ca2 in the system could effectively precipitate both phosphate and ha thus the efficiency of interference was insignificant at high phosphate concentrations 20 6 mg l the available precipitating agent became insufficient for an effective synchronous precipitation of the two ionic species the results presented in fig 5 indicated that the ca2 precipitating agent showed higher affinity for ha than for phosphate in the aqua matrix thus the precipitation of ha took precedence over the phosphate precipitation and the efficiency of competition of the ha became positive 3 4 2 efficiency of interference on nitrate recovery the results of the determinations of the efficiencies of phosphate and organic matter competition on nitrate recovery are presented in fig 6 the presence of phosphate appreciably impacted the magnitude of nitrate recovery this impact was visible within all the interfering phosphate concentrations studied the values of efficiency of interference ranged between 20 3 at the lowest initial nitrate concentration 6 2 mg l and 70 4 at the highest initial nitrate concentrations 53 4 mg l studied the presence of interfering organic matter also significantly influenced the process of nitrate recovery the efficiency of the interfering organic matter was positive and ranged between 14 and 55 within the initial nitrate concentration range studied appraisals of the impacts of the interference of both phosphate and ha on the magnitude of nitrate recovery showed that the presence of these two interfering ions significantly reduced the magnitude of nitrate recovery it has been highlighted that the mechanisms of the recoveries of the two interfering ionic species were totally different from that of nitrate recovery in precipitation reaction the reaction mechanism is faster thus the available reactive material i e cgs for nitrate recovery is quickly depleted from the aqua matrix the precipitation reaction accounted for the very fast recovery rate of both phosphate and ha from the aqua phase subsequent to the fast depletion of the available reactive species in the aqua matrix in the presence of either ha or phosphate the aqua phase nitrate has limited reactive species to bind with thereby causing the appreciable impact of the interfering ion on the magnitude of nitrate recovery 3 4 3 efficiency of interfering ions on organic matter recovery the results of the determination of the efficiencies of interfering phosphate and nitrate separately on organic matter recovery are presented in fig 7 an overview of the results showed that the two interfering nutrient fractions did not show appreciable impact on the recovery of organic matter at low ha concentrations 6 mg l both interfering ionic species reduced the magnitude of organic matter recovery nevertheless higher concentrations of ha nullified the efficiencies of the two nutrient fractions to interfere in ha recovery the time concentration profiles of the recovery of ha showed that the rate of ha recovery was observed to be very fast it has been suggested that high ionic strengths and the presence of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 promote ha coagulation 47 in aqueous solution considering the nature of the adsorbent used the role of precipitation reaction in ha recovery is assured in the determination of the role of the presence of ha in phosphate recovery it was glaring that the precipitation of ha took precedent over phosphate the observation here also attested to this fact thereby the efficiency of competition of phosphate for ha recovery was negligible fig 7 in the case of the interference of nitrogen since the mode of recovery is different the fast precipitation reaction impeded the reaction that favoured nitrate removal thereby nullifying the competitive ability of nitrate in ha recovery 3 5 implication of interference on the process of resource recovery the evaluation of the recoveries of both the nutrient fractions and organic matter from the synthetic feed water showed that the recovery of organic matter took dominance over any other constituents of the nutrient rich water amongst the nutrient fractions the recovery of phosphate took dominance over nitrate the recovery of organic matter and phosphate are very fast while process of nitrate recovery is rather long thus the recovery of the nitrate fraction of the nutrient rich wastewater may be considered as the rate limiting step if cgs is used as the reactive material albeit in nutrient recovery nitrate and phosphate are usually the ionic species of interests in nutrient rich wastewater but the recovery of organic matter cannot be jettisoned taking into cognizance the surface chemistry and the hydrochemistry of organic matter they naturally provide veritable sites for nutrient fractions and the essential microelements to bind thereby serving as a reservoir of nutrient and microelements required for agricultural operations albeit the high binding capacity of the organic fraction of the wastewater can be advantageous but this binding capacity can also be a disadvantage if there are undesirable ionic species present in the wastewater amongst the shortcomings of struvite crystallization for nutrient recovery that have been identified 46 is the issue of securing the quality and safety of the recovered nutrients for fertilizer applications because of the co precipitation of possible undesirable constituents e g pharmaceuticals of the nutrient rich wastewater further research is recommended to evaluate the extent of uptake of undesirable fractions of nutrient rich wastewater in the use of cgs as the reactive material in nutrient recovery amongst the different processes for nutrient recovery struvite precipitation is the leading procedure one of the major limitations of struvite precipitation is that it does not allow for optimal recovery of nitrogen from the nutrient rich wastewater 49 it has been reported that the current implemented struvite recovery technologies only recover less than 3 percent of the n and up to 15 percent of the p found in wastewater 46 for example the concentration of n in urine far exceeds that of p but the struvite precipitation only removes n and p in a 1 1 m ratio necessitating the combination with adsorbent materials to increase the n recovery 46 in the present procedure using synthetic nutrient rich wastewater the nitrate recovery efficiency of the cgs is relatively low when compared with the phosphate and ha recovery nonetheless the procedure still showed higher nitrate recovery efficiency when compared with that of the struvite crystallization procedure because it recovers more than 50 of the available nitrate in the aqua matrix the optimal nitrate recovery capacity of the cgs needs to be properly appraised in real life nutrient rich wastewater to ascertain this claim in terms of the quality characteristics of the treated water the high organic matter recovery propensity of this procedure is also an added advantage consequent upon the high organic matter recovery potential of the cgs a clearer and cleaner water is produced from this procedure thus this procedure have the potential to serve a dual purpose of resource recovery and improved water quality characteristics furthermore the procedure can be a step towards the development of a dual purpose procedure for resource recovery and the development of water recirculation system especially in aquaculture practice were large quantity of water is required for the operations 4 conclusions different reaction mechanism s underlie the recovery of nitrate phosphate and organic matter from aqua matrix using cgs phosphate and organic matter recovery capacities of the cgs were far higher than that of nitrate the process of nitrate recovery is the rate limiting step in nutrient recovery using cgs as the reactive material at low ha concentrations the recovery is minimally impacted by the presence of either phosphate or nitrate the cgs showed higher affinity for ha than either phosphate or nitrate thus organic matter is preferentially recovered over either phosphate or nitrate from aqueous solution onto the cgs appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org
