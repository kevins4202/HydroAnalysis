4000,drought is a multifaceted natural phenomenon with diverse spatial and temporal characteristics and significant environmental social and economic effects the utility of conventional drought indices based on the assumption of stationarity is questionable due to the advent of rapid environmental change we proposed a non stationary standardized precipitation index spins to reassess the nature of meteorological drought precipitation observations from eight rain gauge stations for 1961 2017 in south korea were fitted to a non stationary gamma distribution using a generalized additive model in location scale and shape algorithm drought duration and severity were identified by spins and joint and conditional return periods were estimated using copula based bivariate probabilities the results show that average drought duration severity and frequency obtained from spins were more severe than those produced by a conventional standardized precipitation index spic the average inter arrival time was 41 46 months and 39 86 months for spic and spins respectively at the seoul station the joint return periods of observed drought event from march 2008 to june 2008 with a duration of 4 months and a severity of 4 8 were 10 4 and 6 4 years for the spic and spins respectively at the seoul station we conclude that return periods calculated using the spins are more reliable than those calculated by the spic these findings should prove helpful in drought management and risk assessment under a changing environment as effective management requires prior knowledge of events keywords non stationary drought index meteorological drought conditional probability return period 1 introduction the frequency of floods and droughts have increased due to climate change in recent years droughts are generally caused by lack of precipitation over an extended period of time jehanzaib et al 2020a unlike other natural disasters that tend to be sudden drought can be slow and often go unnoticed however the magnitude of damage associated with drought the extent of affected area and other detrimental effects can be severe lee and kim 2013 kim and jehanzaib 2020 drought damage is a persistent concern for many countries worldwide for example in the united states the economic damage associated with drought is thought to exceed an average of 10 billion per event ncdc 2016 in korea extreme droughts extending more than two years have triggered significant water shortages understanding the characteristics of drought recurrence is important for sustainable development yoo et al

hydrological drought in bivariate frequency analysis kang and jiang 2019 but almost no studies applied bivariate frequency analysis considering the non stationarity of meteorological drought which is the basis of all other drought types unlike previous studies we developed a non stationary spi considering the non stationarity of meteorological data in addition the effects of the characteristics of a non stationary drought index were evaluated using bivariate frequency analysis the main objectives of this research are 1 development of a non stationary drought index for assessment of meteorological drought 2 evaluation of the impact of the non stationary characteristics of meteorological drought on bivariate frequency analysis and 3 comparative evaluation of bivariate frequency analysis between conventional and non stationary drought indices the proposed non stationary drought index and its bivariate analysis should prove useful in assessment of drought and can be used to manage water resources 2 study area and data south korea occupies the southern part of the korean peninsula the climate is humid and heavily influenced by the monsoon season seasonal changes are distinct with humid hot and short summer featuring heavy downpours that supply 50 to 60 of annual precipitation and winters that are long dry and cold this high rainfall concentration in the summer can be followed by drought from the autumn through the following spring the mean annual temperature ranges from approximately 10 to 14 5 c while the average annual precipitation ranges from 700 to 2 000 mm in the northern regions 700 to 1 700 mm in the central regions and 1 000 to 2 400 mm in the south lee et al 2019 in this study eight meteorological stations managed by the korea meteorological administration kma were selected fig 1 because they offer almost 60 years of data data on precipitation and temperature at these stations were collected from the kma s website https data kma go kr cmmn main do from 1961 to 2017 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index the conventional spi spic as proposed by mckee et al 1993 is commonly used to characterize meteorological drought computation is simple as it depends only on precipitation first a long term monthly precipitation series is calculated at a given time scale using the moving average method this precipitation series can be fitted to a two parameter gamma distribution as recommended by mckee et al 1993 1 f x μ σ 1 γ μ σ μ x μ 1 e x σ f o r x 0 2 γ μ 0 x μ 1 e x d x where µ and σ are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ represents a gamma function the cumulative probabilities of the gamma distribution are transformed into a standard normal variate with a zero mean and unit standard deviation an spic value less than 1 0 denotes a drought condition as shown in table 1 the drought characteristics duration and severity were defined and extracted as follows the drought duration d is the time period when the drought index values are continuously below the threshold while the drought severity s is the cumulative deficit below the threshold corresponding to the d 3 2 non stationary spi in general the spic fits precipitation data to a stationary marginal distribution with constant parameters due to the significant impact of climate change signals a precipitation series can represent non stationary characteristics particularly when the length of the time series exceeds 30 years russo et al 2013 before applying a non stationary spi spins the mean variance and slope of precipitation data used in this analysis were found varying with time which shows the precipitation data is non stationary the spi spins was defined in this study analogously to the spic in which the precipitation series was fitted by a non stationary probability distribution with time variant parameters rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a gamlss which is widely used to evaluate non stationary time series a gamlss uses semi parametric regression in which parametric distribution assumptions are required for the response variable and the parameters of the selected distribution vary as linear and or nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables and or random effects wang et al 2015 in a gamlss the observed time series x t of time t 1 2 n follows a probability distribution function f x t ψ t conditional on ψ t ψ t 1 ψ t 2 ψ t k depicting a vector of m distribution parameters at time t the location shape and scale parameters are described by distribution parameter ψ which is associated with explanatory variables via the monotonic link functions ω i given by eq 3 3 ω i ψ i x i α i α 0 i α 1 i x α q i x q i 1 2 k where x i represents the explanatory variables α i s are the coefficients of the polynomial k is the number of parameters and q is the degree of the polynomial in this study a long term precipitation series was fitted to a non stationary gamma distribution with its location parameter μ associated with time the optimal degree of the polynomial was chosen on the basis of the akaike information criterion aic the cumulative probabilities of the non stationary gamma distribution were converted into a standard normal variate similar to the spic the gamlss related calculations were carried out using the gamlss package in r software stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the criteria for defining a drought remained the same as those for the sric 3 3 copula functions copulas functions combine two or more probability distributions to form multivariate distributions the key difference between conventional multivariate distributions and copulas is that copulas do not need variables with similar types of probability distributions this gives a copula the freedom to include univariate probability distributions when two random variables y 1 and y 2 follow arbitrary probability distribution functions f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 respectively then copula function c links these two probability distributions to form joint probability distribution functions f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 as shown in eq 4 4 f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 c f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 in eq 4 the copula can define a bivariate distribution in terms of the univariate moreover if f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 are continuous then c is unique shiau et al 2007 and the joint probability density function can be given as eq 5 5 f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 c f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 where f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 are the probability density functions of f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 respectively and c is the density function of c which can be expressed as 6 c u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 where u 1 and u 2 are the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of a univariate probability distribution many copula families including archimedean elliptical and extreme value ev are available most previous studies report that archimedean and ev copulas are the most commonly employed in hydrology and water resources shiau et al 2007 yoo et al 2013 kang and jiang 2019 we applied six types of copulas clayton frank gumble joe t copula and galambos and the best copula of each station was selected based on the p value of cramer von mises test the copula parameters were estimated using the common maximum likelihood estimation mle method 3 4 goodness of fit test in this study five probability distributions including gamma log normal log logistic weibull and exponential were selected to fit drought characteristics and the best distribution was selected based on the aic a cramer von mises test has been widely used in previous studies for the selection of best copula genest et al 2009 requena et al 2016 in this analysis the best copula was selected by applying a cramer von mises goodness of fit test in the form of eq 7 7 s n n e n u e λ u 2 d e n u 8 e n u 1 u 2 1 n i 1 n i u i 1 u 1 u i 2 u 2 where u i 1 and u i 2 are ranked pseudo observations and i is the indicator function the p values were calculated using the parametric bootstrap method with 1000 runs the copula with the highest p value was chosen a goodness of fit test was performed using the copula package in r 3 5 joint and conditional probability of drought copula based joint distribution of drought characteristics can be used to generate useful information for drought management the probability of both drought duration and severity simultaneously exceeding a certain threshold can provide useful information for government agencies to improve water management during a drought this joint probability can easily be calculated using copula shiau 2006 as expressed by eq 9 9 p d d a n d s s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s where d and s represent drought duration and severity respectively conditional probabilities of drought can be obtained from a copula based bivariate analysis determination of probabilities of drought duration given drought severity exceeding a certain threshold s or probabilities of drought severity given drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d are also helpful shiau 2006 as in eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s 11 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d 3 6 joint and conditional return period of drought a drought return period which is the average time between drought occurrences of a specific magnitude can be used to determine the recurring characteristics of drought a joint or bivariate return period is more informative for drought assessment and management than a univariate return period bivariate copula analysis can be used to estimate a bivariate return period the joint return period of drought characteristics duration and severity can be divided into and and or cases as in eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 t d a n d s e l p d

terms of conditional return period such as the conditional return period of drought duration if the severity exceeds a certain threshold and vice versa condition return periods can be calculated using eqs 14 and 15 shiau 2006 14 t d s s e l 1 f s s 1 f s s f d d c f s s f d d 15 t d s s e l 1 f s s 1 f s s f d d c f s s f d d 4 results and discussion 4 1 computing stationary and non stationary spi in this study drought calculations were made at a 12 month time scale due to the suitability of a longer time scale for describing water resources mishra and singh 2010 and an spi at a 12 month scale is closely related to other drought indices such as the palmar drought index svoboda et al 2012 the spic was calculated at a 12 month scale by fitting a stationary gamma distribution to long term monthly precipitation data and spins was calculated at a 12 month scale by fitting a non stationary gamma distribution using a gamlss algorithm the location parameter of the non stationary gamma distribution varied as a polynomial function of time the degree of the polynomial q was less than or equal to 12 and the optimal q of the gamlss was selected based on the aic the spic and spins were compared based on the aic at all meteorological stations fig 2 the aic of the spic at all stations was greater than that of the spins the model with the lowest aic was considered the best fit model wang et al 2015 ahn and palmer 2016 the comparison showed the superiority of the spins over the spic we also verified the performance of the gamlss by drawing a centile plot at all stations fig 3 clearly demonstrates that gamlss was able to capture the non stationarity of meteorological data as all points lie between the 5 and 95 percentile curves comparative results of the probability distribution of the spic and spins at the seoul station are shown in fig 4 and results for other stations are provided in a supplementary file the probability distribution of the spins accurately represents the actual conditions but the spic with fixed parameters includes only the best fit line fig 4 also indicates that the deviation of the spic from a 1 1 line is high compared to that of the spins significant variation in the mean of stationary and non stationary distributions is evident as shown in fig 5 a we compared the performance of the spic and spins with historical drought events at the seoul station as shown in fig 5 b both drought indices captured drought conditions well but the drought events identified by the srins were more severe compared with those of the spic the srins captured all drought events faithfully with the exception of a drought in 1976 1978 while the spic did not accurately predict actual drought conditions including the 2000 2001 and 2007 2009 events the spic revealed the problem of under prediction which is why the droughts predicted by the spic were less severe these comprehensive results indicate that the spins is a more robust and reliable drought index for drought monitoring 4 2 estimating drought characteristics and fitting probability distributions drought duration severity and frequency were calculated for both the spic and spins table 2 the mean values of drought characteristics calculated using the spins at the seoul station are more severe compared with those produced by the spic the average drought severity calculated using the sric was 13 59 6 63 16 88 13 78 8 72 6 07 8 77 and 7 43 at the chupungryung gangneung gwangju jeonju pohang seoul ulsan and yeosu stations respectively the drought frequency was shorter and the inter arrival time of drought was lower in the spins at most stations compared with the spic results the correlation between drought characteristics duration and severity was computed using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the correlations between drought duration and drought severity calculated using spic and spins are shown in fig 6 drought duration and severity were fitted to exponential gamma log normal log logistic and weibull marginal distributions the best distribution was selected based on the aic as provided in table 3 table 4 supplied the results of best fit distributions and the parameters for drought duration and severity the parameters of marginal distributions were calculated using the mle the weibull distribution was considered optimal for drought duration and the exponential distribution was the most useful for drought severity at most stations when using the spins for the spic the exponential distribution was selected as the best for both severity and duration at most stations 4 3 selecting the best copulas six copulas were selected and applied to construct a dependence structure between drought duration and severity the best copula was selected based on the p value of a cramer von mises test the selected copulas for all stations and their parameters are provided in table 5 the parameters were calculated using the mle method as in table 5 clayton frank and gumbel copulas had the highest p values and were used in further analysis these results are consistent with those of previous studies yoo et al 2013 tosunoglu and can 2016 kang and jiang 2019 which suggested archimedean copulas perform well in hydrological applications due to space limitation the graphical goodness of fit for copula at seoul station was provided in the supplementary file the frank copula which was selected as the best was used to construct joint probabilities of drought duration and severity at the seoul station the joint probabilities of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 at the seoul station lasting 4 months and with a severity of 4 8 were 0 58 and 0 39 for the spic and spins respectively 4 4 estimating joint and conditional probabilities of drought estimation of joint and conditional probabilities for drought characteristics plays a vital role in drought management simultaneous knowledge of the probability of drought duration and severity exceeding a certain threshold can be invaluable following a drought event similar to the one discussed in section 4 3 an event march 2008 to june 2008 with a duration d of 4 months and severity s of 4 8 the joint probabilities of a drought at the seoul station lasting for 4 months with a severity exceeding 4 8 were 0 36 and 0 55 for the spic and spins respectively the main focus of frequency analysis of drought is not just to determine the joint probability of drought duration and severity exceeding a certain threshold the estimation of the conditional probability of drought characteristics such as the probability of drought duration drought severity given drought severity drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d s is of utmost importance the condition probabilities were estimated at all stations using both the spic and spins the outcomes of conditional probabilities at the seoul station are shown in fig 7 the conditional probabilities of drought march 2008 to june 2008 with d 4 months resulting in s 4 8 ware 0 057 and 0 015 for the spic and spins respectively contrarily for the spic and spins the conditional probability of s 4 8 resulting in d 4 months was 0 101 and 0 0714 respectively at the seoul station the variability between joint and conditional probabilities among the spic and spins was due to the influence of non stationarity 4 5 estimating joint and conditional return periods valuation of joint and conditional return periods of drought can help manage and assess drought shiau 2006 suggested using bivariate frequency analysis based on copulas to provide accurate results for quantiles associated with drought duration and severity the joint return period for duration and severity was calculated for both cases using eqs 12 and 13 comparative results of joint return periods between the spic and spins at the seoul station are shown in fig 8 to compare the joint return period in different regions of korea three observed events with different levels of severity and duration at most of the stations were selected the joint return periods for both cases at all stations are provided in table 6 the return periods td and s of historical observed drought event july 1982 to march 1983 with a duration eight months and a severity of 10 6 were 39 4 and 25 6 years at the seoul station in the case of the spic and spins respectively the return periods of the same drought event in the or case were 15 8 and 8 6 years at the seoul station for the spic and spins respectively these results show that return periods calculated using the spins were shorter than those of produced by the spic which means that drought events will occur early in the spins the joint return periods for the spic agree with those in a previous study yoo et al 2013 in south korea for a given joint return period there are innumerable combinations of drought duration and severity and assessing drought risk can be difficult we also estimated the condition return periods for both drought indices using eqs 14 and 15 the outcomes indicate that the conditional return periods of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 with a d 4 months resulting in an s 4 8 were 23 4 and 10 4 years at the seoul station for the spic and spins respectively as shown in fig 9 a and b contrarily for the spic and spins the conditional return periods of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 with an s 4 8 resulting in a d 4 months were 30 7 and 12 8 years at the seoul station as presented in fig 9 c and d respectively the conditional return periods for both spic and spins at all stations are provided in table 6 4 6 discussion a majority of previous studies addressed the significance of bivariate frequency analysis using conventional drought indices shiau 2006 chen et al 2013 maity et al 2013 yoo et al 2013 conventional drought indices incorporate the stationarity assumption which is questionable during periods of rapidly changing environmental conditions bivariate frequency analysis applied to conventional drought indices will not provide reliable information for drought related decision making we conducted a bivariate frequency analysis using the spins and compared its results with those of the spic the findings indicate that the spins is sufficiently robust for meteorological drought monitoring and can be used for estimating drought characteristics significant differences were evident between the results obtained using the spic and spins in particular significant differences were observed in conditional return periods calculated using the spic and spins at all stations table 6 these findings correspond with the results of a study using the spic yoo et al 2013 5 conclusions in drought related research non stationary bivariate frequency analysis of drought is a valuable tool for assessing the adequacy of water resources under drought conditions this research was conducted at eight weather stations in south korea precipitation data for a 57 year period 1961 2017 were used to develop the spins with a 12 month scale using gamlss approach the spins outperformed the spic as measured with the aic the drought characteristics were calculated and fit to five widely used marginal distributions gamma log normal log logistic weibull and exponential the optimal marginal distribution for drought duration and severity was selected based on the aic the copula function was applied to join univariate distributions of drought characteristics several copulas clayton frank gumble joe t copula and galambos were tested to construct joint probability distributions and the best copula was selected based on a cramer von mises goodness of fit test the best fit copula was used to construct joint and conditional probabilities for both spic and spins finally joint and conditional return periods were estimated at all weather stations using both drought indices the results indicate that a drought frequency calculated using the spins was more severe at all weather stations compared with that produced by the spic while the average drought duration and severity were increased at the seoul station with the spins the joint and conditional probabilities calculated using the two drought indices varied significant the differences in joint and conditional return periods of drought events calculated using the spins were similarly significant the outcomes of this study should prove in the management of drought and risk assessments under varying environmental conditions the spins proposed here also constitutes a useful tool for future investigations the calculated joint and conditional return periods can be used to assess the failure probability of a particular water supply system the methodology proposed here can be applied easily worldwide further investigations should consider other factors such as temperature and evapotranspiration involved in drought phenomena credit authorship contribution statement muhammad jehanzaib methodology formal analysis writing original draft jiyoung yoo data

administration kma were selected fig 1 because they offer almost 60 years of data data on precipitation and temperature at these stations were collected from the kma s website https data kma go kr cmmn main do from 1961 to 2017 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index the conventional spi spic as proposed by mckee et al 1993 is commonly used to characterize meteorological drought computation is simple as it depends only on precipitation first a long term monthly precipitation series is calculated at a given time scale using the moving average method this precipitation series can be fitted to a two parameter gamma distribution as recommended by mckee et al 1993 1 f x μ σ 1 γ μ σ μ x μ 1 e x σ f o r x 0 2 γ μ 0 x μ 1 e x d x where µ and σ are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ represents a gamma function the cumulative probabilities of the gamma distribution are transformed into a standard normal variate with a zero mean and unit standard deviation an spic value less than 1 0 denotes a drought condition as shown in table 1 the drought characteristics duration and severity were defined and extracted as follows the drought duration d is the time period when the drought index values are continuously below the threshold while the drought severity s is the cumulative deficit below the threshold corresponding to the d 3 2 non stationary spi in general the spic fits precipitation data to a stationary marginal distribution with constant parameters due to the significant impact of climate change signals a precipitation series can represent non stationary characteristics particularly when the length of the time series exceeds 30 years russo et al 2013 before applying a non stationary spi spins the mean variance and slope of precipitation data used in this analysis were found varying with time which shows the precipitation data is non stationary the spi spins was defined in this study analogously to the spic in which the precipitation series was fitted by a non stationary probability distribution with time variant parameters rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a gamlss which is widely used to evaluate non stationary time series a gamlss uses semi parametric regression in which parametric distribution assumptions are required for the response variable and the parameters of the selected distribution vary as linear and or nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables and or random effects wang et al 2015 in a gamlss the observed time series x t of time t 1 2 n follows a probability distribution function f x t ψ t conditional on ψ t ψ t 1 ψ t 2 ψ t k depicting a vector of m distribution parameters at time t the location shape and scale parameters are described by distribution parameter ψ which is associated with explanatory variables via the monotonic link functions ω i given by eq 3 3 ω i ψ i x i α i α 0 i α 1 i x α q i x q i 1 2 k where x i represents the explanatory variables α i s are the coefficients of the polynomial k is the number of parameters and q is the degree of the polynomial in this study a long term precipitation series was fitted to a non stationary gamma distribution with its location parameter μ associated with time the optimal degree of the polynomial was chosen on the basis of the akaike information criterion aic the cumulative probabilities of the non stationary gamma distribution were converted into a standard normal variate similar to the spic the gamlss related calculations were carried out using the gamlss package in r software stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the criteria for defining a drought remained the same as those for the sric 3 3 copula functions copulas functions combine two or more probability distributions to form multivariate distributions the key difference between conventional multivariate distributions and copulas is that copulas do not need variables with similar types of probability distributions this gives a copula the freedom to include univariate probability distributions when two random variables y 1 and y 2 follow arbitrary probability distribution functions f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 respectively then copula function c links these two probability distributions to form joint probability distribution functions f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 as shown in eq 4 4 f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 c f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 in eq 4 the copula can define a bivariate distribution in terms of the univariate moreover if f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 are continuous then c is unique shiau et al 2007 and the joint probability density function can be given as eq 5 5 f y 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 c f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 f y 1 y 1 f y 2 y 2 where f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 are the probability density functions of f y 1 y 1 and f y 2 y 2 respectively and c is the density function of c which can be expressed as 6 c u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 where u 1 and u 2 are the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of a univariate probability distribution many copula families including archimedean elliptical and extreme value ev are available most previous studies report that archimedean and ev copulas are the most commonly employed in hydrology and water resources shiau et al 2007 yoo et al 2013 kang and jiang 2019 we applied six types of copulas clayton frank gumble joe t copula and galambos and the best copula of each station was selected based on the p value of cramer von mises test the copula parameters were estimated using the common maximum likelihood estimation mle method 3 4 goodness of fit test in this study five probability distributions including gamma log normal log logistic weibull and exponential were selected to fit drought characteristics and the best distribution was selected based on the aic a cramer von mises test has been widely used in previous studies for the selection of best copula genest et al 2009 requena et al 2016 in this analysis the best copula was selected by applying a cramer von mises goodness of fit test in the form of eq 7 7 s n n e n u e λ u 2 d e n u 8 e n u 1 u 2 1 n i 1 n i u i 1 u 1 u i 2 u 2 where u i 1 and u i 2 are ranked pseudo observations and i is the indicator function the p values were calculated using the parametric bootstrap method with 1000 runs the copula with the highest p value was chosen a goodness of fit test was performed using the copula package in r 3 5 joint and conditional probability of drought copula based joint distribution of drought characteristics can be used to generate useful information for drought management the probability of both drought duration and severity simultaneously exceeding a certain threshold can provide useful information for government agencies to improve water management during a drought this joint probability can easily be calculated using copula shiau 2006 as expressed by eq 9 9 p d d a n d s s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s where d and s represent drought duration and severity respectively conditional probabilities of drought can be obtained from a copula based bivariate analysis determination of probabilities of drought duration given drought severity exceeding a certain threshold s or probabilities of drought severity given drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d are also helpful shiau 2006 as in eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s 11 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d 3 6 joint and conditional return period of drought a drought return period which is the average time between drought occurrences of a specific magnitude can be used to determine the recurring characteristics of drought a joint or bivariate return period is more informative for drought assessment and management than a univariate return period bivariate copula analysis can be used to estimate a bivariate return period the joint return period of drought characteristics duration and severity can be divided into and and or cases as in eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 t d a n d s e l p d

terms of conditional return period such as the conditional return period of drought duration if the severity exceeds a certain threshold and vice versa condition return periods can be calculated using eqs 14 and 15 shiau 2006 14 t d s s e l 1 f s s 1 f s s f d d c f s s f d d 15 t d s s e l 1 f s s 1 f s s f d d c f s s f d d 4 results and discussion 4 1 computing stationary and non stationary spi in this study drought calculations were made at a 12 month time scale due to the suitability of a longer time scale for describing water resources mishra and singh 2010 and an spi at a 12 month scale is closely related to other drought indices such as the palmar drought index svoboda et al 2012 the spic was calculated at a 12 month scale by fitting a stationary gamma distribution to long term monthly precipitation data and spins was calculated at a 12 month scale by fitting a non stationary gamma distribution using a gamlss algorithm the location parameter of the non stationary gamma distribution varied as a polynomial function of time the degree of the polynomial q was less than or equal to 12 and the optimal q of the gamlss was selected based on the aic the spic and spins were compared based on the aic at all meteorological stations fig 2 the aic of the spic at all stations was greater than that of the spins the model with the lowest aic was considered the best fit model wang et al 2015 ahn and palmer 2016 the comparison showed the superiority of the spins over the spic we also verified the performance of the gamlss by drawing a centile plot at all stations fig 3 clearly demonstrates that gamlss was able to capture the non stationarity of meteorological data as all points lie between the 5 and 95 percentile curves comparative results of the probability distribution of the spic and spins at the seoul station are shown in fig 4 and results for other stations are provided in a supplementary file the probability distribution of the spins accurately represents the actual conditions but the spic with fixed parameters includes only the best fit line fig 4 also indicates that the deviation of the spic from a 1 1 line is high compared to that of the spins significant variation in the mean of stationary and non stationary distributions is evident as shown in fig 5 a we compared the performance of the spic and spins with historical drought events at the seoul station as shown in fig 5 b both drought indices captured drought conditions well but the drought events identified by the srins were more severe compared with those of the spic the srins captured all drought events faithfully with the exception of a drought in 1976 1978 while the spic did not accurately predict actual drought conditions including the 2000 2001 and 2007 2009 events the spic revealed the problem of under prediction which is why the droughts predicted by the spic were less severe these comprehensive results indicate that the spins is a more robust and reliable drought index for drought monitoring 4 2 estimating drought characteristics and fitting probability distributions drought duration severity and frequency were calculated for both the spic and spins table 2 the mean values of drought characteristics calculated using the spins at the seoul station are more severe compared with those produced by the spic the average drought severity calculated using the sric was 13 59 6 63 16 88 13 78 8 72 6 07 8 77 and 7 43 at the chupungryung gangneung gwangju jeonju pohang seoul ulsan and yeosu stations respectively the drought frequency was shorter and the inter arrival time of drought was lower in the spins at most stations compared with the spic results the correlation between drought characteristics duration and severity was computed using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the correlations between drought duration and drought severity calculated using spic and spins are shown in fig 6 drought duration and severity were fitted to exponential gamma log normal log logistic and weibull marginal distributions the best distribution was selected based on the aic as provided in table 3 table 4 supplied the results of best fit distributions and the parameters for drought duration and severity the parameters of marginal distributions were calculated using the mle the weibull distribution was considered optimal for drought duration and the exponential distribution was the most useful for drought severity at most stations when using the spins for the spic the exponential distribution was selected as the best for both severity and duration at most stations 4 3 selecting the best copulas six copulas were selected and applied to construct a dependence structure between drought duration and severity the best copula was selected based on the p value of a cramer von mises test the selected copulas for all stations and their parameters are provided in table 5 the parameters were calculated using the mle method as in table 5 clayton frank and gumbel copulas had the highest p values and were used in further analysis these results are consistent with those of previous studies yoo et al 2013 tosunoglu and can 2016 kang and jiang 2019 which suggested archimedean copulas perform well in hydrological applications due to space limitation the graphical goodness of fit for copula at seoul station was provided in the supplementary file the frank copula which was selected as the best was used to construct joint probabilities of drought duration and severity at the seoul station the joint probabilities of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 at the seoul station lasting 4 months and with a severity of 4 8 were 0 58 and 0 39 for the spic and spins respectively 4 4 estimating joint and conditional probabilities of drought estimation of joint and conditional probabilities for drought characteristics plays a vital role in drought management simultaneous knowledge of the probability of drought duration and severity exceeding a certain threshold can be invaluable following a drought event similar to the one discussed in section 4 3 an event march 2008 to june 2008 with a duration d of 4 months and severity s of 4 8 the joint probabilities of a drought at the seoul station lasting for 4 months with a severity exceeding 4 8 were 0 36 and 0 55 for the spic and spins respectively the main focus of frequency analysis of drought is not just to determine the joint probability of drought duration and severity exceeding a certain threshold the estimation of the conditional probability of drought characteristics such as the probability of drought duration drought severity given drought severity drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d s is of utmost importance the condition probabilities were estimated at all stations using both the spic and spins the outcomes of conditional probabilities at the seoul station are shown in fig 7 the conditional probabilities of drought march 2008 to june 2008 with d 4 months resulting in s 4 8 ware 0 057 and 0 015 for the spic and spins respectively contrarily for the spic and spins the conditional probability of s 4 8 resulting in d 4 months was 0 101 and 0 0714 respectively at the seoul station the variability between joint and conditional probabilities among the spic and spins was due to the influence of non stationarity 4 5 estimating joint and conditional return periods valuation of joint and conditional return periods of drought can help manage and assess drought shiau 2006 suggested using bivariate frequency analysis based on copulas to provide accurate results for quantiles associated with drought duration and severity the joint return period for duration and severity was calculated for both cases using eqs 12 and 13 comparative results of joint return periods between the spic and spins at the seoul station are shown in fig 8 to compare the joint return period in different regions of korea three observed events with different levels of severity and duration at most of the stations were selected the joint return periods for both cases at all stations are provided in table 6 the return periods td and s of historical observed drought event july 1982 to march 1983 with a duration eight months and a severity of 10 6 were 39 4 and 25 6 years at the seoul station in the case of the spic and spins respectively the return periods of the same drought event in the or case were 15 8 and 8 6 years at the seoul station for the spic and spins respectively these results show that return periods calculated using the spins were shorter than those of produced by the spic which means that drought events will occur early in the spins the joint return periods for the spic agree with those in a previous study yoo et al 2013 in south korea for a given joint return period there are innumerable combinations of drought duration and severity and assessing drought risk can be difficult we also estimated the condition return periods for both drought indices using eqs 14 and 15 the outcomes indicate that the conditional return periods of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 with a d 4 months resulting in an s 4 8 were 23 4 and 10 4 years at the seoul station for the spic and spins respectively as shown in fig 9 a and b contrarily for the spic and spins the conditional return periods of an observed drought event march 2008 to june 2008 with an s 4 8 resulting in a d 4 months were 30 7 and 12 8 years at the seoul station as presented in fig 9 c and d respectively the conditional return periods for both spic and spins at all stations are provided in table 6 4 6 discussion a majority of previous studies addressed the significance of bivariate frequency analysis using conventional drought indices shiau 2006 chen et al 2013 maity et al 2013 yoo et al 2013 conventional drought indices incorporate the stationarity assumption which is questionable during periods of rapidly changing environmental conditions bivariate frequency analysis applied to conventional drought indices will not provide reliable information for drought related decision making we conducted a bivariate frequency analysis using the spins and compared its results with those of the spic the findings indicate that the spins is sufficiently robust for meteorological drought monitoring and can be used for estimating drought characteristics significant differences were evident between the results obtained using the spic and spins in particular significant differences were observed in conditional return periods calculated using the spic and spins at all stations table 6 these findings correspond with the results of a study using the spic yoo et al 2013 5 conclusions in drought related research non stationary bivariate frequency analysis of drought is a valuable tool for assessing the adequacy of water resources under drought conditions this research was conducted at eight weather stations in south korea precipitation data for a 57 year period 1961 2017 were used to develop the spins with a 12 month scale using gamlss approach the spins outperformed the spic as measured with the aic the drought characteristics were calculated and fit to five widely used marginal distributions gamma log normal log logistic weibull and exponential the optimal marginal distribution for drought duration and severity was selected based on the aic the copula function was applied to join univariate distributions of drought characteristics several copulas clayton frank gumble joe t copula and galambos were tested to construct joint probability distributions and the best copula was selected based on a cramer von mises goodness of fit test the best fit copula was used to construct joint and conditional probabilities for both spic and spins finally joint and conditional return periods were estimated at all weather stations using both drought indices the results indicate that a drought frequency calculated using the spins was more severe at all weather stations compared with that produced by the spic while the average drought duration and severity were increased at the seoul station with the spins the joint and conditional probabilities calculated using the two drought indices varied significant the differences in joint and conditional return periods of drought events calculated using the spins were similarly significant the outcomes of this study should prove in the management of drought and risk assessments under varying environmental conditions the spins proposed here also constitutes a useful tool for future investigations the calculated joint and conditional return periods can be used to assess the failure probability of a particular water supply system the methodology proposed here can be applied easily worldwide further investigations should consider other factors such as

source of water gushing in high geothermal coal mine which is of great importance to improve coal mine safety production keywords mine water mixed water source dynamic identification radium radon isotope high ground temperature 1 introduction the mining depth of many coal mines in north china type coalfield is close to 1000 m approximately 100 coal mines with abnormal high temperature are found in floor limestone drainage water the no 13 coal mine in pingdingshan coalfield is 800 m deep and the groundwater temperature of cambrian limestone is as high as 53 c the activity of radium and radon isotopes is significantly high in the multilayer limestone groundwater of coal seam floor studying the distribution law of radium and radon in groundwater under the action of high ground temperature building the corresponding mixed water source identification model and revealing the mixing mechanism of coal mine water inrush are of great importance so as to improve the theory of coal mine water disaster prevention and control the distribution occurrence and migration of natural radionuclide 226ra and its decay product 222rn in groundwater indicate the process of groundwater runoff recharge and mixing and reflect the characteristics of geological conditions hydrogeological conditions artificial interference and other factors chevychelov et al 2019 detected the diffusion halo of 226ra in the groundwater 2 km downstream of the pollution source confirming the strong migration of 226ra and 222rn in the water vital 2020 evaluated the influence of bedrock type depth mineral phase and residence time on 222rn content indicating that 222rn activity is related to well depth and cambrian basement proximity vinson et al 2009 and others believed that water rock interaction and high temperature play a certain role in the migration and distribution of 222rn in groundwater al hilal s 2020 analysis showed that 222rn activity in groundwater is positively correlated with electrical conductivity concentration but has minimal correlation with total dissolved solids tds value roba et al 2012 et al analyzed the correlation between the occurrence and migration of 226ra and 222rn and ph temperature conductivity tds hardness redox potential and chemical oxygen demand they indicated that the mobility of 226ra and 222rn is affected by a variety of physical and chemical parameters abbasi and mirekhtiary 2020 examined the relationship between groundwater conductivity temperature and acidity of groundwater and 226ra activity they found that the abnormally high 226ra concentration in groundwater preferentially appears in the acidic environment with high temperature and high conductivity cheng et al 2020 et al established a regression model between 222rn activity and temperature by using 222rn sample data of groundwater for many years on the basis of 222rn mass balance model hsu et al 2020 et al revealed the main controlling factors of mixed groundwater recharge jian an 2019 used 224ra 223ra ratio and 224ra mass balance model to calculate groundwater age yiwu et al 2020 et al used 222rn mass balance model to calculate the amount of mutual transformation between yili river

and calculated the mixing ratio of groundwater by using a three terminal mixing model lin et al 2020 analyzed the correlation between the 228ra 226ra activity ratio of groundwater and temperature and salinity and constructed a two terminal mixed model many scholars have conducted numerous studies on the mixing mechanism of groundwater qiu et al 2018 and mohammed et al 2014 et al determined the process and source of groundwater circulation by using 2h and 18o isotope tracer technology carucci 2012 used 2h 18o 87sr 86sr 34s and 13c isotopes to determine various recharge sources of groundwater salifu et al 2020 et al used 2h 18o and 87sr 86sr isotopes to quantify the mixing ratio of a tailing downstream water source in sweden and evaluated the consistency of the mixing calculation model petersen et al 2018 and others jointly used 2h 18o 14c 36cl and 4he isotopes to determine the multiple mixing paths of groundwater and built a mixing model to calculate the average contribution rate of main recharge areas li et al 2013 ma et al 2013 luo et al 2013 and han et al 2014 analyzed groundwater recharge environment and identified groundwater sources by using 2h and 18o isotopes haowen et

and xiaoxi 2017 used 2h and 18o isotopes to determine groundwater mixing endmembers and built a mixing calculation model to reveal the mixing mechanism of coal mine groundwater under the influence of mining disturbance xu et al 2018 and others evaluated the mixing process of deep groundwater system by using 2h 18o and 14c isotopes the results show that the continuous overexploitation leads to the strengthening of hydraulic connection xianfang et al 2007 analyzed the mixed water source of river runoff by combining 2h and 18o isotope tracer technology with chloride mass balance method huang and wang 2018 used 2h 18o 3h and 14c isotopes to reveal that the water gushing source in jiaozuo coal mine area mainly comes from the mixing of local precipitation deep limestone water and ancient groundwater and established a multielement mixed mass balance m3 calculation model the deep groundwater in north china type coalfield has similar hydrochemical characteristic values and lithology and the stable isotopes such as 2h 18o 13c etc of groundwater environment are slightly the same thus accurately distinguishing the mixing proportion of groundwater is difficult and the applicability of the model is low for the deep groundwater of small scale high temperature coal mine quantitatively identifying the mixing mechanism of coal mine water inflow source by using radium and radon isotopes groundwater temperature and age has obvious advantages this process is of great importance to improve the theory of coal mine water disaster prevention and control 2 overview of the study area pingdingshan coalfield starts from luogang no 1 normal fault in the east and ends at jiaxian fault in the northwest it starts from the coal seam outcrop of geng formation in the south and ends at xiangjia fault in the northeast the east west trend is 40 km long the south north trend is 10 20 km wide and the coal bearing area is 650 km2 the geological coordinates of minefield are as follows east longitude 113 15 50 4 113 27 15 9 and north latitude 33 48 54 33 59 12 likou syncline is an important geological structure and its axial direction is n60w the guodishan fault located in the southwest of the coalfield is a water blocking fault resulting in the obvious difference in the hydrodynamic field of cambrian limestone between the west and east sides of guodishan fault therefore pingdingshan coalfield is divided into the following three hydrogeological units zone iii south of guodishan fault zone iiii east of guodishan fault to likou syncline and zone iii east of likou syncline no 5 mine no 7 mine no 9 mine xiangshan mine and no 11 mine belong to iii hydrogeological unit no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 no 6 no 8 no 10 no 12 and wuzhai mines belong to iiii hydrogeological unit shoushan no 1 mine and no 13 mine belong to iii hydrogeological unit fig 1 in according with the formation lithology hydrochemical characteristics and burial conditions of aquifer the aquifer which has great influence on coal mining can be roughly divided into four categories from top to bottom these categories are quaternary pore aquifer permian sandstone aquifer carboniferous limestone aquifer and cambrian limestone aquifer the aquifuges are roughly divided into three categories from top to bottom these categories are quaternary floor aquifuges permian coal measure strata and red mudstone of mantou formation of lower cambrian fig 2 the fracture development grade of the groundwater of the roof sandstone groundwater permian sandstone groundwater is low and the surface is relatively smooth the permeability coefficient is 0 0011 0 0644 m d the average thickness of the rock layer is approximately 12 m and aquifer have poor permeability and low water inflow thin layer limestone groundwater carboniferous limestone groundwater is composed of limestone sandstone mudstone and coal the fissures of shallow karst aquifer develop but the number of fractures and caves gradually decreases with the increase in depth in accordance with the drilling data the water inflow of this group is large except for receiving atmospheric precipitation supply through the formation outcrop this group receives lateral recharge from faults and over current recharge of adjacent aquifers the development grade of the dissolution fissures of thick limestone groundwater cambrian limestone groundwater is relatively low and the thickness of rock stratum varies greatly from 0 55 m to 92 86 m the permeability coefficient is 0 084 m d and the mineralization degree of groundwater is 0 77 g l 3 experimental analysis and results the input output system structure internal process and function environment and other factors of underground water system in coal mines change in varying degrees due to the long term influence of mining activities the underground water hydraulic connection of multilayer limestone in coal mine floor is close the mixing action is intensified and the water gushing source is complex in accordance with the decay law of radionuclides and the principle of water balance and mass conservation the radioisotope distribution model of deep groundwater is constructed on the basis of the age and temperature data of uranium radium radon and groundwater the mixed water source identification model of multilayer limestone in coal seam floor is established by using the multielement mixed mass balance calculation method m3 this paper expounds the dynamic response mechanism of groundwater mixing ratio of multilayer limestone in the floor of high geothermal coal mine under the action of mining 3 1 construction of radioisotope distribution model for deep groundwater the deep groundwater in the mining area does not receive the direct recharge of atmospheric precipitation thus the main recharge source of deep groundwater is runoff recharge q in and the discharge is runoff discharge q out in fig 3 v represents the volume of deep groundwater c t represents the concentration of radioisotopes in deep groundwater c in t represents the concentration of radioisotopes in runoff recharge water and c out t represents the concentration of radioisotopes in runoff discharge water the water balance equation is established 1 d v d t q i n q o u t on the basis of the water balance equation and radioactive decay law the mass balance equation

groundwater the runoff path and mixing mechanism of groundwater can be revealed by comparing the changes in nuclide contents in each aquifer the nuclide test results of deep groundwater samples in pingdingshan coalfield are collected table 1 it is found that there are significant differences in nu nra nrn and temperature in roof sandstone groundwater thin limestone groundwater and thick limestone groundwater using it to identify the mixing mechanism of coal mine water inflow has obvious advantages in theory when radionuclides are determining the age of groundwater the smaller the decay constant λ or the longer the half life the longer the age of groundwater measured since the half life of 222rn is short 3 825d and that of 226ra is long 1620a the radium radon method equation 9

age of typical deep groundwater samples in pingdingshan coalfield is calculated the age of the roof sandstone groundwater water sample 12 is 756 4a that in thin limestone water sample 15 is 334 7a and that in thick limestone water sample 11 is 111 5a on the basis of the tritium value in groundwater fawang et al 2000 calculated the age of deep groundwater in north china type coalfield from 35 years to 500 years by using piston model and fully mixed model the calculated results are consistent with the radium radon method thus the radium radon method is suitable for deep groundwater in north china type coalfield the parameters of radioisotope model for deep groundwater in pingdingshan coalfield can be calculated as c 0 9 082 c in 0 0259 and a 0 00486 by substituting the radium content in typical water samples and groundwater age in equation 8 the formula of the radioisotope distribution model of deep groundwater in pingdingshan coalfield equation 10 is obtained 10 c t 9 058 e 0 00529 t 0 0238 3 1 2 recovery of radon and temperature series in deep groundwater with the increase in depth the fractionation and pressure of rock mass matrix increase and radon is difficult to overflow resulting in the activity of radon in aquifer water close to the deep layer and the higher the content of radon under the influence of geothermal gradient the temperature of groundwater increases with the increase in depth therefore the radioactive activity of radon in deep cambrian limestone groundwater has a linear relationship with the groundwater temperature fig 4 on the basis of the relationship between radon activity and groundwater temperature and the constructed radioisotope distribution model of deep groundwater the missing radon and temperature data are recovered table 2 3 2 construction of dynamic mixed proportion model at present many methods are used to evaluate the mixing proportion of coal mine water inflow sources for small scale limestone water inflow with similar lithology in high geothermal coal mine the accuracy of using conventional hydrochemical ions to identify mixed water sources is low on the basis of the data of uranium radium radon groundwater age and temperature this paper uses the multielement mixed mass balance calculation method m3 marcus et al 1999 to build a multilayer limestone mixed water source identification model in coal seam floor 3 2 1 calculation principle and results of m3 mixed model the age and temperature of deep limestone groundwater are a relative concept this concept can effectively explain the runoff path and mixing process of groundwater and reveal the important parameters of groundwater history the uranium content radium and radon activities and the age and temperature of groundwater are dimensionless treated due to the different units of each parameter this process is performed to accurately predict the mixing process of deep limestone groundwater in the mining area principal component analysis is used to extract the information of sample data and the load scatter diagram of principal components 1 and 2 of all water samples is established fig 5 in the load scatter diagram of principal components 1 and 2 of water samples from different aquifers in pingdingshan mining area the common triangle area around all scatter points is found water sample points a 1 305 0 942 b 0 433 2 975 and c 2 321 0 305 are selected as the recharge end element of deep limestone groundwater in the mining area water samples a b and c are typical representatives of roof sandstone groundwater water sample 12 thin limestone groundwater water sample 15 and thick limestone groundwater water sample 11 respectively the mixing ratio calculation is to establish an ideal conceptual model between the typical water sample points and other water sample points the groundwater sample is assumed to be composed of all the typical reference water samples the mixing ratio describes the contribution of typical water samples to the investigation of groundwater samples the calculation method is as follows three reference water sample points are found in the study area a triangle abc is constructed with three typical water sample points as endmembers fig 6 assuming that the observation water sample point x is located in triangle abc the mixing degree of the observation water sample point x is mainly obtained by calculating the mixing ratio of the reference water sample points a b and c the mixing ratio of point a of the reference water sample in groundwater can be expressed as equation 11 11 mixa r a i a c r i where r a cm ac similarly the mixing ratio of points b and c in groundwater can be calculated table 3 the mixing of deep limestone groundwater is controlled by multiple factors on the basis of the analysis of hydrogeology and tectonic geology of the carboniferous limestone aquifer and cambrian limestone aquifer coal mining is the main factor that causes the abnormal radium and radon activity and aggravates the mixing as shown in tab 4 the mixing ratio of water samples at different sampling points is different thin limestone water receives high external supply and has strong mixing effect thick limestone groundwater receives low external recharge and its mixing is weak as shown in fig 7 the mixing proportion contributed by roof sandstone water is positive correlation to the age of groundwater and negative correlation to temperature the mixing proportion contributed by thick limestone water is negative correlation to the age of groundwater and positive correlation to temperature thus the temperature and age of groundwater are negative correlation the temperature of the groundwater increases whereas the age of the deep groundwater decreases with the depth this condition indicates that the thin limestone groundwater and the thick limestone groundwater are greatly affected by coal mining the age renewal of the groundwater is fast and lateral recharge occurs in the groundwater runoff recharge path most sampling points of thin limestone groundwater are highly recharged by roof sandstone groundwater and low recharged by thick limestone groundwater it indicates that with the passage of time the original limestone groundwater is renewed by the new groundwater the current limestone groundwater mainly receives the lateral recharge of roof sandstone groundwater through faults secondly it receives the recharge of thick limestone groundwater through pressure head 3 2 2 dynamic mixing model construction and radium radon response the half life of uranium is as long as 4 51 109 a and its content does not change in decades or even hundreds of years the radioactivity of radium changes with time on the basis of the formula of radioisotope concentration in groundwater equations 10 the radium concentration in several years can be predicted for the same sampling point of deep groundwater the temperature of groundwater remains unchanged a dynamic hybrid model is constructed on the basis of this condition the geographical distribution of pingdingshan coalfield coal mines from east to west is iii hydrogeological unit iiii hydrogeological unit and iii hydrogeological unit combined with hydrogeology structural geological conditions and water sample mixing proportion the change trend of the mixing proportion of deep limestone groundwater in pingdingshan coalfield is drawn fig 8 the direction of deep groundwater flow in space is from west to east and is influenced by hydrogeological conditions the mixing effect of groundwater is changing constantly when groundwater runoff moves the recharge of groundwater from the roof sandstone to the thin limestone groundwater is decreasing from west to east the recharge of thick limestone groundwater to the thin limestone groundwater is increasing from west to east with the passage of time the radium and radon contents in the deep groundwater decrease on the basis of the dynamic change in radium and radon contents with time the dynamic analysis of the mixing proportion of the deep limestone groundwater is made over time the proportion of thick limestone groundwater to thin limestone water supply increases and the proportion of roof sandstone water supply decreases this is due to the decline of water level of roof sandstone water and thin limestone water caused by long term coal mining and the lateral recharge of roof sandstone water is weakened the existence of cambrian sandy mudstone water resisting layer makes the thick limestone groundwater less affected by coal mining so that the recharge of thick limestone groundwater to thin limestone groundwater is relatively enhanced however the main source of supply is the roof sandstone water that is supplied by fault to thin limestone water 4 conclusion 1 the age of the thin layer and thick limestone groundwater in the deep groundwater of coal mine is smaller than that of the roof sandstone groundwater the thin layer and thick limestone groundwater is greatly affected by coal mining most of the limestone groundwater is renewed by new groundwater and the roof sandstone water is less affected by mining 2 the mixing of deep groundwater in coal mine is influenced by the method of mining and runoff with the development of coal mining the main source of deep limestone water is the lateral recharge of the roof sandstone groundwater the mixing proportion of deep limestone groundwater is positive correlation to the age of groundwater and negative correlation to temperature 3 in space the mixing effect of the groundwater runoff in the deep limestone in pingdingshan coal field changes constantly influenced by faults the recharge of the groundwater from the roof sandstone to the thin limestone groundwater is decreasing from west to east the recharge of thick limestone groundwater to the thin limestone groundwater is increasing from west to east due to the influence of head pressure 4 with the passage of time the radioactivity of radium and radon in deep groundwater decreases the recharge of thick limestone groundwater to thin limestone groundwater is increased although the groundwater of roof sandstone is the main source of groundwater supply the contribution mixing ratio decreases funding information this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

found in floor limestone drainage water the no 13 coal mine in pingdingshan coalfield is 800 m deep and the groundwater temperature of cambrian limestone is as high as 53 c the activity of radium and radon isotopes is significantly high in the multilayer limestone groundwater of coal seam floor studying the distribution law of radium and radon in groundwater under the action of high ground temperature building the corresponding mixed water source identification model and revealing the mixing mechanism of coal mine water inrush are of great importance so as to improve the theory of coal

226ra in the groundwater 2 km downstream of the pollution source confirming the strong migration of 226ra and 222rn in the water vital 2020 evaluated the influence of bedrock type depth mineral phase and residence time on 222rn content indicating that 222rn activity is related to well depth and cambrian basement proximity vinson et al 2009 and others believed that water rock interaction and high temperature play a certain role in the migration and distribution of 222rn in groundwater al hilal s 2020 analysis showed that 222rn activity in groundwater is positively correlated with electrical conductivity concentration but has minimal correlation with total dissolved solids tds value roba et al 2012 et al analyzed the correlation between the occurrence and migration of 226ra and 222rn and ph temperature conductivity tds hardness redox potential and chemical oxygen demand they indicated that the mobility of 226ra and 222rn is affected by a variety of physical and chemical parameters abbasi and mirekhtiary 2020 examined the relationship between groundwater conductivity temperature and acidity of groundwater and 226ra activity they found that the abnormally high 226ra concentration in groundwater preferentially appears in the acidic environment with high temperature and high conductivity cheng et al 2020 et al established a regression model between 222rn activity and temperature by using 222rn sample data of groundwater for many years on the basis of 222rn mass balance model hsu et al 2020 et al revealed the main controlling factors of mixed groundwater recharge jian an 2019 used 224ra 223ra ratio and 224ra mass balance model to calculate groundwater age yiwu et al 2020 et al used 222rn mass balance model to calculate the amount of mutual transformation between yili river

and calculated the mixing ratio of groundwater by using a three terminal mixing model lin et al 2020 analyzed the correlation between the 228ra 226ra activity ratio of groundwater and temperature and salinity and constructed a two terminal mixed model many scholars have conducted numerous studies on the mixing mechanism of groundwater qiu et al 2018 and mohammed et al 2014 et al determined the process and source of groundwater circulation by using 2h and 18o isotope tracer technology carucci 2012 used 2h 18o 87sr 86sr 34s and 13c isotopes to determine various recharge sources of groundwater salifu et al 2020 et al used 2h 18o and 87sr 86sr isotopes to quantify the mixing ratio of a tailing downstream water source in sweden and evaluated the consistency of the mixing calculation model petersen et al 2018 and others jointly used 2h 18o 14c 36cl and 4he isotopes to determine the multiple mixing paths of groundwater and built a mixing model to calculate the average contribution rate

strengthening of hydraulic connection xianfang et al 2007 analyzed the mixed water source of river runoff by combining 2h and 18o isotope tracer technology with chloride mass balance method huang and wang 2018 used 2h 18o 3h and 14c isotopes to reveal that the water gushing source in jiaozuo coal mine area mainly comes from the mixing of local precipitation deep limestone water and ancient groundwater and established a multielement mixed mass balance m3 calculation model the deep groundwater in north china type coalfield has similar hydrochemical characteristic values and lithology and the stable isotopes such as 2h 18o 13c etc of groundwater environment are slightly the same thus accurately distinguishing the mixing proportion of groundwater is difficult and the applicability of the model is low for the deep groundwater of small scale high temperature coal mine quantitatively identifying the mixing mechanism of coal mine water inflow source by using radium and radon isotopes groundwater temperature and age has obvious advantages this process is of great importance to improve the theory of coal mine water disaster prevention and control 2 overview of the study area pingdingshan coalfield starts from luogang no 1 normal fault in the east and ends at jiaxian fault in the northwest it starts from the coal seam outcrop of geng formation in the south and ends at xiangjia fault in the northeast the east west trend is 40 km long the south north trend is 10 20 km wide and the coal bearing area is 650 km2 the geological coordinates of minefield are as follows east longitude 113 15 50 4 113 27 15 9 and north latitude 33 48 54 33 59 12 likou syncline is an important geological structure and its axial direction is n60w the guodishan fault located in the southwest of the coalfield is a water blocking fault resulting in the obvious difference in the hydrodynamic field of cambrian limestone between the west and east sides of guodishan fault therefore pingdingshan coalfield is divided into the following three hydrogeological units zone iii south of guodishan fault zone iiii east of guodishan fault to likou syncline and zone iii east of likou syncline no 5 mine no 7 mine no 9 mine xiangshan mine and no 11 mine belong to iii hydrogeological unit no 1 no 2 no 3 no 4 no 6 no 8 no 10 no 12 and wuzhai mines belong to iiii hydrogeological unit shoushan no 1 mine and no 13 mine belong to iii hydrogeological unit fig 1 in according with the formation lithology hydrochemical characteristics and burial conditions of aquifer the aquifer which has great influence on coal mining can be roughly divided into four categories from top to bottom these categories are quaternary pore aquifer permian sandstone aquifer carboniferous limestone aquifer and cambrian limestone aquifer the aquifuges are roughly divided into three categories from top to bottom these categories are quaternary floor aquifuges permian coal measure strata and red mudstone of mantou formation of lower cambrian fig 2 the fracture development grade of the groundwater of the roof sandstone groundwater permian sandstone groundwater is low and the surface is relatively smooth the permeability coefficient is 0 0011 0 0644 m d the average thickness of the rock layer is approximately 12 m and aquifer have poor permeability and low water inflow thin layer limestone groundwater carboniferous limestone groundwater is composed of limestone sandstone mudstone and coal the fissures of shallow karst aquifer develop but the number of fractures and caves gradually decreases with the increase in depth in accordance with the drilling data the water inflow of this group is large except for receiving atmospheric precipitation supply through the formation outcrop this group receives lateral recharge from faults and over current recharge of adjacent aquifers the development grade of the dissolution fissures of thick limestone groundwater cambrian limestone groundwater is relatively low and the thickness of rock stratum varies greatly from 0 55 m to 92 86 m the permeability coefficient is 0 084 m d and the mineralization degree of groundwater is 0 77 g l 3 experimental analysis and results the input output system structure internal process and function environment and other factors of underground water system in coal mines change in varying degrees due to the long term influence of mining activities the underground water hydraulic connection of multilayer limestone in coal mine floor is close the mixing action is intensified and the water gushing source is complex in accordance with the decay law of radionuclides and the principle of water balance and mass conservation the radioisotope distribution model of deep groundwater is constructed on the basis of the age and temperature data of uranium radium radon and groundwater the mixed water source identification model of multilayer limestone in coal seam floor is established by using the multielement mixed mass balance calculation method m3 this paper expounds the dynamic response mechanism of groundwater mixing ratio of multilayer limestone in the floor of high geothermal coal mine under the action of mining 3 1 construction of radioisotope distribution model for deep groundwater the deep groundwater in the mining area does not receive the direct recharge of atmospheric precipitation thus the main recharge source of deep groundwater is runoff recharge q in and the discharge is runoff discharge q out in fig 3 v represents the volume of deep groundwater c t

ecological effects on vegetation water status and photosynthetic performance in the gravel desert ecosystem is still lacking in this study the dew variability and formation frequency on a gravel desert were measured by microlysimeters we quantified dew formation characteristics investigated vegetation water response to dew events in the gravel desert ecosystem at the edge of a desert oasis northwestern china the results showed water adsorption was a primary pathway of dew formation in such system and the average daily amount of dew is 0 06 mm dew occurred on 36 of growing season days the number of days with dew amounts 0 03 mm accounted for 82 of the total dew events and the cumulative amount of dew for those days was 3 41 mm relative humidity air temperature wind speed the difference between air temperature and soil surface temperature had significant effects on dew formation a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in the gravel desert ecosystem a significant positive correlation between dew amounts and the relative moisture in the near surface air was found when rh 30 the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable to dew formation and when wind speed 5 47 m s there was no dew formation because of the water absorbing scales on the leaves of reaumuria soongorica dew events significantly improved their relative water content water

mm from june to october of 2016 whereas rainfall events of 5 mm or less were most frequent and comprised 92 of the events fig 3 the total number of dew days was 55 and varied depending on month june and october had the fewest dew days at 9 and 8 respectively while september had the most at 15 fig 4 the total number of dew days and rainfall days accounted for 36 and 17 of total observation days respectively these results demonstrated that dew formation was more frequent during the growing season than rainfall the average dew amount for gravel surface was 0 06 mm d 1 ranging from 0 02 and 0 24 mm d 1 total recorded amount was 3 41 mm representing 6 6 of the rainfall from june to october fig 5 the results showed that the dew amount of 0 03 mm d 1 occurred on 45 days which accounted for 82 of the total dew events and that dew events with dew amount of 0 1 mm d 1 accounted for 16 4 of the total dew events fig 6 3 2 dew formation and meteorological factors dew formation is a complicated physical process mainly influenced by the near surface meteorological parameters and surface properties kidron 2000 richards 2005 ye et al 2007 guo et al 2016 during the observation period usually the soil surface temperature did not drop below the dew point whereas an increase in soil surface moisture was observed data analysis of meteorological data indicated that nights with dew represented significantly higher relative humidity higher mean temperatures difference between air and soil surface lower mean wind speed and lower means temperatures than nights without dew table 2 there was found to be a significant positive correlation between dew amounts and the relative moisture in the near surface air when rh 30 fig 7 a a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in the gravel desert ecosystem in addition when rh 80 the dew formation was mainly controlled by air temperature in near surfaces it was showed that there was a positive correlation between the dew amounts and wind velocity under the conditions of moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s fig 7b when wind velocity exceeded 1 8 m s the dew amounts decreased rapidly and when wind velocity exceeded 5 47 m s there was no dew formation table 2 3 3 the water status of reaumuria soongorica responses to dew the relative water contents of r soongorica in the early morning increased from 49 2 under dew absent condition to 56 0 after dew event there was significant 13 8 increase in the plants exposed to dew compared with those of no dew in addition the water potential of the species increased from 14 8 mpa under dew absent condition to 10 3 mpa after dew event with a significant 30 7 increase these results confirmed that the water status of r soongorica showed responses to the dew events significantly table 3 3 4 the diurnal photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of reaumuria soongorica responses to dew a typical two peaked diurnal pattern of net co2 pn assimilation rate was observed under dew absent condition through the study period achieving a maximum daily peak rate at 10 00 in the morning and the second peak rate at 16 00 while an atypical bimodal curve of net co2 assimilation rate was observed under dew present condition with a maximum peak rate at 9 00 and the second peak rate at 14 00 fig 8 b the diurnal average net co2 assimilation rate and the maximum peak rate significantly increased under dew present condition p 0 05 the daily mean value of stomatal conductance gs increased from 75 55 mmol m 2 s 1 under dew absent condition to 90 07 mmol m 2 s 1 after dew event with a maximum value 110 4 mmol m 2 s 1 and 158 8 mmol m 2 s 1 at 8 00 respectively fig 8a the dew events significantly increased the stomatal conductance rate from 8 00 to 10 00 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 the dew formation characteristics very few studies have noted the dew variability in the gravel desert ecosystems which are widely distributed throughout the arid area of northern china current results showed that although soil surface temperature did not drop below the dew point temperature in many observation days soil moisture content at uppermost layer still increased which was accordance with the measurement performed in the negev desert israel agam and berliner 2004 in the tengger desert china pan et al 2010 and in the desert riparian forest china hao et al 2012 these results also indicated that the increase of surface soil moisture was not only due to the dew formation in the case of no rainfall the surface soil moisture in the study area was extremely low table 1 under the condition of no rainfall and the water vapor content at the soil pores was less than that of air demonstrating that water adsorption arises easily during the late afternoon and night rather than through capillary condensation philip and de vries 1957 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 water adsorption is still an important hydrological process in the gravel desert ecosystems a recent study conducted in sandy desert ecosystem also showed that water vapor absorption by soil was a typical characteristic of dew formation zhuang and zhao 2017 likewise it is confirmed that the dominant mechanism is still water adsorption in the gravel desert ecosystems however regardless of dew formation or water absorption a diurnal cycle of latent heat flux is involved in the process agam and berliner 2006 thus in this paper dew amounts consisted of dew formation and water absorption our study showed that the dew amounts and the frequency were lower in the gravel desert ecosystems than that in the sandy desert ecosystem 0 13 mm d zhuang and zhao 2017 which may be explained by the two different substratums it is suggested that there are different thermal conductivity effects and the reaction of the air to temperature and humidity distribution to the two surfaces which is important to dew formation kidron 2000 li 2002 the previous study showed that the soil temperature with gravel cover is 1 4 c higher than under sand cover during daytime li 2002 the gravel acts as an insulator and helps to retain soil heat at night in addition the gravel cools slower than sand in the late afternoon thus the higher soil temperature inhibits vapor condensation another reason for lower dew amounts of gravel may be attributed to higher surface roughness in the gravel habitat increasing the turbulence degree of the airflow it was suggested that the sandy soil can reduce the evaporation rate much more than the gravel especially at the higher wind speed hanks and woodruff 1958 li 2002 the dew variability is primarily controlled by micrometeorological factors many studies have documented that the clear skies moderate winds high relative humidity strong inversions of temperature from the soil surface to the atmosphere and the low surface temperatures were usually beneficial to dew formation kidron 2000 pan et al 2010 guo et al 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 in our study we confirmed that rh tair tsoil t air wind were key factors that influenced the dew formation in the gravel desert table 2 the results indicated that water vapor absorption occurred when rh 30 and dew amounts increased with increasing rh suggesting a threshold of rh is 30 for dew formation in the study area moreover dew amounts were also controlled by wind speed and its influences on dew formation was complicated lower wind speed was not favorable to vapor diffusion and higher wind accelerated evaporation processes beysens 2016 our study also showed that the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable to dew formation whereas wind velocity 1 m s and exceeded 2 5 m s inhibited the dew formation it is indicated that moderate winds increased the transport of water vapor and prevented the air mixing at the surface with air above he and richards 2015 other studies have shown that a wind speed of 5 7 m s is the upper limit for dew formation nilsson 1996 muselli et al 2009 lekouch et al 2011 the determination of key micrometeorological parameters in different desert environments could provide important reference for the calculation of dew models 4 2 the positive effects of dew on reaumuria soongorica dew may play an important role in maintaining plant water status by foliar uptake of moisture wang et al 2016 vegetation dew uses have been noted for shrubs in different regions it has been shown that an improvement in co2 assimilation rates 72 and 138 increasing of relative leaf water content and shoots water potential of lavandula stoechas munné bosch et al 1999 in mediterranean filed condition hill et al 2015 found that artemisia sieberi and haloxylon scoparium used 63 and 46 of their water from dewfall in negev desert respectively such information is still lacking for super xerophytic desert plant where dew may potentially play a critical role in vegetation survival in this study we studied the dominant shrubs r soongorica in the gravel desert habitat at the edge of a desert oasis northwestern china the species showed responses to dew as indicated by the significant increases in their predawn relative leaf water content and shoots water potential after the dew events in a previous study by conducting a series of observations of dew deposition in the dominant annual plant bassia dasyphylla with leaf hairs and agriophyllum squarrosum without leaf hairs at the sandy desert habitat we found that dew improved water status and photosynthetic performance of b dasyphylla in the early morning whereas there was no significantly effects on agriophyllum squarrosum zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 it was also suggested that the anatomical characteristics may play a major role in foliar uptake using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis with a scanning electron microscope wang et al 2016 found water absorbing scales in the leaves of r soongorica could absorb unsaturated water from the air they showed that a complex cellular structure of water absorbing scales surmounted by four to seven valves that formed in inverted cone pore the valves contracted and formed a more or less impermeable lid under low rh while the valves absorbed unsaturated atmospheric water and swelled gradually expanding and forming a larger central opening moreover our results showed that an increase in average co2 assimilation rates and stomatal conductance especially from 8 00 to 10 00 which indicated another mechanism that might be critically associated with physiology and water available these results suggested that the dew events may have potential role in avoiding irreversible damage that the photosynthetic apparatus may suffer when rwc falls below 30 kaiser 1987 therefore dew may play a critical role in improving plant water status and ameliorating the adverse effects of plants exposed to prolonged drought 4 3 ecological significance of dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem dew as an additional source of water may have a positive impact on the vegetation functions microbes and animals as well as on sustaining biogeochemical dynamics during rainless period mchugh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in the present study we found that although the dew is a small percentage of total precipitation and only about 6 6 of total rainfall it is a constant and stable water source and thus plays a significant role in the gravel desert environments with scarce water frequent dew formation improves the rate of seed germination and moistens desert plant and the soil crust generally plant canopy condensation was greater than ground condensation hao et al 2012 plant canopy directly absorbs the dew condensed on their surface foliar absorption of dew could be particularly important in dryland ecosystems because plants commonly undergo periods of water stress in our study area the landscape of vegetation is commonly distributed in patches and low vegetation cover and the main vegetation type is desert vegetation dominated by super xerophytic shrubs such as r soongorica which exhibit strong adaptability to drought and the gravel desert habitats and have important roles in soil water conservation and wind erosion prevention it was found that water absorbing scales in the leaves of r soongorica were critical role in dew foliar uptakes which improved the water status during the drought period on the other hand inorganic salts in or on the valves of water absorbing scales can contribute the atmospheric water molecules to condense on the leaf surface and penetrate them into the leaves of r soongorica moreover although the amount is little compared to the root water uptake the indirect effect of dew is also important dew can wet the leave surface reduce the temperature of plant leaves and adjust the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance the higher relative humidity on leaf surface layer and around the plants decreases the evaporation of soil moisture beneath which makes for the storage of soil moisture in the gravel desert the present study is important for identifying certain underlying principles that might be of use in the hyper arid region where precipitation is very limited and top soil is often dry future study would be valuable to explore the different vegetation dew water use pathways and its mechanisms by stable isotope techniques 5 conclusions despite the increasing attention of dew formation and its effects on vegetation water status in dryland areas we still have limited understanding on the roles of dew formation and its uses by super xerophytic shrubs it was concluded that water adsorption was a primary pathway of dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem relative humidity wind speed air temperature the difference between soil surface temperature and air temperature played important roles in dew formation a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in addition the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable for dew formation whereas wind velocity 1 m s or exceeding 2 5 m s inhibited the dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem dew significantly improved the relative water content water potential and photosynthetic performance to r soongorica growing in the extremely dry environments likely indicating that they could take up dew water through particular water absorbing scales in the leaves this study showed that strong response of plants and soil to dew emphasizing the potential importance of dew in ecohydrological processes in the gravel desert environments the study also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of dew on plant water status in the gravel desert ecosystem and significantly enhances our understanding of vegetation dew water use in such systems the present study has important implications for

4002,as an additional source of water to plants besides rainfall dew may have a positive impact on vegetation in the arid ecosystems knowledge regarding dew formation characteristics and its ecological effects on vegetation water status and photosynthetic performance in the gravel desert ecosystem is still lacking in this study the dew variability and formation frequency on a gravel desert were measured by microlysimeters we quantified dew formation characteristics investigated vegetation water response to dew events in the gravel desert ecosystem at the edge of a desert oasis northwestern china the results showed water adsorption was a primary pathway of dew formation in such system and the average daily amount of dew is 0 06 mm dew occurred on 36 of growing season days the number of days with dew amounts 0 03 mm accounted for 82 of the total dew events and the cumulative amount of dew for those days was 3 41 mm relative humidity air temperature wind speed the difference between air temperature and soil surface temperature had significant effects on dew formation a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in the gravel desert ecosystem a significant positive correlation between dew amounts and the relative moisture in the near surface air was found when rh 30 the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable to dew formation and when wind speed 5 47 m s there was no dew formation because of the water absorbing scales on the leaves of reaumuria soongorica dew events significantly improved their relative water content water potential and photosynthetic performance in the early morning and ameliorating the adverse effects of plants exposed to prolonged drought the study highlights dew is an important supplementary source

mm from june to october of 2016 whereas rainfall events of 5 mm or less were most frequent and comprised 92 of the events fig 3 the total number of dew days was 55 and varied depending on month june and october had the fewest dew days at 9 and 8 respectively while september had the most at 15 fig 4 the total number of dew days and rainfall days accounted for 36 and 17 of total observation days respectively these results demonstrated that dew formation was more frequent during the growing season than rainfall the average dew amount for gravel surface was 0 06 mm d 1 ranging from 0 02 and 0 24 mm d 1 total recorded amount was 3 41 mm representing 6 6 of the rainfall from june to october fig 5 the results showed that the dew amount of 0 03 mm d 1 occurred on 45 days which accounted for 82 of the total dew events and that dew events with dew amount of 0 1 mm d 1 accounted for 16 4 of the total dew events fig 6 3 2 dew formation and meteorological factors dew formation is a complicated physical process mainly influenced by the near surface meteorological parameters and surface properties kidron 2000 richards 2005 ye et al 2007 guo et al 2016 during the observation period usually the soil surface temperature did not drop below the dew point whereas an increase in soil surface moisture was observed data analysis of meteorological data indicated that nights with dew represented significantly higher relative humidity higher mean temperatures difference between air and soil surface lower mean wind speed and lower means temperatures than nights without dew table 2 there was found to be a significant positive correlation between dew amounts and the relative moisture in the near surface air when rh 30 fig 7 a a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in the gravel desert ecosystem in addition when rh 80 the dew formation was mainly controlled by air temperature in near surfaces it was showed that there was a positive correlation between the dew amounts and wind velocity under the conditions of moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s fig 7b when wind velocity exceeded 1 8 m s the dew amounts decreased rapidly and when wind velocity exceeded 5 47 m s there was no dew formation table 2 3 3 the water status of reaumuria soongorica responses to dew the relative water contents of r soongorica in the early morning increased from 49 2 under dew absent condition to 56 0 after dew event there was significant 13 8 increase in the plants exposed to dew compared with those of no dew in addition the water potential of the species increased from 14 8 mpa under dew absent condition to 10 3 mpa after dew event with a significant 30 7 increase these results confirmed that the water status of r soongorica showed responses to the dew events significantly table 3 3 4 the diurnal photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of reaumuria soongorica responses to dew a typical two peaked diurnal pattern of net co2 pn assimilation rate was observed under dew absent condition through the study period achieving a maximum daily peak rate at 10 00 in the morning and the second peak rate at 16 00 while an atypical bimodal curve of net co2 assimilation rate was observed under dew present condition with a maximum peak rate at 9 00 and the second peak rate at 14 00 fig 8 b the diurnal average net co2 assimilation rate and the maximum peak rate significantly increased under dew present condition p 0 05 the daily mean value of stomatal conductance gs increased from 75 55 mmol m 2 s 1 under dew absent condition to 90 07 mmol m 2 s 1 after dew event with a maximum value 110 4 mmol m 2 s 1 and 158 8 mmol m 2 s 1 at 8 00 respectively fig 8a the dew events significantly increased the stomatal conductance rate from 8 00 to 10 00 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 the dew formation characteristics very few studies have noted the dew variability in the gravel desert ecosystems which are widely distributed throughout the arid area of northern china current results showed that although soil surface temperature did not drop below the dew point temperature in many observation days soil moisture content at uppermost layer still increased which was accordance with the measurement performed in the negev desert israel agam and berliner 2004 in the tengger desert china pan et al 2010 and in the desert riparian forest china hao et al 2012 these results also indicated that the increase of surface soil moisture was not only due to the dew formation in the case of no rainfall the surface soil moisture in the study area was extremely low table 1 under the condition of no rainfall and the water vapor content at the soil pores was less than that of air demonstrating that water adsorption arises easily during the late afternoon and night rather than through capillary condensation philip and de vries 1957 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 water adsorption is still an important hydrological process in the gravel desert ecosystems a recent study conducted in sandy desert ecosystem also showed that water vapor absorption by soil was a typical characteristic of dew formation zhuang and zhao 2017 likewise it is confirmed that the dominant mechanism is still water adsorption in the gravel desert ecosystems however regardless of dew formation or water absorption a diurnal cycle of latent heat flux is involved in the process agam and berliner 2006 thus in this paper dew amounts consisted of dew formation and water absorption our study showed that the dew amounts and the frequency were lower in the gravel desert ecosystems than that in the sandy desert ecosystem 0 13 mm d zhuang and zhao 2017 which may be explained by the two different substratums it is suggested that there are different thermal conductivity effects and the reaction of the air to temperature and humidity distribution to the two surfaces which is important to dew formation kidron 2000 li 2002 the previous study showed that the soil temperature with gravel cover is 1 4 c higher than under sand cover during daytime li 2002 the gravel acts as an insulator and helps to retain soil heat at night in addition the gravel cools slower than sand in the late afternoon thus the higher soil temperature inhibits vapor condensation another reason for lower dew amounts of gravel may be attributed to higher surface roughness in the gravel habitat increasing the turbulence degree of the airflow it was suggested that the sandy soil can reduce the evaporation rate much more than the gravel especially at the higher wind speed hanks and woodruff 1958 li 2002 the dew variability is primarily controlled by micrometeorological factors many studies have documented that the clear skies moderate winds high relative humidity strong inversions of temperature from the soil surface to the atmosphere and the low surface temperatures were usually beneficial to dew formation kidron 2000 pan et al 2010 guo et al 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 in our study we confirmed that rh tair tsoil t air wind were key factors that influenced the dew formation in the gravel desert table 2 the results indicated that water vapor absorption occurred when rh 30 and dew amounts increased with increasing rh suggesting a threshold of rh is 30 for dew formation in the study area moreover dew amounts were also controlled by wind speed and its influences on dew formation was complicated lower wind speed was not favorable to vapor diffusion and higher wind accelerated evaporation processes beysens 2016 our study also showed that the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable to dew formation whereas wind velocity 1 m s and exceeded 2 5 m s inhibited the dew formation it is indicated that moderate winds increased the transport of water vapor and prevented the air mixing at the surface with air above he and richards 2015 other studies have shown that a wind speed of 5 7 m s is the upper limit for dew formation nilsson 1996 muselli et al 2009 lekouch et al 2011 the determination of key micrometeorological parameters in different desert environments could provide important reference for the calculation of dew models 4 2 the positive effects of dew on reaumuria soongorica dew may play an important role in maintaining plant water status by foliar uptake of moisture wang et al 2016 vegetation dew uses have been noted for shrubs in different regions it has been shown that an improvement in co2 assimilation rates 72 and 138 increasing of relative leaf water content and shoots water potential of lavandula stoechas munné bosch et al 1999 in mediterranean filed condition hill et al 2015 found that artemisia sieberi and haloxylon scoparium used 63 and 46 of their water from dewfall in negev desert respectively such information is still lacking for super xerophytic desert plant where dew may potentially play a critical role in vegetation survival in this study we studied the dominant shrubs r soongorica in the gravel desert habitat at the edge of a desert oasis northwestern china the species showed responses to dew as indicated by the significant increases in their predawn relative leaf water content and shoots water potential after the dew events in a previous study by conducting a series of observations of dew deposition in the dominant annual plant bassia dasyphylla with leaf hairs and agriophyllum squarrosum without leaf hairs at the sandy desert habitat we found that dew improved water status and photosynthetic performance of b dasyphylla in the early morning whereas there was no significantly effects on agriophyllum squarrosum zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 it was also suggested that the anatomical characteristics may play a major role in foliar uptake using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis with a scanning electron microscope wang et al 2016 found water absorbing scales in the leaves of r soongorica could absorb unsaturated water from the air they showed that a complex cellular structure of water absorbing scales surmounted by four to seven valves that formed in inverted cone pore the valves contracted and formed a more or less impermeable lid under low rh while the valves absorbed unsaturated atmospheric water and swelled gradually expanding and forming a larger central opening moreover our results showed that an increase in average co2 assimilation rates and stomatal conductance especially from 8 00 to 10 00 which indicated another mechanism that might be critically associated with physiology and water available these results suggested that the dew events may have potential role in avoiding irreversible damage that the photosynthetic apparatus may suffer when rwc falls below 30 kaiser 1987 therefore dew may play a critical role in improving plant water status and ameliorating the adverse effects of plants exposed to prolonged drought 4 3 ecological significance of dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem dew as an additional source of water may have a positive impact on the vegetation functions microbes and animals as well as on sustaining biogeochemical dynamics during rainless period mchugh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in the present study we found that although the dew is a small percentage of total precipitation and only about 6 6 of total rainfall it is a constant and stable water source and thus plays a significant role in the gravel desert environments with scarce water frequent dew formation improves the rate of seed germination and moistens desert plant and the soil crust generally plant canopy condensation was greater than ground condensation hao et al 2012 plant canopy directly absorbs the dew condensed on their surface foliar absorption of dew could be particularly important in dryland ecosystems because plants commonly undergo periods of water stress in our study area the landscape of vegetation is commonly distributed in patches and low vegetation cover and the main vegetation type is desert vegetation dominated by super xerophytic shrubs such as r soongorica which exhibit strong adaptability to drought and the gravel desert habitats and have important roles in soil water conservation and wind erosion prevention it was found that water absorbing scales in the leaves of r soongorica were critical role in dew foliar uptakes which improved the water status during the drought period on the other hand inorganic salts in or on the valves of water absorbing scales can contribute the atmospheric water molecules to condense on the leaf surface and penetrate them into the leaves of r soongorica moreover although the amount is little compared to the root water uptake the indirect effect of dew is also important dew can wet the leave surface reduce the temperature of plant leaves and adjust the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance the higher relative humidity on leaf surface layer and around the plants decreases the evaporation of soil moisture beneath which makes for the storage of soil moisture in the gravel desert the present study is important for identifying certain underlying principles that might be of use in the hyper arid region where precipitation is very limited and top soil is often dry future study would be valuable to explore the different vegetation dew water use pathways and its mechanisms by stable isotope techniques 5 conclusions despite the increasing attention of dew formation and its effects on vegetation water status in dryland areas we still have limited understanding on the roles of dew formation and its uses by super xerophytic shrubs it was concluded that water adsorption was a primary pathway of dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem relative humidity wind speed air temperature the difference between soil surface temperature and air temperature played important roles in dew formation a threshold of rh 30 is taken to mark possible condensation in addition the moderate wind velocity 1 1 8 m s was favorable for dew formation whereas wind velocity 1 m s or exceeding 2 5 m s inhibited the dew formation in the gravel desert ecosystem dew significantly improved the relative water content water potential and photosynthetic performance to r soongorica growing in the extremely dry environments likely indicating that they could take up dew water through particular water absorbing scales in the leaves this study showed that strong response of plants and soil to dew emphasizing the potential importance of dew in ecohydrological processes in the gravel desert environments the study also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of dew on plant water status in the gravel desert ecosystem and significantly enhances our understanding of vegetation dew water use in such systems the present study has important implications for other arid regions and fills an important knowledge gap in dryland ecohydrology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

confidence intervals of them are obtained as 0 432 1 0 573 1 and 0 923 1 respectively therefore the performance of the sim3 is the best while the sim1 is the worst from the confidence level aspect moreover the comparison between them should be done by the hypothesis testing 4 the proposed way to use lme how to compare two lmes seems to be critical to use lme and prove the advantages of the two

4004,water repellent soils usually experience water flow impedance during the early stage of a wetting process followed by progressive increase of infiltration rate current infiltration models are not formulated to describe this peculiar process similarly simplified methods of soil hydraulic characterization e g best are not equipped to handle water repellent soils here we present an adaptation of the best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of soils at any stage of water repellency we modified the haverkamp explicit transient infiltration model included in best for modeling infiltration data by embedding a scaling factor describing the rate of attenuation of infiltration rate due to water repellency the new model was validated using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture and a dataset that included data from 60 single ring infiltration tests the scaling factor was used as a new index to assess soil water repellency in a mediterranean wooded grassland where the scattered evergreen oak trees induced more noticeable water repellency under the canopies as compared to the open spaces the new index produced results in line with those obtained using the water drop penetration time test which is one of the most widely test applied for quantifying soil water repellency persistence finally we used best wr to determine the hydraulic characteristic curves under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions keywords soil water repellency best water infiltration water retention hydraulic conductivity infiltrometer 1 introduction the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best method was proposed by lassabatere et al 2006 for the complete hydraulic characterization of soil i e for estimating the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the best method uses a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type braud et al 2005 in conjunction with other field and laboratory information the method estimates the shape parameters of the characteristic curves via pedotransfer functions using the textural information otherwise the scale parameters are determined from the infiltration measurement the best method has found a widespread application angulo jaramillo et al 2019 and received recent methodological and theoretical developments by suggesting alternative algorithms to improve the procedure for fitting infiltration data bagarello et al 2014b yilmaz et al 2010 for the estimation of the soil sorptivity and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity other studies aimed at adapting the best methods to other types of physical processes including sealing phenomena bagarello et al 2014a and dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019b although all these improvements allowed best to work satisfactorily in some non ideal conditions one challenge remained to derive soil hydraulic parameters from convex cumulative infiltration curves typical in water repellent soils soil water repellency swr attenuates infiltration rates at early time thus generating convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves with an increasing slope with time a practical implication of this mechanism is that water repellency can be easily detected by visually checking the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve e g alagna et al 2019 iovino et al 2018 lichner et al 2013 sándor et al 2021 this led to infiltration data that is not consistent with the classical physics of infiltration and posed a challenge to the applicability of best under such conditions lassabatere et al 2019a in this investigation we present an adapted best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of both hydrophilic and water repellent soils this method makes use of an empirical exponential scaling factor 1 e α w r t recently proposed by abou najm et al 2021 that describes the rate of attenuation of infiltration rate due to water repellency this scaling factor can be used with any infiltration model short term steady state one dimensional two dimensional or three dimensional the correction factor accounts for the effect of time varying water repellency at the soil surface without influencing the underlying physical model used such that infiltration can still be quantified using common soil hydraulic properties e g soil sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity here we modified the explicit transient infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 which is included in best for modeling infiltration data the new best wr method enables the hydraulic characterization of water repellent soils and allows to successfully analyze heterogeneous datasets including data collected under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions more precisely the best wr method provides the full set of unsaturated hydraulic parameters i e the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves plus the α w r parameter that characterizes the degree of hydrophobicity of the tested soils the best wr method s ability to provide reliable soil hydraulic properties was then tested for both synthetic and real soils to this aim we first validated the infiltration model using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture then with an infiltration dataset that included data from 60 field measurements a further objective of the investigation was to assess swr in a mediterranean wooded grassland system by means of water drop penetration time and the new proposed scaling factor here the scattered evergreen oak trees were expected to induce swr under the canopies playing an important ecohydrological role and affecting water dynamics within the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum 2 theory the best method was developed by lassabatere et al 2006 to estimate parameters for

saturated soil water content note that the case of a null residual soil water content corresponds to the case addressed by best methods angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the shape parameters n m and η are deduced from particle size distribution using specific pedo transfer functions ptf more details on the estimation of these parameters can be found in lassabatere et al 2006 and minasny and mcbratney 2007 for an alternative estimation from the sandy silty and clayey fractions the k s and αvg parameters are derived from the analysis of cumulative water infiltration data for hydrophilic i e non water repellent soils the three dimensional 3d cumulative infiltration i t l and infiltration rate i t l t 1 from a circular source under any zero or negative value of the pressure head can be approached by the following explicit transient and steady state expansions haverkamp et al 1994 2a i t s t as 2 b k s t 2b i t s 2 t as 2 b k s 2c i t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s 2d i s a s 2 k s where t t is the time elapsed since the start of the infiltration event s l t 0 5 is the soil sorptivity i s l t 1 is the steady state infiltration rate b and c are coefficients that can be set equal to 0 467 and 0 639 for most soils with dry initial conditions bagarello et al 2014c and a l 1 is defined as follows 3 a γ r θ s θ i where r l is the radius of the infiltration source θi l3 l 3 is the initial volumetric soil water content and γ is a shape parameter for geometrical correction of the infiltration front shape which is commonly set to 0 75 haverkamp et al 1994 the best algorithm uses eqs 2a and 2b to model the transient cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate data these equations are modified with the replacement of hydraulic conductivity as a function of sorptivity and the experimental steady state infiltration rate i s exp l t 1 using eq 2d leading to 4a k s i s exp a s 2 4b i t s t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp t 4c i t s 2 t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp in this investigation we present an adapted best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of water repellent soils that can also be applied to hydrophilic soils using the correction factor water infiltration into water repellent soils can be modeled as follows abou najm et al 2021 5 i wr t i t 1 e α wr t where i wr t l t 1 is the scaled infiltration rate i t l t 1 is the unscaled infiltration rate that does not account for water repellency and 1 e α w r t is the exponential scaling factor in which the empirical parameter αwr t 1 is considered to reflect the rate of water repellency attenuation during infiltration abou najm et al 2021 here we combine eqs 4c and 5 resulting in the following expression for transient infiltration in a water repellent soil 6 i w r t i t 1 e α w r t s 2 t a 1 b s 2 b i

two unknown parameters αwr and s in comparison the examples in abou najm et al 2021 fit the model with three unknown parameters αwr s and a parameter related to k s thus eq 7 is more likely to identify unique parameters when analysed using classical least squares optimization then the other hydraulic parameters related to the water retention and the hydraulic conductivity curves are estimated as in best slope method lassabatere et al 2006 3 material and methods 3 1 analytical validation we assessed the accuracy of the proposed infiltration model eq 7 for six soils with regularly shaped convex i t curves using synthetic soils previously characterized by di prima et al 2020 and hinnell et al 2009 sand loamy sand sandy loam loam silt loam silty clay loam these soils were chosen to cover a wide range of hydraulic responses without water repellency we modelled infiltration experiments for these synthetic hydrophilic soils using the model proposed by smettem et al 1994 8 i t i 1 d t γ s 2 r δθ where δθ θs θi i l is the 3d cumulative infiltration and i 1d l is the 1d cumulative infiltration into uniform initially unsaturated soil profiles here we modelled i 1d using the following implicit equation haverkamp et al 1990 9 2 δ k 2 s 2 t 1 1 β 2 δ k s 2 i 1 d t k i t l n e x p 2 β δ k s 2 i 1 d t k i t β 1 β where k i l t 1 is the initial soil hydraulic conductivity δk k s k i and β is a shape parameter related to water diffusivity that is commonly set equal to 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 the synthetic curves were modelled considering an initially dry condition with an initial value of the saturation degree se of 0 1 this value was converted to the equivalent θi value for each soil using the relationship se θi θr θs θr we considered the θr values from table 1 for computing the sorptivity and modelling the synthetic curves the sorptivity was then estimated as follows parlange 1975 10 s 0 h θ i θ s θ h 2 θ i k h d h the integral in eq 10 was computed using the intg function defined in scilab campbell et al 2010 and validated against the new procedure proposed by lassabatere et al 2021 the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity functions were calculated according to the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 hydraulic parameters for the six synthetic soils were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 default values of β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were assumed as commonly suggested by many investigations angulo jaramillo et al 2019 to ensure steady state conditions each infiltration process was modelled for a period three times longer than the maximum time for which eqs 2a and 2b are considered valid haverkamp et al 1994 with t max t calculated as follows lassabatere et al 2006 11 t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 for the generation of the cumulative infiltrations for the water repellent soils we extended the quasi exact implicit qei model developed by haverkamp et al 1990 to water repellent soils at this aim we considered the integration of the corrected infiltration eq 5 12 i w r t 0 t i t 1 e α w r t d t the eq 12 was simplified considering integration by parts and algebraic operations to relate the cumulative infiltration corrected for water repellency i w r t with the cumulative infiltration of the same soil without water repellency i t leading to 13 i w r t 1 e α w r t i t α w r 0 t e α w r t i t d t for the computation of eq 13 we injected synthetic curves i t into eq 13 to compute the cumulative infiltration for the same soils with water repellency i w r t the empirical parameter αwr was varied from 0 04 to 10000 h 1 depending on the type of soil to cover the whole range of shapes from regular concave to convex with an inflection point regarding time set the final time was set as the maximum time between 3 t max and the time t rec needed to recover 95 of the regular infiltration rate i e so that 1 e α w r t 0 95 indeed if such a time is not reached the infiltration rate i w r t continues to increase the steady state is not reached and the operator should continue the experiment on the field the two sets of infiltration data obtained for hydrophilic soils i t and water repellent soils i wr t were treated with the new algorithm best wr at first the criterion suggested by bagarello et al 1999 was used to separate the transient and steady state conditions for cumulative infiltration data we conducted a linear regression analysis for the last three data points of i t versus t then the time to steady state t s l was determined as the first value for which 14 e i t i reg t i t e where i reg t is estimated from regression analysis and e defines a given threshold to check linearity eq 14 was applied from the start of the experiment until finding the first data point that fits the condition e e angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the commonly used value of e 2 was adopted in this investigation the slope i s exp l t 1 was estimated by linear regression analysis of steady state data i e all data points measured after time t s when e 2 then the estimators for s and αwr s and α w r were obtained fitting the transient portion of the synthetic data i e data points from time 0 until time t s when e 2 to eq 7 by minimizing the sum of square of errors sse between synthetic data and modeled cumulative infiltration the optimization was carried out with 25 sets of initial parameter values for s w r and α w r using the following starting values s w r 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 mm h 0 5 and α w r 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 h 1 the parameter set with the smallest sse was chosen as the global optimum solution the estimator for k s k s w r was estimated via eq 4a for comparison we also analyzed the data using eq 4b this comparison was aimed to highlight contrasting fitting abilities between the two models adapted to water repellency eq 7 and the regular best method eq 4b when analyzing data affected by water repellency thus we obtained two estimations for soil sorptivity namely s w r from eq 7 and s from eq 4b leading to two estimations for the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s w r and k s from eq 4a the accuracy of these fits was assessed on the basis of the consistency of the model shape and the fit relative error er f i t estimated as follows 15 er f i t i 1 k i e x p t i i e s t t i 2 i 1 k i exp 2 t i where k is the number of data points considered for the transient state and i exp and i est are the experimental and estimated values for water infiltration relative error er was also calculated for each estimated value for α w r soil sorptivity s w r and s and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s w r and k s compared to the corresponding reference value i e αwr s and k s as follows 16 e r x x x x where x is the estimated value and x is the target i e the reference value αwr s and k s table 2 according to the accuracy criterion by reynolds 2013 the estimates were deemed accurate when they fell within the range 0 75 x x 1 25 i e e r x 25 error this stringent criterion was used because the parameters were estimated by analytically generated data and therefore were free of the perturbations embedded in field and laboratory measurements e g measurement error random noise and natural variability 3 2 experimental site the berchidda site 40 48 57 28 n 9 17 33 09 e is a mediterranean wooded grassland system with herbaceous grasslands dominated by annual species and scattered evergreen oak trees quercus suber l and quercus ilex l located in the long term observatory of berchidda monti in ne sardinia italy bagella et al 2020 the site is representative of agro silvo pastoral systems widespread in the mediterranean basin in particular within the iberian peninsula lozano parra et al 2015 the mean annual rainfall is 632 mm of which 70 occurs during october to may the mean annual temperature is 14 2 c according to the usda standards the sampled soils of the upper horizon ranged in texture from sandy loam to loamy sand typic dystroxerept table 3 the natural potential vegetation is mainly represented by cork oak forests also referred to as the violo dehnhardtii quercetum suberis association bagella et al 2016 3 3 automated single ring infiltration test sixty single ring infiltration tests were performed at randomly selected sampling points in correspondence of three selected trees thirty below tree canopies ten below each tree and another thirty in the open grasslands ten in the proximity of each tree in the open spaces for each sampling point the litter and leaf residues were gently removed from the soil surface and a stainless steel ring with a 15 cm inner diameter was inserted shallowly into the soil according to the beerkan procedure for single ring infiltration experiments lassabatere et al 2006 the tests were carried out using the automated single ring infiltrometer proposed by concialdi et al 2020 to infiltrate a total cumulative infiltration of 280 mm assuming an infiltration surface of 94 cm2 the devices were equipped with differential transducers to measure the drop of water level in the mariotte reservoirs see fig 1 in concialdi et al 2020 to setup the experiment we followed the procedure described in di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 we firstly positioned a plastic film on the soil surface inside the ring and applied a small water head of few mm depending on the surface roughness and never exceeding 10 mm the infiltrometer was positioned inside the ring and regulated in height so that the base was in contact with the ponded water the data acquisition started after the mariotte bottle was filled with water and activated finally the infiltration experiment started when the plastic film was removed the automated procedure proposed by concialdi et al 2020 to treat the transducer output was subsequently applied to determine the cumulative infiltration curves a video tutorial showing the field procedure and the data processing can be viewed online di prima 2019 for each site undisturbed soil cores 50 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and used to determine both the soil bulk density ρb g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θi cm3cm 3 disturbed soil samples were also collected to determine the particle size distribution psd gee and bauder 1986 the measured soil physical properties are summarized in table 3 all the experimental infiltration curves were analyzed using the same procedure described above for the synthetic data in addition we followed lassabatere et al 2006 and used the s wr and k s wr estimations in conjunction with the psd to calculate the van genuchten scale parameter αvg wr values see eq 22 in lassabatere et al 2006 3 4 water drop penetration time wdpt test the water drop penetration time wdpt test wessel 1988 was aimed at characterizing contrasting responses in terms of soil surface wettability between two contrasting situations i e below the tree canopies and in open spaces this method is one of the most widely applied for quantifying swr persistence doerr et al 2000 wdpt tests were conducted at the three selected trees with nine tests below tree canopies and other nine in open spaces for each sampling point the litter and leaf residues were gently removed from the soil surface and ten drops 0 05 ml of distilled water were placed using a pipette onto the soil surface at a small distance i e a few cm one to another and measuring the actual time until complete infiltration of each drop the recorded time was stopped after 3600 s although some drops did not infiltrate during this time interval in such cases a wdpt value of 3600 s was assigned buczko et al 2006 thus we measured the infiltration of 180 drops ninety below the tree canopies and other ninety in the open spaces for each situation a representative wdpt value was obtained by averaging the ninety wdpt measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 analytical validation for six synthetic soils when cumulative infiltration was calculated for all synthetic soils without water repellency table 2 using eqs 8 and 9 all curves exhibited a concave shape as a function of time typical for hydrophilic soils fig 1 red reference curves as the process approached steady state cumulative infiltration curves became approximately linear with time this behaviour is well known for hydrophilic soils and shows how the influence of capillarity decreases as the wetting front moves away from the source and the hydraulic gradient decreases xu et al 2012 when cumulative infiltration was calculated using eq 13 to include water repellency the curves exhibited a concave shape for higher αwr values and a convex shape for lower αwr values fig 1 the latter being typical of water repellent soils these shapes are in line with observed water infiltrations into water repellent soils convex shapes may be explained as follows when water infiltrates into these soils the advance of water during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles resulting in a contact angle higher than 90 between soil and water jarvis et al 2008 in addition the hydrophobic material is often heterogeneously distributed leading to a fractional wettability of the bulk media and the concomitance of contrasting factors that simultaneously tends to increase and decrease infiltration rates beatty and smith 2013 as a consequence the final shape of the cumulative infiltration curve is the result of the relative importance during the infiltration process of water repellency which triggers an increase in the infiltration rate over time and the usual gravity and capillarity driven flow with decreasing infiltration rate over time until the attainment of steady state our model eq 13 reproduced these trends in addition we note that for the highest αwr values the curves generated using eq 13 are almost identical with the reference curves generated using the haverkamp eqs 8 and 9 this clearly points to the ability of eq 13 to accurately calculate cumulative infiltration also for the case of hydrophilic soils provided that values of α wr were chosen large enough the proposed model eq 13 is then consistent with the modelling of both hydrophilic soils no water repellency and water repellent soils for the treatment of the synthetic data with best wr we first determined the time to steady state t s with the condition e 2 this threshold split the synthetic data into two subsets a transient phase i e when e 2 and a steady state phase i e when e 2 we estimated from the steady state portion the value of the linear regression model slope i s exp and intercept b s exp mm note that flow impediment at the beginning of the infiltration experiment leads convex shaped curves and therefore to negative b s exp values table 2 thus negative values of this parameter can be considered indicative of the occurrence of water repellency phenomena although other factors could also play some role such as heterogeneous soil structure changes in soil structure during the infiltration run air entrapment heterogeneous profiles for initial soil moisture and temperature e g loizeau et al 2017 then eqs 7 and 4b were fitted to the transient portion of the curve using i s exp and optimizing α w r and s w r for eq 7 and s for eq 4b before deriving k s w r and k s with eq 4a the fitting of eq 7 to transient data was accurate with er fit wr values never exceeding 0 3 table 2 on the other hand less accurate fits were found for eq 4b with increasing er fit values for decreasing αwr more convex curves and values ranging from 0 3 to 12 8 more specifically 45 3 of er fit values were higher than 5 that is commonly considered the threshold for accurate fits regarding the quality of estimates relative error er s and er k s between estimated s w r and k s wr and reference s and k s values ranged from 22 1 to 11 1 circle symbols in fig 2 indicating that all s w r and k s w r values were accurate based on our stated criterion er 25 however the errors always increased for decreasing αwr values we therefore argue that the soil hydraulic properties may be misestimated in case of very low αwr values namely for extremely convex shaped curves in this case best wr is expected to overestimate s and consequently to underestimate k s regarding the αwr parameter er αwr ranged from 65 1 to 4 8 table 2 most of the estimations were below the selected threshold of 25 although for each synthetic soil the one or two highest αwr yielded er αwr values higher than 25 fig 3 however this parameter is expected to have a less relevant effect on the estimation of the soil parameters s and k s when it assumes very high values indeed the lowest errors for s and k s were found for high αwr values fig 2 in other words we gain in accuracy for s and k s for moderate or light water repellency and for αwr for strong water repellency in all cases the parameters easier to estimate are those that have a relevant impact on the cumulative infiltration for best eq 4b relative error between estimated s and k s and reference s and k s values ranged from 90 5 to 161 9 square symbols in fig 2 therefore best wr produced considerably lower relative error values in comparison to best revealing a substantially higher prediction ability of the proposed method more specifically for the case of concave shaped curves high αwr values both methods yielded low er s and er k s values these results suggest that eqs 7 and 4a provide similar results for hydrophilic soils and that the proposed method can also be applied to hydrophilic soils for the case of convex shaped curves low αwr values the discrepancy between the two methods become relevant and only best wr provided a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s in other words best wr applies to both water repellent and hydrophilic soils therefore we can conclude that theoretically the application of best wr to hydrophilic soils should not affect the quality of the estimates for sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity and that the proposed model should apply to all cases 4 2 assessing soil water repellency in a mediterranean wooded grassland system both the αwr parameter and wdpt were non normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov test even if log transformed thus we used the non parametric kruskal wallis test to determine whether the medians of two groups open space and below tree canopy were different in the open spaces the wdpt values ranged between 1 and 259 s with a median value equal to 5 s below the tree canopies the median wdpt value was 1404 s with 19 out of 90 drops 21 that lasted 3600 s to infiltrate according to the kruskal wallis test the two medians were significantly different p 0 05 with higher wdpt values below the canopies as compared to the open spaces according to the classification proposed by dekker and ritsema 1994 the wdpt values were grouped in five classes from wettable wdpt 5 s to extremely water repellent wdpt 3600 s fig 4 wettable conditions were only found in the open spaces with 47 8 of the drops that infiltrated in 5 s here the 41 1 of the tests were classified as slightly water repellent and the 11 1 as strongly water repellent below the tree canopies prevailed water repellent conditions with the 21 1 of the drops that lasted 3600 s to infiltrate extremely water repellent 46 7 of the tests were classified severely water repellent 27 8 as strongly water repellent and 4 4 as slightly water repellent thus below the tree canopies and for initially dry conditions phenomena of flow impedance are expected to be stronger as compared to the open spaces however this type of test could be insufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic response of a water repellent soil indeed swr can promote preferential flow and by pass flow that cannot be detected by a drop scale measurement technique e g bachmann et al 2003 chen et al 2020 scott 2000 compared to wdpt αwr includes information on flow dynamics therefore it can be considered more physically linked to the hydrological processes affected by water repellency we then compared the values of αwr to the values of wdpts in the open spaces αwr values ranged between 1 4 and 1364 2 h 1 with a median value equal to 12 7 h 1 according to the kruskal wallis test the αwr values measured below the tree canopies were significantly lower table 4 fig 5 with values ranging from 0 5 to 320 5 h 1 and a median value equal to 6 6 h 1 low αwr values are associated with increased swr effect and initially attenuated infiltration rates which typically results in convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves abou najm et al 2021 thus both αwr and wdpt measurements revealed more noticeable soil water repellent phenomena below the canopies as compared to the open spaces this likely because the higher soil organic carbon content in the 0 40 cm soil layer below the trees seddaiu et al 2018 previous studies also reported soil hydrophobicity below the canopies of mediterranean oaks di prima et al 2017 lozano parra et al 2015 4 3 experimental assessment of best wr given that intermediate water repellency conditions were found in both locations i e below tree canopies and open spaces fig 4 we decided to group the infiltration measurements based on the shape of the cumulative infiltration curves which can reveal the occurrence of water repellent conditions angulo jaramillo et al 2019 three main types of shapes can be detected i regular shape with a concave part followed by a linear part decreasing infiltration rate which is associated with infiltration into hydrophilic mineral materials ii a typical convex hockey stick like relationship increasing infiltration rate which is associated with hydrophobic organic materials and iii a mixed shape concave then convex with a very small concave part followed by the hockey stick like shape decreasing before increasing infiltration rate this latter shape associated with weak water repellency phenomena due to fractional wettability angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the impact of hydrophobicity on the shape of the cumulative infiltration influences best treatment of the data leading to failed analysis due to a poor fit of the infiltration model and negative values for the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity di prima et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2019a specifically measurements were grouped into three subsets i those that have a convex hockey stick like shape 43 runs out 60 71 7 ii those that have a concave then convex shape 9 runs out 60 15 0 and iii those that have a concave shape 8 runs out 60 13 3 in the open spaces 17 runs out 30 56 7 exhibited convex shaped curves while 7 23 3 had a concave then convex shape and 6 20 0 were concave shaped below the tree canopies the number of convex shaped curves increased to 26 out 30 86 7 while only 4 13 3 had concave then convex shapes or were concave shaped two for each type this result confirms the observations done using wdpt data that water repellent conditions were found in both locations with more occurrences below the tree canopies fig 6 shows three examples one for each case the subpanel a illustrates the case of a convex shaped curve this experiment has infiltration rates that increased with time such that the cumulative infiltration curve exhibited a convex shape for this run the fitting of eq 7 produced a considerably lower relative error value in comparison to eq 4b i e er fit wr 0 6 against er fit 10 4 revealing a substantially higher fitting ability of the proposed model eq 7 adapted to convex shaped data the value of αwr was equal to 2 8 h 1 while the two values of soil sorptivity s wr and s estimated fitting respectively eqs 7 and 4b to the experimental data were equal to 75 0 and 22 8 mm h 0 5 differing by a factor of 3 3 for the cases of concave then convex shape fig 6 b and concave shaped fig 6 c curves we estimated higher αwr values because of the reduced effect of water repellency on the infiltration process the discrepancies between the two models in terms of relative error soil sorptivity and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity were less noticeable for the case of weak water repellency fig 6 b or even negligible when the experiment was not affected at all fig 6 c indeed for this latter case we estimated almost the same values of soil sorptivity with s wr and s equal respectively to 73 9 and 70 9 mm h 0 5 and low fitting relative error values in both cases these results suggest that eqs 7 and 4b provide the same result in case of hydrophilic soils however only the new proposed model eq 7 can provide a satisfactory fitting and a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s when water repellency occurs i e for the case of convex shaped curves in other words this result supports the same conclusions stated above for the analytical validation i e that best wr applies to both water repellent and hydrophilic soils these observations can be generalized to all the infiltration measurements fig 7 a illustrates the discrepancy between αwr values associated with different shapes of the cumulative infiltration curves and thus with the relevance of water repellency phenomena at the soil surface a similarity between sorptivity values were always found for weak or no repellency conditions fig 7 b s wr s close to unity otherwise the discrepancy between the two estimations become relevant for convex shaped curves a remarkable result is that eq 7 provided similar soil hydraulic properties s and k s for the three cases independently from the shape of the curves table 5 taken together these findings suggest that the correction factor can quantify the effect of water repellency at the soil surface without impacting the physical model used so that infiltration continues to be quantified using common soil hydraulic properties the results obtained here can be viewed as a confirmation of the conclusion by abou najm et al 2021 now there remains the question of the meaning of αwr does it correspond to an intrinsic parameter or otherwise a macroscopic parameter that depends at the same time on the soil features in terms of organic matter etc and on initial conditions water content and type of application of water 4 4 hydraulic characterization through best wr of the soils below the tree canopies and in the grassland best wr allowed to estimate the scale θs k s and αvg and shape n m and η parameters of the soil characteristics curves table 6 once s and k s were estimated with eq 7 the remaining parameters were estimated in the same way as for best slope lassabatere et al 2006 while the scale parameters were determined by modeling infiltration data through eq 7 the shape parameters were estimated from the psd analysis according to the procedure developed in lassabatere et al 2006 the hydraulic shape parameters for the two locations were similar due to their similar textures table 6 among the scale parameters only θs differed between the two locations because of the lower bulk density values measured below the tree canopies table 3 fig 8 shows for the two locations the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves predicted by best wr the water retention curves are presented with water content as a function of water pressure head with log scale fig 8 a the hydraulic conductivity was plotted with log scale as a function of water content fig 8 b the curves measured below the tree canopies are more positioned on the right namely the water content corresponding to a given pressure head is generally higher for these curves as compared to the open space indicating higher capillarity effects fig 8 a for this location the hydraulic conductivity functions are positioned below in the graph namely the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to a given water content is generally lower as compared to the open space indicating a lower capacity to conduct water under unsaturated conditions although under saturated condition the hydraulic conductivity is similar for the two locations table 6 a higher capacity to retain water by capillarity below the tree canopies can be viewed as a mechanism of soil moisture capture that increases the storage capacity of patchy areas within the wooded grassland system naveed et al 2019 in addition these patches are less susceptible to soil evaporation losses due to the shadow of the canopies and the presence of a surface water repellent layer robinson et al 2010 during the summer drought this may constitute a competitive advantage for the scattered trees with more water available for the trees as compared to the open grassland 5 summary and conclusions in this investigation we presented an adaptation of the best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of both hydrophilic and water repellent soils we validated the proposed method using both analytically generated data and infiltration experiments carried out in a mediterranean wooded grassland where the scattered evergreen oak trees induced soil water repellency under the canopies the analytical validation and the field measurements supported our hypothesis that the modified haverkamp model eq 7 included in best wr is suitable to predict s and k s under both hydrophilic and water repellent conditions eqs 7 and 4b provided similar results only for the case of hydrophilic soils concave shaped curves conversely when water repellency occurred only eq 7 provided satisfactory fittings and proper estimations of s and k s in addition eq 7 proved to quantify the effect of water repellency at the soil surface without impacting the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties the use of αwr as a new hydrological swr index allowed us to detect more noticeable soil water repellent phenomena below the canopies as compared to the open grassland these measurements were in line with those obtained using the wdpt test which is one of the most widely test applied for quantifying swr persistence at the same time best wr succeeded in determining the soil characteristics curves these curves evidenced a higher capacity to retain water by capillarity below the tree canopies and highlighted how scattered trees can strongly influence ecohydrological processes and water dynamics within wooded grassland systems supported by these examples we expect that the new method will allow researchers to better approach heterogeneous datasets including data collected on both hydrophilic and water repellent soils the versatility of the new method makes it a good candidate to successfully analyze infiltration databases as those developed by rahmati et al 2018 and di prima et al 2020 funding this work was supported through i the european regional development fund erdf and the italian ministry

4004,water repellent soils usually experience water flow impedance during the early stage of a wetting process followed by progressive increase of infiltration rate current infiltration models are not formulated to describe this peculiar process similarly simplified methods of soil hydraulic characterization e g best are not equipped to handle water repellent soils here we present an adaptation of the best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of soils at any stage of water repellency we modified the haverkamp explicit transient infiltration model included in best for modeling infiltration data by embedding a scaling factor describing the rate of attenuation of infiltration rate due to water repellency the new model was validated using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture and a dataset that included data from 60 single ring infiltration tests the scaling factor was used as a new index to assess soil water repellency in a mediterranean wooded grassland where the scattered evergreen oak trees induced more noticeable water repellency under the canopies as compared to the open spaces the new index produced results in line with those obtained using the water drop penetration time test which is one of the most widely test applied for quantifying soil water repellency persistence finally we used best wr to determine the hydraulic characteristic curves under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions keywords soil water repellency best water infiltration water retention hydraulic conductivity infiltrometer 1 introduction the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best method was proposed by lassabatere et al 2006 for the complete hydraulic characterization of soil i e for estimating the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the best method uses a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type braud et al 2005 in conjunction with other field and laboratory information the method estimates the shape parameters of the characteristic curves via pedotransfer functions using the textural information otherwise the scale parameters are determined from the infiltration measurement the best method has found a widespread application angulo jaramillo et al 2019 and received recent methodological and theoretical developments by suggesting alternative algorithms to improve the procedure for fitting infiltration data bagarello et al 2014b yilmaz et al 2010 for the estimation of the soil sorptivity and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity other studies aimed at adapting the best methods to other types of physical processes including sealing phenomena bagarello et al 2014a and dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019b although all these improvements allowed best to work satisfactorily in some non ideal conditions one challenge remained to derive soil hydraulic parameters from convex cumulative infiltration curves typical in water repellent soils soil water repellency swr attenuates infiltration rates at early time thus generating convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves with an increasing slope with time a practical implication of this mechanism is that water repellency can be easily detected by visually checking the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve e g alagna et al 2019 iovino et al 2018 lichner et al 2013 sándor et al 2021 this led to infiltration data that is not consistent with the classical physics of infiltration and posed a challenge to the applicability of best under such conditions lassabatere et al 2019a in this investigation we present an adapted best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of both hydrophilic and water repellent soils this method makes use of an empirical exponential scaling factor 1 e α w r t recently proposed by abou najm et al 2021 that describes the rate of attenuation of infiltration rate due to water repellency this scaling factor can be used with any infiltration model short term steady state one dimensional two dimensional or three dimensional the correction factor accounts for the effect of time varying water repellency at the soil surface without influencing the underlying physical model used such that infiltration can still be quantified using common soil hydraulic properties e g soil sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity here we modified the explicit transient infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 which is included in best for modeling infiltration data the new best wr method enables the hydraulic characterization of water repellent soils and allows to successfully analyze heterogeneous datasets including data collected under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions more precisely the best wr method provides the full set of unsaturated hydraulic parameters i e the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves plus the α w r parameter that characterizes the degree of hydrophobicity of the tested soils the best wr method s ability to provide reliable soil hydraulic properties was then tested for both synthetic and real soils to this aim we first validated the infiltration model using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture then with an infiltration dataset that included data from 60 field measurements a further objective of the investigation was to assess swr in a mediterranean wooded grassland system by means of water drop penetration time and the new proposed scaling factor here the scattered evergreen oak trees were expected to induce swr under the canopies playing an important ecohydrological role and affecting water dynamics within the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum 2 theory the best method was developed by lassabatere et al 2006 to estimate parameters for the van genuchten 1980 water retention curve θ h with the burdine 1953 condition and the brooks and corey 1964 relationship for hydraulic conductivity k θ 1a θ h θ s 1 α v g h n m 1b m 1 2 n 1c k θ k

saturated soil water content note that the case of a null residual soil water content corresponds to the case addressed by best methods angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the shape parameters n m and η are deduced from particle size distribution using specific pedo transfer functions ptf more details on the estimation of these parameters can be found in lassabatere et al 2006 and minasny and mcbratney 2007 for an alternative estimation from the sandy silty and clayey fractions the k s and αvg parameters are derived from the analysis of cumulative water infiltration data for hydrophilic i e non water repellent soils the three dimensional 3d cumulative infiltration i t l and infiltration rate i t l t 1 from a circular source under any zero or negative value of the pressure head can be approached by the following explicit transient and steady state expansions haverkamp et al 1994 2a i t s t as 2 b k s t 2b i t s 2 t as 2 b k s 2c i t a s 2 k s t c s 2 k s 2d i s a s 2 k s where t t is the time elapsed since the start of the infiltration event s l t 0 5 is the soil sorptivity i s l t 1 is the steady state infiltration rate b and c are coefficients that can be set equal to 0 467 and 0 639 for most soils with dry initial conditions bagarello et al 2014c and a l 1 is defined as follows 3 a γ r θ s θ i where r l is the radius of the infiltration source θi l3 l 3 is the initial volumetric soil water content and γ is a shape parameter for geometrical correction of the infiltration front shape which is commonly set to 0 75 haverkamp et al 1994 the best algorithm uses eqs 2a and 2b to model the transient cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate data these equations are modified with the replacement of hydraulic conductivity as a function of sorptivity and the experimental steady state infiltration rate i s exp l t 1 using eq 2d leading to 4a k s i s exp a s 2 4b i t s t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp t 4c i t s 2 t a 1 b s 2 b i s exp in this investigation we present an adapted best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of water repellent soils that can also be applied to hydrophilic soils using the correction factor water infiltration into water repellent soils can be modeled as follows abou najm et al 2021 5 i wr t i t 1 e α wr t where i wr t l t 1 is the scaled infiltration rate i t l t 1 is the unscaled infiltration rate that does not account for water repellency and 1 e α w r t is the exponential scaling factor in which the empirical parameter αwr t 1 is considered to reflect the rate of water repellency attenuation during infiltration abou najm et al 2021 here we combine eqs 4c and 5 resulting in the following expression for transient infiltration in a water repellent soil 6 i w r t i t 1 e α w r t s 2 t a 1 b s 2 b i

two unknown parameters αwr and s in comparison the examples in abou najm et al 2021 fit the model with three unknown parameters αwr s and a parameter related to k s thus eq 7 is more likely to identify unique parameters when analysed using classical least squares optimization then the other hydraulic parameters related to the water retention and the hydraulic conductivity curves are estimated as in best slope method lassabatere et al 2006 3 material and methods 3 1 analytical validation we assessed the accuracy of the proposed infiltration model eq 7 for six soils with regularly shaped convex i t curves using synthetic soils previously characterized by di prima et al 2020 and hinnell et al 2009 sand loamy sand sandy loam loam silt loam silty clay loam these soils were chosen to cover a wide range of hydraulic responses without water repellency we modelled infiltration experiments for these synthetic hydrophilic soils using the model proposed by smettem et al 1994 8 i t i 1 d t γ s 2 r δθ where δθ θs θi i l is the 3d cumulative infiltration and i 1d l is the 1d cumulative infiltration into uniform initially unsaturated soil profiles here we modelled i 1d using the following implicit equation haverkamp et al 1990 9 2 δ k 2 s 2 t 1 1 β 2 δ k s 2 i 1 d t k i t l n e x p 2 β δ k s 2 i 1 d t k i t β 1 β where k i l t 1 is the initial soil hydraulic conductivity δk k s k i and β is a shape parameter related to water diffusivity that is commonly set equal to 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 the synthetic curves were modelled considering an initially dry condition with an initial value of the saturation degree se of 0 1 this value was converted to the equivalent θi value for each soil using the relationship se θi θr θs θr we considered the θr values from table 1 for computing the sorptivity and modelling the synthetic curves the sorptivity was then estimated as follows parlange 1975 10 s 0 h θ i θ s θ h 2 θ i k h d h the integral in eq 10 was computed using the intg function defined in scilab campbell et al 2010 and validated against the new procedure proposed by lassabatere et al 2021 the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity functions were calculated according to the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 hydraulic parameters for the six synthetic soils were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 default values of β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were assumed as commonly suggested by many investigations angulo jaramillo et al 2019 to ensure steady state conditions each infiltration process was modelled for a period three times longer than the maximum time for which eqs 2a and 2b are considered valid haverkamp et al 1994 with t max t calculated as follows lassabatere et al 2006 11 t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 for the generation of the cumulative infiltrations for the water repellent soils we extended the quasi exact implicit qei model developed by haverkamp et al 1990 to water repellent soils at this aim we considered the integration of the corrected infiltration eq 5 12 i w r t 0 t i t 1 e α w r t d t the eq 12 was simplified considering integration by parts and algebraic operations to relate the cumulative infiltration corrected for water repellency i w r t with the cumulative infiltration of the same soil without water repellency i t leading to 13 i w r t 1 e α w r t i t α w r 0 t e α w r t i t d t for the computation of eq 13 we injected synthetic curves i t into eq 13 to compute the cumulative infiltration for the same soils with water repellency i w r t the empirical parameter αwr was varied from 0 04 to 10000 h 1 depending on the type of soil to cover the whole range of shapes from regular concave to convex with an inflection point regarding time set the final time was set as the maximum time between 3 t max and the time t rec needed to recover 95 of the regular infiltration rate i e so that 1 e α w r t 0 95 indeed if such a time is not reached the infiltration rate i w r t continues to increase the steady state is not reached and the operator should continue the experiment on the field the two sets of infiltration data obtained for hydrophilic soils i t and water repellent soils i wr t were treated with the new algorithm best wr at first the criterion suggested by bagarello et al 1999 was used to separate the transient and steady state conditions for cumulative infiltration data we conducted a linear regression analysis for the last three data points of i t versus t then the time to steady state t s l was determined as the first value for which 14 e i t i reg t i t e where i reg t is estimated from regression analysis and e defines a given threshold to check linearity eq 14 was applied from the start of the experiment until finding the first data point that fits the condition e e angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the commonly used value of e 2 was adopted in this investigation the slope i s exp l t 1 was estimated by linear regression analysis of steady state data i e all data points measured after time t s when e 2 then the estimators for s and αwr s and α w r were obtained fitting the transient portion of the synthetic data i e data points from time 0 until time t s when e 2 to eq 7 by minimizing the sum of square of errors sse between synthetic data and modeled cumulative infiltration the optimization was carried out with 25 sets of initial parameter values for s w r and α w r using the following starting values s w r 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 mm h 0 5 and α w r 0 001 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 h 1 the parameter set with the smallest sse was chosen as the global optimum solution the estimator for k s k s w r was estimated via eq 4a for comparison we also analyzed the data using eq 4b this comparison was aimed to highlight contrasting fitting abilities between the two models adapted to water repellency eq 7 and the regular best method eq 4b when analyzing data affected by water repellency thus we obtained two estimations for soil sorptivity namely s w r from eq 7 and s from eq 4b leading to two estimations for the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s w r and k s from eq 4a the accuracy of these fits was assessed on the basis of the consistency of the model shape and the fit relative error er f i t estimated as follows 15 er f i t i 1 k i e x p t i i e s t t i 2 i 1 k i exp 2 t i where k is the number of data points considered for the transient state and i exp and i est are the experimental and estimated values for water infiltration relative error er was also calculated for each estimated value for α w r soil sorptivity s w r and s and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s w r and k s compared to the corresponding reference value i e αwr s and k s as follows 16 e r x x x x where x is the estimated value and x is the target i e the reference value αwr s and k s table 2 according to the accuracy criterion by reynolds 2013 the estimates were deemed accurate when they fell within the range 0 75 x x 1 25 i e e r x 25 error this stringent criterion was used because the parameters were estimated by analytically generated data and therefore were free of the perturbations embedded in field and laboratory measurements e g measurement error random noise and natural variability 3 2 experimental site the berchidda site 40 48 57 28 n 9 17 33 09 e is a mediterranean wooded grassland system with herbaceous grasslands dominated by annual species and scattered evergreen oak trees quercus suber l and quercus ilex l located in the long term observatory of berchidda monti in ne sardinia italy bagella et al 2020 the site is representative of agro silvo pastoral systems widespread in the mediterranean basin in particular within the iberian peninsula lozano parra et al 2015 the mean annual rainfall is 632 mm of which 70 occurs during october to may the mean annual temperature is 14 2 c according to the usda standards the sampled soils of the upper horizon ranged in texture from sandy loam to loamy sand typic dystroxerept table 3 the natural potential vegetation is mainly represented by cork oak forests also referred to as the violo dehnhardtii quercetum suberis association bagella et al 2016 3 3 automated single ring infiltration test sixty single ring infiltration tests were performed at randomly selected sampling points in correspondence of three selected trees thirty below tree canopies ten below each tree and another thirty in the open grasslands ten in the proximity of each tree in the open spaces for each sampling point the litter and leaf residues were gently removed from the soil surface and a stainless steel ring with a 15 cm inner diameter was inserted shallowly into the soil according to the beerkan procedure for single ring infiltration experiments lassabatere et al 2006 the tests were carried out using the automated single ring infiltrometer proposed by concialdi et al 2020 to infiltrate a total cumulative infiltration of 280 mm assuming an infiltration surface of 94 cm2 the devices were equipped with differential transducers to measure the drop of water level in the mariotte reservoirs see fig 1 in concialdi et al 2020 to setup the experiment we followed the procedure described in di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 we firstly positioned a plastic film on the soil surface inside the ring and applied a small water head of few mm depending on the surface roughness and never exceeding 10 mm the infiltrometer was positioned inside the ring and regulated in height so that the base was in contact with the ponded water the data acquisition started after the mariotte bottle was filled with water and activated finally the infiltration experiment started when the plastic film was removed the automated procedure proposed by concialdi et al 2020 to treat the transducer output was subsequently applied to determine the cumulative infiltration curves a video tutorial showing the field procedure and the data processing can be viewed online di prima 2019 for each site undisturbed soil cores 50 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and used to determine both the soil bulk density ρb g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θi cm3cm 3 disturbed soil samples were also collected to determine the particle size distribution psd gee and bauder 1986 the measured soil physical properties are summarized in table 3 all the experimental infiltration curves were analyzed using the same procedure described above for the synthetic data in addition we followed lassabatere et al 2006 and used the s wr and k s wr estimations in conjunction with the psd to calculate the van genuchten scale parameter αvg wr values see eq 22 in lassabatere et al 2006 3 4 water drop penetration time wdpt test the water drop penetration time wdpt test wessel 1988 was aimed at characterizing contrasting responses in terms of soil surface wettability between two contrasting situations i e below the tree canopies and in open spaces this method is one of the most widely applied for quantifying swr persistence doerr et al 2000 wdpt tests were conducted at the three selected trees with nine tests below tree canopies and other nine in open spaces for each sampling point the litter and leaf residues were gently removed from the soil surface and ten drops 0 05 ml of distilled water were placed using a pipette onto the soil surface at a small distance i e a few cm one to another and measuring the actual time until complete infiltration of each drop the recorded time was stopped after 3600 s although some drops did not infiltrate during this time interval in such cases a wdpt value of 3600 s was assigned buczko et al 2006 thus we measured the infiltration of 180 drops ninety below the tree canopies and other ninety in the open spaces for each situation a representative wdpt value was obtained by averaging the ninety wdpt measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 analytical validation for six synthetic soils when cumulative infiltration was calculated for all synthetic soils without water repellency table 2 using eqs 8 and 9 all curves exhibited a concave shape as a function of time typical for hydrophilic soils fig 1 red reference curves as the process approached steady state cumulative infiltration curves became approximately linear with time this behaviour is well known for hydrophilic soils and shows how the influence of capillarity decreases as the wetting front moves away from the source and the hydraulic gradient decreases xu et al 2012 when cumulative infiltration was calculated using eq 13 to include water repellency the curves exhibited a concave shape for higher αwr values and a convex shape for lower αwr values fig 1 the latter being typical of water repellent soils these shapes are in line with observed water infiltrations into water repellent soils convex shapes may be explained as follows when water infiltrates into these soils the advance of water during the early phase of wetting is impeded owing to hydrophobic surface films on soil particles resulting in a contact angle higher than 90 between soil and water jarvis et al 2008 in addition the hydrophobic material is often heterogeneously distributed leading to a fractional wettability of the bulk media and the concomitance of contrasting factors that simultaneously tends to increase and decrease infiltration rates beatty and smith 2013 as a consequence the final shape of the cumulative infiltration curve is the result of the relative importance during the infiltration process of water repellency which triggers an increase in the infiltration rate over time and the usual gravity and capillarity driven flow with decreasing infiltration rate over time until the attainment of steady state our model eq 13 reproduced these trends in addition we note that for the highest αwr values the curves generated using eq 13 are almost identical with the reference curves generated using the haverkamp eqs 8 and 9 this clearly points to the ability of eq 13 to accurately calculate cumulative infiltration also for the case of hydrophilic soils provided that values of α wr were chosen large enough the proposed model eq 13 is then consistent with the modelling of both hydrophilic soils no water repellency and water repellent soils for the treatment of the synthetic data with best wr we first determined the time to steady state t s with the condition e 2 this threshold split the synthetic data into two subsets a transient phase i e when e 2 and a steady state phase i e when e 2 we estimated from the steady state portion the value of the linear regression model slope i s exp and intercept b s exp mm note that flow impediment at the beginning of the infiltration experiment leads convex shaped curves and therefore to negative b s exp values table 2 thus negative values of this parameter can be considered indicative of the occurrence of water repellency phenomena although other factors could also play some role such as heterogeneous soil structure changes in soil structure during the infiltration run air entrapment heterogeneous profiles for initial soil moisture and temperature e g loizeau et al 2017 then eqs 7 and 4b were fitted to the transient portion of the curve using i s exp and optimizing α w r and s w r for eq 7 and s for eq 4b before deriving k s w r and k s with eq 4a the fitting of eq 7 to transient data was accurate with er fit wr values never exceeding 0 3 table 2 on the other hand less accurate fits were found for eq 4b with increasing er fit values for decreasing αwr more convex curves and values ranging from 0 3 to 12 8 more specifically 45 3 of er fit values were higher than 5 that is commonly considered the threshold for accurate fits regarding the quality of estimates relative error er s and er k s between estimated s w r and k s wr and reference s and k s values ranged from 22 1 to 11 1 circle symbols in fig 2 indicating that all s w r and k s w r values were accurate based on our stated criterion er 25 however the errors always increased for decreasing αwr values we therefore argue that the soil hydraulic properties may be misestimated in case of very low αwr values namely for extremely convex shaped curves in this case best wr is expected to overestimate s and consequently to underestimate k s regarding the αwr parameter er αwr ranged from 65 1 to 4 8 table 2 most of the estimations were below the selected threshold of 25 although for each synthetic soil the one or two highest αwr yielded er αwr values higher than 25 fig 3 however this parameter is expected to have a less relevant effect on the estimation of the soil parameters s and k s when it assumes very high values indeed the lowest errors for s and k s were found for high αwr values fig 2 in other words we gain in accuracy for s and k s for moderate or light water repellency and for αwr for strong water repellency in all cases the parameters easier to estimate are those that have a relevant impact on the cumulative infiltration for best eq 4b relative error between estimated s and k s and reference s and k s values ranged from 90 5 to 161 9 square symbols in fig 2 therefore best wr produced considerably lower relative error values in comparison to best revealing a substantially higher prediction ability of the proposed method more specifically for the case of concave shaped curves high αwr values both methods yielded low er s and er k s values these results suggest that eqs 7 and 4a provide similar results for hydrophilic soils and that the proposed method can also be applied to hydrophilic soils for the case of convex shaped curves low αwr values the discrepancy between the two methods become relevant and only best wr provided a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s in other words best wr applies to both water repellent and hydrophilic soils therefore we can conclude that theoretically the application of best wr to hydrophilic soils should not affect the quality of the estimates for sorptivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity and that the proposed model should apply to all cases 4 2 assessing soil water repellency in a mediterranean wooded grassland system both the αwr parameter and wdpt were non normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov test even if log transformed thus we used the non parametric kruskal wallis test to determine whether the medians of two groups open space and below tree canopy were different in the open spaces the wdpt values ranged between 1 and 259 s with a median value equal to 5 s below the tree canopies the median wdpt value was 1404 s with 19 out of 90 drops 21 that lasted 3600 s to infiltrate according to the kruskal wallis test the two medians were significantly different p 0 05 with higher wdpt values below the canopies as compared to the open spaces according to the classification proposed by dekker and ritsema 1994 the wdpt values were grouped in five classes from wettable wdpt 5 s to extremely water repellent wdpt 3600 s fig 4 wettable conditions were only found in the open spaces with 47 8 of the drops that infiltrated in 5 s here the 41 1 of the tests were classified as slightly water repellent and the 11 1 as strongly water repellent below the tree canopies prevailed water repellent conditions with the 21 1 of the drops that lasted 3600 s to infiltrate extremely water repellent 46 7 of the tests were classified severely water repellent 27 8 as strongly water repellent and 4 4 as slightly water repellent thus below the tree canopies and for initially dry conditions phenomena of flow impedance are expected to be stronger as compared to the open spaces however this type of test could be insufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic response of a water repellent soil indeed swr can promote preferential flow and by pass flow that cannot be detected by a drop scale measurement technique e g bachmann et al 2003 chen et al 2020 scott 2000 compared to wdpt αwr includes information on flow dynamics therefore it can be considered more physically linked to the hydrological processes affected by water repellency we then compared the values of αwr to the values of wdpts in the open spaces αwr values ranged between 1 4 and 1364 2 h 1 with a median value equal to 12 7 h 1 according to the kruskal wallis test the αwr values measured below the tree canopies were significantly lower table 4 fig 5 with values ranging from 0 5 to 320 5 h 1 and a median value equal to 6 6 h 1 low αwr values are associated with increased swr effect and initially attenuated infiltration rates which typically results in convex shaped cumulative infiltration curves abou najm et al 2021 thus both αwr and wdpt measurements revealed more noticeable soil water repellent phenomena below the canopies as compared to the open spaces this likely because the higher soil organic carbon content in the 0 40 cm soil layer below the trees seddaiu et al 2018 previous studies also reported soil hydrophobicity below the canopies of mediterranean oaks di prima et al 2017 lozano parra et al 2015 4 3 experimental assessment of best wr given that intermediate water repellency conditions were found in both locations i e below tree canopies and open spaces fig 4 we decided to group the infiltration measurements based on the shape of the cumulative infiltration curves which can reveal the occurrence of water repellent conditions angulo jaramillo et al 2019 three main types of shapes can be detected i regular shape with a concave part followed by a linear part decreasing infiltration rate which is associated with infiltration into hydrophilic mineral materials ii a typical convex hockey stick like relationship increasing infiltration rate which is associated with hydrophobic organic materials and iii a mixed shape concave then convex with a very small concave part followed by the hockey stick like shape decreasing before increasing infiltration rate this latter shape associated with weak water repellency phenomena due to fractional wettability angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the impact of hydrophobicity on the shape of the cumulative infiltration influences best treatment of the data leading to failed analysis due to a poor fit of the infiltration model and negative values for the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity di prima et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2019a specifically measurements were grouped into three subsets i those that have a convex hockey stick like shape 43 runs out 60 71 7 ii those that have a concave then convex shape 9 runs out 60 15 0 and iii those that have a concave shape 8 runs out 60 13 3 in the open spaces 17 runs out 30 56 7 exhibited convex shaped curves while 7 23 3 had a concave then convex shape and 6 20 0 were concave shaped below the tree canopies the number of convex shaped curves increased to 26 out 30 86 7 while only 4 13 3 had concave then convex shapes or were concave shaped two for each type this result confirms the observations done using wdpt data that water repellent conditions were found in both locations with more occurrences below the tree canopies fig 6 shows three examples one for each case the subpanel a illustrates the case of a convex shaped curve this experiment has infiltration rates that increased with time such that the cumulative infiltration curve exhibited a convex shape for this run the fitting of eq 7 produced a considerably lower relative error value in comparison to eq 4b i e er fit wr 0 6 against er fit 10 4 revealing a substantially higher fitting ability of the proposed model eq 7 adapted to convex shaped data the value of αwr was equal to 2 8 h 1 while the two values of soil sorptivity s wr and s estimated fitting respectively eqs 7 and 4b to the experimental data were equal to 75 0 and 22 8 mm h 0 5 differing by a factor of 3 3 for the cases of concave then convex shape fig 6 b and concave shaped fig 6 c curves we estimated higher αwr values because of the reduced effect of water repellency on the infiltration process the discrepancies between the two models in terms of relative error soil sorptivity and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity were less noticeable for the case of weak water repellency fig 6 b or even negligible when the experiment was not affected at all fig 6 c indeed for this latter case we estimated almost the same values of soil sorptivity with s wr and s equal respectively to 73 9 and 70 9 mm h 0 5 and low fitting relative error values in both cases these results suggest that eqs 7 and 4b provide the same result in case of hydrophilic soils however only the new proposed model eq 7 can provide a satisfactory fitting and a proper estimation of the soil hydraulic properties s and k s when water repellency occurs i e for the case of convex shaped curves in other words this result supports the same conclusions stated above for the analytical validation i e that best wr applies to both water repellent and hydrophilic soils these observations can be generalized to all the infiltration measurements fig 7 a illustrates the discrepancy between αwr values associated with different shapes of the cumulative infiltration curves and thus with the relevance of water repellency phenomena at the soil surface a similarity between sorptivity values were always found for weak or no repellency conditions fig 7 b s wr s close to unity otherwise the discrepancy between the two estimations become relevant for convex shaped curves a remarkable result is that eq 7 provided similar soil hydraulic properties s and k s for the three cases independently from the shape of the curves table 5 taken together these findings suggest that the correction factor can quantify the effect of water repellency at the soil surface without impacting the physical model used so that infiltration continues to be quantified using common soil hydraulic properties the results obtained here can be viewed as a confirmation of the conclusion by abou najm et al 2021 now there remains the question of the meaning of αwr does it correspond to an intrinsic parameter or otherwise a macroscopic parameter that depends at the same time on the soil features in terms of organic matter etc and on initial conditions water content and type of application of water 4 4 hydraulic characterization through best wr of the soils below the tree canopies and in the grassland best wr allowed to estimate the scale θs k s and αvg and shape n m and η parameters of the soil characteristics curves table 6 once s and k s were estimated with eq 7 the remaining parameters were estimated in the same way as for best slope lassabatere et al 2006 while the scale parameters were determined by modeling infiltration data through eq 7 the shape parameters were estimated from the psd analysis according to the procedure developed in lassabatere et al 2006 the hydraulic shape parameters for the two locations were similar due to their similar textures table 6 among the scale parameters only θs differed between the two locations because of the lower bulk density values measured below the tree canopies table 3 fig 8 shows for the two locations the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves predicted by best wr the water retention curves are presented with water content as a function of water pressure head with log scale fig 8 a the hydraulic conductivity was plotted with log scale as a function of water content fig 8 b the curves measured below the tree canopies are more positioned on the right namely the water content corresponding to a given pressure head is generally higher for these curves as compared to the open space indicating higher capillarity effects fig 8 a for this location the hydraulic conductivity functions are positioned below in the graph namely the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to a given water content is generally lower as compared to the open space indicating a lower capacity to conduct water under unsaturated conditions although under saturated condition the hydraulic conductivity is similar for the two locations table 6 a higher capacity to retain water by capillarity below the tree canopies can be viewed as a mechanism of soil moisture capture that increases the storage capacity of patchy areas within the wooded grassland system naveed et al 2019 in addition these patches are less susceptible to soil evaporation losses due to the shadow of the canopies and the presence of a surface water repellent layer robinson et al 2010 during the summer drought this may constitute a competitive advantage for the scattered trees with more water available for the trees as compared to the open grassland 5 summary and conclusions in this investigation we presented an adaptation of the best method named best wr for the hydraulic characterization of both hydrophilic and water repellent soils we validated the proposed method using both analytically generated data and infiltration experiments carried out in a mediterranean wooded grassland where the scattered evergreen oak trees induced soil water repellency under the canopies the analytical validation and the field measurements supported our hypothesis that the modified haverkamp model eq 7 included in best wr is suitable to predict s and k s under both hydrophilic and water repellent conditions eqs 7 and 4b provided similar results only for the case of hydrophilic soils concave shaped curves conversely when water repellency occurred only eq 7 provided satisfactory fittings and proper estimations of s and k s in addition eq 7 proved to quantify the effect of water repellency at the soil surface without impacting the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties the use of αwr as a new hydrological swr index allowed us to detect more noticeable soil water repellent phenomena below the canopies as compared to the open grassland these measurements were in line with those obtained using the wdpt test which is one of the most widely test applied for quantifying swr persistence at the same time best wr succeeded in determining the soil characteristics curves these curves evidenced a higher capacity to retain water by capillarity below the tree canopies and highlighted how scattered trees can strongly influence ecohydrological processes and water dynamics within wooded grassland systems supported by these examples we expect that the new method will allow researchers to better approach heterogeneous datasets including data collected on both hydrophilic and water repellent soils the versatility of the new method makes it a good candidate to successfully analyze infiltration databases as those developed by rahmati et al 2018 and di prima et al 2020 funding this work was supported through i the european regional development fund erdf and the italian ministry
