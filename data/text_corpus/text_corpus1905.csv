9525,alfalfa medicago sativa l a globally vital forage crop with abundant nutrition and high yield is commonly planted in arid and semi arid regions where water resources are scare such as china in order to adapt water limitation conditions farmland mulching fm is gradually being applied in alfalfa production however the effects of fm on alfalfa in different climatic conditions and management practices should be investigated before concluding that it is universally effective we performed a meta analysis and regression analysis of 94 yield comparisons and 74 water use efficiency wue comparisons from 19 peer reviewed studies and founded that fm significantly increased alfalfa yield and wue on average by 38 5 and 43 7 respectively compared to non mulching however the increase rate ir of yield and wue varied with mulching type region management and length of growth year for yield fm was more pronounced in gansu in regions with an average annual precipitation aap of 400 600 mm average annual temperature aat 0 c and altitude 2000 mm and with plastic film all of the soil surface mulching ridge furrow planting sowing rate sr 20 kg ha 1 and nitrogen application rate nar 100 kg ha 1 overall aap and altitude had significant positive effects on yield ir of mulching alfalfa while aat and sr had significant negative effects the effects of these factors on yield ir varied across different quantiles for wue fm was more beneficial in regions with aap of 200 400 mm and aat 6 c only sr had a significant negative effect on the wue ir of mulching alfalfa as a whole while the effects of aap aat and altitude were significant in some quantiles our findings confirm the benefits of fm to increase alfalfa yield and wue in china identify the conditions under which these results can be achieved and also suggest that the benefits are site specific keywords farmland mulching climatic condition management practice statistical analysis productivity alfalfa 1 introduction farmland mulching fm is a globally used agronomic practice especially in arid and semi arid regions since it can regulate the soil micro environment and improve agricultural productivity choudhury et al 2014 nawaz et al 2017 depending on the materials used fm can be classified into three main groups organic materials plant products and animal wastes mainly straw inorganic materials synthetic materials such as plastic film and special materials e g sand gravel and concrete kader et al 2017 li and chang 2021 in china and other countries fm has been used in a variety of staple akhtar et al 2018 yin et al 2019 and cash crops braunack et al 2015 laulina et al 2019 where agricultural production is severely limited by water shortages undoubtedly fm has played an important role in expanding crop planting improving farmland output and increasing farmers income the fm directly and indirectly exerts positive impacts on physical and chemical properties of soil and contributes to increased crop productivity plastic film mulching can effectively increase soil moisture and soil temperature accelerate the growth process optimize photosynthetic properties and thus greatly improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue abduwaiti et al 2021 farah et al 2021 straw mulching can obviously improve soil structure increase precipitation infiltration reduce losses of water and nutrients and its effect of inhibiting evaporation is enhanced with increasing amounts of mulched straw within a certain range genger et al 2018 ramadhan 2021 plastic film mulching combined with ridge furrow planting allows a better use of light rain 5 mm and improves the soil environment by increasing microbial numbers soil electrical conductivity enzymatic activities soil heat flux and daily integral net radiation fan et al 2019 yin et al 2018 however some negative effects of fm on soil environment and crop production have also been reported straw mulching can decrease soil temperature which retards seed germination and early crop growth thereby reducing crop yield especially in relatively cold climatic conditions chen et al 2007 wang et al 2009 film mulching over the entire crop growing season can accelerate plant senescence due to higher soil temperatures and poor soil permeability to air yin et al 2015 as well as trigger the rapid depletion of soil nutrients and carbon stocks steinmetz et al 2016 moreover large amounts of residual plastic film on farmland may harm soil structure water and nutrient transport and crop growth gao et al 2019 nawaz et al 2017 these highly variable and even contradictory results indicate that more information about crop production responses to fm is needed to evaluate the strategic feasibility alfalfa medicago sativa l enjoying the reputation of queen of forage is the most universally cultivated forage worldwide for its economic and environmental advantages berti et al 2021 osterholz et al 2019 alfalfa not only has high protein content strong stress resistance and promising economic benefits but can also improve soil fertility reduce soil erosion and optimize soil structure codling and jaja 2021 liu et al 2021 in the united states alfalfa is the fourth largest crop after corn soybeans and wheat accounting for 36 of the global total production areas of alfalfa djaman et al 2021 at present nearly a quarter of china s alfalfa demand still relies on imports despite the annual output and growing area increasing year by year wang 2022 influenced by the thinking of emphasizing agriculture and ignoring forage alfalfa in china is mostly planted in arid and semi arid regions and saline alkali lands where water resources are extremely scarce simultaneously alfalfa has higher water requirements due to its long growing season and developed root system therefore it is necessary to develop novel strategies for alfalfa to reduce the amount of water used while increasing yield and wue for this purpose fm has been gradually introduced into alfalfa production in recent years meta analysis is a promising statistical technique for evaluating the effects of treatments tested by individual field trials and other sources of variability hedges et al 1999 so far the effects of fm on production of maize yin et al 2017 wheat qi et al 2019 potato li and chang 2021 and cotton li et al 2017 have been reported using meta analysis these existing studies mainly focus on the effect of fm on growth of annual crops which can only be harvested once a year and the harvest target are reproductive organ e g fruit and seed and underground vegetative organ e g root and tuber however little attention has been given to the effect of fm on perennial crops such as alfalfa which can usually be harvested 2 4 times a year and the harvested target is the above ground vegetative organs regression analysis is a statistical method to determine the interdependent quantitative relationship between two or more variables it can be used to determine the main factors that affect a dependent variable and its influencing degree and direction here we conducted a meta analysis and regression analysis to systematically analyze available information on the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china specifically our objectives were to 1 quantify the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china 2 investigate how these effects varied with environmental conditions and management practices and 3 provide the direction for further improving the alfalfa production under fm conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we searched the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki http www cnki net and the web of science http apps webofknowledge com for peer reviewed papers reporting the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china with a cut off date of 31 may 2021 the search terms included mulch film straw rainwater harvesting and alfalfa and the search was limited to the titles abstracts and keywords of the papers non english language publications and conference proceedings were excluded a paper had to meet the following criteria to be included in the analysis 1 the experiment was conducted under field conditions in china including both fm and non mulching nm treatments 2 average yield or wue its standard deviation and sample sizes of fm and nm treatments were provided or could be calculated 3 key basic information was clear including the location experimental year average annual temperature aat average annual precipitation aap altitude mulching scope planting pattern mulching material growth year sowing rate sr and nitrogen application rate nar and 4 if the same experimental data were published in different journals then the paper with the most information was selected relevant data were derived from the texts tables and figures using the getdata graph digitizer using these criteria we collected 19 publications 15 in chinese and 4 in english from four provinces totaling 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons see the supplementary material 2 2 data classification to better explain the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue the selected indicators were grouped according to their own types or on the basis of considering the number and distribution of the samples 1 experimental region gansu qinghai shaanxi and hebei provinces 2 experimental year the year in which the

quantile regression were conducted using the base and quantreg packages in r respectively the figures were produced in originpro 9 0 a statistical significance level of p 0 05 was used 3 results 3 1 overview of alfalfa yield and wue our dataset contained 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons from 19 studies conducted in four provinces in china fig 1 both yields and wues were approximately normally distributed for fm alfalfa yield and wue had ranges of 0 5 31 0 t ha 1 mean 7 2 t ha 1 and 0 3 6 4 kg m 3 mean 2 5 kg m 3 respectively for nm alfalfa yield and wue ranges were 0 2 21 0 t ha 1 mean 5 4 t ha 1 and 0 1 3 6 kg m 3 mean 1 7 kg m 3 respectively alfalfa yield and wue varied greatly both among regions and years and fm had much higher yield and wue than nm fig 2 for regions median yield ranged from 5 3 in gansu to 6 8 t ha 1 in hebei under fm and from 3 9 in gansu to 6 1 t ha 1 in shaanxi under nm median wue ranged from 13 9 in shaanxi to 26 0 kg m 3 in hebei under fm and from 13 5 in shaanxi to 17 4 kg m 3 in gansu under nm fig 2a and c for years both yield and wue showed an increasing trend over time median yield range for fm and nm was 4 6 9 7 and 3 0 5 3 t ha 1 respectively and correspondingly median wue range was 11 6 32 7 and 7 8 25 3 kg m 3 fig 2b and d 3 2 effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue using meta analysis 3 2 1 overall effects heterogeneity analyses of both alfalfa yield and wue with fm reached very significant levels p 0 01 consequently random effect models were chosen table 1 overall the alfalfa yield and wue significantly increased with fm compared with nm resulting in a mean increase rate ir of 38 5 95 ci 30 8 46 7 and 43 7 95 ci 34 1 54 0 respectively there was no publication bias p 0 05 for both alfalfa yield and wue table 1 conformably for both alfalfa yield fig 3a and wue fig 3b the sample data points were uniformly distributed on both sides of the funnel indicating that there was no publication bias 3 2 2 time factors positive effects in alfalfa yield and wue using fm varied in different experimental years with both showing a trend of initially decreasing then increasing and then decreasing fig 4 the highest improvement for alfalfa yield mean 53 8 95 ci 34 7 72 8 and wue mean 54 9 95 ci 34 9 74 9 were before 2005 and the corresponding lowest improvements were mean 10 8 95 ci 1 6 19 9 and mean 15 7 95 ci 4 9 26 5 during 2006 2010 3 2 3 region factors alfalfa yield fig 5a and wue fig 6a in response to fm varied among regions for yield gansu and qinghai had a higher positive effect than shaanxi and hebei and shaanxi had the lowest effect the yield effect of fm increased with increasing aap an initial decrease and then a steady trend with increasing aat and an initial increase and then a steady trend with increased altitude regions with aap 400 600 mm aat 0 c and altitude 2000 2500 mm had the highest ir values with means of 47 8 98 0 and 61 0 respectively for wue the improvement using fm was significantly higher in gansu and hebei than in shaanxi but was not significant in hebei differing from yield the wue of alfalfa with fm showed a decreasing trend with increasing aap an increasing trend with increasing aat and initial increase and then a stable trend with increasing altitude regions with aap 200 400 mm aat 6 c and altitude 2000 2500 mm had the highest ir values with mean of 49 6 45 2 and 74 3 respectively 3 2 4 mulching factors the response of alfalfa yield fig 5b and wue fig 6b following fm was affected by mulching material mulching scope and planting pattern mulching with plastic film produced the highest alfalfa yield mean 50 0 and wue mean 59 7 followed by degradable film straw and gravel among these the irs for yield and wue mulched with gravel were not significant the extent of increase in alfalfa yield and wue were not significant between mulching all and mulching part of the soil surface ridge furrow planting had a higher mulching effect on alfalfa yield and wue than traditional flat planting with the difference not significant for yield but significant for wue 3 2 5 management factors the responses of alfalfa yield fig 5c and wue fig 6c to fm varied with management factors such as growth year sr and nar in the case of yield although the highest effect of fm was for alfalfa with growth duration of 1 year no significant differences were found among the categories tested with the increase of sr the yield ir of fm showed a decreasing trend peaking for sr 20 kg ha 1 mean 64 3 with the increase of nar the yield ir of fm showed a downward trend when the nar was 100 100 200 and 200 kg ha 1 the corresponding increases in alfalfa yield were 59 4 35 0 and 25 5 in the case of wue the ir of fm showed a trend of initial increasing and then decreasing with alfalfa growth year the greatest increase mean 68 5 was for growth duration of 3 years there was no significant difference in the wue ir under different sr which was mean 41 0 at sr 20 kg ha 1 and mean 37 3 at sr 20 kg ha 1 the nar 100 kg ha 1 had the highest positive effect on wue mean 69 9 and significantly higher than that for nar of 100 200 and 200 kg ha 1 3 3 effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue using regression analysis regression analyses including multiple linear and quantile regressions were used to shed light on potential nonlinear effects of the numerical variables and better explain the heterogeneity of fm on ir of alfalfa yield and wue 3 3 1 multiple linear regression the aap aat altitude and sr had significant effects p 0 01 on ir of alfalfa yield with positive effects for aap and altitude and negative effects for aat and sr differing from yield only sr had a significant negative effect p 0 01 on ir of alfalfa wue table 2 3 3 2 quantile regression tables 3 and 4 presented quantile regression parameter coefficients on ir of alfalfa yield and wue under fm for the 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th quantiles respectively for yield alfalfa growth year and nar had no significant effect at all quantiles the aap had a significant positive impact only at the 10th quantile both aat and sr had a significant negative impact at the 10th and 25th quantiles and the absolute value of the coefficients of sr were greater than aat with regard to altitude the coefficient was significantly positive p 0 05 in all quantiles and tended to increase with increasing of quantile for wue sr and nar had no significant effect at all quantiles alfalfa growth year had a significant positive impact only at the 90th quantile the aap was significantly negative and altitude was significantly positive in all quantiles except the 10th however aat had a significant negative impact at all quantiles and the absolute value of the coefficients tended to increase with increasing of the quantile 4 discussion our study provided a systematic and quantitative analysis on the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china based on experimental studies published in peer reviewed journals results indicated that fm could be considered a promising practice to increase alfalfa yield and wue with mean improvement of 38 5 and 43 7 respectively however the efficiencies of fm greatly depended on experimental year region mulching and management factors 4 1 effects of experimental year on alfalfa yield and wue alfalfa cultivation in china has a long history but it starts late as an industry xie et al 2021 with the implementations of environment governance and western development alfalfa planting expanded at a rate of 100 000 hm2 per year at the beginning of 21st century by 2005 as china cancelled the subsidies for returning farmland to forest and agricultural taxes farmers gradually re chose to farmland the melamine incident in 2008 brought renewed attention to the importance of alfalfa in animal husbandry especially the implementation of alfalfa development action to revitalize dairy industry in 2012 alfalfa planting has significantly increased tao et al 2019 however due to the low proportion of high quality forage the economic benefits of alfalfa were not optimistic affected by the trade war between china and usa and the covid 19 epidemic in recent years both the price and planting of domestic alfalfa have increased rapidly wang 2022 the distribution of samples in different experimental years in our study also reflected the development of china s alfalfa industry in the past 20 years fig 4 this trend was also consistent with the increase effect of fm on alfalfa yield and wue with experimental years this may be due to the fact that when the output is considerable farmers tend to cultivate intensively such as ridge furrow planting and reasonable sowing to give full play to the advantages of fm and obtain higher economic benefits in alfalfa production 4 2 effects of regional factors on alfalfa yield and wue regional variations in alfalfa yield and wue in response to fm were mainly related to environmental conditions such as precipitation air temperature and altitude qi et al 2019 due to strong drought resistance and environmental adaptability alfalfa is commonly sown in arid and semi arid areas of north china where aap is usually 600 mm and many areas are 400 mm however alfalfa is a deep rooted and water consuming crop with an annual water requirement of 500 900 mm kuslu et al 2010 water scarcity is the most limiting factor in alfalfa production liu et al 2021 and fm can significantly reduce soil evaporation and increase precipitation utilization especially for light precipitation our results showed that fm produced significantly greater increases for alfalfa yield and wue in gansu than in shaanxi figs 5a and 6a gansu is the main production area of high quality alfalfa reaching 0 9 million hectares in 2019 and a key area of grain to forage in china ge et al 2020 ma et al 2021 at present the proportion of first class alfalfa in the hexi oasis irrigation district of gansu is more than 60 enjoying the reputation of china s grass industry sees gansu gansu s grass industry sees hexi wu et al 2021 however gansu is one of the provinces with severe water shortage in china and fm is widely used in agricultural production in order to make full use of precipitation and obtain higher crop yield and water productivity with less irrigation water the increases in alfalfa yield and wue under fm in qinghai and hebei were of large range and non significantly different to those of gansu this may be caused by the followings first qinghai and gansu have similar climatic conditions such as high altitude low aat and low aap and second there were insufficient numbers of samples in qinghai and hebei which may have obscured the true effects similarly investigations on the effects of temperature and altitude revealed that the fm was more effective for alfalfa yield in regions with a lower aat 3 c fig 5a and higher altitude 2000 m fig 5a for wue the improvement of fm increased with increases in aat fig 6a and initially increased and then was stable with increasing altitude fig 6a these findings were consistent with those of li and chang 2021 for potato and yin et al 2017 for maize in contrast qi et al 2019 indicated that compared with no crop residue returning the practice of crop residue returning was more beneficial to winter wheat yield in regions with aat 11 c there are two possible reasons for the different results on the one hand winter wheat is generally sown in late september to middle october and harvested in late may to middle june therefore winter wheat is exposed to lower air temperatures during its growth period especially in the early growing season conversely alfalfa maize and potato are generally growth in late march to early october on the other hand crop residue returning may decrease soil temperature especially when the air temperature is high moreover a large amount of crop residues used as mulch may lead to a great reduction in soil temperature ramadhan 2021 for precipitation fm showed a significantly higher yield ir in regions with aap 200 400 mm and 400 600 mm than for aap 200 mm fig 5a however the ir of wue had the opposite trend with the increase in aap fig 6a to a certain extent this shows that the increase in alfalfa yield was lower than the increase in its water consumption consistent with the meta analysis results multiple linear regression showed that aap aat and altitude significantly affected the yield increasing effect of fm in which aat had a negative effect while aap and altitude had a positive effect table 2 however quantile regression further revealed that aap and aat significantly affected the yield ir of fm only at the 10th and 25th quantiles respectively table 3 this indicates that increasing aap or lowering aat significantly increased the yield ir of mulching alfalfa only when yield ir was at a low level however altitude always significantly affected the yield ir of mulching alfalfa and the higher the yield ir the stronger was the promoting effect differing from yield multiple linear regression showed that no regional factors significantly influenced the wue ir of mulching alfalfa table 2 however quantile regression showed that regional factors significantly affected the wue ir in almost all quantiles table 4 this was mainly related to the overall distribution and local distribution characteristics of alfalfa yield ir and wue ir under each regional factor these results further suggest that multiple methods should be used to assess the effects of a measure on agricultural production from different perspectives 4 3 effects of mulching factors on alfalfa yield and wue mulching material mulching scope and planting pattern are important factors influencing the fm effect in our study there were four kinds of mulching materials including plastic film degradable film straw and gravel plastic film has been widely used in agricultural production and has many advantages such as conserving soil moisture modifying soil temperature and inhibiting weeds thus greatly increasing farmland productivity and wue gu et al 2018 degradable film is basically composed of polysaccharides with low permeabilities and harmless decomposition products and is considered a promising alternative to plastic film braunack et al 2015 yin et al 2019 crop residues containing abundant organic carbon and mineral nutrients can be returned to optimize soil properties and reduce soil evaporation choudhury et al 2014 yin et al 2018 thus crop residue returning is recognized as an important component of sustainable agriculture in regions where crop residues are locally available qi et al 2019 gravel mulching a traditional technique is mainly used in the loess plateau in north china where gravel is plentiful wang et al 2020 in this practice the gravel has to be removed when annual crops are planted regularly our meta analysis showed that the sample numbers of the four kinds of mulching material was plastic film degradable film straw gravel consistent with the order of their mean yield ir and wue ir figs 5b and 6b this agrees with observations of zhang et al 2017b for rice but contradictory to those of yin et al 2019 for maize compared with plastic film degradable film can degrade rapidly during the growth period of crops and its effect of increasing soil temperature and preserving soil moisture lasts for a short time differing from maize alfalfa is a perennial forage and is harvested many times a year so the mulching effect of degradable film is lower than plastic film ridge furrow planting has many advantages such as increasing the surface area for solar radiation and enhancing the temperature difference between day and night li and chang 2021 furthermore ridge furrow planting combined with film mulching contributes to collecting rainwater and conserving soil moisture wang et al 2015 based on a meta analysis li and chang 2021 reported that the yield ir of potato with plastic film mulching was significantly greater under ridge furrow planting mean 37 2 than with traditional flat planting mean 26 0 in the weibei highlands of china li et al 2013 demonstrated that ridge mulching greatly improved the soil moisture and temperature and increased maize yield and wue by 1 6 15 0 and 1 8 15 7 respectively similar results were obtained for alfalfa in our study it is worth noting that the mean yield ir of mulching alfalfa with ridge furrow planting was nearly twice that of traditional flat planting fig 5b while the mean wue ir of mulching alfalfa with ridge furrow planting was nearly 15 times that of traditional flat planting fig 6b this further verifies the importance of ridge furrow planting combined with fm in collecting and storing rainwater to reduce ineffective moisture loss interestingly zhang et al 2017a in research on potato and liu et al 2013 on cotton found no significant difference in crop yield between traditional flat and ridge furrow planting this may be related to the amount and distribution of precipitation during the crop growth period for example in years with heavy and evenly distributed precipitation ridge furrow planting may not have better rainwater collection effects than traditional flat planting it is possible that there are other more important factors that differ between these studies in addition to planting pattern 4 4 effects of management factors on alfalfa yield and wue alfalfa is a perennial forage grass with a growth life of 7 10 years the nodules of alfalfa can fix atmospheric n2 under the action of rhizobia and the litter of its branches and leaves can be decomposed by microorganisms to increase soil organic carbon content symanowicz et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in terms of the production and ecological functions of alfalfa however longer growth periods are not necessarily better alfalfa is a tap rooted forage with a well developed root system luo et al 2015 growing alfalfa for multiple years can cause excessive consumption of deep water resulting in a severe soil dryness thus degrading soil quality and alfalfa productivity ge et al 2020 it is difficult to restore soil water in dry soil layers since the infiltration depth of natural precipitation is generally 1 3 m while the depth of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration can reach 8 10 m wang et al 2002 in the semi arid loess hilly area of china dried soil appeared in the soil layer of 2 and 15 5 m in the third and seventh year of alfalfa growth respectively fan et al 2014 in a semi humid tableland and gully region on the loess plateau china alfalfa yield reached its maximum 3 4 years after planting cui et al 2018 however our study found no significant differences in yield ir for mulching alfalfa among 1 2 3 and 4 years of growth duration at a regional scale fig 5c the wue ir for mulching alfalfa initially increased and then decreased with increasing growth duration and reached a maximum for growth duration of 3 years fig 6c this may be related to the limited alfalfa growth years involved in the samples of our study planting alfalfa consecutively for several years and then inter conversion with other crops has been proven an important sustainable technology which is conducive to restore soil moisture and maintain farmland productivity ge et al 2020 luo et al 2015 the sr is a vital index to regulate the density of alfalfa communities appropriate sr helps to coordinate the contradiction between individuals and groups and make full use of light heat space water and fertilizer resources which is an important measure to improve alfalfa productivity ahmad et al 2020 the sr affects alfalfa yield by adjusting the number of clumps per unit area the number of branches per clump and the weight of branches in henan province wang et al 2017 found that when the number of clumps increased from 11 to 17 plants m 2 the yield per unit area increased but the number of branches and the weight of individual branches tended to decrease in shaanxi province yu et al 2007 showed that when sr was 10 35 kg ha 1 alfalfa yield increased with the increasing sr but no longer increased for sr 35 kg ha 1 in the hilly area of southern china miao et al 2009 indicated that the suitable sr of alfalfa was 15 0 22 5 kg ha 1 which was beneficial to improve the fresh dry ratio stem leaf ratio yield and wue similarly our meta analysis concluded that the yield ir of mulching alfalfa with sr 20 kg ha 1 was much higher than that with a sr of 20 25 and 25 kg ha 1 fig 5c however there was no significant difference in the wue ir of mulching alfalfa between sr of 20 and 20 kg ha 1 fig 6c to a certain extent this shows that too many individuals will not improve the competitiveness of individuals but will reduce the utilization of soil water by the group nitrogen is a major nutritional element required in substantial amounts for plant growth since it has a dominant role in regulating carbon assimilation elgharably and benes 2021 it is generally considered that legume crops such as alfalfa have a strong biological nitrogen fixation capacity and do not require additional nitrogen supplementation during their growth in fact according to estimates the amount of nitrogen fixed by rhizobia is 148 177 kg ha 1 annually accounting for 43 62 of the total nitrogen requirement of alfalfa luo et al 2015 moreover during the seedling stage or after cutting the nitrogen fixing effect of alfalfa is weak and with the increase of growth year the nitrogen fixation capacity of alfalfa declines gradually zhang et al 2016 therefore additional application of nitrogen fertilizer is an indispensable measure to improve alfalfa productivity our meta analysis indicated that when nar 100 kg ha 1 both the yield ir and wue ir of mulching alfalfa were much higher than for other nars figs 5c and 6c this indicated that alfalfa yield and wue can be greatly improved by an appropriate amount of additional nitrogen fertilizer and thus greatly increase the return rate of nitrogen fertilizers however the appropriate nar for alfalfa is affected by various factors such as alfalfa species soil fertility and field management in the hexi corridor area of gansu feng et al 2016 reported that root biomass above ground biomass and wue of alfalfa reached maxima for nar of 80 kg ha 1 in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china zhang et al 2015 showed the highest yield and best quality for alfalfa when nar was 180 kg ha 1 in addition the amount of nitrogen applied also affects the nitrogen fixation effect of alfalfa when the soil nitrogen content is too low nitrogen starvation will occur resulting in a decrease in nitrogen fixation which is not conducive to alfalfa growth when the soil nitrogen content is too high nitrogen repression will arise making the number of root nodules and biological nitrogen fixation decrease which limits the full development of alfalfa s nitrogen fixation potential fan et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 moreover excessive nitrogen application can hinder alfalfa growth and result in environmental pollution though runoff into surface waters and leaching into groundwater xie et al 2015 consequently the chinese ministry of agriculture announced the zero increase action plan in 2015 to control the use of chemical fertilizer in agricultural production 5 conclusions we conducted a meta analysis and regression analysis to evaluate the effect of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china using 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons from 19 studies in four provinces the median alfalfa yield had a range of 0 5 31 0 t ha 1 and the median alfalfa wue range was 0 3 6 4 kg m 3 under fm meta analysis showed that fm significantly increased alfalfa yield by 38 5 and wue by 43 7 compared to nm respectively for yield fm performed better in gansu in regions with aap 400 600 mm aat 0 c and altitude 2000 mm and with plastic film all of the soil surface mulching ridge furrow planting sr 20 kg ha 1 and nar 100 kg ha 1 discordantly for wue fm performed better in regions with aap 200 400 mm and aat 6 c regression analysis showed that aap and altitude had significant positive effects while aat and sr had significant negative effects on the yield ir of mulching alfalfa the effects of these factors on yield ir varied across quantiles only sr had a significant negative effect on the wue ir of mulching alfalfa while effects of aap aat and altitude on wue ir were significant in some quantiles our results demonstrated that fm especially plastic film is a promising practice to improve alfalfa yield and wue considering the negative impacts of residual film on the environment the development of a degradable film with comparable mulching effects to plastic film is urgently needed to develop sustainable alfalfa production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9525,alfalfa medicago sativa l a globally vital forage crop with abundant nutrition and high yield is commonly planted in arid and semi arid regions where water resources are scare such as china in order to adapt water limitation conditions farmland mulching fm is gradually being applied in alfalfa production however the effects of fm on alfalfa in different climatic conditions and management practices should be investigated before concluding that it is universally effective we performed a meta analysis and regression analysis of 94 yield comparisons and 74 water use efficiency wue comparisons from 19 peer reviewed studies and founded that fm significantly increased alfalfa yield and wue on average by 38 5 and 43 7 respectively compared to non mulching however the increase rate ir of yield and wue varied with mulching type region management and length of growth year for yield fm was more pronounced in gansu in regions with an average annual precipitation aap of 400 600 mm average annual temperature aat 0 c and altitude 2000 mm and with plastic film all of the soil surface mulching ridge furrow planting sowing rate sr 20 kg ha 1 and nitrogen application rate nar 100 kg ha 1 overall aap and altitude had significant positive effects on yield ir of mulching alfalfa while aat and sr had significant negative effects the effects of these factors on yield ir varied across different quantiles for wue fm was more beneficial in regions with aap of 200 400 mm and aat 6 c only sr had a significant negative effect on the wue ir of mulching alfalfa as a whole while the effects of aap aat and altitude were significant in some quantiles our findings confirm the benefits of fm to increase alfalfa yield and wue in china identify the conditions under which these results can be achieved and also suggest that the benefits are site specific keywords farmland mulching climatic condition management practice statistical analysis productivity alfalfa 1 introduction farmland mulching fm is a globally used agronomic practice especially in arid and semi arid regions since it can regulate the soil micro environment and improve agricultural productivity choudhury et al 2014 nawaz et al 2017 depending on the materials used fm can be classified into three main groups organic materials plant products and animal wastes mainly straw inorganic materials synthetic materials such as plastic film and special materials e g sand gravel and concrete kader et al 2017 li and chang 2021 in china and other countries fm has been used in a variety of staple akhtar et al 2018 yin et al 2019 and cash crops braunack et al 2015 laulina et al 2019 where agricultural production is severely limited by water shortages undoubtedly fm has played an important role in expanding crop planting improving farmland output and increasing farmers income the fm directly and indirectly exerts positive impacts on physical and chemical properties of soil and contributes to increased crop productivity plastic film mulching can effectively increase soil moisture and soil temperature accelerate the growth process optimize photosynthetic properties and thus greatly improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue abduwaiti et al 2021 farah et al 2021 straw mulching can obviously improve soil structure increase precipitation infiltration reduce losses of water and nutrients and its effect of inhibiting evaporation is enhanced with increasing amounts of mulched straw within a certain range genger et al 2018 ramadhan 2021 plastic film mulching combined with ridge furrow planting allows a better use of light rain 5 mm and improves the soil environment by increasing microbial numbers soil electrical conductivity enzymatic activities soil heat flux and daily integral net radiation fan et al 2019 yin et al 2018 however some negative effects of fm on soil environment and crop production have also been reported straw mulching can decrease soil temperature which retards seed germination and early crop growth thereby reducing crop yield especially in relatively cold climatic conditions chen et al 2007 wang et al 2009 film mulching over the entire crop growing season can accelerate plant senescence due to higher soil temperatures and poor soil permeability to air yin et al 2015 as well as trigger the rapid depletion of soil nutrients and carbon stocks steinmetz et al 2016 moreover large amounts of residual plastic film on farmland may harm soil structure water and nutrient transport and crop growth gao et al 2019 nawaz et al 2017 these highly variable and even contradictory results indicate that more information about crop production responses to fm is needed to evaluate the strategic feasibility alfalfa medicago sativa l enjoying the reputation of queen of forage is the most universally cultivated forage worldwide for its economic and environmental advantages berti et al 2021 osterholz et al 2019 alfalfa not only has high protein content strong stress resistance and promising economic benefits but can also improve soil fertility reduce soil erosion and optimize soil structure codling and jaja 2021 liu et al 2021 in the united states alfalfa is the fourth largest crop after corn soybeans and wheat accounting for 36 of the global total production areas of alfalfa djaman et al 2021 at present nearly a quarter of china s alfalfa demand still relies on imports despite the annual output and growing area increasing year by year wang 2022 influenced by the thinking of emphasizing agriculture and ignoring forage alfalfa in china is mostly planted in arid and semi arid regions and saline alkali lands where water resources are extremely scarce simultaneously alfalfa has higher water requirements due to its long growing season and developed root system therefore it is necessary to develop novel strategies for alfalfa to reduce the amount of water used while increasing yield and wue for this purpose fm has been gradually introduced into alfalfa production in recent years meta analysis is a promising statistical technique for evaluating the effects of treatments tested by individual field trials and other sources of variability hedges et al 1999 so far the effects of fm on production of maize yin et al 2017 wheat qi et al 2019 potato li and chang 2021 and cotton li et al 2017 have been reported using meta analysis these existing studies mainly focus on the effect of fm on growth of annual crops which can only be harvested once a year and the harvest target are reproductive organ e g fruit and seed and underground vegetative organ e g root and tuber however little attention has been given to the effect of fm on perennial crops such as alfalfa which can usually be harvested 2 4 times a year and the harvested target is the above ground vegetative organs regression analysis is a statistical method to determine the interdependent quantitative relationship between two or more variables it can be used to determine the main factors that affect a dependent variable and its influencing degree and direction here we conducted a meta analysis and regression analysis to systematically analyze available information on the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china specifically our objectives were to 1 quantify the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china 2 investigate how these effects varied with environmental conditions and management practices and 3 provide the direction for further improving the alfalfa production under fm conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we searched the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki http www cnki net and the web of science http apps webofknowledge com for peer reviewed papers reporting the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china with a cut off date of 31 may 2021 the search terms included mulch film straw rainwater harvesting and alfalfa and the search was limited to the titles abstracts and keywords of the papers non english language publications and conference proceedings were excluded a paper had to meet the following criteria to be included in the analysis 1 the experiment was conducted under field conditions in china including both fm and non mulching nm treatments 2 average yield or wue its standard deviation and sample sizes of fm and nm treatments were provided or could be calculated 3 key basic information was clear including the location experimental year average annual temperature aat average annual precipitation aap altitude mulching scope planting pattern mulching material growth year sowing rate sr and nitrogen application rate nar and 4 if the same experimental data were published in different journals then the paper with the most information was selected relevant data were derived from the texts tables and figures using the getdata graph digitizer using these criteria we collected 19 publications 15 in chinese and 4 in english from four provinces totaling 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons see the supplementary material 2 2 data classification to better explain the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue the selected indicators were grouped according to their own types or on the basis of considering the number and distribution of the samples 1 experimental region gansu qinghai shaanxi and hebei provinces 2 experimental year the year in which the

quantile regression were conducted using the base and quantreg packages in r respectively the figures were produced in originpro 9 0 a statistical significance level of p 0 05 was used 3 results 3 1 overview of alfalfa yield and wue our dataset contained 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons from 19 studies conducted in four provinces in china fig 1 both yields and wues were approximately normally distributed for fm alfalfa yield and wue had ranges of 0 5 31 0 t ha 1 mean 7 2 t ha 1 and 0 3 6 4 kg m 3 mean 2 5 kg m 3 respectively for nm alfalfa yield and wue ranges were 0 2 21 0 t ha 1 mean 5 4 t ha 1 and 0 1 3 6 kg m 3 mean 1 7 kg m 3 respectively alfalfa yield and wue varied greatly both among regions and years and fm had much higher yield and wue than nm fig 2 for regions median yield ranged from 5 3 in gansu to 6 8 t ha 1 in hebei under fm and from 3 9 in gansu to 6 1 t ha 1 in shaanxi under nm median wue ranged from 13 9 in shaanxi to 26 0 kg m 3 in hebei under fm and from 13 5 in shaanxi to 17 4 kg m 3 in gansu under nm fig 2a and c for years both yield and wue showed an increasing trend over time median yield range for fm and nm was 4 6 9 7 and 3 0 5 3 t ha 1 respectively and correspondingly median wue range was 11 6 32 7 and 7 8 25 3 kg m 3 fig 2b and d 3 2 effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue using meta analysis 3 2 1 overall effects heterogeneity analyses of both alfalfa yield and wue with fm reached very significant levels p 0 01 consequently random effect models were chosen table 1 overall the alfalfa yield and wue significantly increased with fm compared with nm resulting in a mean increase rate ir of 38 5 95 ci 30 8 46 7 and 43 7 95 ci 34 1 54 0 respectively there was no publication bias p 0 05 for both alfalfa yield and wue table 1 conformably for both alfalfa yield fig 3a and wue fig 3b the sample data points were uniformly distributed on both sides of the funnel indicating that there was no publication bias 3 2 2 time factors positive effects in alfalfa yield and wue using fm varied in different experimental years with both showing a trend of initially decreasing then increasing and then decreasing fig 4 the highest improvement for alfalfa yield mean 53 8 95 ci 34 7 72 8 and wue mean 54 9 95 ci 34 9 74 9 were before 2005 and the corresponding lowest improvements were mean 10 8 95 ci 1 6 19 9 and mean 15 7 95 ci 4 9 26 5 during 2006 2010 3 2 3 region factors alfalfa yield fig 5a and wue fig 6a in response to fm varied among regions for yield gansu and qinghai had a higher positive effect than shaanxi and hebei and shaanxi had the lowest effect the yield effect of fm increased with increasing aap an initial decrease and then a steady trend with increasing aat and an initial increase and then a steady trend with increased altitude regions with aap 400 600 mm aat 0 c and altitude 2000 2500 mm had the highest ir values with means of 47 8 98 0 and 61 0 respectively for wue the improvement using fm was significantly higher in gansu and hebei than in shaanxi but was not significant in hebei differing from yield the wue of alfalfa with fm showed a decreasing trend with increasing aap an increasing trend with increasing aat and initial increase and then a stable trend with increasing altitude regions with aap 200 400 mm aat 6 c and altitude 2000 2500 mm had the highest ir values with mean of 49 6 45 2 and 74 3 respectively 3 2 4 mulching factors the response of alfalfa yield fig 5b and wue fig 6b following fm was affected by mulching material mulching scope and planting pattern mulching with plastic film produced the highest alfalfa yield mean 50 0 and wue mean 59 7 followed by degradable film straw and gravel among these the irs for yield and wue mulched with gravel were not significant the extent of increase in alfalfa yield and wue were not significant between mulching all and mulching part of the soil surface ridge furrow planting had a higher mulching effect on alfalfa yield and wue than traditional flat planting with the difference not significant for yield but significant for wue 3 2 5 management factors the responses of alfalfa yield fig 5c and wue fig 6c to fm varied with management factors such as growth year sr and nar in the case of yield although the highest effect of fm was for alfalfa with growth duration of 1 year no significant differences were found among the categories tested with the increase of sr the yield ir of fm showed a decreasing trend peaking for sr 20 kg ha 1 mean 64 3 with the increase of nar the yield ir of fm showed a downward trend when the nar was 100 100 200 and 200 kg ha 1 the corresponding increases in alfalfa yield were 59 4 35 0 and 25 5 in the case of wue the ir of fm showed a trend of initial increasing and then decreasing with alfalfa growth year the greatest increase mean 68 5 was for growth duration of 3 years there was no significant difference in the wue ir under different sr which was mean 41 0 at sr 20 kg ha 1 and mean 37 3 at sr 20 kg ha 1 the nar 100 kg ha 1 had the highest positive effect on wue mean 69 9 and significantly higher than that for nar of 100 200 and 200 kg ha 1 3 3 effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue using regression analysis regression analyses including multiple linear and quantile regressions were used to shed light on potential nonlinear effects of the numerical variables and better explain the heterogeneity of fm on ir of alfalfa yield and wue 3 3 1 multiple linear regression the aap aat altitude and sr had significant effects p 0 01 on ir of alfalfa yield with positive effects for aap and altitude and negative effects for aat and sr differing from yield only sr had a significant negative effect p 0 01 on ir of alfalfa wue table 2 3 3 2 quantile regression tables 3 and 4 presented quantile regression parameter coefficients on ir of alfalfa yield and wue under fm for the 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th quantiles respectively for yield alfalfa growth year and nar had no significant effect at all quantiles the aap had a significant positive impact only at the 10th quantile both aat and sr had a significant negative impact at the 10th and 25th quantiles and the absolute value of the coefficients of sr were greater than aat with regard to altitude the coefficient was significantly positive p 0 05 in all quantiles and tended to increase with increasing of quantile for wue sr and nar had no significant effect at all quantiles alfalfa growth year had a significant positive impact only at the 90th quantile the aap was significantly negative and altitude was significantly positive in all quantiles except the 10th however aat had a significant negative impact at all quantiles and the absolute value of the coefficients tended to increase with increasing of the quantile 4 discussion our study provided a systematic and quantitative analysis on the effects of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china based on experimental studies published in peer reviewed journals results indicated that fm could be considered a promising practice to increase alfalfa yield and wue with mean improvement of 38 5 and 43 7 respectively however the efficiencies of fm greatly depended on experimental year region mulching and management factors 4 1 effects of experimental year on alfalfa yield and wue alfalfa cultivation in china has a long history but it starts late as an industry xie et al 2021 with the implementations of environment governance and western development alfalfa planting expanded at a rate of 100 000 hm2 per year at the beginning of 21st century by 2005 as china cancelled the subsidies for returning farmland to forest and agricultural taxes farmers gradually re chose to farmland the melamine incident in 2008 brought renewed attention to the importance of alfalfa in animal husbandry especially the implementation of alfalfa development action to revitalize dairy industry in 2012 alfalfa planting has significantly increased tao et al 2019 however due to the low proportion of high quality forage the economic benefits of alfalfa were not optimistic affected by the trade war between china and usa and the covid 19 epidemic in recent years both the price and planting of domestic alfalfa have increased rapidly wang 2022 the distribution of samples in different experimental years in our study also reflected the development of china s alfalfa industry in the past 20 years fig 4 this trend was also consistent with the increase effect of fm on alfalfa yield and wue with experimental years this may be due to the fact that when the output is considerable farmers tend to cultivate intensively such as ridge furrow planting and reasonable sowing to give full play to the advantages of fm and obtain higher economic benefits in alfalfa production 4 2 effects of regional factors on alfalfa yield and wue regional variations in alfalfa yield and wue in response to fm were mainly related to environmental conditions such as precipitation air temperature and altitude qi et al 2019 due to strong drought resistance and environmental adaptability alfalfa is commonly sown in arid and semi arid areas of north china where aap is usually 600 mm and many areas are 400 mm however alfalfa is a deep rooted and water consuming crop with an annual water requirement of 500 900 mm kuslu et al 2010 water scarcity is the most limiting factor in alfalfa production liu et al 2021 and fm can significantly reduce soil evaporation and increase precipitation utilization especially for light precipitation our results showed that fm produced significantly greater increases for alfalfa yield and wue in gansu than in shaanxi figs 5a and 6a gansu is the main production area of high quality alfalfa reaching 0 9 million hectares in 2019 and a key area of grain to forage in china ge et al 2020 ma et al 2021 at present the proportion of first class alfalfa in the hexi oasis irrigation district of gansu is more than 60 enjoying the reputation of china s grass industry sees gansu gansu s grass industry sees hexi wu et al 2021 however gansu is one of the provinces with severe water shortage in china and fm is widely used in agricultural production in order to make full use of precipitation and obtain higher crop yield and water productivity with less irrigation water the increases in alfalfa yield and wue under fm in qinghai and hebei were of large range and non significantly different to those of gansu this may be caused by the followings first qinghai and gansu have similar climatic conditions such as high altitude low aat and low aap and second there were insufficient numbers of samples in qinghai and hebei which may have obscured the true effects similarly investigations on the effects of temperature and altitude revealed that the fm was more effective for alfalfa yield in regions with a lower aat 3 c fig 5a and higher altitude 2000 m fig 5a for wue the improvement of fm increased with increases in aat fig 6a and initially increased and then was stable with increasing altitude fig 6a these findings were consistent with those of li and chang 2021 for potato and yin et al 2017 for maize in contrast qi et al 2019 indicated that compared with no crop residue returning the practice of crop residue returning was more beneficial to winter wheat yield in regions with aat 11 c there are two possible reasons for the different results on the one hand winter wheat is generally sown in late september to middle october and harvested in late may to middle june therefore winter wheat is exposed to lower air temperatures during its growth period especially in the early growing season conversely alfalfa maize and potato are generally growth in late march to early october on the other hand crop residue returning may decrease soil temperature especially when the air temperature is high moreover a large amount of crop residues used as mulch may lead to a great reduction in soil temperature ramadhan 2021 for precipitation fm showed a significantly higher yield ir in regions with aap 200 400 mm and 400 600 mm than for aap 200 mm fig 5a however the ir of wue had the opposite trend with the increase in aap fig 6a to a certain extent this shows that the increase in alfalfa yield was lower than the increase in its water consumption consistent with the meta analysis results multiple linear regression showed that aap aat and altitude significantly affected the yield increasing effect of fm in which aat had a negative effect while aap and altitude had a positive effect table 2 however quantile regression further revealed that aap and aat significantly affected the yield ir of fm only at the 10th and 25th quantiles respectively table 3 this indicates that increasing aap or lowering aat significantly increased the yield ir of mulching alfalfa only when yield ir was at a low level however altitude always significantly affected the yield ir of mulching alfalfa and the higher the yield ir the stronger was the promoting effect differing from yield multiple linear regression showed that no regional factors significantly influenced the wue ir of mulching alfalfa table 2 however quantile regression showed that regional factors significantly affected the wue ir in almost all quantiles table 4 this was mainly related to the overall distribution and local distribution characteristics of alfalfa yield ir and wue ir under each regional factor these results further suggest that multiple methods should be used to assess the effects of a measure on agricultural production from different perspectives 4 3 effects of mulching factors on alfalfa yield and wue mulching material mulching scope and planting pattern are important factors influencing the fm effect in our study there were four kinds of mulching materials including plastic film degradable film straw and gravel plastic film has been widely used in agricultural production and has many advantages such as conserving soil moisture modifying soil temperature and inhibiting weeds thus greatly increasing farmland productivity and wue gu et al 2018 degradable film is basically composed of polysaccharides with low permeabilities and harmless decomposition products and is considered a promising alternative to plastic film braunack et al 2015 yin et al 2019 crop residues containing abundant organic carbon and mineral nutrients can be returned to optimize soil properties and reduce soil evaporation choudhury et al 2014 yin et al 2018 thus crop residue returning is recognized as an important component of sustainable agriculture in regions where crop residues are locally available qi et al 2019 gravel mulching a traditional technique is mainly used in the loess plateau in north china where gravel is plentiful wang et al 2020 in this practice the gravel has to be removed when annual crops are planted regularly our meta analysis showed that the sample numbers of the four kinds of mulching material was plastic film degradable film straw gravel consistent with the order of their mean yield ir and wue ir figs 5b and 6b this agrees with observations of zhang et al 2017b for rice but contradictory to those of yin et al 2019 for maize compared with plastic film degradable film can degrade rapidly during the growth period of crops and its effect of increasing soil temperature and preserving soil moisture lasts for a short time differing from maize alfalfa is a perennial forage and is harvested many times a year so the mulching effect of degradable film is lower than plastic film ridge furrow planting has many advantages such as increasing the surface area for solar radiation and enhancing the temperature difference between day and night li and chang 2021 furthermore ridge furrow planting combined with film mulching contributes to collecting rainwater and conserving soil moisture wang et al 2015 based on a meta analysis li and chang 2021 reported that the yield ir of potato with plastic film mulching was significantly greater under ridge furrow planting mean 37 2 than with traditional flat planting mean 26 0 in the weibei highlands of china li et al 2013 demonstrated that ridge mulching greatly improved the soil moisture and temperature and increased maize yield and wue by 1 6 15 0 and 1 8 15 7 respectively similar results were obtained for alfalfa in our study it is worth noting that the mean yield ir of mulching alfalfa with ridge furrow planting was nearly twice that of traditional flat planting fig 5b while the mean wue ir of mulching alfalfa with ridge furrow planting was nearly 15 times that of traditional flat planting fig 6b this further verifies the importance of ridge furrow planting combined with fm in collecting and storing rainwater to reduce ineffective moisture loss interestingly zhang et al 2017a in research on potato and liu et al 2013 on cotton found no significant difference in crop yield between traditional flat and ridge furrow planting this may be related to the amount and distribution of precipitation during the crop growth period for example in years with heavy and evenly distributed precipitation ridge furrow planting may not have better rainwater collection effects than traditional flat planting it is possible that there are other more important factors that differ between these studies in addition to planting pattern 4 4 effects of management factors on alfalfa yield and wue alfalfa is a perennial forage grass with a growth life of 7 10 years the nodules of alfalfa can fix atmospheric n2 under the action of rhizobia and the litter of its branches and leaves can be decomposed by microorganisms to increase soil organic carbon content symanowicz et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in terms of the production and ecological functions of alfalfa however longer growth periods are not necessarily better alfalfa is a tap rooted forage with a well developed root system luo et al 2015 growing alfalfa for multiple years can cause excessive consumption of deep water resulting in a severe soil dryness thus degrading soil quality and alfalfa productivity ge et al 2020 it is difficult to restore soil water in dry soil layers since the infiltration depth of natural precipitation is generally 1 3 m while the depth of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration can reach 8 10 m wang et al 2002 in the semi arid loess hilly area of china dried soil appeared in the soil layer of 2 and 15 5 m in the third and seventh year of alfalfa growth respectively fan et al 2014 in a semi humid tableland and gully region on the loess plateau china alfalfa yield reached its maximum 3 4 years after planting cui et al 2018 however our study found no significant differences in yield ir for mulching alfalfa among 1 2 3 and 4 years of growth duration at a regional scale fig 5c the wue ir for mulching alfalfa initially increased and then decreased with increasing growth duration and reached a maximum for growth duration of 3 years fig 6c this may be related to the limited alfalfa growth years involved in the samples of our study planting alfalfa consecutively for several years and then inter conversion with other crops has been proven an important sustainable technology which is conducive to restore soil moisture and maintain farmland productivity ge et al 2020 luo et al 2015 the sr is a vital index to regulate the density of alfalfa communities appropriate sr helps to coordinate the contradiction between individuals and groups and make full use of light heat space water and fertilizer resources which is an important measure to improve alfalfa productivity ahmad et al 2020 the sr affects alfalfa yield by adjusting the number of clumps per unit area the number of branches per clump and the weight of branches in henan province wang et al 2017 found that when the number of clumps increased from 11 to 17 plants m 2 the yield per unit area increased but the number of branches and the weight of individual branches tended to decrease in shaanxi province yu et al 2007 showed that when sr was 10 35 kg ha 1 alfalfa yield increased with the increasing sr but no longer increased for sr 35 kg ha 1 in the hilly area of southern china miao et al 2009 indicated that the suitable sr of alfalfa was 15 0 22 5 kg ha 1 which was beneficial to improve the fresh dry ratio stem leaf ratio yield and wue similarly our meta analysis concluded that the yield ir of mulching alfalfa with sr 20 kg ha 1 was much higher than that with a sr of 20 25 and 25 kg ha 1 fig 5c however there was no significant difference in the wue ir of mulching alfalfa between sr of 20 and 20 kg ha 1 fig 6c to a certain extent this shows that too many individuals will not improve the competitiveness of individuals but will reduce the utilization of soil water by the group nitrogen is a major nutritional element required in substantial amounts for plant growth since it has a dominant role in regulating carbon assimilation elgharably and benes 2021 it is generally considered that legume crops such as alfalfa have a strong biological nitrogen fixation capacity and do not require additional nitrogen supplementation during their growth in fact according to estimates the amount of nitrogen fixed by rhizobia is 148 177 kg ha 1 annually accounting for 43 62 of the total nitrogen requirement of alfalfa luo et al 2015 moreover during the seedling stage or after cutting the nitrogen fixing effect of alfalfa is weak and with the increase of growth year the nitrogen fixation capacity of alfalfa declines gradually zhang et al 2016 therefore additional application of nitrogen fertilizer is an indispensable measure to improve alfalfa productivity our meta analysis indicated that when nar 100 kg ha 1 both the yield ir and wue ir of mulching alfalfa were much higher than for other nars figs 5c and 6c this indicated that alfalfa yield and wue can be greatly improved by an appropriate amount of additional nitrogen fertilizer and thus greatly increase the return rate of nitrogen fertilizers however the appropriate nar for alfalfa is affected by various factors such as alfalfa species soil fertility and field management in the hexi corridor area of gansu feng et al 2016 reported that root biomass above ground biomass and wue of alfalfa reached maxima for nar of 80 kg ha 1 in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china zhang et al 2015 showed the highest yield and best quality for alfalfa when nar was 180 kg ha 1 in addition the amount of nitrogen applied also affects the nitrogen fixation effect of alfalfa when the soil nitrogen content is too low nitrogen starvation will occur resulting in a decrease in nitrogen fixation which is not conducive to alfalfa growth when the soil nitrogen content is too high nitrogen repression will arise making the number of root nodules and biological nitrogen fixation decrease which limits the full development of alfalfa s nitrogen fixation potential fan et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 moreover excessive nitrogen application can hinder alfalfa growth and result in environmental pollution though runoff into surface waters and leaching into groundwater xie et al 2015 consequently the chinese ministry of agriculture announced the zero increase action plan in 2015 to control the use of chemical fertilizer in agricultural production 5 conclusions we conducted a meta analysis and regression analysis to evaluate the effect of fm on alfalfa yield and wue in china using 94 yield comparisons and 74 wue comparisons from 19 studies in four provinces the median alfalfa yield had a range of 0 5 31 0 t ha 1 and the median alfalfa wue range was 0 3 6 4 kg m 3 under fm meta analysis showed that fm significantly increased alfalfa yield by 38 5 and wue by 43 7 compared to nm respectively for yield fm performed better in gansu in regions with aap 400 600 mm aat 0 c and altitude 2000 mm and with plastic film all of the soil surface mulching ridge furrow planting sr 20 kg ha 1 and nar 100 kg ha 1 discordantly for wue fm performed better in regions with aap 200 400 mm and aat 6 c regression analysis showed that aap and altitude had significant positive effects while aat and sr had significant negative effects on the yield ir of mulching alfalfa the effects of these factors on yield ir varied across quantiles only sr had a significant negative effect on the wue ir of mulching alfalfa while effects of aap aat and altitude on wue ir were significant in some quantiles our results demonstrated that fm especially plastic film is a promising practice to improve alfalfa yield and wue considering the negative impacts of residual film on the environment the development of a degradable film with comparable mulching effects to plastic film is urgently needed to develop sustainable alfalfa production declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9526,water shortage and poor soil fertility are the main factors restricting the sustainable development of peanut production in semi arid areas of northeast china it is thus essential to have a deep understanding of the soil water nitrogen dynamics and crop water nitrogen use for developing water and nutrient strategies three levels of irrigation treatment w65 65 of field capacity w55 55 of field capacity w45 45 of field capacity and a rain fed treatment ck were implemented in field experiments conducted for peanut during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 in liaoning northeast china the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model was calibrated and validated and then applied to assess peanut yield water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue for the present situation and future irrigation scenarios the results indicated that the ahc model was capable of simulating soil water and nitrogen status and peanut growth simulations of soil water nitrogen contents and crop growth indicators leaf area index aboveground biomass plant height and yield fitted well with field observations simulated dynamics showed that 9 21 of the total water input and 14 27 of the total n input were leached out the root zone 0 60 cm rainfall was the main cause of water percolation and nitrogen leaching the highest average yield 5701 kg ha 1 and nue 26 77 kg kg 1 were obtained in the w55 treatment the wp was not obviously decreased under the w55 treatment and was only 4 1 lower than that of the ck treatment in which the wp was highest based on scenario analysis with the consideration of crop yield wp and nue the optimal irrigation amount of 80 97 mm is recommended for peanut cultivation in this region we demonstrated that the ahc model could be used to develop water management strategies for peanuts in northeast china to conserve water while sustaining agriculture keywords agro hydrological model irrigation crop growth water nitrogen use 1 introduction irrigation is critical for crop growth and yield xu et al 2020 china is a leading agricultural country with agricultural water consumption accounting for more than 60 of its total water use of which approximately 90 is used for agricultural irrigation fan et al 2014 hu et al 2016 chang et al 2016 with the increase in irrigation areas and crops water shortages have become a major constraint on agricultural production in china tang et al 2021 meanwhile the ratio of irrigation water available to crops in the field to the total water diversion is only 0 55 in china li et al 2020a 2020b indicating that a large amount of irrigation water is lost due to inappropriate management wang et al 2019 soil moisture is the most critical for crop growth as irrigation water must be converted into soil water before being absorbed by crops therefore in depth studies of the dynamics of soil water movement and the implementation of water saving irrigation methods are of great importance for alleviating water shortages and ensuring sustainable agricultural development in china in addition to irrigation fertilization is another vital factor for maintaining crop growth and guaranteeing grain yield wang et al 2017 taking nitrogen n fertilizer as an example the annual n fertilizer application for agriculture in china reached 20 million tons in recent years accounting for approximately 1 4 of the world s total n fertilizer applications however the ratio of nitrogen uptake by crops to nitrogen application for agricultural production is still very low with an average value of 25 in china zhang et al 2015 the loss of n fertilizer results in serious environmental degradation such as air pollution and groundwater contamination guo et al 2020 yao et al 2019 rekha et al 2011 thus grasping the law of soil n migration and implementing effective n fertilizer management could not only promote crop production but also reduce the environmental risk liu et al 2018 peanut arachis hypogaea l is one of the main cash crops in liaoning province of northeast china pan et al 2013 the northwest liaoning is a competitive producing area for peanut and the primary export base of high quality peanut in semi arid areas of northeast china wang et al 2021 however the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall in this area is extremely uneven due to the unique monsoon climate and topographical characteristics typically the water supply is not sufficient for peanuts during the critical growth period in which plants are sensitive to water deficits xia et al 2021 at the same time groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this area with the decreasing availability of groundwater irrigation water scarcity would be more severe huang et al 2020 in addition the dominant soil texture in this area is sandy loam with a relatively low supply capacity of n which is insufficient for peanut growth as a result most local farmers often apply excessive amounts of n fertilizers for achieving more production so as to obtain great economic benefits therefore it is essential to develop reasonable irrigation and fertilization plans that can mitigate both water use conflicts and environmental pollution in semi arid areas of northeast china in general the optimal water and n management can be identified by field experiments yan et al 2019 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 however it is difficult to quantitatively study the cycle and utilization of water and n in the field due to the time consuming and high cost of field experiments hao et al 2014 moreover some water and n balance observations are difficult to measure directly noory et al 2011 therefore simulation models are important alternatives for evaluating long term water and n dynamics in the field rath et al 2021 the newly developed ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model is a systematic tool to numerically simulate agro ecosystem processes e g soil water flow heat and solute transport n transformation crop growth the ahc model has been validated for the simulation of the relevant agroecosystem processes in maize and wheat fields liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 but has not yet used in peanut fields therefore based on two year field experiment data the ahc model was used to assess the agroecosystem processes in peanut fields the objectives of this study were 1 to simulate soil water and n dynamics and crop growth in peanut fields using the ahc model 2 to assess water and nitrogen use under present and future irrigation scenarios and 3 to identify a suitable irrigation amount for peanut cultivation in the study area 1 1 materials and methods 1 1 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted at the taoli experimental station latitude 42 08 n longitude 121 44 e altitude 213 m fig 1 in liaoning province of northeast china during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons may to september the study area belongs to the north temperate zone with a semi arid continental monsoon climate the average annual air temperature is 7 2 with a cumulative temperature above 10 of approximately 3000 the average annual precipitation is 493 1 mm and pan evaporation 20 cm pan is 1846 mm the frost free period is about 150 days the total rainfall was 399 mm and 335 mm during the peanut growth seasons in 2016 and 2017 respectively the soil texture is sandy loam and the detailed physical properties of the soil in the study site are presented in table 1 the groundwater depth is 8 13 m below the ground surface 1 1 2 experimental design and measurements the test peanut was the cultivar baisha 1016 which was widely planted in the study area three irrigation levels were implemented in field experiment the upper limit of the soil water content was 90 of the field capacity fc while the lower limits were 45 w45 55 w55 and 65 w65 of the fc in addition a rain fed treatment was conducted as the control ck the detailed irrigation schedules for each treatment are shown in table 2 peanut was planted in double rows and the width of the ridge was 0 5 m the planting density was 2 25 105 plants ha 1 plot sizes were 3 5 m2 and an 80 cm depth polyvinyl chloride barrier was inserted into the soil between plots to prevent horizontal movement of nutrients the irrigation method was drip irrigation under film mulching groundwater was used as the irrigation water drip irrigation tubes were installed in each row and a water meter was used to measure the volume of irrigation the emitter spacing was 0 35 m and the discharge of each emitter was 4 l h 1 nitrogen urea 60 kg ha 1 phosphorus 105 kg ha 1 and potassium 120 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied for all treatments as basal fertilizers the peanut was sowed on may 14th and harvested on september 17th in 2016 and sowed on may 25th and harvested on september 25th in 2017 the other field management measures use of insecticide and weeding etc were according to the local farmers soil was sampled at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 60 cm using a ring knife 100 cm3 to determine the basic soil physical properties table 1 the 0 60 cm at 10 cm intervals soil water content was measured every seven days via a diviner 2000 sentek corporation australia during all growth stages soil samples of 0 60 cm at 10 cm intervals were collected and the soil nitrate concentrations were determined using the continuous flow analytical system auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany three peanut plants were selected in each plot to measure the leaf area index lai using the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa and plant height was measured with a straight meter ruler every 7 14 days three plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then were dried to a constant weight at 75 c to measure the accumulated aboveground biomass at harvest seeds were air dried outdoors for 10 13 days and peanut yields were calculated based on 14 moisture content meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and rainfall were obtained from an automatic weather station watch dog m2900et weather station usa the detailed data on the main weather variables are presented in fig 2 1 2 overview of ahc and its components the ahc model is a physically based numerical model developed to simulate the agroecosystem processes including soil water evaporation and transpiration solute salt n heat and plant growth it is composed of three main parts i e the agroecosystem simulation aesim process the global sensitivity analysis gsa process and the global parameter estimation gpe process the aesim process calculation part is inherited and modified based on the previous agro hydrological model swap epic xu et al 2013a 2013b the 1 d richards equation convection dispersion equation and heat conduction equation pachepskya et al 2003 van dam et al 2008 boesten and van der linden 1991 de vries 1975 were used to describe the soil water flow solute transport and heat transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum system respectively the finite difference solution scheme was applied for each process while the fully implicit difference scheme was used temporally and the unit centre method was used spatially the model also considers soil hysteresis spatial heterogeneity and expansion and contraction in the solution process the simulation of the n migration and transformation process referred to the daisy model abrahamsen and hansen 2000 the crop growth module in the ahc is mainly based on the concept of the environment policy integrated climate epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 the gsa process and gpe process were used in conjunction to determine the parameters for model calibration the gsa process is based on the latin hypercube one factor at a time method lh oat morris 1991 mckay et al 1979 to perform parameter sensitivity analysis the gpe process uses the modified micro genetic algorithm modified mga ines and droogers 2002 to perform global optimization on sensitive parameters and to finally determine reasonable parameter values the ahc model has also developed a graphical user interface with complete functions based on the vb net language this model can be applied to the simulation and analysis of farmland hydrological processes under different conditions and has been well tested and applied in northern china xu et al 2013a 2013b jiang et al 2015 a detailed description of the model components and mechanisms is shown in the work of xu et al 2018 1 3 model setup calibration and validation the simulation period was from may to september in both 2016 and 2017 covering the whole growing season of peanut the w65 treatment of 2016 was used to calibrate the ahc model all other treatments in 2016 and 2017 were used to validate the model the depth of the soil profile was set to 0 150 cm with four horizontal layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 150 cm the column was discretized into 150 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 0 cm the depth of the peanut root zone was set at 0 60 cm because the root system of peanuts is mainly concentrated in this range ding et al 2015 for soil water flow the upper boundary condition of the model was determined by the irrigation and rainfall fluxes and the actual evaporation and transpiration meanwhile the influence of film mulching was considered with the mulching coefficient of 0 6 since the depth of groundwater in the study area was greater than 8 m the lower boundary was set as a free drainage boundary for nitrogen transport the third type boundary condition was used for the upper and lower boundary conditions the initial conditions of the soil water content and soil nitrogen concentration were set based on the field measurements the initial values of soil hydraulic parameters were predicted by the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 based on the measured soil particle composition and soil bulk density the initial values related to carbon turnover of the nitrogen module referred to the recommended values of the daisy model and were set in conjunction with previous research results liang et al 2014 hansen et al 1991 mueller et al 1998 the initial values of crop growth and the root water uptake parameters table 4 referred to the recommended values of the epic model and former study williams et al 1989 ren et al 2016 2017 three indicators were used to evaluate the model performance including the root mean square error rmse the determination coefficient r 2 and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse ren et al 2016 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg 2 i 1 n p i p avg 2 where p i and o i are the simulated and observed values at time i p avg and o avg are the mean simulated and observed values respectively and n is the number of observations rmse values close to 0 and r 2 values close to 1 indicate good model performance the nse values range from to 1 with nse 1 0 representing high efficiency and with nse 0 indicating that the mean observed value is a good predictor compared to the model leghari et al 2019 1 4 simulation scenarios of different irrigation amounts after proper calibration and validation the ahc model was applied to determine the optimal irrigation amount in 2016 normal year and 2017 dry year a total of eight irrigation scenarios 60 130 were set with an interval of 10 of the present irrigation amount of the w55 treatment during the growth period in 2016 and 2017 the total irrigation amount of the eight scenarios ranged from 53 to 116 mm in 2016 and from 69 to 151 mm in 2017 then the relative yield ry relative wp rwp relative nue rnue nitrate leaching and evapotranspiration under different irrigation levels were calculated to determine the optimal irrigation amounts in the test year the ry rwp and rnue were normalized results and defined as the actual values divided by the respective maximum hence the values vary between 0 and 1 these scenarios were conducted by only varying the irrigation amounts of w55 treatment while other field management practices were maintained the same as the w55 treatment in 2016 and 2017 2 results and discussion 2 1 model calibration and validation the measured and simulated soil water contents soil nitrate concentrations leaf area index crop heights aboveground biomass and yields of all treatments during the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 3 the statistical indicators rmse nse and r 2 for both calibration and validation are presented in table 3 for soil water content the ahc model can reflect the trend of soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths fig s1 soil water content increased rapidly with irrigation or rainfall and then gradually decreased because of root water uptake and redistribution until the next irrigation or rainfall event occurred the variations of soil water content in the upper soil layers 0 30 cm were significantly wider and more frequent than those in the deeper soil layers 30 60 cm as rainfall irrigation and root water uptake had greater impacts on the upper soil layers similar results were also reported by wang et al 2014 and ren et al 2018 the rmse nse and r 2 values for soil water content ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 from 0 63 to 0 81 and from 0 79 to 0 87 respectively during the calibration and validation periods the goodness of fit indicators were within the range of values reported in previous research for soil water simulation liu and shao 2015 jiang et al 2011 ramos et al 2017 for soil nitrate concentration the no3 n concentrations in the near surface layers 0 20 cm gradually increased and then reached a peak approximately ten days after sowing due to urea hydrolysis and nitrification later the no3 n concentrations slowly decreased due to the influence of crop n uptake and n leaching fig s2 the rmse nse and r 2 values for soil nitrate simulation ranged from 2 92 to 5 01 mg kg 1 from 0 33 to 0 55 and from 0 31 to 0 76 respectively table 3 considering the complexity of soil nitrogen transformation and comparing to other research results wang et al 2011 xu et al 2018 liang et al 2020 the simulation accuracy for soil nitrate simulation is within an acceptable range moreover the simulated crop growth index matched well with the observed ones as shown in fig 3c f and table 3 the nse and r 2 values for lai plant height and aboveground biomass were higher than 0 8 however the plant height and lai were systematically slightly higher than the observed values in the late growth periods of both calibration and validation this may because the peanut growth was stressed by frequent heavy rainfalls in the late growth periods which was not considered by the ahc model additionally rmse between the simulated and measured peanut yields were 38 504 kg ha 1 in summary the above results indicated that the ahc model can be used as a reliable tool for simulating soil water and nitrogen dynamics as well as crop growth in the study area the calibrated parameters related to soil hydraulic and crop growth are shown in table 1 and table 4 respectively 2 2 transpiration and evaporation the simulated crop evapotranspiration et a transpiration t a and soil evaporation e a in each treatment are presented in table 5 results showed that the et a rates of different treatments were 308 387 mm and 290 388 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively the t a values ranged from 264 to 343 mm and from 255 to 354 mm accounting for 86 89 and 88 91 respectively of the et a the e a values were 42 44 mm and 34 35 mm for the two years accounting for 11 14 and 9 12 respectively of the et a studies on evapotranspiration partitioning reported that e a mainly accounts for 20 40 of et a on average for a range of different crops kool et al 2014 the lower e a in this study should be explained by the higher ground cover plastic film mulching and deeper water table moreover previous research showed that the e a et a ratio under film should be less than 20 rosa et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 which also confirmed that the ahc model could be a reliable tool for et simulation under the film mulching condition the trends of the daily t a and e a rates of different treatments in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 e a was significantly higher than t a in the seedling stage e a then decreased while t a increased with the expansion of the canopy during the late stage the t a rate gradually weakened due to the influential factors such as plant senescence and leaf area decline e a still remained at a low rate which may be due to the lower soil water contents caused by the small amount and frequency of rainfall that occurred during this period the average daily et a rates of different treatments during the whole growth period were 2 96 mm d 1 and 3 17 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 2 3 bottom flux of soil water and nitrogen the soil water and n fluxes at the 60 cm soil depth in each treatment in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 5 the directions of the water and n fluxes of each treatment were downward in the two years water percolation and nitrate leaching occurred simultaneously fig 5 during the simulation period of 2016 the water percolation and nitrate leaching amounts in each treatment were 84 92 mm and 39 41 kg n ha 1 respectively water percolation and nitrate leaching were mainly concentrated during the three heavy rainfall events from july 21 to july 29 fig 5a the rainfall amounts 200 mm in this period accounted for half of the total amounts 399 mm during the whole growth periods the water percolation and nitrate leaching of each treatment were 68 3 71 8 mm and 32 7 34 7 kg n ha 1 which accounted for 73 9 78 0 and 79 7 84 7 of the total amount of water percolation and nitrate leaching respectively wang et al 2014 also reported that nitrate leaching most likely occurred following a heavy precipitation event the leakage of water and nitrate during the last two heavy rainfall events were significantly greater than those of the first rainfall being likely because the soil was relatively dry before the first heavy rainfall event and the rainfall mainly supplemented the soil moisture as the soil was nearly saturated large amounts of water percolation and nitrate leaching occurred during the following two rainfall events liang et al 2011 the water and nitrate leaching amounts in 2017 32 55 mm and 21 26 kg n ha 1 respectively were lower than those in 2016 the reason may be that the rainfall distribution was relatively uniform during the simulation period in 2017 water percolation and nitrate leaching were mainly concentrated on august 3 and continuous rainfall periods occurred from august 14 to august 19 fig 5b the rainfall amount of 65 5 mm on august 3 resulted in 4 8 5 6 mm of water percolation and 4 8 5 5 kg n ha 1 of nitrate leaching accounting for 8 8 17 3 and 18 6 26 2 of the total amount of water percolation and nitrate leaching there were 7 9 27 3 mm of water percolation and 4 3 9 7 kg n ha 1 of nitrate leaching occurred during the continuous rainfall periods the cumulative rainfall was 66 4 mm from august 14 to august 19 accounting for 22 0 50 4 of the total water percolation and 20 4 37 3 of the total nitrate leaching respectively 2 4 water and nitrogen balance 2 4 1 water balance and wp the soil water balance components for the 0 60 cm soil profile i e the root zone and wp of each treatment during the simulation period in 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 6 the soil water storage change is defined as the sum of water input components rainfall irrigation and capillary rise minus the water output components percolation and evapotranspiration rainfall was the main water input component which accounted for 78 97 and 72 99 of the total water input in 2016 and 2017 respectively evapotranspiration was the main pathway of water consumption accounting for approximately 75 87 of the total water input the bottom flux was composed of capillary rise and water percolation it was found that a low amount of water moved upward into the root zone through capillary rise with cumulated values of 2 11 mm as the groundwater depth in the study area is deep 8 m this was different from the results of studies in shallow groundwater areas ren et al 2017 reported that there was about 300 mm net groundwater supplement into the root zone of cropland in hetao irrigation district the water percolation accounted for 17 21 and 9 12 of the total water input in 2016 and 2017 respectively due to the influence of heavy rainfall events during the growth seasons of 2016 and 2017 the percolated water amount in each treatment was much higher than the capillary rise the values of soil water balance in both years were positive ranging from 17 to 34 mm in 2016 and from 15 to 26 mm in 2017 thereby indicating that the soil water storage could meet the peanut growth requirement as shown in table 6 the measured peanut yield ranged from 4783 to 5679 kg ha 1 in 2016 and from 4896 to 5724 kg ha 1 in 2017 in both years the highest yield was obtained in the w55 treatment while the lowest was obtained in the ck treatment the wp of each treatment ranged from 1 45 to 1 58 kg m 3 in 2016 and from 1 44 to 1 63 kg m 3 in 2017 table 6 the ck treatment had the highest wp in both years compared with ck the wp of the w65 w55 and w45 treatments decreased by 8 4 2 1 and 7 1 in 2016 and by 11 4 6 1 and 10 1 in 2017 2 4 2 nitrogen balance and nue the n balance components for the 0 60 cm soil profile i e the root zone and nue of each treatment during the simulation period of 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 7 the n storage change is defined as the n input components n fertilization n in rainfall and irrigation water soil net n mineralization and n capillary rise flux at the bottom minus the output components nitrate leaching ammonia volatilization crop n uptake and denitrification nitrate leaching was one of the main ways of n loss accounting for 24 26 and 14 16 of the total n inputs in 2016 and 2017 respectively there was a small difference in nitrate leaching among irrigation treatments which was mainly because the n fertilization amount of each treatment was 60 kg ha 1 and no additional fertilizer was applied shi et al 2020 also reported that the n leaching for maize was relative stable when the fertilizer amount was within a certain range due to rainfall conditions the interannual difference in nitrate leaching was significant ammonia volatilization was the main pathway of gaseous n loss which accounted for approximately 21 and 23 of the total n source in 2016 and 2017 respectively the n lost through denitrification was negligible at 5 of the total n input which was agreed with the results that reported by hu et al 2010 and edis 2004 crop n uptake constituted the largest part of n outputs which accounted for 74 82 and 95 97 of the total n source of each treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of soil n balance ranged from 50 to 37 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and from 61 to 53 kg n ha 1 in 2017 respectively the negative values of n balance revealed the net consumption of soil mineral n the nue of each treatment ranged from 24 43 to 27 30 kg kg 1 in 2016 and from 24 19 to 26 23 kg kg 1 in 2017 table 7 the highest nue was observed in the w55 treatment in both years 2 5 optimization of irrigation amounts in test years the verified ahc model was used to predict the relative yield ry relative wp rwp relative nue rnue evapotranspiration and n leaching under different irrigation scenarios to determine the optimal irrigation amount as shown in fig 6 ry increased as the irrigation amount increased through a quadratic function however when the total irrigation amount increased to approximately 100 mm the rate of increase in ry gradually decreased which indicated that the relationship between peanut yield and irrigation amount was not linear previous studies indicated that excessive irrigation could lead to low production sun et al 2006 therefore irrigation amount must be controlled within a certain range to achieve the goals of saving water and maintaining production sezen et al 2019 rwp decreased and rnue increased with increasing irrigation fig 6 the reason for the decline in rwp was that the rate of increase in yield was smaller than that of evapotranspiration the reason for the increase in rnue was that the yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount but the n output components under different irrigation scenarios had little difference as shown in fig 7a the evapotranspiration under different irrigation scenarios ranged from 310 to 420 mm and increased with increasing irrigation amount the evapotranspiration under the optimal irrigation amount was 365 mm in 2016 and 367 mm in 2017 the relationship between nitrate leaching and irrigation amount is shown in fig 7b the nitrate leaching amounts ranged from 39 to 43 kg n ha 1 and from 24 to 29 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively there was no significant difference in nitrate leaching under different irrigation amounts this result is similar to that reported by li et al 2020b who found that there was no evident difference in nitrate leaching under different matric potential controlled drip irrigation in the hetao irrigation district of china nitrate leaching corresponding to the optimal irrigation amount was 40 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and 24 kg n ha 1 in 2017 the most appropriate irrigation managements should satisfy both high crop yields and high wp zheng et al 2013 in 2016 the optimal irrigation amount was 80 mm while the rwp and the ry were both 0 93 and there was no significant difference from the w55 treatment the optimal irrigation amount in 2017 was 97 mm while the rwp and the ry were 0 95 the irrigation amount was reduced by approximately 20 mm and the rwp increased by 19 compared with the w55 treatment the rnue corresponding to the optimal irrigation amount was 0 99 in both 2016 and 2017 in summary we recommend irrigation amount of 80 97 mm for peanut in the semi arid areas of northeast china 3 conclusion the ahc model was successfully used to simulate the soil water nitrogen dynamics and crop growth in peanut fields in semi arid areas of northeast china good agreement was obtained between the simulated and observed data with an rmse root mean square error value of 0 02 0 03 cm3 cm 3 for soil water content and 2 92 5 01 mg kg 1 for nitrate concentration and 38 504 kg ha 1 for peanut yield the w55 treatment produced the highest peanut yield and nue without compromising wp evapotranspiration and crop n uptake were the main pathways of water and nitrogen consumption accounting for 75 87 and 74 97 of the total water and nitrogen inputs water percolation and nitrogen leaching mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall events scenario simulations indicated that the crop yield and nue increased while wp decreased as the irrigation amounts increased through a quadratic function considering crop yield wp and nue we recommend that the optimal irrigation amount of 80 97 mm for peanut in the semi arid areas of northeast china this study provided a scientific basis for the sustainable development of the peanut industry for this area however future work should also consider the effects of different n applications on yield wp and nue

9526,water shortage and poor soil fertility are the main factors restricting the sustainable development of peanut production in semi arid areas of northeast china it is thus essential to have a deep understanding of the soil water nitrogen dynamics and crop water nitrogen use for developing water and nutrient strategies three levels of irrigation treatment w65 65 of field capacity w55 55 of field capacity w45 45 of field capacity and a rain fed treatment ck were implemented in field experiments conducted for peanut during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 in liaoning northeast china the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model was calibrated and validated and then applied to assess peanut yield water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue for the present situation and future irrigation scenarios the results indicated that the ahc model was capable of simulating soil water and nitrogen status and peanut growth simulations of soil water nitrogen contents and crop growth indicators leaf area index aboveground biomass plant height and yield fitted well with field observations simulated dynamics showed that 9 21 of the total water input and 14 27 of the total n input were leached out the root zone 0 60 cm rainfall was the main cause of water percolation and nitrogen leaching the highest average yield 5701 kg ha 1 and nue 26 77 kg kg 1 were obtained in the w55 treatment the wp was not obviously decreased under the w55 treatment and was only 4 1 lower than that of the ck treatment in which the wp was highest based on scenario analysis with the consideration of crop yield wp and nue the optimal irrigation amount of 80 97 mm is recommended for peanut cultivation in this region we demonstrated that the ahc model could be used to develop water management strategies for peanuts in northeast china to conserve water while sustaining agriculture keywords agro hydrological model irrigation crop growth water nitrogen use 1 introduction irrigation is critical for crop growth and yield xu et al 2020 china is a leading agricultural country with agricultural water consumption accounting for more than 60 of its total water use of which approximately 90 is used for agricultural irrigation fan et al 2014 hu et al 2016 chang et al 2016 with the increase in irrigation areas and crops water shortages have become a major constraint on agricultural production in china tang et al 2021 meanwhile the ratio of irrigation water available to crops in the field to the total water diversion is only 0 55 in china li et al 2020a 2020b indicating that a large amount of irrigation water is lost due to inappropriate management wang et al 2019 soil moisture is the most critical for crop growth as irrigation water must be converted into soil water before being absorbed by crops therefore in depth studies of the dynamics of soil water movement and the implementation of water saving irrigation methods are of great importance for alleviating water shortages and ensuring sustainable agricultural development in china in addition to irrigation fertilization is another vital factor for maintaining crop growth and guaranteeing grain yield wang et al 2017 taking nitrogen n fertilizer as an example the annual n fertilizer application for agriculture in china reached 20 million tons in recent years accounting for approximately 1 4 of the world s total n fertilizer applications however the ratio of nitrogen uptake by crops to nitrogen application for agricultural production is still very low with an average value of 25 in china zhang et al 2015 the loss of n fertilizer results in serious environmental degradation such as air pollution and groundwater contamination guo et al 2020 yao et al 2019 rekha et al 2011 thus grasping the law of soil n migration and implementing effective n fertilizer management could not only promote crop production but also reduce the environmental risk liu et al 2018 peanut arachis hypogaea l is one of the main cash crops in liaoning province of northeast china pan et al 2013 the northwest liaoning is a competitive producing area for peanut and the primary export base of high quality peanut in semi arid areas of northeast china wang et al 2021 however the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall in this area is extremely uneven due to the unique monsoon climate and topographical characteristics typically the water supply is not sufficient for peanuts during the critical growth period in which plants are sensitive to water deficits xia et al 2021 at the same time groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this area with the decreasing availability of groundwater irrigation water scarcity would be more severe huang et al 2020 in addition the dominant soil texture in this area is sandy loam with a relatively low supply capacity of n which is insufficient for peanut growth as a result most local farmers often apply excessive amounts of n fertilizers for achieving more production so as to obtain great economic benefits therefore it is essential to develop reasonable irrigation and fertilization plans that can mitigate both water use conflicts and environmental pollution in semi arid areas of northeast china in general the optimal water and n management can be identified by field experiments yan et al 2019 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 however it is difficult to quantitatively study the cycle and utilization of water and n in the field due to the time consuming and high cost of field experiments hao et al 2014 moreover some water and n balance observations are difficult to measure directly noory et al 2011 therefore simulation models are important alternatives for evaluating long term water and n dynamics in the field rath et al 2021 the newly developed ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator model is a systematic tool to numerically simulate agro ecosystem processes e g soil water flow heat and solute transport n transformation crop growth the ahc model has been validated for the simulation of the relevant agroecosystem processes in maize and wheat fields liu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 but has not yet used in peanut fields therefore based on two year field experiment data the ahc model was used to assess the agroecosystem processes in peanut fields the objectives of this study were 1 to simulate soil water and n dynamics and crop growth in peanut fields using the ahc model 2 to assess water and nitrogen use under present and future irrigation scenarios and 3 to identify a suitable irrigation amount for peanut cultivation in the study area 1 1 materials and methods 1 1 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted at the taoli experimental station latitude 42 08 n longitude 121 44 e altitude 213 m fig 1 in liaoning province of northeast china during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons may to september the study area belongs to the north temperate zone with a semi arid continental monsoon climate the average annual air temperature is 7 2 with a cumulative temperature above 10 of approximately 3000 the average annual precipitation is 493 1 mm and pan evaporation 20 cm pan is 1846 mm the frost free period is about 150 days the total rainfall was 399 mm and 335 mm during the peanut growth seasons in 2016 and 2017 respectively the soil texture is sandy loam and the detailed physical properties of the soil in the study site are presented in table 1 the groundwater depth is 8 13 m below the ground surface 1 1 2 experimental design and measurements the test peanut was the cultivar baisha 1016 which was widely planted in the study area three irrigation levels were implemented in field experiment the upper limit of the soil water content was 90 of the field capacity fc while the lower limits were 45 w45 55 w55 and 65 w65 of the fc in addition a rain fed treatment was conducted as the control ck the detailed irrigation schedules for each treatment are shown in table 2 peanut was planted in double rows and the width of the ridge was 0 5 m the planting density was 2 25 105 plants ha 1 plot sizes were 3 5 m2 and an 80 cm depth polyvinyl chloride barrier was inserted into the soil between plots to prevent horizontal movement of nutrients the irrigation method was drip irrigation under film mulching groundwater was used as the irrigation water drip irrigation tubes were installed in each row and a water meter was used to measure the volume of irrigation the emitter spacing was 0 35 m and the discharge of each emitter was 4 l h 1 nitrogen urea 60 kg ha 1 phosphorus 105 kg ha 1 and potassium 120 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied for all treatments as basal fertilizers the peanut was sowed on may 14th and harvested on september 17th in 2016 and sowed on may 25th and harvested on september 25th in 2017 the other field management measures use of insecticide and weeding etc were according to the local farmers soil was sampled at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 60 cm using a ring knife 100 cm3 to determine the basic soil physical properties table 1 the 0 60 cm at 10 cm intervals soil water content was measured every seven days via a diviner 2000 sentek corporation australia during all growth stages soil samples of 0 60 cm at 10 cm intervals were collected and the soil nitrate concentrations were determined using the continuous flow analytical system auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany three peanut plants were selected in each plot to measure the leaf area index lai using the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa and plant height was measured with a straight meter ruler every 7 14 days three plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then were dried to a constant weight at 75 c to measure the accumulated aboveground biomass at harvest seeds were air dried outdoors for 10 13 days and peanut yields were calculated based on 14 moisture content meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and rainfall were obtained from an automatic weather station watch dog m2900et weather station usa the detailed data on the main weather variables are presented in fig 2 1 2 overview of ahc and its components the ahc model is a physically based numerical model developed to simulate the agroecosystem processes including soil water evaporation and transpiration solute salt n heat and plant growth it is composed of three main parts i e the agroecosystem simulation aesim process the global sensitivity analysis gsa process and the global parameter estimation gpe process the aesim process calculation part is inherited and modified based on the previous agro hydrological model swap epic xu et al 2013a 2013b the 1 d richards equation convection dispersion equation and heat conduction equation pachepskya et al 2003 van dam et al 2008 boesten and van der linden 1991 de vries 1975 were used to describe the soil water flow solute transport and heat transfer in the soil plant atmosphere continuum system respectively the finite difference solution scheme was applied for each process while the fully implicit difference scheme was used temporally and the unit centre method was used spatially the model also considers soil hysteresis spatial heterogeneity and expansion and contraction in the solution process the simulation of the n migration and transformation process referred to the daisy model abrahamsen and hansen 2000 the crop growth module in the ahc is mainly based on the concept of the environment policy integrated climate epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 the gsa process and gpe process were used in conjunction to determine the parameters for model calibration the gsa process is based on the latin hypercube one factor at a time method lh oat morris 1991 mckay et al 1979 to perform parameter sensitivity analysis the gpe process uses the modified micro genetic algorithm modified mga ines and droogers 2002 to perform global optimization on sensitive parameters and to finally determine reasonable parameter values the ahc model has also developed a graphical user interface with complete functions based on the vb net language this model can be applied to the simulation and analysis of farmland hydrological processes under different conditions and has been well tested and applied in northern china xu et al 2013a 2013b jiang et al 2015 a detailed description of the model components and mechanisms is shown in the work of xu et al 2018 1 3 model setup calibration and validation the simulation period was from may to september in both 2016 and 2017 covering the whole growing season of peanut the w65 treatment of 2016 was used to calibrate the ahc model all other treatments in 2016 and 2017 were used to validate the model the depth of the soil profile was set to 0 150 cm with four horizontal layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 150 cm the column was discretized into 150 nodes with a uniform spacing of 1 0 cm the depth of the peanut root zone was set at 0 60 cm because the root system of peanuts is mainly concentrated in this range ding et al 2015 for soil water flow the upper boundary condition of the model was determined by the irrigation and rainfall fluxes and the actual evaporation and transpiration meanwhile the influence of film mulching was considered with the mulching coefficient of 0 6 since the depth of groundwater in the study area was greater than 8 m the lower boundary was set as a free drainage boundary for nitrogen transport the third type boundary condition was used for the upper and lower boundary conditions the initial conditions of the soil water content and soil nitrogen concentration were set based on the field measurements the initial values of soil hydraulic parameters were predicted by the rosetta model schaap et al 2001 based on the measured soil particle composition and soil bulk density the initial values related to carbon turnover of the nitrogen module referred to the recommended values of the daisy model and were set in conjunction with previous research results liang et al 2014 hansen et al 1991 mueller et al 1998 the initial values of crop growth and the root water uptake parameters table 4 referred to the recommended values of the epic model and former study williams et al 1989 ren et al 2016 2017 three indicators were used to evaluate the model performance including the root mean square error rmse the determination coefficient r 2 and the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse ren et al 2016 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 nse 1 i

simulated and observed values respectively and n is the number of observations rmse values close to 0 and r 2 values close to 1 indicate good model performance the nse values range from to 1 with nse 1 0 representing high efficiency and with nse 0 indicating that the mean observed value is a good predictor compared to the model leghari et al 2019 1 4 simulation scenarios of different irrigation amounts after proper calibration and validation the ahc model was applied to determine the optimal irrigation amount in 2016 normal year and 2017 dry year a total of eight irrigation scenarios 60 130 were set with an interval of 10 of the present irrigation amount of the w55 treatment during the growth period in 2016 and 2017 the total irrigation amount of the eight scenarios ranged from 53 to 116 mm in 2016 and from 69 to 151 mm in 2017 then the relative yield ry relative wp rwp relative nue rnue nitrate leaching and evapotranspiration under different irrigation levels were calculated to determine the optimal irrigation amounts in the test year the ry rwp and rnue were normalized results and defined as the actual values divided by the respective maximum hence the values vary between 0 and 1 these scenarios were conducted by only varying the irrigation amounts of w55 treatment while other field management practices were maintained the same as the w55 treatment in 2016 and 2017 2 results and discussion 2 1 model calibration and validation the measured and simulated soil water contents soil nitrate concentrations leaf area index crop heights aboveground biomass and yields of all treatments during the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 3 the statistical indicators rmse nse and r 2 for both calibration and validation are presented in table 3 for soil water content the ahc model can reflect the trend of soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths fig s1 soil water content increased rapidly with irrigation or rainfall and then gradually decreased because of root water uptake and redistribution until the next irrigation or rainfall event occurred the variations of soil water content in the upper soil layers 0 30 cm were significantly wider and more frequent than those in the deeper soil layers 30 60 cm as rainfall irrigation and root water uptake had greater impacts on the upper soil layers similar results were also reported by wang et al 2014 and ren et al 2018 the rmse nse and r 2 values for soil water content ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 from 0 63 to 0 81 and from 0 79 to 0 87 respectively during the calibration and validation periods the goodness of fit indicators were within the range of values reported in previous research for soil water simulation liu and shao 2015 jiang et al 2011 ramos et al 2017 for soil nitrate concentration the no3 n concentrations in the near surface layers 0 20 cm gradually increased and then reached a peak approximately ten days after sowing due to urea hydrolysis and nitrification later the no3 n concentrations slowly decreased due to the influence of crop n uptake and n leaching fig s2 the rmse nse and r 2 values for soil nitrate simulation ranged from 2 92 to 5 01 mg kg 1 from 0 33 to 0 55 and from 0 31 to 0 76 respectively table 3 considering the complexity of soil nitrogen transformation and comparing to other research results wang et al 2011 xu et al 2018 liang et al 2020 the simulation accuracy for soil nitrate simulation is within an acceptable range moreover the simulated crop growth index matched well with the observed ones as shown in fig 3c f and table 3 the nse and r 2 values for lai plant height and aboveground biomass were higher than 0 8 however the plant height and lai were systematically slightly higher than the observed values in the late growth periods of both calibration and validation this may because the peanut growth was stressed by frequent heavy rainfalls in the late growth periods which was not considered by the ahc model additionally rmse between the simulated and measured peanut yields were 38 504 kg ha 1 in summary the above results indicated that the ahc model can be used as a reliable tool for simulating soil water and nitrogen dynamics as well as crop growth in the study area the calibrated parameters related to soil hydraulic and crop growth are shown in table 1 and table 4 respectively 2 2 transpiration and evaporation the simulated crop evapotranspiration et a transpiration t a and soil evaporation e a in each treatment are presented in table 5 results showed that the et a rates of different treatments were 308 387 mm and 290 388 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively the t a values ranged from 264 to 343 mm and from 255 to 354 mm accounting for 86 89 and 88 91 respectively of the et a the e a values were 42 44 mm and 34 35 mm for the two years accounting for 11 14 and 9 12 respectively of the et a studies on evapotranspiration partitioning reported that e a mainly accounts for 20 40 of et a on average for a range of different crops kool et al 2014 the lower e a in this study should be explained by the higher ground cover plastic film mulching and deeper water table moreover previous research showed that the e a et a ratio under film should be less than 20 rosa et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 which also confirmed that the ahc model could be a reliable tool for et simulation under the film mulching condition the trends of the daily t a and e a rates of different treatments in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 e a was significantly higher than t a in the seedling stage e a then decreased while t a increased with the expansion of the canopy during the late stage the t a rate gradually weakened due to the influential factors such as plant senescence and leaf area decline e a still remained at a low rate which may be due to the lower soil water contents caused by the small amount and frequency of rainfall that occurred during this period the average daily et a rates of different treatments during the whole growth period were 2 96 mm d 1 and 3 17 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 2 3 bottom flux of soil water and nitrogen the soil water and n fluxes at the 60 cm soil depth in each treatment in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 5 the directions of the water and n fluxes of each treatment were downward in the two years water percolation and nitrate leaching occurred simultaneously fig 5 during the simulation period of 2016 the water percolation and nitrate leaching amounts in each treatment were 84 92 mm and 39 41 kg n ha 1 respectively water percolation and nitrate leaching were mainly concentrated during the three heavy rainfall events from july 21 to july 29 fig 5a the rainfall amounts 200 mm in this period accounted for half of the total amounts 399 mm during the whole growth periods the water percolation and nitrate leaching of each treatment were 68 3 71 8 mm and 32 7 34 7 kg n ha 1 which accounted for 73 9 78 0 and 79 7 84 7 of the total amount of water percolation and nitrate leaching respectively wang et al 2014 also reported that nitrate leaching most likely occurred following a heavy precipitation event the leakage of water and nitrate during the last two heavy rainfall events were significantly greater than those of the first rainfall being likely because the soil was relatively dry before the first heavy rainfall event and the rainfall mainly supplemented the soil moisture as the soil was nearly saturated large amounts of water percolation and nitrate leaching occurred during the following two rainfall events liang et al 2011 the water and nitrate leaching amounts in 2017 32 55 mm and 21 26 kg n ha 1 respectively were lower than those in 2016 the reason may be that the rainfall distribution was relatively uniform during the simulation period in 2017 water percolation and nitrate leaching were mainly concentrated on august 3 and continuous rainfall periods occurred from august 14 to august 19 fig 5b the rainfall amount of 65 5 mm on august 3 resulted in 4 8 5 6 mm of water percolation and 4 8 5 5 kg n ha 1 of nitrate leaching accounting for 8 8 17 3 and 18 6 26 2 of the total amount of water percolation and nitrate leaching there were 7 9 27 3 mm of water percolation and 4 3 9 7 kg n ha 1 of nitrate leaching occurred during the continuous rainfall periods the cumulative rainfall was 66 4 mm from august 14 to august 19 accounting for 22 0 50 4 of the total water percolation and 20 4 37 3 of the total nitrate leaching respectively 2 4 water and nitrogen balance 2 4 1 water balance and wp the soil water balance components for the 0 60 cm soil profile i e the root zone and wp of each treatment during the simulation period in 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 6 the soil water storage change is defined as the sum of water input components rainfall irrigation and capillary rise minus the water output components percolation and evapotranspiration rainfall was the main water input component which accounted for 78 97 and 72 99 of the total water input in 2016 and 2017 respectively evapotranspiration was the main pathway of water consumption accounting for approximately 75 87 of the total water input the bottom flux was composed of capillary rise and water percolation it was found that a low amount of water moved upward into the root zone through capillary rise with cumulated values of 2 11 mm as the groundwater depth in the study area is deep 8 m this was different from the results of studies in shallow groundwater areas ren et al 2017 reported that there was about 300 mm net groundwater supplement into the root zone of cropland in hetao irrigation district the water percolation accounted for 17 21 and 9 12 of the total water input in 2016 and 2017 respectively due to the influence of heavy rainfall events during the growth seasons of 2016 and 2017 the percolated water amount in each treatment was much higher than the capillary rise the values of soil water balance in both years were positive ranging from 17 to 34 mm in 2016 and from 15 to 26 mm in 2017 thereby indicating that the soil water storage could meet the peanut growth requirement as shown in table 6 the measured peanut yield ranged from 4783 to 5679 kg ha 1 in 2016 and from 4896 to 5724 kg ha 1 in 2017 in both years the highest yield was obtained in the w55 treatment while the lowest was obtained in the ck treatment the wp of each treatment ranged from 1 45 to 1 58 kg m 3 in 2016 and from 1 44 to 1 63 kg m 3 in 2017 table 6 the ck treatment had the highest wp in both years compared with ck the wp of the w65 w55 and w45 treatments decreased by 8 4 2 1 and 7 1 in 2016 and by 11 4 6 1 and 10 1 in 2017 2 4 2 nitrogen balance and nue the n balance components for the 0 60 cm soil profile i e the root zone and nue of each treatment during the simulation period of 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 7 the n storage change is defined as the n input components n fertilization n in rainfall and irrigation water soil net n mineralization and n capillary rise flux at the bottom minus the output components nitrate leaching ammonia volatilization crop n uptake and denitrification nitrate leaching was one of the main ways of n loss accounting for 24 26 and 14 16 of the total n inputs in 2016 and 2017 respectively there was a small difference in nitrate leaching among irrigation treatments which was mainly because the n fertilization amount of each treatment was 60 kg ha 1 and no additional fertilizer was applied shi et al 2020 also reported that the n leaching for maize was relative stable when the fertilizer amount was within a certain range due to rainfall conditions the interannual difference in nitrate leaching was significant ammonia volatilization was the main pathway of gaseous n loss which accounted for approximately 21 and 23 of the total n source in 2016 and 2017 respectively the n lost through denitrification was negligible at 5 of the total n input which was agreed with the results that reported by hu et al 2010 and edis 2004 crop n uptake constituted the largest part of n outputs which accounted for 74 82 and 95 97 of the total n source of each treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively the values of soil n balance ranged from 50 to 37 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and from 61 to 53 kg n ha 1 in 2017 respectively the negative values of n balance revealed the net consumption of soil mineral n the nue of each treatment ranged from 24 43 to 27 30 kg kg 1 in 2016 and from 24 19 to 26 23 kg kg 1 in 2017 table 7 the highest nue was observed in the w55 treatment in both years 2 5 optimization of irrigation amounts in test years the verified ahc model was used to predict the relative yield ry relative wp rwp relative nue rnue evapotranspiration and n leaching under different irrigation scenarios to determine the optimal irrigation amount as shown in fig 6 ry increased as the irrigation amount increased through a quadratic function however when the total irrigation amount increased to approximately 100 mm the rate of increase in ry gradually decreased which indicated that the relationship between peanut yield and irrigation amount was not linear previous studies indicated that excessive irrigation could lead to low production sun et al 2006 therefore irrigation amount must be controlled within a certain range to achieve the goals of saving water and maintaining production sezen et al 2019 rwp decreased and rnue increased with increasing irrigation fig 6 the reason for the decline in rwp was that the rate of increase in yield was smaller than that of evapotranspiration the reason for the increase in rnue was that the yield increased with the increase of irrigation amount but the n output components under different irrigation scenarios had little difference as shown in fig 7a the evapotranspiration under different irrigation scenarios ranged from 310 to 420 mm and increased with increasing irrigation amount the evapotranspiration under the optimal irrigation amount was 365 mm in 2016 and 367 mm in 2017 the relationship between nitrate leaching and irrigation amount is shown in fig 7b the nitrate leaching amounts ranged from 39 to 43 kg n ha 1 and from 24 to 29 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively there was no significant difference in nitrate leaching under different irrigation amounts this result is similar to that reported by li et al 2020b who found that there was no evident difference in nitrate leaching under different matric potential controlled drip irrigation in the hetao irrigation district of china nitrate leaching corresponding to the optimal irrigation amount was 40 kg n ha 1 in 2016 and 24 kg n ha 1 in 2017 the most appropriate irrigation managements should satisfy both high crop yields and high wp zheng et al 2013 in 2016 the optimal irrigation amount was 80 mm while the rwp and the ry were both 0 93 and there was no significant difference from the w55 treatment the optimal irrigation amount in 2017 was 97 mm while the rwp and the ry were 0 95 the irrigation amount was reduced by approximately 20 mm and the rwp increased by 19 compared with the w55 treatment the rnue corresponding to the optimal irrigation amount was 0 99 in both 2016 and 2017 in summary we recommend irrigation amount of 80 97 mm for peanut in the semi arid areas of northeast china 3 conclusion the ahc model was successfully used to simulate the soil water nitrogen dynamics and crop growth in peanut fields in semi arid areas of northeast china good agreement was obtained between the simulated and observed data with an rmse root mean square error value of 0 02 0 03 cm3 cm 3 for soil water content and 2 92 5 01 mg kg 1 for nitrate concentration and 38 504 kg ha 1 for peanut yield the w55 treatment produced the highest peanut yield and nue without compromising wp evapotranspiration and crop n uptake were the main pathways of water and nitrogen consumption accounting for 75 87 and 74 97 of the total water and nitrogen inputs water percolation and nitrogen leaching mainly occurred due to heavy rainfall events scenario simulations indicated that the crop yield and nue increased while wp decreased as the irrigation amounts increased through a quadratic function considering crop yield wp and nue we recommend that the optimal irrigation amount of 80 97 mm for peanut in the semi arid areas of northeast china this study provided a scientific basis for the sustainable development of the peanut industry for this area however future work should also consider the effects of different n applications on yield wp and nue

9527,climate change growing populations and increasing wealth are increasing demand for food energy and water additionally water stress is expected to increase in the future in areas with high rates of seasonality of precipitation due to increased variability in precipitation one approach to limiting the impact of climate change on food system productions is through the intensive and extensive expansion of irrigated agriculture this study develops a hydro economic model to assess future agriculture production possibilities and the role of irrigation water in the pacific slope region of guatemala one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country a range of future scenarios are presented to account for uncertainty around irrigation infrastructure expansion future crop prices incentives for production of biomass for bioenergy and water availability and irrigation demand due to climate change we find that current surface water irrigation infrastructure increases agricultural output by value in the region by about 5 3 compared to a fully rainfed system additionally we show that with expanded irrigation infrastructure agricultural output could increase by between 3 4 and 18 4 relative to current levels under current climate conditions but the value of agricultural production could increase under climate change with projected output from current and expanded irrigation infrastructure resulting in an increase of 1 2 24 8 relative to current irrigation levels we also present evidence that the marginal benefit from increased irrigation access to smallholder farmers is nearly equal to that received by large scale industrial agricultural producers keywords irrigation expansion hydro economics surface water allocation 1 introduction 1 1 a spatial temporal mismatch in water demand and supply demand for food energy and freshwater rises as global population grows and urbanizes mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhao et al 2019 recently demand for water has been growing at twice the population growth rate fao 2010 mainly due to irrigation expansion and food security concerns vörösmarty et al 2000 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 stress that while water supply is often sufficient to meet these demands spatial and temporal heterogeneity can result in mismatches in water supply and demand leading to water scarcity and diminished economic opportunity in certain areas climate change is expected to increase the variance in precipitation across the globe dore 2005 this could exacerbate the mismatch in timing or spatial allocation of supply and demand in certain regions with existing development challenges including latin america by shifting the temporal distribution of water availability between dry and wet seasons and in some cases reducing aggregate water availability below historical amounts imbach et al 2018 wwap 2012 in many contexts availability and demand for water in agricultural systems could be more severely affected than in other sectors due to increased demand for irrigation water from warmer and drier conditions wang et al 2016 for example water availability in guatemala has declined by about 2 7 between 1950 and 2006 while irrigation demand has increased over that time period vargas et al 2018 water access and agriculture the agricultural sector is the largest global demand source for freshwater supplies ritchie and roser 2017 though access to water for irrigation remains a limiting factor for agricultural systems in many regions domènech 2015 irrigation access is increasingly constrained by a changing climate and competing demands in other sectors though institutional forces also limit irrigation expansion possibilities in some regions agricultural water is inefficiently managed or is only allocated to select users limiting access to other producer groups that must rely on rainfed systems or capital intensive groundwater extraction for irrigation further as water access for agricultural and household consumption has traditionally been viewed as a human right governmental policies have aimed at providing water access at the lowest possible cost which can result in inefficient consumption patterns across different water use sectors convery 2013 grafton et al 2020 scott and shah 2004 argue that subsidies to the agriculture sector aimed at increasing irrigation access can also intensify water allocation concerns however while increasing irrigation access faces institutional challenges that can be exacerbated by certain policy incentives irrigation expansion may be a necessary tool for closing global agricultural yield gaps and increasing food security rosa et al 2018 mahlknecht et al 2020 found that water use in agricultural production accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals in latin america future irrigation expansion will continue to compete with other economic and development priorities in the region that also rely on freshwater sources including industrial manufacturing and energy generation mahlknecht et al 2020 de oliveira et al 2009 discuss the rise of irrigated agriculture in latin america pointing out that as demand in other sectors continues to encroach on available water supplies for agriculture producers will need to improve their water management strategies however wu et al 2018 suggests that latin america is the region with the greatest potential to increase its cropping intensity level including through irrigation regardless of whether irrigation expansion is supported by subsidies or publicly financed capital projects direct and indirect costs of these policies or investments must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits they would provide to rural communities further investment needs and management interventions to ensure sustainable irrigation practices are context specific and could vary region to region palazzo et al 2019 for example irrigation induced yield growth can benefit both rural communities and the environment in some contexts by boosting agricultural incomes while relaxing pressure for land at the extensive margin ceddia 2019 irrigation expansion and the food energy water nexus socioeconomic pressures environmental change and land conservation policies for climate and biodiversity goals may continue to push intensification in agricultural production and irrigation in latin america and such expansion will need to be weighed relative to broader development objectives in the food energy water nexus improving agricultural productivity through irrigation expansion can support livelihoods and economic growth although challenges and uncertainties remain bhattarai and narayanamoorthy 2003 cook et al 2009 de fraiture et al 2010 including whether irrigation expansion will conflict with growing demands for water from households industry and the energy sector thus it is critical to identify opportunities where irrigation expansion can improve local economic outcomes while limiting food energy water nexus and associated environmental impacts irrigation expansion can contribute to food energy water nexus by bolstering local food supplies and food security objectives and by supporting production of agricultural feed stocks used in bioenergy systems but could limit system capacity to meet growing water demands in other sectors given existing and expected future resource constraints it is important to evaluate the extent to which expanding irrigation access or other adaptation mechanisms e g crop switching or spatial re allocation of agricultural land use can increase economic benefits as a basis for cost benefit analysis of irrigation projects 1 2 guatemala as a unique study development challenges in guatemala guatemala currently faces a wide range of development challenges in the food energy water nexus kondash et al 2021 that will drive resource competition in the coming decades and could require new management strategies and infrastructure investments such challenges will require analysis that captures spatial and temporal interactions between policy induced changes in resource consumption and socioeconomic outcomes for example climate change mitigation and renewable energy commitments could drive the demand for land and water as the country seeks to expand its renewable electricity generation portfolio henry et al 2021 and liquid biofuel production gleds 2018 and such investments could encroach on agricultural lands thus requiring greater intensification of agricultural production to achieve food security goals agriculture in guatemala the agriculture sector in guatemala accounts for approximately 12 of gdp fao 2013 and over 35 of total land was dedicated to agricultural in 2018 bank 2021 additionally the agriculture sector employees approximately 40 of the labor force within guatemala fao 2013 smallholder farmers households owning less than 4 ha ha of farmland control over 50 of arable land with 45 of all holdings being smaller than 0 7 ha fao 2014 despite smallholder farmers controlling a large proportion of total agricultural land over 65 of irrigated area is dedicated to major exportation crops such as sugarcane and banana fao 2013 guatemala has seen an expansion of irrigation water demand being driven by exported crops such as sugarcane rubber and oil palm other crops that are culturally and economically important e g coffee and staple crops that support local food security e g corn beans and vegetables are typically not irrigated because they are grown by smallholder farmers with limited access to capital and financing for irrigation infrastructure for producers of these crops obstacles to irrigation include a lack of access to irrigation infrastructure water distribution and storage limited surface water rights and a lack of access to credit technical assistance and market value chains maga 2012 the inequality of access and prioritization of resource allocation to sugarcane and oil palm has led to civil unrest over land and water rights between indigenous populations and industrial agricultural producers pietilainen and otero 2019 kooijmans 2021 water in guatemala the availability of water per capita in guatemala varies depending on the basin and is relatively high compared to other countries water availability is estimated to be about 6000 m3 per person per year in the caribbean slope about 6250 m3 per person per year for the pacific and almost 10 000 m3 per person per year for the gulf of mexico basterrechea 2019 however this availability is not stable during the year given the seasonality in the annual cycle of precipitation cepal 2018 importantly while the pacific slope has less water availability than the caribbean slope it has the largest population industrial base agricultural activities and the least forest coverage according to the projections made by cepal reductions of water availability of up to 59 are expected by the end of the century thus per capita water availability would drop to a range of 2000 5000 m3 per year due to population and economic growth cepal 2010 2015 another serious problem related to water resources and the impact of climate change is the increase in sea levels and the potential salinization of surface and underground water bodies according to cepal 2018 salinity levels have increased notably specifically in the aquifers of the pacific basin increasing the vulnerability to water stress of many people and their livelihoods in addition to the increase in demand and climate change water resources present an additional vulnerability due to the difficulty of its management given its spatial and temporal dynamics as well as the weak institutional and political framework present in the country 1 3 study objectives the goal of this study is to assess the impact of different management strategies on future agricultural land use and irrigation management under various climate change scenarios increasing agricultural sector resilience to climate change is a key development objective in central america because it supports the rural economy and livelihoods increasing irrigation access particularly for smallholder farmers is one potential adaptation strategy to climate and socioeconomic change in this study we conduct a first of its kind hydro economic assessment of crop irrigation expansion possibilities in the pacific slope region of guatemala which is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country we develop and apply a hydro economic optimization model that captures variation in the spatiotemporal distribution of water supply and demand across sectors in the region under observed and future conditions with climate change we apply this hydro economic model to assess agricultural land use and irrigation strategies under alternative crop expansion scenarios where we restrict and expand access to irrigation by crop groups our scenario design captures variation in observed climate and water availability projected future climate change and relative returns to agriculture to reflect energy sector connections to food production and water supply systems we also assess irrigation expansion possibilities with and without bioenergy systems overall we examine agricultural land and irrigation management under a wide range of plausible water availability climate and socioeconomic scenarios previous assessments while the literature around irrigation water management and the food energy water nexus has developed rapidly in latin america there are notable gaps site or country specific analyses of irrigation expansion potential in latin america often focus on specific crop groups or irrigation technologies e g merlos et al 2015 oumarou abdoulaye et al 2019 vos and marshall 2017 hernandez cuello et al 2019 however these biophysical and techno economic assessments may not capture important economic trade offs associated with irrigation expansion meanwhile applied integrated assessment modeling arango aramburo et al 2019 santos da silva et al 2019 assesses high level tradeoffs between irrigation and other development objectives particularly in the energy sector while such approaches reflect resource constraints and economic opportunity costs they may not capture nuanced details related to watershed hydrology infrastructure or supply and demand systems of water other hydro economic techniques baker et al 2021 kondash et al 2021 capture more detail on spatiotemporal dynamics between socioeconomic and resource systems at local scale but typically do not capture broader market implications of management changes or new infrastructure additionally most analyses have focused on middle income countries such as brazil argentina chile and mexico due in part to availability of data analytics and modeling efforts in countries in less developed countries including guatemala are limited one notable example banerjee et al 2019 applies an integrated environmental economic platform with detailed social accounting data to assess tradeoffs between sustainable development goals in guatemala while detailed the framework used in this study lacks the spatial and temporal resolution needed to assess tradeoffs between irrigation management and policy scenarios our study makes several contributions to the literature first this is the first attempt that we are aware of to systematically evaluate agricultural water resource management production possibilities and potential benefits of irrigation in guatemala using hydro economic modeling techniques we develop an integrated hydro economic modeling framework for the pacific slope region to assess the value of irrigation water and to quantify the potential economic benefits that could be derived from irrigation expansion and alternative water allocation schemes our scenario design reflects current institutional allocations and policy goals relevant to the food energy water nexus in the country including improving agricultural productivity for food crops supporting bioenergy production from agricultural byproducts and meeting household water demands while capturing sources of uncertainty we show that even marginal reallocations of irrigation water away from industrial crop production systems near the coast to smaller scale food crop producers in the interior portions of the pacific slope can yield system wide benefits and this result is robust to projected climate changes our analysis and modeling framework can inform future assessment of policy design cost benefit analysis of specific irrigation projects or opportunities to improve development outcomes through coordinated management of the food energy and water nexus 2 methods this study links spatial analytics hydrologic modeling and economic systems modeling in a novel way to conduct the hydro economic assessment of agricultural water use in the pacific slope of guatemala our hydro economic approach simulates the potential benefits of irrigation expansion while recognizing tradeoffs and resource constraints that vary spatially and temporally each of the system components is described in detail in the following sections 2 1 study region our study region focuses on the pacific slope portion of guatemala or the southwestern portion of the country which accounts for 22 of the country s land area and drains to the pacific ocean this region is an important economic driver as most exported crops grown in the country are produced there further the pacific slope captures a diverse range of land use forestry agriculture urban and others and watersheds that begin in the highlands and flow into the pacific ocean shown in fig 1 industrial agricultural production including sugarcane and oil palm is mostly confined to the central and coastal portion of the study region these operations maintain a large allocation of available surface water in the region subsistence annual crops such as corn and beans are scattered throughout the study region including the southern and eastern portions coffee and rubber production is confined mostly to highlands region further inland from most sugarcane production 2 2 hydrologic simulation framework a network or node based hydro economic optimization model was developed to project the impact of a range of climate and hydrologic conditions on the irrigation implementation and production of major crop commodities these types of models represent and fully integrate natural hydrologic systems and human and economic systems and have been used for water resource valuation and policy analysis bekchanov et al 2017 harou et al 2009 this modeling framework accounts for spatial and temporal variation in surface water availability irrigation and household demand for water and river outflows to the ocean the model is setup to maximize the value of agriculture production by endogenously selecting where and what crops to irrigate subject to resource availability constraints these constraints include minimum surface water outflow and a baseline level of household demand that must be met prior to water being allocated to irrigation the hydrologic assessment framework relies on the modeling tool hydro bid developed by the inter american development bank idb and rti international hydro bid is a modeling system that includes hydrology and climate analysis modules to estimate water availability surface water volumes and fluxes at the regional basin and subbasin scales moreda et al 2014 the system is built on a hydrographic network derived for the study area with watersheds divided into sub watershed catchments the model uses the network topology and underlying gridded datasets of climate land cover and soil properties to estimate streamflow at a daily timestep based on the gwlf modeling framework haith et al 1992 haith 1985 we divide the pacific slope region into 10 separate river basin watersheds each draining to the pacific ocean and one endorheic basin that drains only to lake atitlan in the central highlands these 10 watersheds are further subdivided into a total of 1004 networked catchments with an average size of 25 square kilometers for completeness the hydrologic model includes the portions of the eastern and western most river basins that overlap into el salvador and mexico see fig 1 however the economic model focuses strictly on water and land use decisions in guatemala inputs to the hydrology model were developed from remotely sensed datasets gridded daily time series of precipitation and temperature from the nasa power global database were used for climate forcing sparks 2018 the remotely sensed data was compared against observations from ground based meteorological stations in the study area to quantify error based on our findings we derived monthly correction factors to reduce error in rainfall timing and magnitude these factors were then applied to the entire remotely sensed dataset to better match local conditions land use was based on the usgs global land cover classification dataset loveland et al 2000 whereas soil properties including hydrologic soil group and available water capacity were derived from the fao world harmonized soil database nachtergaele et al 2010 2 3 hydro economic optimization model hydro bid simulation output provides pristine i e absent human alteration inflow data within each model catchment henceforth referred to as node the general node schematic node names and mapping between nodes as well as all hydrologic simulation data serve as inputs to the optimization routine which makes water allocation decisions at each node and time step including water diverted to homes for agricultural irrigation used in the production of electricity through hydropower dams or downstream we estimate monthly crop water demands that vary spatially by crop and by a range of irrigation intensities and crop profit functions which vary depending on level of irrigation inputs climate condition and crop type next we built an underlying economic database defined by the hydrologic nodes that include crop production possibilities location of hydropower facilities and households based on spatially and demographically delineated populations allpress 2018 the economic model aggregates the daily time step estimates from the hydrology model to a monthly time step fig 2 presents a schematic of both hydro bid and the hydro economic modeling framework 2 3 1 hydrologic flow consistent with all hydro economic models our framework captures hydrologic continuity to maintain mass balance of water flow and consumption through the surface water system see baker et al 2021 for additional discussion eq 1 defines hydrologic continuity of the system for each node i and month t 1 1 for our study region we assume no storage as all large scale hydropower reservoirs in guatemala are located outside of our study area 1 w i i 1 t j a gwate r ijt municipalwate r it w i 1 i t inflo w it where w i i 1 t is the flow of water from upstream i to downstream i 1 agwate r ijt is the amount of water diverted for irrigated agricultural production from node i for use by crop j during time period month t municipalwate r it is the amount of water diverted for household consumption node i during time period month t inflo w it is the pristine inflow by month and node which varies across simulation years this equation ensures mass balance of water from upstream to downstream across each monthly time step eq 2 represents a maximum instream flow constraint represented by the parameter maxoutflo w it which is an estimated upper bound on cumulative flow calculated for each node and month combination 2 w i i 1 t maxoutflo w it i t eq 3 imposes a minimum flow constraint on basin outflows this can be interpreted as a minimum instream flow constraint which is only applied to the outflow node the node in which the river basin flows into the ocean for each watershed in the system for this parameter we assume that minimum outflows cannot be less than 10 of average monthly outflow for our time series 3 w i i 1 t instreamflo w it for i 1 basin outflow point 2 3 2 hydro economic model agriculture sector benefits while most agriculture by small and medium farmers in guatemala is rain fed a significant portion of the productive land area in the pacific slope is irrigated due to the relatively high proportion of industrial farming operations to produce cash crops in this area to reflect agricultural demands for water in the study area an agriculture sector component was developed and calibrated to local agricultural production data the model optimizes agricultural profits from irrigated and rainfed systems with crop production possibilities that include rainfed low medium and high irrigation intensity options for crops that are allowed to be irrigated 2 3 3 crop profit functions agricultural production possibilities are represented for the following eight primary crops coffee sugarcane beans corn banana palm rubber and a vegetable proxy crop group we disaggregate the pacific slope into 1004 individual nodes which include areas within 14 departments and 206 municipalities fig 1 we compiled information on agricultural production harvested area crop value and yield for the pacific slope of guatemala this includes spatial mapping of land use and crop planting locations collected by the ministry of agriculture maga 2014 mapped to each node fig 1 in total about 1 2 million hectares of agricultural land are modeled in this analysis corn and beans are traditionally double cropped on the same land and covers the largest amount of area in the pacific slope about 364 kha sugarcane and coffee are the second and third most produced crops by area about 347 and 311 kha respectively while the rest of the modeled crops cover less than 100 kha each 75 for rubber 42 for both banana and vegetables and 33 for palm historical yields for each of these commodities was collected from fao from 2000 to 2016 fao 2021 after identifying the most prevalent crops in the study region we acquired production cost information for each crop from the bank of guatemala 2014 including historical rental rates of land crop establishment costs labor rates machinery and equipment depreciation and input costs additionally labor and equipment for irrigation is included so we can account for heterogeneity in cost associated with irrigated crop production several departments were missing crop production costs so each observation for each crop was averaged to estimate a representative regional production cost wholesale crop prices for vegetables corn and beans were collected from the la terminal market in guatemala city from 2006 to 2015 and averaged across this time frame maga 2018a 2018b 2018c producer prices collected from fao for central america were used to estimate the prices farmers received for coffee palm rubber sugarcane and banana fao 2021 prices for each crop were averaged using annual producer prices from 2006 to 2015 agricultural sector economic benefits are described by node specific profit functions in the following equation 4 a g b e n e f i t s i j b a s e a r e a i j k e x p a r e a i j k y i e l d j k p

irrigation is allowed to expand beyond the base assumption decision variable yiel d jk yield for crop j and irrigation status k where irrigation status includes dryland low medium and high irrigation intensity pric e j price for crop j annual crop prices were calculated as the regional average producer price or wholesale price from 2006 to 2015 from either maga 2018a 2018b 2018c or fao 2021 cost s jk production costs for crop j and irrigation status kl p mt w ag the assumed price for water for each node m and time period t of 1 guatemalan quetzal m3 roughly 0 13 m3 which is consistent with water tariffs paid by agricultural irrigators in guatemala future development of this model could benefit from local water price information for the agriculture sector the model also introduces constraints to limit total land area allocated to specific crop activities one concern with optimization models is that they can lead to corner solutions in which an activity with a high marginal net benefit is pursued at an unreasonable level e g a single crop dominating production in a region with a diverse crop mix to limit this effect we introduce node level crop area minimum and maximum constraints to ensure that production of any given crop lies within the observed minimum and maximum area devoted to that crop 80 and 120 of current crop area respectively as reported in our crop area maps these constraints are more formally represented in the following equation 5 mincropare a ij k baseare a ijk expare a ijk maxcropare a ij where the parameters mincropare a ij and maxcropare a ij represent the minimum and maximum parameters furthermore base irrigated area is restricted to be no more than the amount of area suitable or equipped for surface water irrigation we use fao global maps of irrigation areas to restrict irrigated areas for scenarios in which irrigation expansion is not allowed faures et al 2001 this constraint places an upper bound on baseare a ijk low and high irrigation only for each node by spatially weighting the total area equipped for surface water irrigation from each municipality in our study region 6 j k baseare a ijk fao irrigatedarea k dryland finally an upper bound on total crop area is imposed for each municipality equal to the maximum crop area total observed in the crop area layer this constraint imposes a realistic upper bound on total cropped area rain fed and irrigated based on existing production data an alternative model formulation relaxes the irrigated area constraint allowing extensive margin expansion at each node such that all crop area except for coffee can be irrigated 7 j k baseare a ijk expare a ijk maxcropare a i to develop irrigation response functions we apply a standard fao methodology to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration and then use this framework to estimate yields for different levels of irrigation intensity reference crop evapotranspiration et o is estimated using the hargreaves et o equation 8 eto 0 0023 tmean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where t mean t max and t min are daily mean maximum and minimum temperature which were developed from climate and daily solar radiation r a from the nasa atmospheric science data center power larc nasa gov using crop specific coefficients we then calculate a monthly crop water requirement crop evapotranspiration et c by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient k c 9 e t c k c e t 0 k c is the crop coefficient that varies by crop type climate soil evaporation and crop growth stages using data from allen et al 1998 the crop growing period is divided into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season we estimate crop water requirements for each of these stages and then develop per hectare irrigation requirements by month for each simulation year this crop water requirement can be supplied by rainfall irrigation or a combination of the two crop yield can reach its highest potential yield y c when the crop water requirement is fully satisfied depending on the actual water applied and effective rainfall actual crop yield y a is calculated by the following equation vaux and pruitt 1983 10 1 y a yc k y 1 eta etc where y a and y c stand for actual yield and maximum yield respectively and k y is the crop yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses k y is drawn from fao irrigation and drainage paper 66 steduto et al 2012 and sigalingging and rahmansyah 2018 for palm and ranges from 1 00 to 1 85 for the seven crops in the pacific slope rubber k y 1 00 is the most water resistant crop followed by vegetables 2 2 vegetables include carrots cabbage and onions 1 025 then bean 1 15 then corn and sugarcane each k y 1 25 then banana k y 1 275 and then palm k y 1 85 et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration which is the sum of effective rainfall and effective irrigation water based on this equation we can estimate how crop yield responds to irrigation for each node we used the nearest remotely sensed datapoint based on the nasa power data power larc nasa gov based on the precipitation we calculate the effective rainfall using eq 10 we estimate yields under three assumed irrigation conditions high irrigation low irrigation and dryland conditions to estimate high irrigation yields we took the highest observed yield for each crop and municipality between 2006 and 2015 and we estimated the additional monthly irrigation water requirements that would be needed to meet that yield target in each simulation year we then use eq 10 to estimate a dryland yield without irrigation for low irrigation yields we assumed it is the average yield between high yield and dryland yield then estimated the additional irrigation required to achieve this lower irrigated yield target similarly we include a medium irrigation schedule that is the average yield between low and high irrigation yields and calculate the additional irrigation required to achieve this target an illustrative example of alternative irrigation and yield possibilities is presented in fig 3 finally to determine the allocation of water at different nodes the following equation is used 11 agwate r ijt j k baseare a ijk θ ijkt expare a ijk θ ijkt δ i i t and m i where θ ijkt the monthly per hectare crop water requirement for node i crop j irrigation system k and time period t computed using the method outlined above δ i distribution efficiency for node i a simple parameter of 60 is assumed which is consistent with the distribution efficiency for connected households it is important to note that although some irrigators rely on groundwater particularly in the pacific slope we are requiring all irrigation to come from surface water resources we take this approach due in part to uncertainty and a lack of data availability regarding irrigation practices and hydrogeologic processes in guatemala further our approach allows us to focus specifically on competition for surface water resources and to address the question of whether sufficient water is available in the region to satisfy both household and agricultural demands 2 3 4 hydro economic model hydropower generation in addition to irrigation use flow through the nodes can be used to generate electricity at existing hydropower facilities within our study region there are 16 existing hydropower facilities for each of these facilities we gathered engineering specifications for each from the guatamala comision comisión nacional de energía eléctrica this includes location of dam average head height generation capacity and average flow through the turbine see supplemental table 10 in the appendix with this information we can estimate the

water demands we developed a synthetic population dataset for guatemala which provides a simplified but high resolution representation of actual household level populations within spatial nodes disaggregated by demographic characteristics allpress 2018 in the modeling framework we use the synthetic population to develop household demand functions for water consumption disaggregating population by connection type and rural urban designation table 1 provides an estimate of total water demand for the study region by population type these parameters are multiplied by populations for each model node using the synthetic population data to estimate monthly household water demand requirements in the study region allpress 2018 we multiply total per capita demand by population type and household within each node and aggregate to the monthly time step for each node and month eq 12 maintains that municipal water withdrawals cannot exceed total household demand 12 municipalwate r it housholddeman d it i t we introduce a penalty in the objective function to ensure that household water demands are as close to being met as physically possible this penalty represents the opportunity cost of satisfying water demands with an alternative source such as bottled water or private wells we assume a high opportunity cost of gtq 9 per m3 eq 13 represents this penalty 13 munpenalty i t housholddeman d it municipalwate r it then we combine household characteristics and estimates of water availability to construct a vulnerability metric in this analysis vulnerability is defined as the characteristics of a community systems or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard unisdr 2009 this definition incorporates two disparate pieces of information the characteristics of a community e g socioeconomic status and exposure to a hazard e g natural disasters information on either one is necessary but insufficient to characterize vulnerability of communities this definition implicitly considers that the communities that are vulnerable to water shortages are not necessarily the same communities that are vulnerable to other hazards e g

endogenous variables the optimization model is a linear program lp which is solved in gams using the cplex solver 2 4 scenario design a range of future scenarios were modeled to assess the variability in future commodity prices and crop revenue 3 alternative crop revenue scenarios intensive and extensive expansion of irrigation infrastructure 6 irrigation scenarios and the presence of incentives on sugarcane biproducts being used for bioenergy generation 2 biofuel scenarios each scenario is defined over these three parameters resulting in 36 scenario combinations each of these were run over ten simulation years of hydrologic flows from hydro bid 2006 2015 representing differences in water availability and irrigation demand additionally alternative climate change scenarios using an adjustment factor to shift monthly precipitation and precipitation inputs using the a1b scenario an outline of the modeled scenarios is included in table 2 our intention with this scenario design was to capture a wide range of key scenario parameters affecting either the physical availability of resources climate driven variation in water flows or the demand for water for irrigation the former is captured via spatially downscaled simulations of hydrologic flow using hydro bid representing both a replicated time series of historic flow from periods of low to high precipitation as well as projected future climate change variation in economic demands is captured through variation in economic rents to crop production as well as inclusion of bioenergy scenarios that increase the value of sugarcane production our alternative irrigation scenarios then allow us to simulate the potential benefits that irrigation expansion could provide to agricultural producers in the region with expansion possibilities ranging from inclusive of all crops to restricted irrigation expansion to industrial production of sugarcane only or to crop production in economically vulnerable regions details of the irrigation scenarios bioenergy scenarios crop revenue scenarios and climate scenarios are presented in table 3 3 results our results indicate that in the pacific slope of guatemala there is substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in water availability during the dry season there are still modest flows downstream of the major river basins however smaller tributaries receive very little rainfall and are potentially dry most precipitation derived water generation in the pacific slope occurs close to the coast and in the central portion of the study region further the greatest levels of water generation occur where most cash crops are grown sugarcane oil palm and banana fig 5 shows average monthly routed flow by node accumulated inflows without withdrawals over the simulated time series for both the dry season november through april and wet season may through october dry season water availability is consistently low throughout most nodes in the pacific slope with some accumulated water availability in the downstream portion of each watershed though there have been excessive drought events where downstream flows have run dry for brief periods causing local water conflict 4 4 recent examples of severe drought conditions in the region include the drying of madre vieja river in 2015 and 2016 which was due to an extended el niño event gobernación de

análisis de la sequía en la costa sur de guatemala en 2016 desfaío social el aqua red nacional de formación e investigación ambiental guatelama water availability in the pacific slope increases overall during the wet season with a substantial increase in the highlands for the central and southwestern portions of our study region this figure helps illustrate both the seasonal differences in water availability and the spatial distribution of where water availability is proportionately higher across the pacific slope we find that across all modeled years the average surface water availability in the study region is 3 29 billion m3 in the dry season and 5 43 billion m3 in the wet season 3 1 baseline crop area table 4 presents simulated crop area by crop type for the median water availability year under current irrigation practices in the pacific slope henceforth referred to as the baseline simulated rainfed and irrigated area does not vary significantly between the with and without bioenergy formulation with minor differences in the distribution of sugarcane and oil palm production this baseline represents irrigation on approximately 4 of total crop production area slightly lower than observed irrigation trends because we are only accounting for irrigation water supplied by surface water and roughly 12 of sugarcane grown in the region 3 2 simulated difference in the value of agricultural production from baseline we use our baseline crop production trends as a starting point to evaluate whether the pacific slope system has adequate water to expand irrigation to assess the economic value that water provides under different assumptions of crop eligibility bioenergy support policies crop revenue and climate we calculate the simulated difference in agricultural benefits from our different scenarios relative to our baseline specifically we quantify the additional economic benefits or intensive extensive margin irrigation expansion relative to the current irrigation practice baseline for each scenario we are comparing agricultural benefits relative to the baseline irrigation formulation with all other scenario assumptions e g holding with without bioenergy climate year and crop revenue assumptions constant between the baseline and counter factual scenarios 3 2 1 difference in agricultural benefits fig 6 displays a percentage change range for the calculated difference in benefits from agricultural production across our scenarios relative to the baseline limited irrigation formulation several important results emerge from these calculations simulated irrigation under current limited crops irrigation provides additional net benefits of 4 0 7 4 relative to a fully rainfed system in the pacific slope region while only requiring 12 of the agricultural land base this effect is slightly truncated when bioenergy revenues are included approximately 4 2 6 7 reduction in benefits second we find that intensive margin expansion or expanding the range of crops that can be irrigated within the currently irrigated area increases net benefits from 3 4 5 4 without bioenergy and 2 1 3 5 with bioenergy in general this result suggests that intensive margin expansion in irrigation and allowing crop substitution can increase net benefits to the system further this result suggests that there is sufficient water available in the dry season to support irrigated crop diversification in the region the smaller increase in net benefits with bioenergy is reflective of higher opportunity costs of shifting irrigation supplies away from irrigated sugarcane third shifts at the extensive margin further increases benefits however restricted expansion has a minimal effect and only slightly increases benefits beyond the all crops current area scenario for example additional benefits from the vulnerable expansion scenarios range 3 9 6 5 without bioenergy and 2 5 4 4 with bioenergy while restricting expansion to sugarcane systems increases net benefits5 3 9 0 and 4 4 7 6 relative to current irrigation with bioenergy respectively since crop switching is also allowed for our expansion scenarios this suggests that targeting irrigation investments in areas with vulnerable populations or in high productivity sugarcane systems may not change benefits much beyond a policy that targets irrigation diversification allowing expansion in all nodes and for all crops results in a significant change in net benefits ranging 9 6 18 4 without bioenergy and 7 3 13 8 with bioenergy relative to current irrigation suggesting that there are opportunities to realize economic benefits from both crop diversification and shifting the spatial distribution of irrigation patterns finally the bottom panel of fig 6 shows changes in net benefits from different scenarios with climate change relative to the no climate change baseline with limited irrigation this figure shows that under current irrigation practices limited crops climate change could result in increased economic benefits from crop production in the pacific slope with improvements ranging 1 2 2 1 relative to current climate conditions these increases are driven by a shift in the spatial and temporal distribution of water across the region resulting in increased baseline yields and in some nodes reduced demand for irrigation under the climate change scenario average minimum and maximum temperatures increase resulting in larger quantities of water needed to hit irrigation targets however from we find that the projected increases in precipitation outweigh the losses through increase evapotranspiration additionally a flexible scenario that allows for both intensive and extensive margin adjustments all crops expanded area can increase net benefits under climate change relative to a current baseline thus spatial reallocation of irrigation patterns plus crop switching could be an important adaptation mechanism to climate change in the region however these findings do not recognize the potential impact that increased temperature or flooding could have on reducing the suitability of key crops in the southern slope region of guatemala as shown by hannah et al 2017 3 3 simulated difference in water consumption from baseline in addition to changes in the distribution of economic benefits from agricultural production we quantify changes in irrigation water consumption across our scenarios first table 5 displays changes in water consumption across the pacific slope for our alternative irrigation scenarios median water availability year and table 6 presents changes in water consumption under the bioenergy scenarios total water consumption for irrigation actually declines under the all crops current area scenario indicating potential efficiency gains within the system from crop switching and intensive margin adjustments for the most part total irrigation water consumed increases substantially under the targeted expansion scenarios relative to the baseline scenario 4 1 39 0 even though this expansion is spatially limited within the region the vulnerable expansion scenario shows much less expansion in irrigation water use but results in similar levels of additional value than the sugarcane expansion scenarios this is due to limited water availability in vulnerable nodes the all crops expanded area scenario results in a doubling of irrigation water consumption across the select scenarios 3 3 1 difference in the spatial distribution of water consumption from baseline fig 7 shows the simulated change in the spatial allocation of water consumption across the pacific slope when we allow intensive and extensive margin expansion in irrigation this generally results in reduced irrigation in the central portion of the study region under vulnerable expansion we see the northern most nodes irrigated to near max capacity but this still leaves some water available for downstream expansion in irrigation under the full expansion scenario we see more extensive expansion occurring in the eastern most nodes of the region these areas are defined mostly by subsistence level rainfed agricultural practices and thus the lowest current amount of irrigation infrastructure however our results indicate that there are substantial opportunities to generate increased crop revenues through expanded irrigation access in these nodes the full expansion scenario also illustrates that the system is not currently water constrained though a redistribution of support for irrigation infrastructure in less productive nodes may be required to realize system wide benefit improvements under climate change however figure 11 in appendix supplemental figures and tables the spatial distribution of irrigation changes substantially as water availability shifts across the region generally we see less irrigation expansion to the southeastern portion of the study region under the a1b scenario due to lower water demand less irrigation is needed throughout the pacific slope under climate change including the highlands to support crop growth despite increased temperatures which contributes to the spatial reallocation of water consumption 3 4 simulated difference in crop production from baseline simulated differences in water consumption correspond to changes in crop mix strategies across our simulation scenarios while the spatial distribution of crop production is relatively consistent across scenarios targeted irrigation expansion scenarios result in subtle but important shifts in crop production strategies in the pacific slope 3 4 1 differences in crop production from baseline across the different irrigation expansion scenarios we find shifts away from oil palm coffee rubber and to a lesser extent sugarcane production to accommodate increased production of beans and vegetables table 7 and table 8 this result is consistent with the spatial distribution of production changes in which agricultural output decreases reduced production of rubber is driven by relatively low profits in our study region while oil palm production competes with other high valued crops like sugarcane and vegetables reduced output from sugarcane production reflects less irrigation water supply for sugarcane systems which is consistent across most of our scenarios while this percentage is small a marginal change in irrigated sugarcane area frees up a substantial amount of water for less irrigation intensive crops like beans figure 13 in the appendix shows the spatial distribution of crop production in the region under different irrigation scenarios without climate change notably changes in sugarcane production are robust across the with and without bioenergy formulations thus even when sugarcane has higher profitability with bioenergy we still see economic opportunities to reallocate water to other nodes and cropping systems figure 14 in appendix supplemental figures and tables provides a full range of production differences for different crop groups across our irrigation scenarios sugarcane and corn show the greatest sensitivity in production differences to the different scenario formulations from a food security standpoint our results show clear expansion opportunities in food crops across most scenarios with expansion in bean and vegetable production in most irrigation expansion scenarios analyzed thus expanding irrigation access may provide dual benefits of increasing rural incomes and improving food security in the region however vulnerable areas align with areas facing water scarcity so prioritizing these areas for surface water irrigation expansion may not provide large additional benefits to the system if irrigation projects in these nodes are to be sourced from already stressed surface water resources alternative policies or investments supporting groundwater access or small scale water storage infrastructure could complement efforts to expand agricultural productivity and enhance food security in this region 3 4 2 crop production with climate change crop production changes under climate change show similar trends overall though with much larger expansion of bean production and a larger contraction of sugarcane production caused by spatial differences in water availability table 9 the impact of climate change on sugarcane production is notable given the importance of sugarcane as an export crop such a shift could require additional adaptation responses to minimize economic impacts of climate change 3 4 3 difference in the spatial distribution of crop production benefits from baseline fig 8 quantifies the net change in agricultural value that corresponds with the spatial patterns of production and irrigation changes losses from the no irrigation scenario are mostly concentrated in intensively cultivated sugarcane production regions across all irrigation expansion scenarios the patterns are similar in terms of where benefits are realized but the magnitude of this change grows as irrigation access increases under climate change fig 9 the spatial pattern of additional benefits shifts towards the western portion of the study region projected changes to precipitation under climate change include increased rainfall events in the western portion of the pacific slope which outweighs the impacts of increased temperature resulting in net gains in agriculture output thus policymakers interested in expanding irrigation access may find that there is little difference in net economic gains between helping the most vulnerable population and the sugarcane industry under current climate conditions but the narrative may shift under the influence of climate change for resiliency planning policymakers should consider long term climate impacts when prioritizing irrigation investments or implementing new resource management strategies in general our results show that a limited spatial redistribution of water resources under a free irrigation expansion scenario with or without climate change can result in net benefit changes thus irrigation expansion at the intensive and extensive margins could be an important adaptation mechanism to enhance agricultural productivity in the pacific slope under socioeconomic and environmental change 3 5 simulated energy generation from hydroelectric facilities overall we find little difference in annual generation from hydropower facilities across irrigation expansion bioenergy or crop revenue scenarios however we do see increases in electricity generation under climate change conditions this is driven by the increase in precipitation which generates higher rates of monthly flow across the region overall we find that generation increases by about 40 under climate change with an annual generation of 1512 to 1860 mw in the expanded irrigation scenario across alternative water availability and crop profit scenarios and an annual generation of 2194 to 2701 mw across these same scenarios under climate change see fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 key study findings our results indicate that total water availability may not be a limiting resource in the region under current agricultural production and household consumption demands which is counter to recent experience in the region and challenges however this result assumes efficiency improvements in the spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation and household water supplies that is our modeling framework assumes agronomic irrigation rates to hit specific yield thresholds and homogenous distribution efficiency factors for irrigation and household water supplies given a lack of reliable data on distribution efficiency the reality may be more complicated and prolonged drought during the dry season can result in water shortages where historically sugarcane irrigation has been prioritized over other uses across most of our scenario simulations we find that household demands are met and that there are opportunities to expand irrigation for crops that are currently irrigated and for those that are not under the most inclusive expansion scenario we see that water consumption by the agriculture sector almost doubles in the medium revenue scenario relative to the baseline without climate change thus expanding irrigation as a development objective or to adapt to changing climate conditions is currently limited by infrastructure capacity strategic investments in irrigation access could provide system wide benefits and may ameliorate economic challenges faced by smallholder farmers in the region irrigation expansion has the potential to increase economic benefits between 2 1 and 18 4 relative to our business as usual scenario without climate change and up to 24 8 with climate change our results illustrate how alternative crop management strategies and moderate levels of spatial re allocation of production decisions to accommodate irrigation expansion can improve economic outcomes in particular expanding irrigation access to areas with limited irrigation infrastructure and less productive systems can provide greater marginal benefits than increasing irrigation intensity in industrial agricultural systems e g sugarcane however our current approach does not recognize spatially explicit infrastructure expansion cost when examining the value of irrigation water by crops results suggest that there is potential to realize large marginal increases in consumption value for crops that historically have not been irrigated including corn beans and vegetables which require a relatively small amount of water required to reach higher yields and hence profits relative to water intensive crops such as sugarcane this result implies that even a slight reallocation of surface water supplies away from intensively cultivated industrial crops in the region to increase irrigation access for smallholder farmers could result in additional system wide benefits relative to the status quo importantly we show that benefits to irrigation expansion are lower under climate change than under observed climate conditions unless full irrigation expansion is allowed this reduction is being driven by increased demand for irrigation water due to rising temperatures and increased variability in rainfall this illustrates the need to couple irrigation expansion with other adaptation solutions that can improve resilience and productivity of farms e g access to nutrients energy and water storage infrastructure it is also important to note that our simulated irrigation expansion possibilities potentially represent a lower bound in the region because we do not capture water storage potential or the transportation of water across basins if large scale storage or inter basin transfer projections are considered benefits from expansion will be likely larger due to current spatial and temporal mismatches in water supply and demand this storyline is robust to our bioenergy and climate change scenarios as well under climate change water availability and sugarcane production in the pacific slope declines relative to current climate conditions though there is sufficient water to expand irrigation inland thus our results provide important context on the economic value of irrigation water in our study region and the benefits of expanding irrigation access that can be used in cost benefit analysis or to inform policy design 4 2 future research directions we acknowledge several limitations in our analytical framework that provide direction for future research and analysis first we do not capture spatial heterogeneity in crop production costs or producer prices given a lack of spatially explicit information future surveys targeting agricultural producers could gain insight into crop production cost and producer price heterogeneity across the region which would offer greater insight into spatial hotspots for irrigation expansion investments second consistent with other hydro economic frameworks based on a monthly time step our model overestimates the impacts of monthly variation in water availability by not capturing day to day differences in precipitation thus we may not capture the implications of large precipitation events or sub daily water supply anomalies in the system that have implications for downstream water availability further if crop specific water demands cannot be met during any monthly time step it is deemed that it is not possible to realize gains from irrigation thus our estimates may underestimate the potential gains from expanded irrigation access third the analysis in its present form does not allow for irrigation involving water transfers between nodes other than through the existing upstream to downstream surface water network or between months i e through water storage infrastructure in other words water availability for irrigation is restricted to concurrent same month instream flows in the same node this feature is not expected to be a significant limitation for analyzing smallholder agriculture and small scale irrigation projects however it is likely to understate potential benefits for larger operations that can afford transfer and storage infrastructure additional analysis of specific water storage or transfer infrastructure options is needed in the pacific slope to assess whether these options are economically viable and improve the resilience of the agricultural system finally our analysis does not account for the costs of irrigation expansion and how these costs would compare to the irrigation benefit estimates derived in our study the research on irrigation expansion costs is limited and the capital costs of irrigation projects are typically evaluated on a site by site basis therefore our current focus is on the potential benefits of expanded irrigation which leaves the issue of potential net benefits for future research nonetheless our analysis represents a first of its kind effort to evaluate irrigation expansion possibilities in a region of guatemala that faces a multitude of development challenges resource constraints and limited food energy and water sector infrastructure and coordinated management our results present evidence that water scarcity or variability in surface water supply may not be the limiting factor to expanding irrigated agricultural systems as we see a doubling of irrigation water consumption when irrigation expansion intensive and extensive margin is allowed thus under current climate conditions existing irrigation infrastructure is likely the limiting factor in this study region not water availability our results provide appropriate evidence of spatial and crop system hotspots that would potentially provide the greatest marginal additional benefits to the system under both recently observed and projected future climate conditions we show that spatial reallocation of production and irrigation management may be an important adaptation response to future climate change 5 conclusions our analysis applies a spatially detailed hydro economic model of the pacific slope region in guatemala to assess irrigation expansion potential across a wide range of scenarios our framework captures important spatial and temporal dependencies in water resource supply and demand across the agricultural and municipal sectors we developed a unique scenario design to evaluate the economic value of water used in irrigation in the study region and to assess potential economic benefits from alternative irrigation expansion scenarios our study provides new insights into agricultural expansion possibilities in the region expanding on recent studies that did not consider management adaptation responses to climate change castellanos et al 2018 or that did not consider spatiotemporal resource constraints banerjee et al 2019 we find that the region currently has sufficient water to support expanded irrigation from surface water resources while meeting municipal water demands for all months and scenario combinations across our scenarios we identify potential efficiency gains from crop switching and intensive margin expansion as well as from shifting the spatial distribution of irrigation patterns intensification leads to larger relative benefit changes than targeted expansion in vulnerable spatial nodes and sugarcane irrigation expansion the increased value of agricultural production from focused effort on expanding irrigation access to most vulnerable population creates about the same gains as extensive expansion of industrial agricultural crops like sugar however unlimited irrigation expansion leads to a slight reallocation of irrigation supplies away from sugarcane to less intensively managed systems such as corn bean and vegetable that are not traditionally irrigated in the region thus the marginal value of increasing irrigation access for less water intensive low input systems provides greater system wide benefits than marginal additions of water to sugarcane and oil palm production re allocating irrigation water to different cropping systems and spatial locations is a challenge that would require both infrastructure investments and changes to existing management institutions that have historically prioritized water for highly profitable industrial crops like sugar cane and oil palm institutional changes that offer greater system wide benefits may require additional sources of compensation for industrial producers that relinquish a small share of their existing water allocation climate and socioeconomic change in the region in addition to other policies supporting energy and industrial sector development may constrain water resources in the future analyses that capture connections and tradeoffs across the food energy and water nexus will be critical for improving development outcomes in guatemala our results suggest that policy makers and industrial stakeholders may need to adapt spatial cropping patterns to respond to emerging water constraints under climate change additionally our results indicate that complementary investments in groundwater irrigation and water storage may be needed to support continued growth in agricultural production in the pacific slope under a changing climate funding this work was supported by

9527,climate change growing populations and increasing wealth are increasing demand for food energy and water additionally water stress is expected to increase in the future in areas with high rates of seasonality of precipitation due to increased variability in precipitation one approach to limiting the impact of climate change on food system productions is through the intensive and extensive expansion of irrigated agriculture this study develops a hydro economic model to assess future agriculture production possibilities and the role of irrigation water in the pacific slope region of guatemala one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country a range of future scenarios are presented to account for uncertainty around irrigation infrastructure expansion future crop prices incentives for production of biomass for bioenergy and water availability and irrigation demand due to climate change we find that current surface water irrigation infrastructure increases agricultural output by value in the region by about 5 3 compared to a fully rainfed system additionally we show that with expanded irrigation infrastructure agricultural output could increase by between 3 4 and 18 4 relative to current levels under current climate conditions but the value of agricultural production could increase under climate change with projected output from current and expanded irrigation infrastructure resulting in an increase of 1 2 24 8 relative to current irrigation levels we also present evidence that the marginal benefit from increased irrigation access to smallholder farmers is nearly equal to that received by large scale industrial agricultural producers keywords irrigation expansion hydro economics surface water allocation 1 introduction 1 1 a spatial temporal mismatch in water demand and supply demand for food energy and freshwater rises as global population grows and urbanizes mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 zhao et al 2019 recently demand for water has been growing at twice the population growth rate fao 2010 mainly due to irrigation expansion and food security concerns vörösmarty et al 2000 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 stress that while water supply is often sufficient to meet these demands spatial and temporal heterogeneity can result in mismatches in water supply and demand leading to water scarcity and diminished economic opportunity in certain areas climate change is expected to increase the variance in precipitation across the globe dore 2005 this could exacerbate the mismatch in timing or spatial allocation of supply and demand in certain regions with existing development challenges including latin america by shifting the temporal distribution of water availability between dry and wet seasons and in some cases reducing aggregate water availability below historical amounts imbach et al 2018 wwap 2012 in many contexts availability and demand for water in agricultural systems could be more severely affected than in other sectors due to increased demand for irrigation water from warmer and drier conditions wang et al 2016 for example water availability in guatemala has declined by about 2 7 between 1950 and 2006 while irrigation demand has increased over that time period vargas et al 2018 water access and agriculture the agricultural sector is the largest global demand source for freshwater supplies ritchie and roser 2017 though access to water for irrigation remains a limiting factor for agricultural systems in many regions domènech 2015 irrigation access is increasingly constrained by a changing climate and competing demands in other sectors though institutional forces also limit irrigation expansion possibilities in some regions agricultural water is inefficiently managed or is only allocated to select users limiting access to other producer groups that must rely on rainfed systems or capital intensive groundwater extraction for irrigation further as water access for agricultural and household consumption has traditionally been viewed as a human right governmental policies have aimed at providing water access at the lowest possible cost which can result in inefficient consumption patterns across different water use sectors convery 2013 grafton et al 2020 scott and shah 2004 argue that subsidies to the agriculture sector aimed at increasing irrigation access can also intensify water allocation concerns however while increasing irrigation access faces institutional challenges that can be exacerbated by certain policy incentives irrigation expansion may be a necessary tool for closing global agricultural yield gaps and increasing food security rosa et al 2018 mahlknecht et al 2020 found that water use in agricultural production accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals in latin america future irrigation expansion will continue to compete with other economic and development priorities in the region that also rely on freshwater sources including industrial manufacturing and energy generation mahlknecht et al 2020 de oliveira et al 2009 discuss the rise of irrigated agriculture in latin america pointing out that as demand in other sectors continues to encroach on available water supplies for agriculture producers will need to improve their water management strategies however wu et al 2018 suggests that latin america is the region with the greatest potential to increase its cropping intensity level including through irrigation regardless of whether irrigation expansion is supported by subsidies or publicly financed capital projects direct and indirect costs of these policies or investments must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits they would provide to rural communities further investment needs and management interventions to ensure sustainable irrigation practices are context specific and could vary region to region palazzo et al 2019 for example irrigation induced yield growth can benefit both rural communities and the environment in some contexts by boosting agricultural incomes while relaxing pressure for land at the extensive margin ceddia 2019 irrigation expansion and the food energy water nexus socioeconomic pressures environmental change and land conservation policies for climate and biodiversity goals may continue to push intensification in agricultural production and irrigation in latin america and such expansion will need to be weighed relative to broader development objectives in the food energy water nexus improving agricultural productivity through irrigation expansion can support livelihoods and economic growth although challenges and uncertainties remain bhattarai and narayanamoorthy 2003 cook et al 2009 de fraiture et al 2010 including whether irrigation expansion will conflict with growing demands for water from households industry and the energy sector thus it is critical to identify opportunities where irrigation expansion can improve local economic outcomes while limiting food energy water nexus and associated environmental impacts irrigation expansion can contribute to food energy water nexus by bolstering local food supplies and food security objectives and by supporting production of agricultural feed stocks used in bioenergy systems but could limit system capacity to meet growing water demands in other sectors given existing and expected future resource constraints it is important to evaluate the extent to which expanding irrigation access or other adaptation mechanisms e g crop switching or spatial re allocation of agricultural land use can increase economic benefits as a basis for cost benefit analysis of irrigation projects 1 2 guatemala as a unique study development challenges in guatemala guatemala currently faces a wide range of development challenges in the food energy water nexus kondash et al 2021 that will drive resource competition in the coming decades and could require new management strategies and infrastructure investments such challenges will require analysis that captures spatial and temporal interactions between policy induced changes in resource consumption and socioeconomic outcomes for example climate change mitigation and renewable energy commitments could drive the demand for land and water as the country seeks to expand its renewable electricity generation portfolio henry et al 2021 and liquid biofuel production gleds 2018 and such investments could encroach on agricultural lands thus requiring greater intensification of agricultural production to achieve food security goals agriculture in guatemala the agriculture sector in guatemala accounts for approximately 12 of gdp fao 2013 and over 35 of total land was dedicated to agricultural in 2018 bank 2021 additionally the agriculture sector employees approximately 40 of the labor force within guatemala fao 2013 smallholder farmers households owning less than 4 ha ha of farmland control over 50 of arable land with 45 of all holdings being smaller than 0 7 ha fao 2014 despite smallholder farmers controlling a large proportion of total agricultural land over 65 of irrigated area is dedicated to major exportation crops such as sugarcane and banana fao 2013 guatemala has seen an expansion of irrigation water demand being driven by exported crops such as sugarcane rubber and oil palm other crops that are culturally and economically important e g coffee and staple crops that support local food security e g corn beans and vegetables are typically not irrigated because they are grown by smallholder farmers with limited access to capital and financing for irrigation infrastructure for producers of these crops obstacles to irrigation include a lack of access to irrigation infrastructure water distribution and storage limited surface water rights and a lack of access to credit technical assistance and market value chains maga 2012 the inequality of access and prioritization of resource allocation to sugarcane and oil palm has led to civil unrest over land and water rights between indigenous populations and industrial agricultural producers pietilainen and otero 2019 kooijmans 2021 water in guatemala the availability of water per capita in guatemala varies depending on the basin and is relatively high compared to other countries water availability is estimated to be about 6000 m3 per person per year in the caribbean slope about 6250 m3 per person per year for the pacific and almost 10 000 m3 per person per year for the gulf of mexico basterrechea 2019 however this availability is not stable during the year given the seasonality in the annual cycle of precipitation cepal 2018 importantly while the pacific slope has less water availability than the caribbean slope it has the largest population industrial base agricultural activities and the least forest coverage according to the projections made by cepal reductions of water availability of up to 59 are expected by the end of the century thus per capita water availability would drop to a range of 2000 5000 m3 per year due to population and economic growth cepal 2010 2015 another serious problem related to water resources and the impact of climate change is the increase in sea levels and the potential salinization of surface and underground water bodies according to cepal 2018 salinity levels have increased notably specifically in the aquifers of the pacific basin increasing the vulnerability to water stress of many people and their livelihoods in addition to the increase in demand and climate change water resources present an additional vulnerability due to the difficulty of its management given its spatial and temporal dynamics as well as the weak institutional and political framework present in the country 1 3 study objectives the goal of this study is to assess the impact of different management strategies on future agricultural land use and irrigation management under various climate change scenarios increasing agricultural sector resilience to climate change is a key development objective in central america because it supports the rural economy and livelihoods increasing irrigation access particularly for smallholder farmers is one potential adaptation strategy to climate and socioeconomic change in this study we conduct a first of its kind hydro economic assessment of crop irrigation expansion possibilities in the pacific slope region of guatemala which is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country we develop and apply a hydro economic optimization model that captures variation in the spatiotemporal distribution of water supply and demand across sectors in the region under observed and future conditions with climate change we apply this hydro economic model to assess agricultural land use and irrigation strategies under alternative crop expansion scenarios where we restrict and expand access to irrigation by crop groups our scenario design captures variation in observed climate and water availability projected future climate change and relative returns to agriculture to reflect energy sector connections to food production and water supply systems we also assess irrigation expansion possibilities with and without bioenergy systems overall we examine agricultural land and irrigation management under a wide range of plausible water availability climate and socioeconomic scenarios previous assessments while the literature around irrigation water management and the food energy water nexus has developed rapidly in latin america there are notable gaps site or country specific analyses of irrigation expansion potential in latin america often focus on specific crop groups or irrigation technologies e g merlos et al 2015 oumarou abdoulaye et al 2019 vos and marshall 2017 hernandez cuello et al 2019 however these biophysical and techno economic assessments may not capture important economic trade offs associated with irrigation expansion meanwhile applied integrated assessment modeling arango aramburo et al 2019 santos da silva et al 2019 assesses high level tradeoffs between irrigation and other development objectives particularly in the energy sector while such approaches reflect resource constraints and economic opportunity costs they may not capture nuanced details related to watershed hydrology infrastructure or supply and demand systems of water other hydro economic techniques baker et al 2021 kondash et al 2021 capture more detail on spatiotemporal dynamics between socioeconomic and resource systems at local scale but typically do not capture broader market implications of management changes or new infrastructure additionally most analyses have focused on middle income countries such as brazil argentina chile and mexico due in part to availability of data analytics and modeling efforts in countries in less developed countries including guatemala are limited one notable example banerjee et al 2019 applies an integrated environmental economic platform with detailed social accounting data to assess tradeoffs between sustainable development goals in guatemala while detailed the framework used in this study lacks the spatial and temporal resolution needed to assess tradeoffs between irrigation management and policy scenarios our study makes several contributions to the literature first this is the first attempt that we are aware of to systematically evaluate agricultural water resource management production possibilities and potential benefits of irrigation in guatemala using hydro economic modeling techniques we develop an integrated hydro economic modeling framework for the pacific slope region to assess the value of irrigation water and to quantify the potential economic benefits that could be derived from irrigation expansion and alternative water allocation schemes our scenario design reflects current institutional allocations and policy goals relevant to the food energy water nexus in the country including improving agricultural productivity for food crops supporting bioenergy production from agricultural byproducts and meeting household water demands while capturing sources of uncertainty we show that even marginal reallocations of irrigation water away from industrial crop production systems near the coast to smaller scale food crop producers in the interior portions of the pacific slope can yield system wide benefits and this result is robust to projected climate changes our analysis and modeling framework can inform future assessment of policy design cost benefit analysis of specific irrigation projects or opportunities to improve development outcomes through coordinated management of the food energy and water nexus 2 methods this study links spatial analytics hydrologic modeling and economic systems modeling in a novel way to conduct the hydro economic assessment of agricultural water use in the pacific slope of guatemala our hydro economic approach simulates the potential benefits of irrigation expansion while recognizing tradeoffs and resource constraints that vary spatially and temporally each of the system components is described in detail in the following sections 2 1 study region our study region focuses on the pacific slope portion of guatemala or the southwestern portion of the country which accounts for 22 of the country s land area and drains to the pacific ocean this region is an important economic driver as most exported crops grown in the country are produced there further the pacific slope captures a diverse range of land use forestry agriculture urban and others and watersheds that begin in the highlands and flow into the pacific ocean shown in fig 1 industrial agricultural production including sugarcane and oil palm is mostly confined to the central and coastal portion of the study region these operations maintain a large allocation of available surface water in the region subsistence annual crops such as corn and beans are scattered throughout the study region including the southern and eastern portions coffee and rubber production is confined mostly to highlands region further inland from most sugarcane production 2 2 hydrologic simulation framework a network or node based hydro economic optimization model was developed to project the impact of a range of climate and hydrologic conditions on the irrigation implementation and production of major crop commodities these types of models represent and fully integrate natural hydrologic systems and human and economic systems and have been used for water resource valuation and policy analysis bekchanov et al 2017 harou et al 2009 this modeling framework accounts for spatial and temporal variation in surface water availability irrigation and household demand for water and river outflows to the ocean the model is setup to maximize the value of agriculture production by endogenously selecting where and what crops to irrigate subject to resource availability constraints these constraints include minimum surface water outflow and a baseline level of household demand that must be met prior to water being allocated to irrigation the hydrologic assessment framework relies on the modeling tool hydro bid developed by the inter american development bank idb and rti international hydro bid is a modeling system that includes hydrology and climate analysis modules to estimate water availability surface water volumes and fluxes at the regional basin and subbasin scales moreda et al 2014 the system is built on a hydrographic network derived for the study area with watersheds divided into sub watershed catchments the model uses the network topology and underlying gridded datasets of climate land cover and soil properties to estimate streamflow at a daily timestep based on the gwlf modeling framework haith et al 1992 haith 1985 we divide the pacific slope region into 10 separate river basin watersheds each draining to the pacific ocean and one endorheic basin that drains only to lake atitlan in the central highlands these 10 watersheds are further subdivided into a total of 1004 networked catchments with an average size of 25 square kilometers for completeness the hydrologic model includes the portions of the eastern and western most river basins that overlap into el salvador and mexico see fig 1 however the economic model focuses strictly on water and land use decisions in guatemala inputs to the hydrology model were developed from remotely sensed datasets gridded daily time series of precipitation and temperature from the nasa power global database were used for climate forcing sparks 2018 the remotely sensed data was compared against observations from ground based meteorological stations in the study area to quantify error based on our findings we derived monthly correction factors to reduce error in rainfall timing and magnitude these factors were then applied to the entire remotely sensed dataset to better match local conditions land use was based on the usgs global land cover classification dataset loveland et al 2000 whereas soil properties including hydrologic soil group and available water capacity were derived from the fao world harmonized soil database nachtergaele et al 2010 2 3 hydro economic optimization model hydro bid simulation output provides pristine i e absent human alteration inflow data within each model catchment henceforth referred to as node the general node schematic node names and mapping between nodes as well as all hydrologic simulation data serve as inputs to the optimization routine which makes water allocation decisions at each node and time step including water diverted to homes for agricultural irrigation used in the production of electricity through hydropower dams or downstream we estimate monthly crop water demands that vary spatially by crop and by a range of irrigation intensities and crop profit functions which vary depending on level of irrigation inputs climate condition and crop type next we built an underlying economic database defined by the hydrologic nodes that include crop production possibilities location of hydropower facilities and households based on spatially and demographically delineated populations allpress 2018 the economic model aggregates the daily time step estimates from the hydrology model to a monthly time step fig 2 presents a schematic of both hydro bid and the hydro economic modeling framework 2 3 1 hydrologic flow consistent with all hydro economic models our framework captures hydrologic continuity to maintain mass balance of water flow and consumption through the surface water system see baker et al 2021 for additional discussion eq 1 defines hydrologic continuity of the system for each node i and month t 1 1 for our study region we assume no storage as all large scale hydropower reservoirs

in guatemala is rain fed a significant portion of the productive land area in the pacific slope is irrigated due to the relatively high proportion of industrial farming operations to produce cash crops in this area to reflect agricultural demands for water in the study area an agriculture sector component was developed and calibrated to local agricultural production data the model optimizes agricultural profits from irrigated and rainfed systems with crop production possibilities that include rainfed low medium and high irrigation intensity options for crops that are allowed to be irrigated 2 3 3 crop profit functions agricultural production possibilities are represented for the following eight primary crops coffee sugarcane beans corn banana palm rubber and a vegetable proxy crop group we disaggregate the pacific slope into 1004 individual nodes which include areas within 14 departments and 206 municipalities fig 1 we compiled information on agricultural production harvested area crop value and yield for the pacific slope of guatemala this includes spatial mapping of land use and crop planting locations collected by the ministry of agriculture maga 2014 mapped to each node fig 1 in total about 1 2 million hectares of agricultural land are modeled in this analysis corn and beans are traditionally double cropped on the same land and covers the largest amount of area in the pacific slope about 364 kha sugarcane and coffee are the second and third most produced crops by area about 347 and 311 kha respectively while the rest of the modeled crops cover less than 100 kha each 75 for rubber 42 for both banana and vegetables and 33 for palm historical yields for each of these commodities was collected from fao from 2000 to 2016 fao 2021 after identifying the most prevalent crops in the study region we acquired production cost information for each crop from the bank of guatemala 2014 including historical rental rates of land crop establishment costs labor rates machinery and equipment depreciation and input costs additionally labor and equipment for irrigation is included so we can account for heterogeneity in cost associated with irrigated crop production several departments were missing crop production costs so each observation for each crop was averaged to estimate a representative regional production cost wholesale crop prices for vegetables corn and beans were collected from the la terminal market in guatemala city from 2006 to 2015 and averaged across this time frame maga 2018a 2018b 2018c producer prices collected from fao for central america were used to estimate the prices farmers received for coffee palm rubber sugarcane and banana fao 2021 prices for each crop were averaged using annual producer prices from 2006 to 2015 agricultural sector economic benefits are described by node specific profit functions in the following equation 4 a g b e n e f i t s i j b a s e a r e a i j k e x p a r e a i j k y i e l d j k p

jk production costs for crop j and irrigation status kl p mt w ag the assumed price for water for each node m and time period t of 1 guatemalan quetzal m3 roughly 0 13 m3 which is consistent with water tariffs paid by agricultural irrigators in guatemala future development of this model could benefit from local water price information for the agriculture sector the model also introduces constraints to limit total land area allocated to specific crop activities one concern with optimization models is that they can lead to corner solutions in which an activity with a high marginal net benefit is pursued at an unreasonable level e g a single crop dominating production in a region with a diverse crop mix to limit this effect we introduce node level crop area minimum and maximum constraints to ensure that production of any given crop lies within the observed minimum and maximum area devoted to that crop 80 and 120 of current crop area respectively as reported in our crop area maps these constraints are more formally represented in the following equation 5 mincropare a ij k baseare a ijk expare a ijk maxcropare a ij where the parameters mincropare a ij and maxcropare a ij represent the minimum and maximum parameters furthermore base irrigated area is restricted to be no more than the amount of area suitable or equipped for surface water irrigation we use fao global maps of irrigation areas to restrict irrigated areas for scenarios in which irrigation expansion is not allowed faures et al 2001 this constraint places an upper bound on baseare a ijk low and high irrigation only for each node by spatially weighting the total area equipped for surface water irrigation from each municipality in our study region 6 j k baseare a ijk fao irrigatedarea k dryland finally an upper bound on total crop area is imposed for each municipality equal to the maximum crop area total observed in the crop area layer this constraint imposes a realistic upper bound on total cropped area rain fed and irrigated based on existing production data an alternative model formulation relaxes the irrigated area constraint allowing extensive margin expansion at each node such that all crop area except for coffee can be irrigated 7 j k baseare a ijk expare a ijk maxcropare a i to develop irrigation response functions we apply a standard fao methodology to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration and then use this framework to estimate yields for different levels of irrigation intensity reference crop evapotranspiration et o is estimated using the hargreaves et o equation 8 eto 0 0023 tmean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where t mean t max and t min are daily mean maximum and minimum temperature which were developed from climate and daily solar radiation r a from the nasa atmospheric science data center power larc nasa gov using crop specific coefficients we then calculate a monthly crop water requirement crop evapotranspiration et c by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient k c 9 e t c k c e t 0 k c is the crop coefficient that varies by crop type climate soil evaporation and crop growth stages using data from allen et al 1998 the crop growing period is divided into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season we estimate crop water requirements for each of these stages and then develop per hectare irrigation requirements by month for each simulation year this crop water requirement can be supplied by rainfall irrigation or a combination of the two crop yield can reach its highest potential yield y c when the crop water requirement is fully satisfied depending on the actual water applied and effective rainfall actual crop yield y a is calculated by the following equation vaux and pruitt 1983 10 1 y a yc k y 1 eta etc where y a and y c stand for actual yield and maximum yield respectively and k y is the crop yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yield losses k y is drawn from fao irrigation and drainage paper 66 steduto et al 2012 and sigalingging and rahmansyah 2018 for palm and ranges from 1 00 to 1 85 for the seven crops in the pacific slope rubber k y 1 00 is the most water resistant crop followed by vegetables 2 2 vegetables include carrots cabbage and onions 1 025 then bean 1 15 then corn and sugarcane each k y 1 25 then banana k y 1 275 and then palm k y 1 85 et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration which is the sum of effective rainfall and effective irrigation water based on this equation we can estimate how crop yield responds to irrigation for each node we used the nearest remotely sensed datapoint based on the nasa power data power larc nasa gov based on the precipitation we calculate the effective rainfall using eq 10 we estimate yields under three assumed irrigation conditions high irrigation low irrigation and dryland conditions to estimate high irrigation yields we took the highest observed yield for each crop and municipality between 2006 and 2015 and we estimated the additional monthly irrigation water requirements that would be needed to meet that yield target in each simulation year we then use eq 10 to estimate a dryland yield without irrigation for low irrigation yields we assumed it is the average yield between high yield and dryland yield then estimated the additional irrigation required to achieve this lower irrigated yield target similarly we include a medium irrigation schedule that is the average yield between low and high irrigation yields and calculate the additional irrigation required to achieve this target an illustrative example of alternative irrigation and yield possibilities is presented in fig 3 finally to determine the allocation of water at different nodes the following equation is used 11 agwate r ijt j k baseare a ijk θ ijkt expare a ijk θ ijkt δ i i t and m i where θ ijkt the monthly per hectare crop water requirement for node i crop j irrigation system k and time period t computed using the method outlined above δ i distribution efficiency for node i a simple parameter of 60 is assumed which is consistent with the distribution efficiency for connected households it is important to note that although some irrigators rely on groundwater particularly in the pacific slope we are requiring all irrigation to come from surface water resources we take this approach due in part to uncertainty and a lack of data availability regarding irrigation practices and hydrogeologic processes in guatemala further our approach allows us to focus specifically on competition for surface water resources and to address the question of whether sufficient water is available in the region to satisfy both household and agricultural demands 2 3 4 hydro economic model hydropower generation in addition to irrigation use flow through the nodes can be used to generate electricity at existing hydropower facilities within our study region there are 16 existing hydropower facilities for each of these facilities we gathered engineering specifications for each from the guatamala comision comisión nacional de energía eléctrica this includes location of dam average head height generation capacity and average flow through the turbine see supplemental table 10 in the appendix with this information we can estimate the average monthly generation at each facility based on monthly flow rates hydropowe rgeneration i t d η ρ q i t gh where η efficiency of turbine dimensionless ρ density of water 1000 kg m3 q i t average

water demands we developed a synthetic population dataset for guatemala which provides a simplified but high resolution representation of actual household level populations within spatial nodes disaggregated by demographic characteristics allpress 2018 in the modeling framework we use the synthetic population to develop household demand functions for water consumption disaggregating population by connection type and rural urban designation table 1 provides an estimate of total water demand for the study region by population type these parameters are multiplied by populations for each model node using the synthetic population data to estimate monthly household water demand requirements in the study region allpress 2018 we multiply total per capita demand by population type and household within each node and aggregate to the monthly time step for each node and month eq 12 maintains that municipal water withdrawals cannot exceed total household demand 12 municipalwate r it housholddeman d it i t we introduce a penalty in the objective function to ensure that household water demands are as close to being met as physically possible this penalty represents the opportunity cost of satisfying water demands with an alternative source such as bottled water or private wells we assume a high opportunity cost of gtq 9 per m3 eq 13 represents this penalty 13 munpenalty i t housholddeman d it municipalwate r it then we combine household characteristics and estimates of water availability to construct a vulnerability metric in this analysis vulnerability is defined as the characteristics of a community systems or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard unisdr 2009 this definition incorporates two disparate pieces of information the characteristics of a community e g socioeconomic status and exposure to a hazard e g natural disasters information on either one is necessary but insufficient to characterize vulnerability of communities this definition implicitly considers that the communities that are vulnerable to water shortages are not necessarily the same communities that are vulnerable to other hazards e g earthquakes or volcanos to determine relative vulnerability of populations within our hydro economic model spatial nodes we use detailed vulnerability data and indicators e g socioeconomic status from

presents population estimates for each node based on allpress 2018 and monthly mean income estimates also derived from on allpress 2018 the economic model optimizes economic benefits from agricultural and municipal water consumption as defined by eq 14 14 max totalbenefits agbenefits hydropowerbenefits munpenalty to optimize total benefits the model chooses an optimal allocation of water over space nodes time months and across user groups irrigators and households the flow of water through the watershed the allocation of water to end uses and agricultural land use by crop and system are all endogenous variables the optimization model is a linear program lp which is solved in gams using the cplex solver 2 4 scenario design a range of future scenarios were modeled to assess the variability in future commodity prices and crop revenue 3 alternative crop revenue scenarios intensive and extensive expansion of irrigation infrastructure 6 irrigation scenarios and the presence of incentives on sugarcane biproducts being used for bioenergy generation 2 biofuel scenarios each scenario is defined over these three parameters resulting in 36 scenario combinations each of these were run over ten simulation years of hydrologic flows from hydro bid 2006 2015 representing differences in water availability and irrigation demand additionally alternative climate change scenarios using an adjustment factor to shift monthly precipitation and precipitation inputs using the a1b scenario an outline of the modeled scenarios is included in table 2 our intention with this scenario design was to capture a wide range of key scenario parameters affecting either the physical availability of resources climate driven variation in water flows or the demand for water for irrigation the former is captured via spatially downscaled simulations of hydrologic flow using hydro bid representing both a replicated time series of historic flow from periods of low to high precipitation as well as projected future climate change variation in economic demands is captured through variation in economic rents to crop production as well as inclusion of bioenergy scenarios that increase the value of sugarcane production our alternative irrigation scenarios then allow us to simulate the potential benefits that irrigation expansion could provide to agricultural producers in the region with expansion possibilities ranging from inclusive of all crops to restricted irrigation expansion to industrial production of sugarcane only or to crop production in economically vulnerable regions details of the irrigation scenarios bioenergy scenarios crop revenue scenarios and climate scenarios are presented in table 3 3 results our results indicate that in the pacific slope of guatemala there is substantial temporal and spatial heterogeneity in water availability during the dry season there are still modest flows downstream of the major river basins however smaller tributaries receive very little rainfall and are potentially dry most precipitation derived water generation in the pacific slope occurs close to the coast and in the central portion of the study region further the greatest levels of water generation occur where most cash crops are grown sugarcane oil palm and banana fig 5 shows average monthly routed flow by node accumulated inflows without withdrawals over the simulated time series for both the dry season november through april and wet season may through october dry season water availability is consistently low throughout most nodes in the pacific slope with some accumulated water availability in the downstream portion of each watershed though there have been excessive drought events where downstream flows have run dry for brief periods causing local water conflict 4 4 recent examples of severe drought conditions in the region include the drying of madre vieja river in 2015 and 2016 which was due to an extended el niño event gobernación de

análisis de la sequía en la costa sur de guatemala en 2016 desfaío social el aqua red nacional de formación e investigación ambiental guatelama water availability in the pacific slope increases overall during the wet season with a substantial increase in the highlands for the central and southwestern portions of our study region this figure helps illustrate both the seasonal differences in water availability and the spatial distribution of where water availability is proportionately higher across the pacific slope we find that across all modeled years the average surface water availability in the study region is 3 29 billion m3 in the dry season and 5 43 billion m3 in the wet season 3 1 baseline crop area table 4 presents simulated crop area by crop type for the median water availability year under current irrigation practices in the pacific slope henceforth referred to as the baseline simulated rainfed and irrigated area does not vary significantly between the with and without bioenergy formulation with minor differences in the distribution of sugarcane and oil palm production this baseline represents irrigation on approximately 4 of total crop production area slightly lower than observed irrigation trends because we are only accounting for irrigation water supplied by surface water and roughly 12 of sugarcane grown in the region 3 2 simulated difference in the value of agricultural production from baseline we use our baseline crop production trends as a starting point to evaluate whether the pacific slope system has adequate water to expand irrigation to assess the economic value that water provides under different assumptions of crop eligibility bioenergy support policies crop revenue and climate we calculate the simulated difference in agricultural benefits from our different scenarios relative to our baseline specifically we quantify the additional economic benefits or intensive extensive margin irrigation expansion relative to the current irrigation practice baseline for each scenario we are comparing agricultural benefits relative to the baseline irrigation formulation with all other scenario assumptions e g holding with without bioenergy climate year and crop revenue assumptions constant between the baseline and counter factual scenarios 3 2 1 difference in agricultural benefits fig 6 displays a percentage change range for the calculated difference in benefits from agricultural production across our scenarios relative to the baseline limited irrigation formulation several important results emerge from these calculations simulated irrigation under current limited crops irrigation provides additional net benefits of 4 0 7 4 relative to a fully rainfed system in the pacific slope region while only requiring 12 of the agricultural land base this effect is slightly truncated when bioenergy revenues are included approximately 4 2 6 7 reduction in benefits second we find that intensive margin expansion or expanding the range of crops that can be irrigated within the currently irrigated area increases net benefits from 3 4 5 4 without bioenergy and 2 1 3 5 with bioenergy in general this result suggests that intensive margin expansion in irrigation and allowing crop substitution can increase net benefits to the system further this result suggests that there is sufficient water available in the dry season to support irrigated crop diversification in the region the smaller increase in net benefits with bioenergy is reflective of higher opportunity costs of shifting irrigation supplies away from irrigated sugarcane third shifts at the extensive margin further increases benefits however restricted expansion has a minimal effect and only slightly increases benefits beyond the all crops current area scenario for example additional benefits from the vulnerable expansion scenarios range 3 9 6 5 without bioenergy and 2 5 4 4 with bioenergy while restricting expansion to sugarcane systems increases net benefits5 3 9 0 and 4 4 7 6 relative to current irrigation with bioenergy respectively since crop switching is also allowed for our expansion scenarios this suggests that targeting irrigation investments in areas with vulnerable populations or in high productivity sugarcane systems may not change benefits much beyond a policy that targets irrigation diversification allowing expansion in all nodes and for all crops results in a significant change in net benefits ranging 9 6 18 4 without bioenergy and 7 3 13 8 with bioenergy relative to current irrigation suggesting that there are opportunities to realize economic benefits from both crop diversification and shifting the spatial distribution of irrigation patterns finally the bottom panel of fig 6 shows changes in net benefits from different scenarios with climate change relative to the no climate change baseline with limited irrigation this figure shows that under current irrigation practices limited crops climate change could result in increased economic benefits from crop production in the pacific slope with improvements ranging 1 2 2 1 relative to current climate conditions these increases are driven by a shift in the spatial and temporal distribution of water across the region resulting in increased baseline yields and in some nodes reduced demand for irrigation under the climate change scenario average minimum and maximum temperatures increase resulting in larger quantities of water needed to hit irrigation targets however from we find that the projected increases in precipitation outweigh the losses through increase evapotranspiration additionally a flexible scenario that allows for both intensive and extensive margin adjustments all crops expanded area can increase net benefits under climate change relative to a current baseline thus spatial reallocation of irrigation patterns plus crop switching could be an important adaptation mechanism to climate change in the region however these findings do not recognize the potential impact that increased temperature or flooding could have on reducing the suitability of key crops in the southern slope region of guatemala as shown by hannah et al 2017 3 3 simulated difference in water consumption from baseline in addition to changes in the distribution of economic benefits from agricultural production we quantify changes in irrigation water consumption across our scenarios first table 5 displays changes in water consumption across the pacific slope for our alternative irrigation scenarios median water availability year and table 6 presents changes in water consumption under the bioenergy scenarios total water consumption for irrigation actually declines under the all crops current area scenario indicating potential efficiency gains within the system from crop switching and intensive margin adjustments for the most part total irrigation water consumed increases substantially under the targeted expansion scenarios relative to the baseline scenario 4 1 39 0 even though this expansion is spatially limited within the region the vulnerable expansion scenario shows much less expansion in irrigation water use but results in similar levels of additional value than the sugarcane expansion scenarios this is due to limited water availability in vulnerable nodes the all crops expanded area scenario results in a doubling of irrigation water consumption across the select scenarios 3 3 1 difference in the spatial distribution of water consumption from baseline fig 7 shows the simulated change in the spatial allocation of water consumption across the pacific slope when we allow intensive and extensive margin expansion in irrigation this generally results in reduced irrigation in the central portion of the study region under vulnerable expansion we see the northern most nodes irrigated to near max capacity but this still leaves some water available for downstream expansion in irrigation under the full expansion scenario we see more extensive expansion occurring in the eastern most nodes of the region these areas are defined mostly by subsistence level rainfed agricultural practices and thus the lowest current amount of irrigation infrastructure however our results indicate that there are substantial opportunities to generate increased crop revenues through expanded irrigation access in these nodes the full expansion scenario also illustrates that the system is not currently water constrained though a redistribution of support for irrigation infrastructure in less productive nodes may be required to realize system wide benefit improvements under climate change however figure 11 in appendix supplemental figures and tables the spatial distribution of irrigation changes substantially as water availability shifts across the region generally we see less irrigation expansion to the southeastern portion of the study region under the a1b scenario due to lower water demand less irrigation is needed throughout the pacific slope under climate change including the highlands to support crop growth despite increased temperatures which contributes to the spatial reallocation of water consumption 3 4 simulated difference in crop production from baseline simulated differences in water consumption correspond to changes in crop mix strategies across our simulation scenarios while the spatial distribution of crop production is relatively consistent across scenarios targeted irrigation expansion scenarios result in subtle but important shifts in crop production strategies in the pacific slope 3 4 1 differences in crop production from baseline across the different irrigation expansion scenarios we find shifts away from oil palm coffee rubber and to a lesser extent sugarcane production to accommodate increased production of beans and vegetables table 7 and table 8 this result is consistent with the spatial distribution of production changes in which agricultural output decreases reduced production of rubber is driven by relatively low profits in our study region while oil palm production competes with other high valued crops like sugarcane and vegetables reduced output from sugarcane production reflects less irrigation water supply for sugarcane systems which is consistent across most of our scenarios while this percentage is small a marginal change in irrigated sugarcane area frees up a substantial amount of water for less irrigation intensive crops like beans figure 13 in the appendix shows the spatial distribution of crop production in the region under different irrigation scenarios without climate change notably changes in sugarcane production are robust across the with and without bioenergy formulations thus even when sugarcane has higher profitability with bioenergy we still see economic opportunities to reallocate water to other nodes and cropping systems figure 14 in appendix supplemental figures and tables provides a full range of production differences for different crop groups across our irrigation scenarios sugarcane and corn show the greatest sensitivity in production differences to the different scenario formulations from a food security standpoint our results show clear expansion opportunities in food crops across most scenarios with expansion in bean and vegetable production in most irrigation expansion scenarios analyzed thus expanding irrigation access may provide dual benefits of increasing rural incomes and improving food security in the region however vulnerable areas align with areas facing water scarcity so prioritizing these areas for surface water irrigation expansion may not provide large additional benefits to the system if irrigation projects in these nodes are to be sourced from already stressed surface water resources alternative policies or investments supporting groundwater access or small scale water storage infrastructure could complement efforts to expand agricultural productivity and enhance food security in this region 3 4 2 crop production with climate change crop production changes under climate change show similar trends overall though with much larger expansion of bean production and a larger contraction of sugarcane production caused by spatial differences in water availability table 9 the impact of climate change on sugarcane production is notable given the importance of sugarcane as an export crop such a shift could require additional adaptation responses to minimize economic impacts of climate change 3 4 3 difference in the spatial distribution of crop production benefits from baseline fig 8 quantifies the net change in agricultural value that corresponds with the spatial patterns of production and irrigation changes losses from the no irrigation scenario are mostly concentrated in intensively cultivated sugarcane production regions across all irrigation expansion scenarios the patterns are similar in terms of where benefits are realized but the magnitude of this change grows as irrigation access increases under climate change fig 9 the spatial pattern of additional benefits shifts towards the western portion of the study region projected changes to precipitation under climate change include increased rainfall events in the western portion of the pacific slope which outweighs the impacts of increased temperature resulting in net gains in agriculture output thus policymakers interested in expanding irrigation access may find that there is little difference in net economic gains between helping the most vulnerable population and the sugarcane industry under current climate conditions but the narrative may shift under the influence of climate change for resiliency planning policymakers should consider long term climate impacts when prioritizing irrigation investments or implementing new resource management strategies in general our results show that a limited spatial redistribution of water resources under a free irrigation expansion scenario with or without climate change can result in net benefit changes thus irrigation expansion at the intensive and extensive margins could be an important adaptation mechanism to enhance agricultural productivity in the pacific slope under socioeconomic and environmental change 3 5 simulated energy generation from hydroelectric facilities overall we find little difference in annual generation from hydropower facilities across irrigation expansion bioenergy or crop revenue scenarios however we do see increases in electricity generation under climate change conditions this is driven by the increase in precipitation which generates higher rates of monthly flow across the region overall we find that generation increases by about 40 under climate change with an annual generation of 1512 to 1860 mw in the expanded irrigation scenario across alternative water availability and crop profit scenarios and an annual generation of 2194 to 2701 mw across these same scenarios under climate change see fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 key study findings our results indicate that total water availability may not be a limiting resource in the region under current agricultural production and household consumption demands which is counter to recent experience in the region and challenges however this result assumes efficiency improvements in the spatiotemporal allocation of irrigation and household water supplies that is our modeling framework assumes agronomic irrigation rates to hit specific yield thresholds and homogenous distribution efficiency factors for irrigation and household water supplies given a lack of reliable data on distribution efficiency the reality may be more complicated and prolonged drought during the dry season can result in water shortages where historically sugarcane irrigation has been prioritized over other uses across most of our scenario simulations we find that household demands are met and that there are opportunities to expand irrigation for crops that are currently irrigated and for those that are not under the most inclusive expansion scenario we see that water consumption by the agriculture sector almost doubles in the medium revenue scenario relative to the baseline without climate change thus expanding irrigation as a development objective or to adapt to changing climate conditions is currently limited by infrastructure capacity strategic investments in irrigation access could provide system wide benefits and may ameliorate economic challenges faced by smallholder farmers in the region irrigation expansion has the potential to increase economic benefits between 2 1 and 18 4 relative to our business as usual scenario without climate change and up to 24 8 with climate change our results illustrate how alternative crop management strategies and moderate levels of spatial re allocation of production decisions to accommodate irrigation expansion can improve economic outcomes in particular expanding irrigation access to areas with limited irrigation infrastructure and less productive systems can provide greater marginal benefits than increasing irrigation intensity in industrial agricultural systems e g sugarcane however our current approach does not recognize spatially explicit infrastructure expansion cost when examining the value of irrigation water by crops results suggest that there is potential to realize large marginal increases in consumption value for crops that historically have not been irrigated including corn beans and vegetables which require a relatively small amount of water required to reach higher yields and hence profits relative to water intensive crops such as sugarcane this result implies that even a slight reallocation of surface water supplies away from intensively cultivated industrial crops in the region to increase irrigation access for smallholder farmers could result in additional system wide benefits relative to the status quo importantly we show that benefits to irrigation expansion are lower under climate change than under observed climate conditions unless full irrigation expansion is allowed this reduction is being driven by increased demand for irrigation water due to rising temperatures and increased variability in rainfall this illustrates the need to couple irrigation expansion with other adaptation solutions that can improve resilience and productivity of farms e g access to nutrients energy and water storage infrastructure it is also important to note that our simulated irrigation expansion possibilities potentially represent a lower bound in the region because we do not capture water storage potential or the transportation of water across basins if large scale storage or inter basin transfer projections are considered benefits from expansion will be likely larger due to current spatial and temporal mismatches in water supply and demand this storyline is robust to our bioenergy and climate change scenarios as well under climate change water availability and sugarcane production in the pacific slope declines relative to current climate conditions though there is sufficient water to expand irrigation inland thus our results provide important context on the economic value of irrigation water in our study region and the benefits of expanding irrigation access that can be used in cost benefit analysis or to inform policy design 4 2 future research directions we acknowledge several limitations in our analytical framework that provide direction for future research and analysis first we do not capture spatial heterogeneity in crop production costs or producer prices given a lack of spatially explicit information future surveys targeting agricultural producers could gain insight into crop production cost and producer price heterogeneity across the region which would offer greater insight into spatial hotspots for irrigation expansion investments second consistent with other hydro economic frameworks based on a monthly time step our model overestimates the impacts of monthly variation in water availability by not capturing day to day differences in precipitation thus we may not capture the implications of large precipitation events or sub daily water supply anomalies in the system that have implications for downstream water availability further if crop specific water demands cannot be met during any monthly time step it is deemed that it is not possible to realize gains from irrigation thus our estimates may underestimate the potential gains from expanded irrigation access third the analysis in its present form does not allow for irrigation involving water transfers between nodes other than through the existing upstream to downstream surface water network or between months i e through water storage infrastructure in other words water availability for irrigation is restricted to concurrent same month instream flows in the same node this feature is not expected to be a significant limitation for analyzing smallholder agriculture and small scale irrigation projects however it is likely to understate potential benefits for larger operations that can afford transfer and storage infrastructure additional analysis of specific water storage or transfer infrastructure options is needed in the pacific slope to assess whether these options are economically viable and improve the resilience of the agricultural system finally our analysis does not account for the costs of irrigation expansion and how these costs would compare to the irrigation benefit estimates derived in our study the research on irrigation expansion costs is limited and the capital costs of irrigation projects are typically evaluated on a site by site basis therefore our current focus is on the potential benefits of expanded irrigation which leaves the issue of potential net benefits for future research nonetheless our analysis represents a first of its kind effort to evaluate irrigation expansion possibilities in a region of guatemala that faces a multitude of development challenges resource constraints and limited food energy and water sector infrastructure and coordinated management our results present evidence that water scarcity or variability in surface water supply may not be the limiting factor to expanding irrigated agricultural systems as we see a doubling of irrigation water consumption when irrigation expansion intensive and extensive margin is allowed thus under current climate conditions existing irrigation infrastructure is likely the limiting factor in this study region not water availability our results provide appropriate evidence of spatial and crop system hotspots that would potentially provide the greatest marginal additional benefits to the system under both recently observed and projected future climate conditions we show that spatial reallocation of production and irrigation management may be an important adaptation response to future climate change 5 conclusions our analysis applies a spatially detailed hydro economic model of the pacific slope region in guatemala to assess irrigation expansion potential across a wide range of scenarios our framework captures important spatial and temporal dependencies in water resource supply and demand across the agricultural and municipal sectors we developed a unique scenario design to evaluate the economic value of water used in irrigation in the study region and to assess potential economic benefits from alternative irrigation expansion scenarios our study provides new insights into agricultural expansion possibilities in the region expanding on recent studies that did not consider management adaptation responses to climate change castellanos et al 2018 or that did not consider spatiotemporal resource constraints banerjee et al 2019 we find that the region currently has sufficient water to support expanded irrigation from surface water resources while meeting municipal water demands for all months and scenario combinations across our scenarios we identify potential efficiency gains from crop switching and intensive margin expansion as well as from shifting the spatial distribution of irrigation patterns intensification leads to larger relative benefit changes than targeted expansion in vulnerable spatial nodes and sugarcane irrigation expansion the increased value of agricultural production from focused effort on expanding irrigation access to most vulnerable population creates about the same gains as extensive expansion of industrial agricultural crops like sugar however unlimited irrigation expansion leads to a slight reallocation of irrigation supplies away from sugarcane to less intensively managed systems such as corn bean and vegetable that are not traditionally irrigated in the region thus the marginal value of increasing irrigation access for less water intensive low input systems provides greater system wide benefits than marginal additions of water to sugarcane and oil palm production re allocating irrigation water to different cropping systems and spatial locations is a challenge that would require both infrastructure investments and changes to existing management institutions that have historically prioritized water for highly profitable industrial crops like sugar cane and oil palm institutional changes that offer greater system wide benefits may require additional sources of compensation for industrial producers that relinquish a small share of their existing water allocation climate and socioeconomic change in the region in addition to other policies supporting energy and industrial sector development may constrain water resources in the future analyses that capture connections and tradeoffs across the food energy and water nexus will be critical for improving development outcomes in guatemala our results suggest that policy makers and industrial stakeholders may need to adapt spatial cropping patterns to respond to emerging water constraints under climate change additionally our results indicate that complementary investments in groundwater irrigation and water storage may be needed to support continued growth in agricultural production in the pacific slope under a changing climate funding this work was supported by

9528,this study aimed at the evaluation of the change in the effectiveness of best management practices bmps for agricultural pollution control in terms of reduction of nutrient loads to surface water bodies in lithuania in the context of climate change cc the swat model was used by applying two cc representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 three time horizons historical 2000 2019 mid century 2040 2059 and end century 2080 2099 and five bmps arable land conversion to grasslands reduced fertilization no till farming catch crops and stubble fields throughout winter the most effective with the greatest nutrient reduction bmps include grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops no plough farming and reduced fertilization bmps appear to be the least effective ones cc would increase the potential of reduced fertilization and conversion to grasslands bmps up to 179 and 17 respectively for total nitrogen tn reduction regarding total phosphorus tp the reduction potential would increase 226 for fertilization reduction and remain approximate for grasslands at median 4 due to winter reduction of loads no plough stubble fields and winter cover crops would decrease by as much as 50 12 and 26 respectively for tn and 30 11 and 17 respectively for tp compared to the historical period the greatest change would be recorded for the most extreme cc scenario rcp8 5 and the longest time horizon end century the effectiveness of bmps except for no plough for tn load reduction would increase more and on average would become greater in agriculture dominated areas of central northern lithuania than elsewhere although the maximum reduction values would occur in western and in some cases eastern lithuania except for reduced fertilization this suggests the importance of the application of the measures in both areas bmps except for grasslands are expected to have relatively little effect on the overall crop yield keywords bmp climate change impacts agriculture swat model lithuania 1 introduction water resources are subject to multiple stressors directly and indirectly created by humans among them the impact of climate change cc and agricultural non point source nps pollution are the primary factors affecting water availability and quality around the globe khatri and tyagi 2014 scherger et al 2022 according to eea 2020 approximately 50 of surface water and 25 of ground water bodies in the european union eu were in less than good condition in 2016 most of them failed to achieve good status due to nps pollution moreover water problems are exacerbated by the intensification of climate warming cc redistributes water flows makes dry areas drier and wet areas wetter lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 next to the redistribution of water flows increased nutrient losses particularly nitrogen from the soils are potentially accelerated as well barclay and walter 2015 øygarden et al 2014 along with temperature increases the intensification of loss of total nitrogen and total phosphorus tn and tp may further aggravate the already serious eutrophication problems in places such as the baltic sea helcom 2018 moreover this process by itself may turn water bodies into large sources of greenhouse gas emissions li et al 2021 further intensifying cc and consequently nps pollution problems the development of resilient agricultural systems capable of buffering cc impacts on agricultural production as well as protection of aquatic systems is therefore of the highest priority eea 2020 such resilient agricultural systems require effective strategies of agricultural water pollution reduction in order to improve the efficiency of agricultural systems brouziyne et al 2018 particularly by identifying weather resilient solutions bosch et al 2018 according to a number of authors effective reduction of agricultural nps agri nps water pollution should take into account changes in the environment resulting from cc brouziyne et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 wallace et al 2017 xu et al 2019 studies show bosch et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 that cc will likely increase the cost of meeting water quality goals in water bodies affected by agriculture for instance in the nordic baltic region higher temperatures may increase nitrogen mineralisation and increased precipitation in the cold period may create more favourable conditions for nitrate no3 n leaching molina navarro et al 2018 next to increasing nutrient loads cc is likely to change the spatial distribution patterns of agri nps and cause substantial changes in areas identified as critical source areas renkenberger et al 2017 because targeting bmps in such areas yields considerable reductions in pollution loads piniewski et al 2021 wagena and easton 2018 xu et al 2019 successful meeting of water policy targets requires planning for their changes the identification of the most effective cc resilient pollution reduction strategy therefore requires examining how cc changes spatial agri nps patterns because future changes cannot be assessed through monitoring environmental modelling remains the most important tool available for this type of research multiple studies have been published evaluating water pollution from the perspective of cc by applying models such as swim hesse et al 2014 vemala huttunen et al 2015 mike she vansteenkiste et al 2013 and many others andersen et al 2006 barclay and walter 2015 huttunen et al 2021 olsson et al 2016 although other models have been applied successfully the soil and water assessment tool swat model remains one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models across the globe gassman and yingkuan 2015 this semi distributed process based model allows for the examination of multiple environmental processes arnold et al 1998 it has been widely applied in hydro climatic studies tan et al 2020 the swat model has also been used extensively for the assessment of water policy and management options andersen et al 2016 hesse et al 2014 huttunen et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 piniewski et al 2021 thodsen et al 2017 the advantages of the swat model include its past successful application in many studies integrating cc and agri nps pollution reduction issues bosch et al 2018 brouziyne et al 2018 jeon et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 teshager et al 2017 wagena and easton 2018 woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 xu et al 2019 many studies have already identified the significance of cc in designing nps pollution reduction programmes and approached the issue from different perspectives while also applying the swat model for example the study by pandey et al 2021 identified critical sub watersheds where bmps application is the most effective and determined how this effectiveness may change depending on cc woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 investigated uncertainties related to agri bmps implementation in changing climate in a us lake watershed wallace et al 2017 assessed the effectiveness of combined agri bmps under cc in a small us catchment brouziyne et al 2018 evaluated different cc adaptation strategies with agri bmps application for improved crop water productivity while preserving hydrological resources in the study by jeon et al 2018 swat modeling of bmps under cc was integrated with the artificial intelligence model to perform trade off analysis between economic and environmental objectives in another study wagena and easton 2018 examined 4 bmps in a large scale us watershed and concluded that cc impacts could be offset with additional bmps although such strategies should take into account pollutant swapping risks next to assessing the effects of bmps on changing climate bosch et al 2018 also calculated the economic costs of meeting water protection goals depending on the cc scenario the costs of pollution reduction were also examined by xu et al 2019 including the targeting option the study by teshager et al 2017 combined multiple bmps into five strategies tested with cc in the context of nutrient sediment loss agricultural production and water availability despite the abundance of studies examining cc impacts on bmps effectiveness we were not able to find studies covering the entire country as the study object such an approach would be important in reference to the attainment of water management goals that in most cases are set at the country level we therefore selected lithuania as the study object the country lacked this kind of assessments moreover we focused on evaluating numerous patterns associated with changes in agri bmps effectiveness due to the impact of cc in the spatial or temporal dimension such information is important in building a weather resilient agricultural nps pollution abatement strategy it is the essential component of tackling the problems of baltic sea helcom 2018 and inland water eutrophication in lithuania eea 2020 2018 the objectives of this study were as follows 1 assessment of the effects of agri bmps on water balance and nutrient loads 2 evaluation of change in agri bmps effectiveness due to cc 3 indication of important spatial and temporal patterns in agri bmps effectiveness and impacts on crop yields 2 materials and methods this study is built on the foundation laid in the article by plunge et al 2021 and the work of the environmental protection agency of lithuania which built its river modeling system by integrating swat 2012 model and phyton scripts its detailed

relevant for this study 2 1 study area an important feature of this study is the selection of the entire country of lithuania as the study area this perspective is meaningful because serious management issues are usually resolved and water policies are set at the national level small scale or large scale covering many countries or even continents studies provide some important insights the different scales of such studies however frequently lead to the failure to address the application of the results in the actual policies the model was therefore set up for the entire country it also covered relevant external areas generating inflow to the territory the model area in fig 2 plunge et al 2021 covers lithuania 65 300 km2 in fine detail and belarus 45 463 km2 for the nemunas basin and 488 km2 for the daugava basin and poland 2516 km2 of nemunas basin in coarse detail the results section presents only modelling results obtained for the lithuanian territory areas covered by the fine detail model are dominated by agriculture accounting for approximately 59 of lithuania followed by forests 30 water bodies 2 urban built up areas 3 and other areas 6 plc 7 2019 areas outside lithuania are also primarily occupied by agriculture covering 49 of the territory and forests 47 other types of land use are relatively insignificant including water 1 urban built up areas 0 4 and other 3 pakhomau 2016 the declared crop data collected by the agriculture information and rural business centre from 2012 covering agricultural areas were used in the model as baseline crop data the largest areas were used for pastures occupying 18 of lithuania s territory followed by winter wheat 6 5 barley 3 2 rape 3 1 summer wheat 2 8 winter triticale 1 4 and oats 1 2 2 climate change data meteorological data necessary for cc impact modelling were obtained from the european coordinated regional climate downscaling euro cordex programme 2 2 data available at https www euro cordex net the finest available resolution eur 11 0 11 degrees or 12 5 km in regional climate models rcm was selected although the rcms were different global climate models gcms used in setting boundary conditions for rcms in some cases were the same seven combinations were selected to avoid skewed results due to deviations in single climate model input data this approach is recommended by many authors rathjens et al 2016 singh 2016 two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were selected for modelling representing the intermediate rcp4 5 and worst case rcp8 5 cc scenarios daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature data were used other weather variables wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were generated by means of an internal swat weather generator by applying statistical parameters calculated from historical meteorological data statistical bias correction to local stations data from 18 national stations were used was applied to precipitation and temperature cc data the local intensity scaling and linear scaling methods were applied for the bias correction of temperature distribution mapping was used for precipitation with the application of the cmhyd programme rathjens et al 2016 more details are provided in the article by plunge et al 2021 the swat model was run for the period 1994 2099 the 6th year was used for model warm up with prepared rcms data to keep consistency with the rest of the time series the historical period was modelled with rcms data results processing involved the selection of three periods of 20 years for the assessment and presentation of results the historical period included the time interval of 2000 2019 mid century 2040 2059 and end century 2080 2099 table 1 presents the selection of cc rcm models used in this study the table also provides information on the used rcms data mean deviations from historical period averages data for 18 national meteorological stations were used in the calculation 2 3 best management practices the selection of the best agri bmps for modelling purposes was based on the lithuanian environmental protection agency s screening plunge 2020 the screening report published on the institution s webpage 3 3 the report in lithuanian language is available at https vanduo old gamta lt files savadas html identified the most cost effective measures for reducing agricultural water pollution which also could be modelled at scale with the swat model the screening was performed by modeling 12 different agri bmps on a watershed of 1140 km2 with agricultural land occupying approximately 62 in the middle of lithuania with the swat model the cost effectiveness of measures reducing nutrient loads were evaluated and compared to similar results in studies and reports published by other agencies based on the screening results the following bmps were selected 1 converting arable land to perennial grasslands grassland 2 reduced fertilization by 10 from the baseline level fertilization 3 applying no plough or no till farming technology no plough 4 planting cover crops catch crops and keeping them through winter wintcrops 5 leaving stubble fields through winter stubblefields the selected bmps were used in modelling based on the swat model for the modelling scenarios selected bmps were simulated for all the applicable areas in lithuania the distribution of the application areas is presented in fig 3 the grassland bmp was applied to all areas identified as arable excluding the existing pastures these areas accounted for 1 291104 km2 or 19 8 of the country s territory the application area for the reduced fertilization bmp covered all areas identified as arable land and pastures the application territory occupied 2 249104 km2 or 34 4 of the country no plough technology was applied over areas used mostly for grain and rape growing such areas occupied 8611 km2 or 13 2 of the country areas covered with summer crops were eligible for winter cover crop growing they occupied 8398 km2 or 12 9 of the country the last bmp namely stubble fields in winter was also applied over areas with summer crops in the latter case however vegetable grown areas were excluded such areas covered 8082 km2 or 12 4 of the country grassland bmp in the swat model was implemented by converting the land cover of arable land to winter pasture wpas code in model library fertilization bmp was represented in the model by multiplying mineral and organic fertilizer used on agricultural land with a coefficient of 0 9 due to differences in crop fertilization rates between crops farm sizes and regions in absolute terms kg ha of reduced fertilizer the reduction also varied detailed information regarding baseline fertilization rates used in the model is provided in the paic 2015 report 59 72 pp no plough bmp was applied by substituting spring ploughing operation with no till mixing sprgplow to zerotill tillage codes according to the model library all other tillage operations were removed except for the fall plow operation which in no till agriculture is required every 3 4 years to unify annual management practices it was treated as an annual operation wintcrops bmp was introduced by planting winter rye rye code in the model library after harvesting the main summer crop moreover autumn tillage operations were removed winter catch crops kill operation in the model were done on 30 march manure applications were moved to spring only mineral nitrogen fertilizer amount was reduced by 10 and planting of summer crops was delayed by 2 weeks stubblefields bmp was implemented in the model by removing fall plough operations this measure was only applicable in the case of summer crops a detailed description of the rationale application areas and parameters for bmp implementation is presented in the report of paic 2015 2 4 scenarios and evaluation modelling of scenarios was based on the intersection between selected rcms rcps scenarios and bmps 5 bmps were applied separately each time over the maximum available territory available with each of 7 rcms data with each of 2 rcps scenarios no bmp scenario without additional bmps was also prepared for each of 7 rcms data and both rcps scenarios the model was therefore run a total of 84 times generating the same number of result sets the modelling results were retrieved from swat output sub for nutrient loads and output hru for yields files agri bmp effect for absolute values t y or kg ha year was calculated by subtracting results of the no bmp scenario from a specific bmp scenario for the same rcm rcp time period data were used the change in bmp load reduction potential in percentages was calculated by subtracting median results for the historical period specific bmp measure scenario from those of same measure cc scenario mid century or end century the subtraction result was divided by the historical period value and multiplied by 100 for percentage conversion 2 5 water bodies at risk from agriculture for water management purposes risk water body statuses were assigned to water bodies failing to meet good water quality criteria as defined by the national regulation am 2007 different types of pressures are responsible for the deterioration of the status of water bodies the most profound pressure responsible for the largest part of risk water bodies in lithuania is agriculture plungė and gudas 2018 risk water body basins suffering from agricultural pressures in lithuania are presented in fig 4 because measures for management and agricultural water pollution reduction are focused on those areas it is important to investigate the effectiveness of bmp measures in risk basins and to verify if it is somehow different compared to the areas outside of the risk basins a relevant comparison was made but only for the rcp8 5 cc scenario representing the broadest interval of possible climate conditions 3 results 3 1 changes in nutrient load reduction according to the modelling results significant changes in nutrient loads reaching surface water bodies represented in the model in lithuania should be expected depending on the cc scenario and time period fig 5 shows that in the no bmp scenario without agri bmps application temperature driven nutrient mineralisation and increased leaching from soils due to cc are expected to cause a significant increase in nitrogen loads to surface water bodies the median increases in tn loads reach 23 1 for rcp4 5 scenario and 64 4 for rcp8 5 by the end century period on the other hand tp loads are expected to slightly decline the median results are 5 6 for rcp4 5 scenario and 7 4 for rcp8 5 by the end century period more in depth assessment of the effects of cc scenarios on water quantity and quality is presented in the article by plunge et al 2021 the effects of the application of agri bmp measures vary with different cc scenarios and time periods fig 5 the reduction of fertilization by 10 as a measure reduces more nutrient loads with more pronounced cc the modelling results show that in the rcp8 5 cc scenario for median tn results by mid century fertilization reduction increases load reduction by 94 7 compared to the historical period by end century this value increases up to 178 6 this change is mainly caused by the increased reduction of no3 n flows via tile drains by 139 1 and via lateral flows by 82 5 fig 6 by end century compared to the impact of bmp during the historical period a similar effect is observed for tp loads except for the historical period when tp loads slightly increase with this bmp with the progress of climate warming however the measure becomes more effective in reducing tp the change in load reduction for the worst case scenario by end century compared to the historical period is 226 this increase might be partly related to the fact that increased water flows with cc would increase leaching of nutrients from fertilizer application this also applies to plant growth which will be negatively affected with unstable climate patterns the reduction of fertilizer application bmp is therefore expected to have a stronger effect in the future as the capability of plants to absorb nutrients from fertilizers become negatively affected different effects should be expected regarding no plough application with progressing cc this measure becomes less effective for instance this measure loses its median tn load reduction potential for the worst case scenario by 34 in mid century and by 49 9 by end century period for tp the values reach 20 6 and 30 1 for the same periods respectively such losses result from the fact that while cc reduces snow cover and melting it also reduces surface runoff when conventionally tilled soil surface is substituted with no till it results in an effective ceasing of erosion related flow of nutrients from such soils to water bodies this is evident in the observation of the modelling results with historical data as cc progresses however the reduced snow melt related surface water flow transports less nutrients from fields therefore the diminishing role of this pollution pathway diminishes the effectiveness of this bmp the surface runoff might actually increase with this measure comparing no bmp and bmp scenarios for same period by a small amount less than 1 nevertheless this flow appears insufficient to offset the effect of lost snow melt water load reduction on grasslands appears to only substantially change in the most extreme cc scenario it increases only for tn by 17 4 for the worst case cc scenario by end century period while tp remains on the same level a change of approximately 4 for the same scenario and period the analysis of detailed variables fig 6 reveals that this measure is effective in reducing nutrient loss both in surface runoff and in subsurface flow pathways the intensification of cc reduces the grassland effect of holding nitrogen pollution traveling via surface runoff loss of organic nitrogen retaining capacity by 29 6 and organic phosphorus by 25 8 for the worst case scenario by end century surface runoff decreases followed by less pollution by this pathway yet the potential of this bmp is increased for trapping nutrient pollution supplied by subsurface pathways it is determined by several factors a decrease in plant nutrient uptake with cc intensification is much lower for grasslands compared to agricultural crops moreover a lower rate of fertilization on grasslands like in the fertilization reduction bmp provides a higher yield with cc intensification a reduction of tn and no3 n loads in tile drains is expected to increase by 99 5 and 62 1 respectively for the worst case scenario by end century the same trend is observed for phosphorus for this variable plant uptake increasing with cc intensification is responsible for increased reduction of soluble p load these two phenomena loss of potential to trap nutrients transported via surface flows and its increase for subsurface pathways balance each other out and the potential of the measure to reduce nutrient loads remains more or less constant with the exception of tn in the rcp8 5 climate change scenario for end century where more extreme warming tips the scales with increased importance of subsurface pathways and their reductions stubble fields left through winter lose their potential to reduce both tn and tp with increased cc intensity however the differences between median results in the intermediate and worst case cc scenarios are negligible the loss of potential of tn load reduction for the end century of the rpc4 5 scenario is 9 1 and for tp 7 1 within the rcp8 5 scenario for the same period the losses of tn and tp reach 12 5 and 11 2 respectively the extreme cc scenario changes uncertainty bounds for the possible results as in the no plough bmp according to results in fig 6 the reduction of effectiveness for this agri bmp is related to the overall reduction of the amounts of surface runoff linked to the reduced amounts of water generated by snow melt the loss of the capability to trap organic nitrogen related to surface flow reaches 23 5 for the worst case scenario s end century period although the nutrient loss mechanisms are similar stubble fields remain a significantly more effective measure than no plough this result of better nutrient retention in the soil is related to the fact that in this bmp soils and plant roots are left intact through winter while it is not the case for no plough bmp nutrient load reduction potential for winter cover crops also decreases with cc intensification this decrease for the intermediate scenario by end century for tn is 10 6 and for total phosphorus 8 2 for the worst case scenario the values are 26 1 for tn and 16 7 tp as with other bmps the loss of potential is connected to the reduction of surface runoff pathways in comparison with stubble fields however the loss in nutrient trapping capacity is more extreme for the rcp8 5 cc scenario by end century differences in evapotranspiration changes provide a clue for why this occurs in the rcp8 5 cc scenario evapotranspiration does not further increase with temperature a 12 1 decrease compared to the historical period due to extreme temperature warming exerting pressure on winter cover crop plants resulting in less reliable plant growth it should be emphasised that the model assumes harvesting of regular crops much earlier with cc already in june due to the heat unit operation scheduling used in the model because winter cover crops in the model are planted shortly after harvesting a practice applied currently by end century winter cover crops are planted as early as july with average temperatures of approximately 30 c in the extreme cc scenario summer temperatures will obviously not be optimal for winter cover crops their optimal temperature is approximately 12 c therefore their functioning as nutrient trappers will suffer as well it is also worth emphasising that winter catch crops are not as dense as grassland plants therefore the crops will soak in excess nutrients from subsurface flow less effectively compared to grasslands because cc comes with more winter precipitation and lower evapotranspiration due to plant stress more precipitation will infiltrate and more nutrients will be washed out from soil 3 2 impact on the effectiveness of nutrient load reduction fig 7 presents detailed information for each pathway of nutrients and sediment loads the results were prepared by averaging results obtained at the model subbasin level for the entire territory of lithuania the figure shows mean changes for load variables that can be expected if agri bmp is applied on 1 ha of arable land the results show same patterns to those presented previously although comparing results on the same scale the analysis of tn and tp results shows that grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops have an average effectiveness on roughly the same level winter cover crops are marginally more effective compared to the other two yet it loses effectiveness with intensification of cc while the application of grasslands at least for tn in the rcp8 5 scenario gains effectiveness grasslands also grow effectiveness to trap nitrogen related to tile drain and lateral flow pathways which is expected to increase in importance with cc the two remaining bmps namely reduction of fertilization and no plough reach a completely different level the application of no plough on same area produces around ten times less impact for tn and five times less for tp reduction of fertilization has an even lesser effect moreover it is only effective for nitrogen reduction 3 3 agri risk basins according to fig 8 and fig 9 the only measure evidently more effective in agri risk areas is the reduction of fertilization interestingly this measure for tn becomes more effective with the intensification of climate warming although it is only the case for agri risk areas the changes for non risk basins are considerably lower for tp reduction effectiveness also increases with cc intensification this bmp however is expected to reliably produce reductions only for agri risk areas in non risk areas certain reductions can be expected only for the conditions of the most extreme climate change for the remaining four pollution abatement measures the patterns are similar for tp variable they are all significantly less effective in agri risk areas compared to non risk basins moreover climate warming is not observed to change this pattern in any significant way tn patterns are more interesting all four measures for the historical period are less effective in agri risk areas for grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops however cc intensification swaps the effectiveness density distributions as a result with the most intensive climate warming the measures become more effective in agri risk basins this is because tn loads are expected to increase substantially in these areas plunge et al 2021 for the no plough measure its effectiveness in agri risk areas remains on the lower end compared to non risk areas 3 4 crop yields beside the hydrology and nutrient loads to surface water bodies cc is expected to change crop yields important to consider when planning the pollution reduction strategy according to the results presented in fig 10 without any bmps climate warming would reduce yields the results presented in the figure are averaged for all crops within each rcm data variation in 7 datasets represented by boxplots width cc scenario and period the more extreme scenario takes place the more reduction can be expected due to more frequent unfavourable weather conditions as was already mentioned the model assumes crops would be planted and harvested earlier less stable weather patterns would also provide less than optimal conditions for them regarding changes resulting from the application of bmps different patterns could be distinguished cc impacts the loss of yields from fertilization reduction the more intensive cc the lesser yield drop is expected because yields would primarily be more affected by climate and unstable weather than fertilization reduction cc is also likely to increase the growth of grasslands compared to crops that might be due to the fact that grasslands grow continually and with cc grass would extend its growth into the cold period nov to apr while other crops might suffer from climate extremes from cc it is important to emphasise that the baseline in the case of grassland bmp was cropland converted to grasslands therefore the initial loss of yield in this case represents lower level of yields obtained from grasslands compared to averaged values from cropland regarding no plough application warming related to cc appears to result in a positive effect on yields as well with changing climate however stubble fields and winter cover crops would negatively affect yields the most likely reason for this would be associated with weather conditions in the warm season may to oct increasingly stressful for main crops with cc intensification it should be emphasised that stubble fields and no plough bmps show very good performance in terms of changes in yields in the context of cc the former even results in a yield increase while the latter ensures basically unchanged yield both bmps result in relatively lower losses of nutrients more of them therefore become available during the vegetation season to help boost the yields moreover stubble in stubble fields represents an additional source of nutrients winter crops would slightly diminish the yields with the exception of a significant drop for grasslands however all bmps are generally expected to have little effect on overall crop yields 3 5 spatial results the spatial dimension is very important in the assessment of the effectiveness of measures fig 11 and fig 12 present maps with the colour of basins depending on the average effectiveness of measures in those basins if bmps could be applied the presented results were obtained using subbasins level output recalculating for areas of the applied measures hollow areas represent model subbasins without suitable areas for selected agri bmp the map providing results for tn shows that the change in the spatial distribution of effects of fertilization reduction bmp is the most pronounced in the context of cc this bmp becomes more efficient with cc intensification in the middle of lithuania where most agricultural land is concentrated and the least precipitation is common similar patterns are observed for fertilization effects on tp loads although their reduction potential is somewhat less concentrated compared to tn the remaining four measures show patterns similar to one another tp reduction is more effective in areas where precipitation levels are the highest in lithuania climate warming does not have a strong impact on those patterns regarding tn reduction the western and in some cases north eastern or eastern parts of the country are areas most efficient to target with the measures i e in these areas the effects per hectare could reach the highest levels on the other hand to achieve the complete image of the situation the maps should be examined together with fig 8 and fig 9 in this context although grassland stubble field and winter cover crops remain with high nutrient load reduction values in the hills of western and eastern lithuania or the north eastern part of the country the most frequent dense or average values evidently increase due to cc in central and northern lithuania s agricultural heartland agri risk area although the latter values are much lower than maximum value in no risk basins they are more spatially widespread and more abundant 4 discussion the study results show that cc is an important factor changing the effectiveness of agri bmps used for nps reduction and it is important to account for it in designing water pollution abatement programmes this conclusion is in agreement with other available studies for instance qiu et al 2020 evaluating bmps under cc in a watershed of chinese reservoir concluded that cc would reduce the efficiency of bmps which is important to take into consideration when planning watershed management loss for agri bmp effectiveness is confirmed in the study by renkenberger et al 2017 who also determined that critical source areas for nps pollution would increase as well according to his study bmps designed to reach water management targets under current climate conditions will become insufficient with climate change these conclusions are in line with our results for increased nitrogen pollution our study was focused on the impact of cc on agri bmp effectiveness through time in lithuania and the investigation of the underlying reasons for expected changes the results reveal that the redistribution of flows due to cc is probably the most important factor for these changes the diminishment of the importance of surface runoff is associated with the loss of snow cover with cc intensification this would reduce the effectiveness of agri bmps targeting this nutrient loss pathway the loss of effectiveness is significant for no tillage agriculture and stubble fields left through winter such impacts were confirmed by several studies pandey et al 2021 wagena and easton 2018 wallace et al 2017 the redistribution of flows and loss of snow melt runoff due to cc is widely expected among scientists akstinas et al 2019 arheimer et al 2005 čerkasova 2019 jakimavičius et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 other hydrological changes expected in northern countries including lithuania include increased rainfall and water flows particularly during the cold nov mar period lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 šarauskienė et al 2018 water flows infiltrating the soil also increase leaching of nitrogen from soils during the period without vegetation øygarden et al 2014 rising temperatures increase mineralisation of organic nitrogen barclay and walter 2015 leading to even more leaching from the soils according to our results agri bmps that in combination decreased surface water flows increased water percolation and subsequently subsurface flow as well as stable plant cover such as grasslands reduced nitrate input to soils like the reduction of fertilization tended to be positively affected by the intensification of cc teixeira et al 2021 however presented results for winter cover crops that show increasing effectiveness with cc for some areas in new zealand qiu et al 2020 showed that the reduction of fertilization might be losing effectiveness with cc in a chinese watershed contrary to our results these effects however varied depending of the climate model and period they are also geographically distant to lithuania s conditions and therefore might not be comparable the study demonstrated that the most promising measures for tn and tp reduction in terms of their effectiveness with the largest reductions of nutrients per area of application are grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops no plough bmp appears to be the least effective one it is rather difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of fertilization because its effect strongly depends on the level of ambition 10 reduction was selected for the study and the actual levels of fertilization practices fertilization rates are not well accounted for in lithuania it was therefore assumed that fertilizer is not over used which most likely is not the case regarding grasslands in theory this measure could be applied over the largest total territory with the exception of fertilizer but its overall appeal and social acceptability could only become high in the case of enhancement of animal husbandry which seems to be the case in strategical agricultural policy documents otherwise widespread adoption of this bmp would significantly lower agricultural yields with grasslands replacing a lot of crops a solution potentially unacceptable for the agricultural sector notwithstanding this grasslands and fertilization seem to increase in effectiveness with cc which raises the environmental appeal for those measures on the other hand no plough winter crops and stubble fields bmps are expected to become less effective or remain stable for the reduction of nutrient loads with cc the attractiveness of those bmps is related to rather neutral effect on crop yields including positive effects in the case of stubble fields with the assumption of two annual cycles of planting and harvesting total crop yields might be much higher but the negative effects of increased nutrient leaching should also be expected the analysis of maximum and most frequent nutrient reduction values for grasslands stubble fields winter crops and no plough bmps suggests the importance of application of those measures both in non risk basins of western and sometimes eastern lithuania where maximum values will prevail and in agri risk basins central and northern lithuania where the overall level of effectiveness is expected to rise with cc for the purposes of inland water protection more emphasis should be put on the aforementioned bmp application in agricultural risk areas with the highest number of affected rivers and lakes water reservoirs on the other hand for the sake of the baltic sea protection particular attention should be paid to bmp application in western lithuania because the territory constitutes a nearby pollution source for the baltic sea it is important to emphasise that it is the first time the country scale approach for the assessment of bmps effectiveness is employed in lithuania in the context of cc such approach is more suitable for small countries with somewhat homogenous environmental conditions while it might result in a certain loss of some detailed information the approach might be of practical importance by potentially facilitating well informed decisions while drafting water management plans strategies and policies country wide modelling is essential when it comes to planning pollution load reduction targets and measures in the baltic sea and the curonian lagoon because all the pollution generated in the territory of lithuania is carried to the baltic sea excluding retention and losses via other pathways it is worth mentioning that the results of the study bear an additional important political signal that was not possible to convey before cc will likely have an effect of a manifold exacerbation on diffuse pollution problems and some of bmps are expected to emerge as more promising than they are now and more effective than some of the bmps now considered the most effective ones in terms of scientific value the inclusion of the cc component into bmps effectiveness assessment constitutes a scientific novelty in lithuania it may help foster other studies to deepen the knowledge on this particular topic future efforts should be focused on the assessment and design of existing and planned water protection programs which would apply results of this or similar studies to deliver effective climate resilient water management tools and plans 5 conclusion achievement of water related environmental targets in the baltic sea and inland waters is a huge challenge in itself especially when the main pressure comes from diffuse pollution sources climate change on the other hand adds even more uncertainty into possibilities to achieve the targets the study thus aimed at the assessment of cc implications on the effectiveness of agricultural bmps with a view to come up with some recommendations as to which measures would become more promising than others in the future the study revealed that cc will generally increase diffuse pollution loads to water bodies by up to 64 4 of tn for the worst case cc scenario the greatest change is expected for the most extreme cc scenario rcp8 5 and the longest time horizon end of century rising nutrient leaching from soils will be driven by increased rainfall and water flows particularly during the cold period as well as by increased mineralisation of organic nitrogen because of rising temperatures in terms of pollution reduction effectiveness the most promising measures in all periods including historical and cc scenarios are grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops however with cc the effectiveness of grasslands would increase even more by up to 17 in the case of reduced fertilization bmp increase would be even more significant by 179 and 226 for tn and tp respectively fertilization reduction could become much more important in the future if actual over fertilization level is much higher than modestly assumed 10 from optimal one on the other hand no plough winter crops and stubble fields are expected to become less effective with cc down to 50 12 and 26 respectively for tn and to 30 11 and 17 respectively for tp the drop in effectiveness is related to the loss of importance of surface runoff due to the loss of snow cover with cc intensification since those bmps target this nutrient loss pathway the study also demonstrated differences in bmp implementation spatial aspects depending on priority objectives if the achievement of good status in inland waters would be the main goal more emphasis should be put on bmp application in agricultural risk areas central lithuania on the other hand for the sake of the baltic sea protection particular attention should be paid to bmp application in western lithuania because the territory constitutes a nearby pollution source for the baltic sea in addition study results imply that cc is important to account for in designing water pollution abatement policy and programmes and they provide hints on how best to account for cc in particular the study conveys an important political signal cc will significantly exacerbate the existing diffuse pollution problem thus even more pollution abatement efforts will be necessary in the future furthermore with this study it is the first time the country scale approach for bmps effectiveness assessment in lithuania in the context of cc was employed although it might result in some loss in precision the approach might be of practical importance by facilitating well informed water management decisions our conclusion is that country scale proved suitable for small countries with somewhat homogenous environmental conditions it should be noted that the inclusion of the cc component into bmps effectiveness assessment constitutes a scientific novelty in lithuania it may help foster other studies to deepen the knowledge on this topic future efforts should be focused on

9528,this study aimed at the evaluation of the change in the effectiveness of best management practices bmps for agricultural pollution control in terms of reduction of nutrient loads to surface water bodies in lithuania in the context of climate change cc the swat model was used by applying two cc representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 three time horizons historical 2000 2019 mid century 2040 2059 and end century 2080 2099 and five bmps arable land conversion to grasslands reduced fertilization no till farming catch crops and stubble fields throughout winter the most effective with the greatest nutrient reduction bmps include grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops no plough farming and reduced fertilization bmps appear to be the least effective ones cc would increase the potential of reduced fertilization and conversion to grasslands bmps up to 179 and 17 respectively for total nitrogen tn reduction regarding total phosphorus tp the reduction potential would increase 226 for fertilization reduction and remain approximate for grasslands at median 4 due to winter reduction of loads no plough stubble fields and winter cover crops would decrease by as much as 50 12 and 26 respectively for tn and 30 11 and 17 respectively for tp compared to the historical period the greatest change would be recorded for the most extreme cc scenario rcp8 5 and the longest time horizon end century the effectiveness of bmps except for no plough for tn load reduction would increase more and on average would become greater in agriculture dominated areas of central northern lithuania than elsewhere although the maximum reduction values would occur in western and in some cases eastern lithuania except for reduced fertilization this suggests the importance of the application of the measures in both areas bmps except for grasslands are expected to have relatively little effect on the overall crop yield keywords bmp climate change impacts agriculture swat model lithuania 1 introduction water resources are subject to multiple stressors directly and indirectly created by humans among them the impact of climate change cc and agricultural non point source nps pollution are the primary factors affecting water availability and quality around the globe khatri and tyagi 2014 scherger et al 2022 according to eea 2020 approximately 50 of surface water and 25 of ground water bodies in the european union eu were in less than good condition in 2016 most of them failed to achieve good status due to nps pollution moreover water problems are exacerbated by the intensification of climate warming cc redistributes water flows makes dry areas drier and wet areas wetter lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 next to the redistribution of water flows increased nutrient losses particularly nitrogen from the soils are potentially accelerated as well barclay and walter 2015 øygarden et al 2014 along with temperature increases the intensification of loss of total nitrogen and total phosphorus tn and tp may further aggravate the already serious eutrophication problems in places such as the baltic sea helcom 2018 moreover this process by itself may turn water bodies into large sources of greenhouse gas emissions li et al 2021 further intensifying cc and consequently nps pollution problems the development of resilient agricultural systems capable of buffering cc impacts on agricultural production as well as protection of aquatic systems is therefore of the highest priority eea 2020 such resilient agricultural systems require effective strategies of agricultural water pollution reduction in order to improve the efficiency of agricultural systems brouziyne et al 2018 particularly by identifying weather resilient solutions bosch et al 2018 according to a number of authors effective reduction of agricultural nps agri nps water pollution should take into account changes in the environment resulting from cc brouziyne et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 wallace et al 2017 xu et al 2019 studies show bosch et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 that cc will likely increase the cost of meeting water quality goals in water bodies affected by agriculture for instance in the nordic baltic region higher temperatures may increase nitrogen mineralisation and increased precipitation in the cold period may create more favourable conditions for nitrate no3 n leaching molina navarro et al 2018 next to increasing nutrient loads cc is likely to change the spatial distribution patterns of agri nps and cause substantial changes in areas identified as critical source areas renkenberger et al 2017 because targeting bmps in such areas yields considerable reductions in pollution loads piniewski et al 2021 wagena and easton 2018 xu et al 2019 successful meeting of water policy targets requires planning for their changes the identification of the most effective cc resilient pollution reduction strategy therefore requires examining how cc changes spatial agri nps patterns because future changes cannot be assessed through monitoring environmental modelling remains the most important tool available for this type of research multiple studies have been published evaluating water pollution from the perspective of cc by applying models such as swim hesse et al 2014 vemala huttunen et al 2015 mike she vansteenkiste et al 2013 and many others andersen et al 2006 barclay and walter 2015 huttunen et al 2021 olsson et al 2016 although other models have been applied successfully the soil and water assessment tool swat model remains one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models across the globe gassman and yingkuan 2015 this semi distributed process based model allows for the examination of multiple environmental processes arnold et al 1998 it has been widely applied in hydro climatic studies tan et al 2020 the swat model has also been used extensively for the assessment of water policy and management options andersen et al 2016 hesse et al 2014 huttunen et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 piniewski et al 2021 thodsen et al 2017 the advantages of the swat model include its past successful application in many studies integrating cc and agri nps pollution reduction issues bosch et al 2018 brouziyne et al 2018 jeon et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 teshager et al 2017 wagena and easton 2018 woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 xu et al 2019 many studies have already identified the significance of cc in designing nps pollution reduction programmes and approached the issue from different perspectives while also applying the swat model for example the study by pandey et al 2021 identified critical sub watersheds where bmps application is the most effective and determined how this effectiveness may change depending on cc woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 investigated uncertainties related to agri bmps implementation in changing climate in a us lake watershed wallace et al 2017 assessed the effectiveness of combined agri bmps under cc in a small us catchment brouziyne et al 2018 evaluated different cc adaptation strategies with agri bmps application for improved crop water productivity while preserving hydrological resources in the study by jeon et al 2018 swat modeling of bmps under cc was integrated with the artificial intelligence model to perform trade off analysis between economic and environmental objectives in another study wagena and easton 2018 examined 4 bmps in a large scale us watershed and concluded that cc impacts could be offset with additional bmps although such strategies should take into account pollutant swapping risks next to assessing the effects of bmps on changing climate bosch et al 2018 also calculated the economic costs of meeting water protection goals depending on the cc scenario the costs of pollution reduction were also examined by xu et al 2019 including the targeting option the study by teshager et al 2017 combined multiple bmps into five strategies tested with cc in the context of nutrient sediment loss agricultural production and water availability despite the abundance of studies examining cc impacts on bmps effectiveness we were not able to find studies covering the entire country as the study object such an approach would be important in reference to the attainment of water management goals that in most cases are set at the country level we therefore selected lithuania as the study object the country lacked this kind of assessments moreover we focused on evaluating numerous patterns associated with changes in agri bmps effectiveness due to the impact of cc in the spatial or temporal dimension such information is important in building a weather resilient agricultural nps pollution abatement strategy it is the essential component of tackling the problems of baltic sea helcom 2018 and inland water eutrophication in lithuania eea 2020 2018 the objectives of this study were as follows 1 assessment of the effects of agri bmps on water balance and nutrient loads 2 evaluation of change in agri bmps effectiveness due to cc 3 indication of important spatial and temporal patterns in agri bmps effectiveness and impacts on crop yields 2 materials and methods this study is built on the foundation laid in the article by plunge et al 2021 and the work of the environmental protection agency of lithuania which built its river modeling system by integrating swat 2012 model and phyton scripts its detailed

and nutrient load modelling results for cc scenarios etc this section summarises information needed to facilitate the understanding of the issue with more detailed explanations provided for methods relevant for this study 2 1 study area an important feature of this study is the selection of the entire country of lithuania as the study area this perspective is meaningful because serious management issues are usually resolved and water policies are set at the national level small scale or large scale covering many countries or even continents studies provide some important insights the different scales of such studies however frequently lead to the failure to address the application of the results in the actual policies the model was therefore set up for the entire country it also covered relevant external areas generating inflow to the territory the model area in fig 2 plunge et al 2021 covers lithuania 65 300 km2 in fine detail and belarus 45 463 km2 for the nemunas basin and 488 km2 for the daugava basin and poland 2516 km2 of nemunas basin in coarse detail the results section presents only modelling results obtained for the lithuanian territory areas covered by the fine detail model are dominated by agriculture accounting for approximately 59 of lithuania followed by forests 30 water bodies 2 urban built up areas 3 and other areas 6 plc 7 2019 areas outside lithuania are also primarily occupied by agriculture covering 49 of the territory and forests 47 other types of land use are relatively insignificant including water 1 urban built up areas 0 4 and other 3 pakhomau 2016 the declared crop data collected by the agriculture information and rural business centre from 2012 covering agricultural areas were used in the model as baseline crop data the largest areas were used for pastures occupying 18 of lithuania s territory followed by winter wheat 6 5 barley 3 2 rape 3 1 summer wheat 2 8 winter triticale 1 4 and oats 1 2 2 climate change data meteorological data necessary for cc impact modelling were obtained from the european coordinated regional climate downscaling euro cordex programme 2 2 data available at https www euro cordex net the finest available resolution eur 11 0 11 degrees or 12 5 km in regional climate models rcm was selected although the rcms were different global climate models gcms used in setting boundary conditions for rcms in some cases were the same seven combinations were selected to avoid skewed results due to deviations in single climate model input data this approach is recommended by many authors rathjens et al 2016 singh 2016 two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were selected for modelling representing the intermediate rcp4 5 and worst case rcp8 5 cc scenarios daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature data were used other weather variables wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were generated by means of an internal swat weather generator by applying statistical parameters calculated from historical meteorological data statistical bias correction to local stations data from 18 national stations were used was applied to precipitation and temperature cc data the local intensity scaling and linear scaling methods were applied for the bias correction of temperature distribution mapping was used for precipitation with the application of the cmhyd programme rathjens et al 2016 more details are provided in the article by plunge et al 2021 the swat model was run for the period 1994 2099 the 6th year was used for model warm up with prepared rcms data to keep consistency with the rest of the time series the historical period was modelled with rcms data results processing involved the selection of three periods of 20 years for the assessment and presentation of results the historical period included the time interval of 2000 2019 mid century 2040 2059 and end century 2080 2099 table 1 presents the selection of cc rcm models used in this study the table also provides information on the used rcms data mean deviations from historical period averages data for 18 national meteorological stations were used in the calculation 2 3 best management practices the selection of the best agri bmps for modelling purposes was based on the lithuanian environmental protection agency s screening plunge 2020 the screening report published on the institution s webpage 3 3 the report in lithuanian language is available at https vanduo old gamta lt files savadas html identified the most cost effective measures for reducing agricultural water pollution which also could be modelled at scale with the swat model the screening was performed by modeling 12 different agri bmps on a watershed of 1140 km2 with agricultural land occupying approximately 62 in the middle of lithuania with the swat model the cost effectiveness of measures reducing nutrient loads were evaluated and compared to similar results in studies and reports published by other agencies based on the screening results the following bmps were selected 1 converting arable land to perennial grasslands grassland 2 reduced fertilization by 10 from the baseline level fertilization 3 applying no plough or no till farming technology no plough 4 planting cover crops catch crops and keeping them through winter wintcrops 5 leaving stubble fields through winter stubblefields the selected bmps were used in modelling based on the swat model for the modelling scenarios selected bmps were simulated for all the applicable areas in lithuania the distribution of the application areas is presented in fig 3 the grassland bmp was applied to all areas identified as arable excluding the existing pastures these areas accounted for 1 291104 km2 or 19 8 of the country s territory the application area for the reduced fertilization bmp covered all areas identified as arable land and pastures the application territory occupied 2 249104 km2 or 34 4 of the country no plough technology was applied over areas used mostly for grain and rape growing such areas occupied 8611 km2 or 13 2 of the country areas covered with summer crops were eligible for winter cover crop growing they occupied 8398 km2 or 12 9 of the country the last bmp namely stubble fields in winter was also applied over areas with summer crops in the latter case however vegetable grown areas were excluded such areas covered 8082 km2 or 12 4 of the country grassland bmp in the swat model was implemented by converting the land cover of arable land to winter pasture wpas code in model library fertilization bmp was represented in the model by multiplying mineral and organic fertilizer used on agricultural land with a coefficient of 0 9 due to differences in crop fertilization rates between crops farm sizes and regions in absolute terms kg ha of reduced fertilizer the reduction also varied detailed information regarding baseline fertilization rates used in the model is provided in the paic 2015 report 59 72 pp no plough bmp was applied by substituting spring ploughing operation with no till mixing sprgplow to zerotill tillage codes according to the model library all other tillage operations were removed except for the fall plow operation which in no till agriculture is required every 3 4 years to unify annual management practices it was treated as an annual operation wintcrops bmp was introduced by planting winter rye rye code in the model library after harvesting the main summer crop moreover autumn tillage operations were removed winter catch crops kill operation in the model were done on 30 march manure applications were moved to spring only mineral nitrogen fertilizer amount was reduced by 10 and planting of summer crops was delayed by 2 weeks stubblefields bmp was implemented in the model by removing fall plough operations this measure was only applicable in the case of summer crops a detailed description of the rationale application areas and parameters for bmp implementation is presented in the report of paic 2015 2 4 scenarios and evaluation modelling of scenarios was based on the intersection between selected rcms rcps scenarios and bmps 5 bmps were applied separately each time over the maximum available territory available with each of 7 rcms data with each of 2 rcps scenarios no bmp scenario without additional bmps was also prepared for each of 7 rcms data and both rcps scenarios the model was therefore run a total of 84 times generating the same number of result sets the modelling results were retrieved from swat output sub for nutrient loads and output hru for yields files agri bmp effect for absolute values t y or kg ha year was calculated by subtracting results of the no bmp scenario from a specific bmp scenario for the same rcm rcp time period data were used the change in bmp load reduction potential in percentages was calculated by subtracting median results for the historical period specific bmp measure scenario from those of same measure cc scenario mid century or end century the subtraction result was divided by the historical period value and multiplied by 100 for percentage conversion 2 5 water bodies at risk from agriculture for water management purposes risk water body statuses were assigned to water bodies failing to meet good water quality criteria as defined by the national regulation am 2007 different types of pressures are responsible for the deterioration of the status of water bodies the most profound pressure responsible for the largest part of risk water bodies in lithuania is agriculture plungė and gudas 2018 risk water body basins suffering from agricultural pressures in lithuania are presented in fig 4 because measures for management and agricultural water pollution reduction are focused on those areas it is important to investigate the effectiveness of bmp measures in risk basins and to verify if it is somehow different compared to the areas outside of the risk basins a relevant comparison was made but only for the rcp8 5 cc scenario representing the broadest interval of possible climate conditions 3 results 3 1 changes in nutrient load reduction according to the modelling results significant changes in nutrient loads reaching surface water bodies represented in the model in lithuania should be expected depending on the cc scenario and time period fig 5 shows that in the no bmp scenario without agri bmps application temperature driven nutrient mineralisation and increased leaching from soils due to cc are expected to cause a significant increase in nitrogen loads to surface water bodies the median increases in tn loads reach 23 1 for rcp4 5 scenario and 64 4 for rcp8 5 by the end century period on the other hand tp loads are expected to slightly decline the median results are 5 6 for rcp4 5 scenario and 7 4 for rcp8 5 by the end century period more in depth assessment of the effects of cc scenarios on water quantity and quality is presented in the article by plunge et al 2021 the effects of the application of agri bmp measures vary with different cc scenarios and time periods fig 5 the reduction of fertilization by 10 as a measure reduces more nutrient loads with more pronounced cc the modelling results show that in the rcp8 5 cc scenario for median tn results by mid century fertilization reduction increases load reduction by 94 7 compared to the historical period by end century this value increases up to 178 6 this change is mainly caused by the increased reduction of no3 n flows via tile drains by 139 1 and via lateral flows by 82 5 fig 6 by end century compared to the impact of bmp during the historical period a similar effect is observed for tp loads except for the historical period when tp loads slightly increase with this bmp with the progress of climate warming however the measure becomes more effective in reducing tp the change in load reduction for the worst case scenario by end century compared to the historical period is 226 this increase might be partly related to the fact that increased water flows with cc would increase leaching of nutrients from fertilizer application this also applies to plant growth which will be negatively affected with unstable climate patterns the reduction of fertilizer application bmp is therefore expected to have a stronger effect in the future as the capability of plants to absorb nutrients from fertilizers become negatively affected different effects should be expected regarding no plough application with progressing cc this measure becomes less effective for instance this measure loses its median tn load reduction potential for the worst case scenario by 34 in mid century and by 49 9 by end century period for tp the values reach 20 6 and 30 1 for the same periods respectively such losses result from the fact that while cc reduces snow cover and melting it also reduces surface runoff when conventionally tilled soil surface is substituted with no till it results in an effective ceasing of erosion related flow of nutrients from such soils to water bodies this is evident in the observation of the modelling results with historical data as cc progresses however the reduced snow melt related surface water flow transports less nutrients from fields therefore the diminishing role of this pollution pathway diminishes the effectiveness of this bmp the surface runoff might actually increase with this measure comparing no bmp and bmp scenarios for same period by a small amount less than 1 nevertheless this flow appears insufficient to offset the effect of lost snow melt water load reduction on grasslands appears to only substantially change in the most extreme cc scenario it increases only for tn by 17 4 for the worst case cc scenario by end century period while tp remains on the same level a change of approximately 4 for the same scenario and period the analysis of detailed variables fig 6 reveals that this measure is effective in reducing nutrient loss both in surface runoff and in subsurface flow pathways the intensification of cc reduces the grassland effect of holding nitrogen pollution traveling via surface runoff loss of organic nitrogen retaining capacity by 29 6 and organic phosphorus by 25 8 for the worst case scenario by end century surface runoff decreases followed by less pollution by this pathway yet the potential of this bmp is increased for trapping nutrient pollution supplied by subsurface pathways it is determined by several factors a decrease in plant nutrient uptake with cc intensification is much lower for grasslands compared to agricultural crops moreover a lower rate of fertilization on grasslands like in the fertilization reduction bmp provides a higher yield with cc intensification a reduction of tn and no3 n loads in tile drains is expected to increase by 99 5 and 62 1 respectively for the worst case scenario by end century the same trend is observed for phosphorus for this variable plant uptake increasing with cc intensification is responsible for increased reduction of soluble p load these two phenomena loss of potential to trap nutrients transported via surface flows and its increase for subsurface pathways balance each other out and the potential of the measure to reduce nutrient loads remains more or less constant with the exception of tn in the rcp8 5 climate change scenario for end century where more extreme warming tips the scales with increased importance of subsurface pathways and their reductions stubble fields left through winter lose their potential to reduce both tn and tp with increased cc intensity however the differences between median results in the intermediate and worst case cc scenarios are negligible the loss of potential of tn load reduction for the end century of the rpc4 5 scenario is 9 1 and for tp 7 1 within the rcp8 5 scenario for the same period the losses of tn and tp reach 12 5 and 11 2 respectively the extreme cc scenario changes uncertainty bounds for the possible results as in the no plough bmp according to results in fig 6 the reduction of effectiveness for this agri bmp is related to the overall reduction of the amounts of surface runoff linked to the reduced amounts of water generated by snow melt the loss of the capability to trap organic nitrogen related to surface flow reaches 23 5 for the worst case scenario s end century period although the nutrient loss mechanisms are similar stubble fields remain a significantly more effective measure than no plough this result of better nutrient retention in the soil is related to the fact that in this bmp soils and plant roots are left intact through winter while it is not the case for no plough bmp nutrient load reduction potential for winter cover crops also decreases with cc intensification this decrease for the intermediate scenario by end century for tn is 10 6 and for total phosphorus 8 2 for the worst case scenario the values are 26 1 for tn and 16 7 tp as with other bmps the loss of potential is connected to the reduction of surface runoff pathways in comparison with stubble fields however the loss in nutrient trapping capacity is more extreme for the rcp8 5 cc scenario by end century differences in evapotranspiration changes provide a clue for why this occurs in the rcp8 5 cc scenario evapotranspiration does not further increase with temperature a 12 1 decrease compared to the historical period due to extreme temperature warming exerting pressure on winter cover crop plants resulting in less reliable plant growth it should be emphasised that the model assumes harvesting of regular crops much earlier with cc already in june due to the heat unit operation scheduling used in the model because winter cover crops in the model are planted shortly after harvesting a practice applied currently by end century winter cover crops are planted as early as july with average temperatures of approximately 30 c in the extreme cc scenario summer temperatures will obviously not be optimal for winter cover crops their optimal temperature is approximately 12 c therefore their functioning as nutrient trappers will suffer as well it is also worth emphasising that winter catch crops are not as dense as grassland plants therefore the crops will soak in excess nutrients from subsurface flow less effectively compared to grasslands because cc comes with more winter precipitation and lower evapotranspiration due to plant stress more precipitation will infiltrate and more nutrients will be washed out from soil 3 2 impact on the effectiveness of nutrient load reduction fig 7 presents detailed information for each pathway of nutrients and sediment loads the results were prepared by averaging results obtained at the model subbasin level for the entire territory of lithuania the figure shows mean changes for load variables that can be expected if agri bmp is applied on 1 ha of arable land the results show same patterns to those presented previously although comparing results on the same scale the analysis of tn and tp results shows that grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops have an average effectiveness on roughly the same level winter cover crops are marginally more effective compared to the other two yet it loses effectiveness with intensification of cc while the application of grasslands at least for tn in the rcp8 5 scenario gains effectiveness grasslands also grow effectiveness to trap nitrogen related to tile drain and lateral flow pathways which is expected to increase in importance with cc the two remaining bmps namely reduction of fertilization and no plough reach a completely different level the application of no plough on same area produces around ten times less impact for tn and five times less for tp reduction of fertilization has an even lesser effect moreover it is only effective for nitrogen reduction 3 3 agri risk basins according to fig 8 and fig 9 the only measure evidently more effective in agri risk areas is the reduction of fertilization interestingly this measure for tn becomes more effective with the intensification of climate warming although it is only the case for agri risk areas the changes for non risk basins are considerably lower for tp reduction effectiveness also increases with cc intensification this bmp however is expected to reliably produce reductions only for agri risk areas in non risk areas certain reductions can be expected only for the conditions of the most extreme climate change for the remaining four pollution abatement measures the patterns are similar for tp variable they are all significantly less effective in agri risk areas compared to non risk basins moreover climate warming is not observed to change this pattern in any significant way tn patterns are more interesting all four measures for the historical period are less effective in agri risk areas for grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops however cc intensification swaps the effectiveness density distributions as a result with the most intensive climate warming the measures become more effective in agri risk basins this is because tn loads are expected to increase substantially in these areas plunge et al 2021 for the no plough measure its effectiveness in agri risk areas remains on the lower end compared to non risk areas 3 4 crop yields beside the hydrology and nutrient loads to surface water bodies cc is expected to change crop yields important to consider when planning the pollution reduction strategy according to the results presented in fig 10 without any bmps climate warming would reduce yields the results presented in the figure are averaged for all crops within each rcm data variation in 7 datasets represented by boxplots width cc scenario and period the more extreme scenario takes place the more reduction can be expected due to more frequent unfavourable weather conditions as was already mentioned the model assumes crops would be planted and harvested earlier less stable weather patterns would also provide less than optimal conditions for them regarding changes resulting from the application of bmps different patterns could be distinguished cc impacts the loss of yields from fertilization reduction the more intensive cc the lesser yield drop is expected because yields would primarily be more affected by climate and unstable weather than fertilization reduction cc is also likely to increase the growth of grasslands compared to crops that might be due to the fact that grasslands grow continually and with cc grass would extend its growth into the cold period nov to apr while other crops might suffer from climate extremes from cc it is important to emphasise that the baseline in the case of grassland bmp was cropland converted to grasslands therefore the initial loss of yield in this case represents lower level of yields obtained from grasslands compared to averaged values from cropland regarding no plough application warming related to cc appears to result in a positive effect on yields as well with changing climate however stubble fields and winter cover crops would negatively affect yields the most likely reason for this would be associated with weather conditions in the warm season may to oct increasingly stressful for main crops with cc intensification it should be emphasised that stubble fields and no plough bmps show very good performance in terms of changes in yields in the context of cc the former even results in a yield increase while the latter ensures basically unchanged yield both bmps result in relatively lower losses of nutrients more of them therefore become available during the vegetation season to help boost the yields moreover stubble in stubble fields represents an additional source of nutrients winter crops would slightly diminish the yields with the exception of a significant drop for grasslands however all bmps are generally expected to have little effect on overall crop yields 3 5 spatial results the spatial dimension is very important in the assessment of the effectiveness of measures fig 11 and fig 12 present maps with the colour of basins depending on the average effectiveness of measures in those basins if bmps could be applied the presented results were obtained using subbasins level output recalculating for areas of the applied measures hollow areas represent model subbasins without suitable areas for selected agri bmp the map providing results for tn shows that the change in the spatial distribution of effects of fertilization reduction bmp is the most pronounced in the context of cc this bmp becomes more efficient with cc intensification in the middle of lithuania where most agricultural land is concentrated and the least precipitation is common similar patterns are observed for fertilization effects on tp loads although their reduction potential is somewhat less concentrated compared to tn the remaining four measures show patterns similar to one another tp reduction is more effective in areas where precipitation levels are the highest in lithuania climate warming does not have a strong impact on those patterns regarding tn reduction the western and in some cases north eastern or eastern parts of the country are areas most efficient to target with the measures i e in these areas the effects per hectare could reach the highest levels on the other hand to achieve the complete image of the situation the maps should be examined together with fig 8 and fig 9 in this context although grassland stubble field and winter cover crops remain with high nutrient load reduction values in the hills of western and eastern lithuania or the north eastern part of the country the most frequent dense or average values evidently increase due to cc in central and northern lithuania s agricultural heartland agri risk area although the latter values are much lower than maximum value in no risk basins they are more spatially widespread and more abundant 4 discussion the study results show that cc is an important factor changing the effectiveness of agri bmps used for nps reduction and it is important to account for it in designing water pollution abatement programmes this conclusion is in agreement with other available studies for instance qiu et al 2020 evaluating bmps under cc in a watershed of chinese reservoir concluded that cc would reduce the efficiency of bmps which is important to take into consideration when planning watershed management loss for agri bmp effectiveness is confirmed in the study by renkenberger et al 2017 who also determined that critical source areas for nps pollution would increase as well according to his study bmps designed to reach water management targets under current climate conditions will become insufficient with climate change these conclusions are in line with our results for increased nitrogen pollution our study was focused on the impact of cc on agri bmp effectiveness through time in lithuania and the investigation of the underlying reasons for expected changes the results reveal that the redistribution of flows due to cc is probably the most important factor for these changes the diminishment of the importance of surface runoff is associated with the loss of snow cover with cc intensification this would reduce the effectiveness of agri bmps targeting this nutrient loss pathway the loss of effectiveness is significant for no tillage agriculture and stubble fields left through winter such impacts were confirmed by several studies pandey et al 2021 wagena and easton 2018 wallace et al 2017 the redistribution of flows and loss of snow melt runoff due to cc is widely expected among scientists akstinas et al 2019 arheimer et al 2005 čerkasova 2019 jakimavičius et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 other hydrological changes expected in northern countries including lithuania include increased rainfall and water flows particularly during the cold nov mar period lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 šarauskienė et al 2018 water flows infiltrating the soil also increase leaching of nitrogen from soils during the period without vegetation øygarden et al 2014 rising temperatures increase mineralisation of organic nitrogen barclay and walter 2015 leading to even more leaching from the soils according to our results agri bmps that in combination decreased surface water flows increased water percolation and subsequently subsurface flow as well as stable plant cover such as grasslands reduced nitrate input to soils like the reduction of fertilization tended to be positively affected by the intensification of cc teixeira et al 2021 however presented results for winter cover crops that show increasing effectiveness with cc for some areas in new zealand qiu et al 2020 showed that the reduction of fertilization might be losing effectiveness with cc in a chinese watershed contrary to our results these effects however varied depending of the climate model and period they are also geographically distant to lithuania s conditions and therefore might not be comparable the study demonstrated that the most promising measures for tn and tp reduction in terms of their effectiveness with the largest reductions of nutrients per area of application are grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops no plough bmp appears to be the least effective one it is rather difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of fertilization because its effect strongly depends on the level of ambition 10 reduction was selected for the study and the actual levels of fertilization practices fertilization rates are not well accounted for in lithuania it was therefore assumed that fertilizer is not over used which most likely is not the case regarding grasslands in theory this measure could be applied over the largest total territory with the exception of fertilizer but its overall appeal and social acceptability could only become high in the case of enhancement of animal husbandry which seems to be the case in strategical agricultural policy documents otherwise widespread adoption of this bmp would significantly lower agricultural yields with grasslands replacing a lot of crops a solution potentially unacceptable for the agricultural sector notwithstanding this grasslands and fertilization seem to increase in effectiveness with cc which raises the environmental appeal for those measures on the other hand no plough winter crops and stubble fields bmps are expected to become less effective or remain stable for the reduction of nutrient loads with cc the attractiveness of those bmps is related to rather neutral effect on crop yields including positive effects in the case of stubble fields with the assumption of two annual cycles of planting and harvesting total crop yields might be much higher but the negative effects of increased nutrient leaching should also be expected the analysis of maximum and most frequent nutrient reduction values for grasslands stubble fields winter crops and no plough bmps suggests the importance of application of those measures both in non risk basins of western and sometimes eastern lithuania where maximum values will prevail and in agri risk basins central and northern lithuania where the overall level of effectiveness is expected to rise with cc for the purposes of inland water protection more emphasis should be put on the aforementioned bmp application in agricultural risk areas with the highest number of affected rivers and lakes water reservoirs on the other hand for the sake of the baltic sea protection particular attention should be paid to bmp application in western lithuania because the territory constitutes a nearby pollution source for the baltic sea it is important to emphasise that it is the first time the country scale approach for the assessment of bmps effectiveness is employed in lithuania in the context of cc such approach is more suitable for small countries with somewhat homogenous environmental conditions while it might result in a certain loss of some detailed information the approach might be of practical importance by potentially facilitating well informed decisions while drafting water management plans strategies and policies country wide modelling is essential when it comes to planning pollution load reduction targets and measures in the baltic sea and the curonian lagoon because all the pollution generated in the territory of lithuania is carried to the baltic sea excluding retention and losses via other pathways it is worth mentioning that the results of the study bear an additional important political signal that was not possible to convey before cc will likely have an effect of a manifold exacerbation on diffuse pollution problems and some of bmps are expected to emerge as more promising than they are now and more effective than some of the bmps now considered the most effective ones in terms of scientific value the inclusion of the cc component into bmps effectiveness assessment constitutes a scientific novelty in lithuania it may help foster other studies to deepen the knowledge on this particular topic future efforts should be focused on the assessment and design of existing and planned water protection programs which would apply results of this or similar studies to deliver effective climate resilient water management tools and plans 5 conclusion achievement of water related environmental targets in the baltic sea and inland waters is a huge challenge in itself especially when the main pressure comes from diffuse pollution sources climate change on the other hand adds even more uncertainty into possibilities to achieve the targets the study thus aimed at the assessment of cc implications on the effectiveness of agricultural bmps with a view to come up with some recommendations as to which measures would become more promising than others in the future the study revealed that cc will generally increase diffuse pollution loads to water bodies by up to 64 4 of tn for the worst case cc scenario the greatest change is expected for the most extreme cc scenario rcp8 5 and the longest time horizon end of century rising nutrient leaching from soils will be driven by increased rainfall and water flows particularly during the cold period as well as by increased mineralisation of organic nitrogen because of rising temperatures in terms of pollution reduction effectiveness the most promising measures in all periods including historical and cc scenarios are grasslands stubble fields and winter cover crops however with cc the effectiveness of grasslands would increase even more by up to 17 in the case of reduced fertilization bmp increase would be even more significant by 179 and 226 for tn and tp respectively fertilization reduction could become much more important in the future if actual over fertilization level is much higher than modestly assumed 10 from optimal one on the other hand no plough winter crops and stubble fields are expected to become less effective with cc down to 50 12 and 26 respectively for tn and to 30 11 and 17 respectively for tp the drop in effectiveness is related to the loss of importance of surface runoff due to the loss of snow cover with cc intensification since those bmps target this nutrient loss pathway the study also demonstrated differences in bmp implementation spatial aspects depending on priority objectives if the achievement of good status in inland waters would be the main goal more emphasis should be put on bmp application in agricultural risk areas central lithuania on the other hand for the sake of the baltic sea protection particular attention should be paid to bmp application in western lithuania because the territory constitutes a nearby pollution source for the baltic sea in addition study results imply that cc is important to account for in designing water pollution abatement policy and programmes and they provide hints on how best to account for cc in particular the study conveys an important political signal cc will significantly exacerbate the existing diffuse pollution problem thus even more pollution abatement efforts will be necessary in the future furthermore with this study it is the first time the country scale approach for bmps effectiveness assessment in lithuania in the context of cc was employed although it might result in some loss in precision the approach might be of practical importance by facilitating well informed water management decisions our conclusion is that country scale proved suitable for small countries with somewhat homogenous environmental conditions it should be noted that the inclusion of the cc component into bmps effectiveness assessment constitutes a scientific novelty in lithuania it may help foster other studies to deepen the knowledge on this topic future efforts should be focused on search for optimal cost effective solutions to deal with diffuse pollution problem in a changing climate and drawing climate resilient water management tools and plans credit authorship contribution

9529,a robust water supply system is significant to the local ecosystem of riparian vegetation in the arid basin considering the elasticity and relative importance of ecological water use in different regions of the basin this study defines the ecological water rights on a multi year scale divides the priority of those rights based on the ecological network and proposes a rights allocation method the application of the method to the mainstream watershed of tarim river in china shows that when the overall available ecological water is only 77 of the ecological water demand it can ensure that the ecological water demand of vegetation in important areas is fully met and the growth condition is good however the demand in non important areas must be less than 50 and the growth condition will deteriorate this method expands the existing definition and distribution of water rights and the approach of coupling ecological networks can be used for the efficient management of ecological water supply in other arid basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecological water rights arid basin ecological network riparian vegetation tarim river 1 introduction water is one of the most crucial factors maintaining the stability and integrity of dryland ecosystems bennetsen et al 2016 boithias et al 2016 gu et al 2016 in arid regions the ecological processes are more strongly influenced by the hydrological cycle daessle et al 2016 which also indicates the knowledge gaps remain in policy decision related to sustainable ecological development in areas bodin 2017 desert riparian vegetation is vital to arid ecosystems however its growth and distribution are restricted by water supply agapiou et al 2016 given the increase of water demand caused by the economical development the available water resources for desert riparian vegetation becomes more scarce wang et al 2015 and more vulnerable to the impact of the manmade water conservancy projects consequently the ecological water rights determining the amount and period of water supply for riparian vegetation in arid regions must be evaluated to devise methods for alleviating water shortage and other water related problems in the desert riparian ecosystem ye et al 2014 it is important to keep the balance between economic and ecological water demands in river basins in drylands calzadilla et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 previous studies suggested that water shortage water use efficiency and water resource protection could benefit from establishing water rights wang et al 2017 di et al 2020 fei et al 2021 ecological water rights are established to protect rivers lakes and natural ecosystems cao et al 2011 according to studies few countries have regulations and laws in place to guarantee ecological water rights while water resource managers may not consider the ecological benefits of the rights cong and ni 2006 zhang and zhang 2007 however the determination of ecological water rights is a prerequisite to implement sustainable ecological protections ye et al 2020 and more efficiently use and protect water resources in drylands the ecological water rights in desert riparian vegetation ecosystems rely on the ecological water demand which can guarantee the normal growth of vegetation and cure its further deterioration si et al 2015 most studies have investigated the ecological water demand at the basin level over the time scale of a year ling et al 2016 which implies that the ecological water rights were viewed as macro descriptions of ecological water use for basin water resources management zheng et al 2008 however the coarse spatial scale makes it difficult to match the ecological water rights with the demand in a given area ye et al 2020 therefore the ecological water rights must be evaluated on a finer spatial scale the allocation of ecological water rights is different from that of industrial agricultural and domestic water rights due to the unique characteristics of the ecosystem kapetas et al 2019 first to ensure ecological water rights authorities must supply water at flexible amount and period as ecosystems can adapt to the water resources availability villeneuve et al 2015 for example trees in drylands such as populus euphratica oliv can subsist on small amounts of water over several years unlike agriculture and industries which have a relatively rigid requirement of water rights therefore a practicable range for ecological water rights must be determined ling et al 2014 huge disparity exists in the water condition and landscape of desert riparian vegetation which make different areas meet different needs like living and migration of the wildlife thriving in desert riparian vegetation ecosystems zuliani et al 2021 this spatial disparity in terms of ecological functions indicates that the priority of water rights is different at the regional scale studies on water rights priority have introduced the principle of prior occupancy kim 2011 water value lee et al 2020 and risk bearing ability li et al 2017 however they did not consider the spatial difference of ecological functions lee et al 2020 in a previous study we found that the ecological network can be used to describe this difference lacher et al 2014 the supporting functions of wildlife activities in the target water catchment area in ecological networks can be introduced in priority identification for ecological water rights the creation of rights reflecting vegetation characteristics xu et al 2007 and relevant supporting functions of wildlife activities will benefit vegetation growth and improve animal habitat conditions livesley et al 2021 which is of more practical significance to arid and water scarce regions this study allocates the ecological water rights for the protection of ecosystems in the upper and middle reaches of the mainstream of the tarim river basin mtrb in arid western china in addition to riverbed leakage another major source of ecological water in riparian vegetation systems in the region is diverted water from the ecological gates of the mtrb to satisfy the limitation of the total volume of available ecological water ecological water rights must be allocated at the gate scale the efficiency of water supply must be maximized zhang et al 2019 and the water demand of vegetation in the important areas playing key roles in riparian vegetation ecosystems must be considered to meet these objectives first we defined the ecological water rights for the mrtb as the maximum water diversion from each ecological gate over several years second we extracted an ecological network of the mtrb to distinguish the high priority water supply regions subsequently we proposed an optimal model for ecological water usage considering the ecosystem service function value based on this we employed two different processes of water rights allocation and evaluated their results finally we discussed the findings and provided conclusions 2 framework for water rights allocation by ecological network it is considered to be a benefit to manage both river and river basin as the responsibility of the regional government dong et al 2018 meyer and diez 2015 which is also very conducive to the implementation of the policies of sustainable plans wang et al 2019 however knowledge gaps in the decision evidence still remain to what extent usage for ecological water bodin 2017 a framework for water rights allocation was proposed in this study as described below 2 1 ecological water rights common water rights frameworks include riparian rights prior appropriation and public rights among three different water rights types the public water rights recognize water for public environmental benefits lukasiewicz and dare 2016 in generally the prior appropriation rights is more common in water scarce regions than the water abundant regions wang et al 2009 which lead to the water shortages will be first borne by water right holders with the least priorities in these areas in arid and semi arid areas ecological water rights have become a vital issue facing scarce water situations ye et al 2014 argued that the establishment of ecological rights is the basis for restoring the fragile environment in arid areas as a typical inland river basin it is reported to have a mixture of prior appropriation rights and public rights for the allocation of water flowing through the upper and middle reaches of mtrb he and tang 2007 since there is a lack of tarim river ecological compensation regulations which was proposed by some researchers ye et al 2014 the ecological water rights didn t have high priority in tarim river basin the water rights for residential consumption industry and domestic uses have a high priority followed by the agricultural water rights in mtrb since local agriculture is the pillar of the local social economy and has been going on for decades the regional administrations operate in management mode implementing sustainable environmental policies with the lowest annual quantity limit according to the water amount flowing in mtrb this situation leads to the fact that the satisfy of ecological water demand in the mtrb mainly depends on the division of water of gates chen et al 2016 the quantity of ecological water rights in mtrb is limited as the difference of the water amount flowing minus the amount of described higher priority water rights considering the loss of water transport in the river channel it is focused on the internal allocation within these ecological water rights in this study a reasonable method of determining the total ecological water rights should consider the water availability in the arid region in general the water supply for production and human living take priority over that for the ecology which leads to the latter s shortage in some years however the water rights should balance the water demand of vegetation and the water supply over several years therefore the ecological water rights need to be set on the multi year scale that is the total quantity of ecological water right of an ecological gate over x years is set as x times the annual water demand of vegetation in the water supply region the value of x can be determined by the characteristics of water demand of vegetation ling et al 2016 the annual ecological water demand d i in a region can be calculated as 1 d i iu 1 v i m iu w iu where i is the number of gates iu are the different types of vegetation m iu is the plant area hm2 and w iu is the annual water demand quota of the different types of vegetation m3 hm2 in order to avoid the uncertainty of d i ralted to the deviation of w iu three different methods the phreatic evaporation method the averyanov formula and the area quota method were employed for determination of values of w iu the arithmetic average values of these values were used in this study by following the treatment of previous literature ye et al 2010 li et al 2018 2 2 ecological network tens of thousands of parcels of land have been irrigated along the mtrb scattering the native flora yu 1996 proposed the ecological network to restructure the ecological patterns for sustainability and health and for the promotion of species migration among habitat patches amid scarcity of water resources at the basin scale the ecological network links the biophysical processes and land use status seriously affected by human activities around the whole basin bodin 2017 which may benefit sustainable environment protection in arid regions a typical ecological network consists of three parts habitat stepping stone and ecological corridor habitat is the area suitable for the thriving of species stepping stone also known as temporary resting region is a niche patch of temporary habitat in the process of species migration and ecological corridor is a linear or zonal layout area connecting the habitat and the stepping stone for improving the ability of species to migrate and communicate an ecological network is constructed in three steps 1 habitats and stepping stones are identified 2 the resistance values are set 3 the ecological network is generated using various cost models in this study the minimum cumulative resistance model mcrm was used to generate an ecological corridor the mcrm uses the simple algebraic rule of calculating the species migration path from the shortest cost distance between the starting point source and the target point yu 1996 based on gridded landscape resistance regions the model is based on the node link pixel mapping expression algorithm from the graph theory and can be defined as 2 a 1 cost 1 cost 2 2 3 a 2 2 cost 2 cost 3 2 4 accum cost i 1 n a i where cost 1 cost 2 and cost 3 are the resistance costs of pixel 1 pixel 2 and pixel 3 respectively a 1 is the total resistance cost of vertical or horizontal connection from pixel 1 to pixel 2 a 2 is the total resistance cost of diagonal connection from pixel 2 to pixel 3 accum cost n is the cumulative drag cost of moving from pixel 1 to pixel n and a i is the drag cost of moving from pixel 1 to pixel n 2 3 grading of water rights by ecological network although the ecological gates along the mtrb were primarily constructed for the manual control of ecological systems they can also be used to reshape the ecological patterns of the mtrb especially when coupled with the ecological water rights allocation zhang et al 2004 the ecological network also reflects the relative importance of each ecological gate for the irrigated areas therefore the priority grades of ecological water rights were set to 1 2 and 3 for the ecological gates corresponding to habitat stepping stone and corridor the smaller grades are high priority if a gate does not correspond to the habitat stepping stone or corridor in its irrigated area its priority grade is 4 2 4 time sequence processes the time sequence allocation of ecological water rights is a periodic dynamic process that changes the inflow status the allocation is constrained to the total volume of ecological water rights as d i where x is a fixed number of years for water allocation eq 5 in addition the allocation should start from the gates with the highest priority water rights and then distribute to each gate gradewise within x years two schedules sequential water allocation schedule ss and forced water allocation schedule fs were proposed by following the rotation principle 2 4 1 sequential water allocation schedule ss according to the order grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 grade 4 water can be allocated to the lower priority grade ecological gate only after the water rights of the highest priority ecological gate are satisfied thus the water rights allocation was repeated in a cycle of different ecological gate grades by this process first the maximum water allocation of each gate in a year was quantified according to the degree of water shortage in that year for one gate the degree of water shortage is 5 s i l x d i aw i l x d i i g k where l represents the current year k represents the current ecological water rights grade k 1 2 3 and 4 and g k are the gates belonging to that grade s i l is the degree of water shortage aw i l m3 is the total volume of ecological water allocated to gate i since the starting year of the current round and up to the previous year for gates with s i l 0 eq 5 becomes x d i aw i l i e the total volume of accumulated water allocated is equal to the volume of water rights and the gates do not require water in the current year otherwise the gates have ecological water demand the maximum ecological water allocation in gates mw i l x 1 s i l d i which indicates that the ecological water demand in x years is satisfied second the remaining available ecological water in the current year should be calculated before the allocation of the k grade ecological water rights as 6 v l f l i g l q i l α i f l where v l is the remaining available water for the ecological gates at the control sections in the current year m3 g l is the gates to which the water supply has been allocated in the current year of the current round q i l is the volume of water allocated m3 f l is the total available ecological water in the control sections m3 α i is the water conveyance efficiency in different sections f l is the volume of water used in the previous cycle of water allocation at the control sections in the current year note that the ecological water rights allocation for the successive year can be transferred from the current year if the ecological water rights of the current grade are not fully satisfied in the current year then the ecological water rights allocation will strart from that grade in next year 2 4 2 forced water allocation schedule fs compared with the ss this schedule judges the mandatory start of a new allocation round suppose a certain cycle continues to the xth year after the start the beginning of a certain round of water allocation is the first year but the available water in this year has been exhausted and no grade of water rights has been fully satisfied then the current cycle of water allocation will terminate the period by the successive cycle of water allocation starting directly in the x 1 th year 2 5 water rights allocation 2 5 1 objective function the ecological water rights with the same grade will be allocated based on the ecosystem service value costanza et al 1997 referring to the benefits that human beings get directly or indirectly from the ecosystem the objective of the ecological water allocation is to achieve the maximum ecological benefits accumulated over the years and it is expressed as 7 max i g k p i dw i l aw i l 8 p i iu 1 4 e iu p iu θ iu d i where l is the current year k is the current ecological water rights grade and g k is the gates belonging to this grade k dw i l are the decision variables representing the water allocated to the gates in the current year p i is the ecosystem service values per unit water cny m3 iu is the type of vegetation p iu is the ecological values per unit area cny hm2 and θ iu is the revised factors related to p iu 2 5 2 constraints the volume of water allocated to the gates is the constraint on the available ecological water in the control section it can be defined as 9 i g k dw i l α i v l further constraints were applied on the upper and lower limits of ecological water rights allocation to reflect the differences in grades of the rights these constraints can be described as 10 a i x d i dw i l aw i l 1 b i x d i where a i and b i are the minimum and maximum allowable coefficients of water quantity at each gate the satisfying degree of available ecological water c can be defined as 11 c v i g k aw i l 1 α i i g k x d i α i as consist with the basic water allocation rules a i and b i should correlate with c under the following principles 1 the values of a i and b i decline with the decrease in c 2 high priority gates have larger a i and b i than the low priority ones under a constant c 3 a i and b i values should ensure that the available ecological water can be fully allocated 3 case study in tarim river basin 3 1 study area and data source 3 1 1 study area located in southern xinjiang the trb is one of the largest inland river basins in the arid region and suffers water scarcity the basin has garnered research focus for its unique and vulnerable ecology the trb has an extreme climate with a temperature ranging from 27 5 43 6 while the annual precipitation of the region is less than 100 mm with a large spatial variation in the basin the trb has nine tributaries aksu yarkant kaxgar hetian keriya weigan kuqa dina kaidu kongque and qarqan yu et al 2017 the basin has a vast desert riparian forest with the largest populus euphratica p euphratica population and various endemic fauna e g lepus yarkandensis or l yarkandensis reports claim that 54 of the world s p euphratica is distributed along the mtrb hukin et al 2005 the p euphratica population has been affected by the shortage of water resources chen et al 2016 l yarkandensis is a rare and endangered species endemic to the trb wu et al 2011 it relies on the riparian forest near the river for subsistence chapman and flux 2013 the mtrb has six water controlled hydro junctions along its stretch and 47 ecological gates to preserve natural ecological systems fig 1 most of the inflow of the mtrb is consumed by agricultural water demand in the region between xinqiman and yingbazha the rest of the water resource caters to ecological water demands 3 1 2 building of an ecological network l yarkandensis was selected as the simulation object for the ecological network a typical desert species l yarkandensis inhabit artificial reservoirs marshlands and river shores hui and zhao 2013 the ecological network with this species was generated by the following steps 3 1 2 1 step 1 spot habitat and stepping stone the habitat and stepping stone of l yarkandensis were defined by two regions 1 near the river and 2 within the lush vegetation such as p euphratica forest tamarix shrub etc the foraging area of l yarkandensis was generated by the intersection of the buffer zone from the tarim river to the areas of open woodland woodland and high coverage grassland in the basin based on a land use map the distance for generating the buffer zone according to the tracing distance of l yarkandensis was chosen as 1 km as per chen 2016 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map was used to distinguish the habitat and stepping stone corresponding to the high and medium ndvi areas we used the annual average value of the ndvi from jun to oct as n to distinguish the different ndvi grades the area with n 0 7 was defined as high ndvi area and the area with 0 5 n 0 7 as medium ndvi area finally based on field observation and investigation 4 habitats and 37 stepping stones were extracted from the upper and middle reaches of the trb by merging small patches and artificially processing the boundary line 3 1 2 2 step 2 set resistance value different land use types have different degrees of promotion of species movement as it needs to overcome the resistance of different land use as it emigrates in a horizontal space the resistance value was defined as the resistance cost of species crossing a specific land which was used as a quantitative expression of the migration process of the target species l yarkandensis in this study across different land use types the factors related to the resistance value in different land use types include the target species ecological habits and behavioral characteristics plant characteristics and land use status the resistance values in the mtrb ranged from 10 to 100 and the low value indicates a beneficial crossing environment for the target species liu et al 2019 meng et al 2016 with these factors we obtained the resistance values for different land use types table 1 3 1 2 3 step 3 generate ecological network as introduced in section 2 2 we employed the cost distance tool in arcgis using the mcrm and a python script for calculating the minimum cumulative cost distance of each pixel from the cost plane then the cost path tool was used to determine the path with the least resistance accumulation based on the gridded landscape resistance surface finally the ecological network of the upper and middle reaches of the tarim river was extracted fig 2 3 1 3 definition of ecological water rights and their grades according to the 2018 land use map of the trb guo et al 2017 the number of vegetation types was set to four by dividing the whole area into four types dredging forest land forested land low cover grassland and high cover grassland the corresponding w iu for these four types of land use were 4 45 104 30 42 104 6 28 104 and 23 40 104 m3 km2 by following the described method in section 2 1 the arithmetic average values of w iu were used in this study so that it is convenient to estimate the ecological water demand according to the land use data and our calculation is consistent with practical management wei et al 2018 the grading is listed in table s1 and the distribution of different grades is illustrated in fig 3 to maintain continuously distributed vegetation we defined the sub grade as 2 1 and 2 2 in grade 2 and 4 1 and 4 2 in grade 4 the water supply areas of subgrade 2 1 are concentrated and near the habitat and the water supply areas of subgrade 4 1 are also concentrated and near the habitat stepping stone and corridor 3 1 4 model calculations here we specify a few details for the calculation in eq 6 f l m3 represents the available water volume of the alar section for ecological gates in the current year α i the water conveyance efficiency of the section from the alar section to the section where the ecological gate is located and f the water volume of the alar section used for the last cycle of water allocation in the current year following wei et al 2018 we assumed the values of α i as 0 853 0 668 0 473 and 0 339 for the different river sections through xinqiman yingbazha wusiman and qiala respectively as the calculation refers to economic values we set p iu eq 8 for open woodland woodland low coverage grassland and high coverage grassland were selected as 302 302 232 and 232 cny hm2 according to costanza et al 1997 while θ iu was 0 7 1 5 0 5 and 1 5 respectively su et al 2006 note that the sum of the available water allocated to each gate is equal to the remaining available water volume in the alar section for ecological water demand the minimum and maximum allowable coefficients of water quantity defined as a i and b i in eq 10 at each gate was significantly affected by the quantity of water supply because the riparian vegetation in the mainstream of tarim river has a highly elastic water demand and no standards are available on the suitable or acceptable status of riparian vegetation in the basin for reference the determination of a suitable range of ecological water supply is difficult when the available water is insufficient therefore the calculation formulas of a i and b i table 2 are determined based on the experience of managers from watershed management agencies similarly tarebari et al 2018 determined the lower limits for water usages for domestic industrial enviromental and agricultural sectors based on expert opinion the allowable ranges of water volume for each grade of water rights are depicted in fig 4 to obtain the available water volume for riparian vegetation awe in the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb we used the annual water volume in the alar section to deduce the economic water consumption and the water required to be discharged to the lower reaches of tarim river the control section of qiala by using the ratio of annual vegetation water demand in the ecological gate water supply area to that in the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb ra the available water for gates awg at the alar station was obtained by multiplying ra with awe the 60 years sequence of the awg at the alar station was obtained from the annual water volume of the alar hydrological station from 1958 to 2017 by following the method mentioned above fig 5a as described by eq 6 f l must be determined to derive the water allocation cycles the awg series of the alar section was taken as the input of f l three different x values x 3 x 4 and x 5 where x is the fixed number of years for water allocation in eq 5 were set to derive the corresponding water allocation volumes with two proposed time sequence schedules section 2 4 3 2 water allocation cycles the awg process at the alar section is depicted in fig 5a the total volume of the awg in the section over 60 years is 23 305 billion m3 the total ecological water demand of all gates is 30 134 billion m3 in 60 years the ratio of the total available water of the total ecological water demand is 0 773 in any consecutive year 3 4 or 5 years the ratio of the total ecological water demand for all gates to the available water in the alar section was 0 33 1 02 0 47 0 97 and 0 52 0 91 with the medians being 0 7560 0 7505 and 0 7515 respectively consequently the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb have a deficit of ecological available water volume the results of water allocation rounds under three different x values are illustrated in fig 5b and c due to the water shortage none of the grades of water rights could be satisfied in 60 years in addition the water rights were met between 4 and 9 years which is longer than the calculated 3 5 years fig 5b the duration of a water allocation round depends on when the ecological available water can be sufficient for all water rights in that round as the total amount of ecological water available in x years can hardly equal the total amount of water demand the last year of the previous water allocation cycle overlapped the first year of the next one in fig 5c all water allocation rounds failed to meet the water rights grades and were terminated except the 20th round of water allocation under x 3 as the two previous consecutive years witnessed an extremely large volume of water regardless of the amount of available ecological water and whether the water rights of this round were fully satisfied each water distribution round will end after x years and the two consecutive water distribution rounds will not have any overlapping years 3 3 processes of water allocation in a single round the first water allocation process can be explained by the first water allocation round when x 3 fig 6 illustrates the change process of the proportion of the annual accumulated water allocation to the volume of water rights satisfaction degree of water right sdwr in that round as per fig 6 a d the water rights of all grades are satisfied at the end of the round grades 1 3 satisfy the water demand for three years while grade 4 do not if the available ecological water is less the round will last longer and more grades of water rights will fail to meet their water supply targets fig 6 e i depicts the accumulative allocation of water volume and the sdwr in the sixth round of water allocation under x 5 with the second time sequence schedule fs in this round the g1 g2 and g3 water rights were fully satisfied in the 1st 4th and 5th years supplying five times the annual water demand for five years however g4 was only partially satisfied in the last year of the round moreover g4 had significantly different sdwr values the sdwr of g4 1 and g4 2 were 0 318 and 0 074 respectively if water is allocated with ss it would continue into the sixth year until g4 water rights are fully satisfied however it would fail to achieve the supply targets hence the supply process of all grades in a single round is affected by the water inflow process and water rights allocation mechanism when the available ecological water is insufficient the high grade water rights are always given priority to receive water and the water supply target is more likely to be achieved regardless of the allocation process adopted 3 4 long term satisfaction degree of ecological water demand to investigate the long term variations of ecological water demand satisfaction under different schedules we calculated the satisfaction degree of cumulative demand sdcd for gates from each grade which can be expressed as the proportion of the annual cumulative water supply divided by the cumulative ecological water demand the variations of sdcd under two different processes fs and ss considering the results under x 5 for further analysis are illustrated in fig 7 a i the vertical line indicates water supplied during the year while the dotted line indicates the downward trend which were also compared with the sdcd without time sequence processes labeled as no processes in fig 7 m the coupling of the water shortage at the alar section with the time sequence process during the water allocation may negatively impact the natural vegetation that depends on ecological water supply in this study vegetation growth was assumed to be related to the satisfaction of ecological water demand based on this the vegetation growth will be in a better situation in the year with sufficient water supply maintain a stable growth condition in the successive years and subsequently deteriorate until the next irrigation cycle in fig 7 a f the vegetation s water demand cannot be fully satisfied in a single water allocation cycle therefore the growth status rose and then decreased during different stages this fluctuation continued for a long time in the first process ss in fig 7 g i vegetation supplied by g1 and g2 gates will maintain stable growth in a single round owing to sufficient water supply in the second process fs vegetation supplied by g3 and g4 gates exhibited a downward trend due to the insufficient water supply however vegetation supplied by g3 and g4 in the fs presented lower and higher decline rates than vegetation supplied by g1 in the ss respectively in the initial stage of water allocation the growth rate of incoming water severely fluctuates which leads to a large difference in the sdcd with the continuous process of water allocation sdcd tends to stabilize in fig 7 a f the sdcd stability values of all water rights gates are the same and less than 1 and are close to those without the time sequence processes in fig 7 g i the stability values of sdcd of g1 g3 gates are the same and greater than 1 the stability value of g4 water rights is less than that without the time sequence processes and the stability values of g4 1 and g4 2 are different these results show that the grade of the gate water rights will affect the short term vegetation growth in both processes but it will only affect the long term vegetation growth in fs table 3 lists the final sdcd fsdcd values under different water rights the values of fsdcd of different water rights are all less than 1 in the first process ss which indicates the demand of gates with different grades was not satisfied when facing water shortage and the vegetation growth condition of all the water supply areas corresponding to the gates deteriorates in the long run in contrast as indicated in table 3 the values of fsdcd of g1 and g2 are equal to 1 which means their conditions were fully satisfied in the second process fs the conditions of the g3 gate were also fully satisfied under x 5 which indicates the gates with the high priority water rights could still meet the ecological water rights under water shortage but those with the low priority rights could not thus the vegetation growth status of the water supply area at the gate with high priority water rights is maintained in the long run in contrast the vegetation growth status of the supply region at the gate with the low priority water rights will deteriorate in the long run fig 8 illustrates the spatial patterns of fsdcd with the average values of fsdcd for each gate at different values of x in the ss process the demand of all gates could not be fully satisfied and the average value of fsdcd was equal to 0 749 fig 8a in the fs process figs 8b 38 4 of the total area had fsdcd values equal to 1 0 20 7 had values between 0 9 and 1 0 36 6 between 0 4 and 0 5 and the remainder between 0 2 and 0 3 in general the area with an fsdcd of less than 0 5 is located between the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb these results show that under the condition of long term awg deficiency in the alar section the vegetation growth status at the gates of the water supply regions with g4 water rights located between the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb faces severe risk of deterioration in conclusion with the overall water shortage within the entire basin the first water allocation scheme deteriorates vegetation growth uniformly throughout the basin whereas the second scheme evidently distinguishes vegetation growth in different gate areas and produces different effects this approach can safeguard the normal growth of vegetation in the most important areas and alleviate the deterioration in the less important ones at the expense of worsening vegetation condition in other areas 3 5 response of the ecosystem services value the growth status of natural vegetation will affect the strength of its ecosystem services assuming the ecosystem service value linearly varies with the degree of ecological water demand satisfaction we calculated the value according to the vegetation type and area the total annual ecosystem service value of the water supply area yearly ecological service value of the water supply area yesvwsa was calculated for the ss and fs processes the yesvwsas for ss and fs are cny 424 895 103 and cny 441 752 103 respectively which demonstrates that the fs process has a larger ecosystem service value the spatial patterns of the yesvwsa are illustrated in fig 9 vegetation supplied by gate 28 with water rights g4 1 had the highest yesvwsa values and areas supplied by gates 1 and 2 with water rights g2 1 in the upper reaches of the mtrb achieved the second high yesvwsa values in the ss process fig 9a on the one hand the average value of yesvwsa in areas supplied by gate 28 decreased by 45 under the fs process on the other hand vegetation supplied by gates 1 and 2 obtained the highest values of yesvwsa which increased by 33 compared with those under the ss process when the ecological water demand is fully satisfied the yesvwsa of the 28th gate is the highest consequently it is the highest in the first water allocation process and decreases drastically because it belongs to the 4th grade and has ecological water demand similarly the differences in vegetation type area water rights grade and ecological water requirement in the water supply area also cause significant changes in the yesvwsa at the first and second gates as well as marginal changes in other gates 3 6 impact of different ecological water rights establishment the changes in parameter x of the ecological water rights will also affect the upper limit of one year and long term water supply frequencies the annual water supply of gate 6 in the first grade water rights is illustrated in fig 10 the water allocation results of other gates in the g1 and g3 water rights are similar to those in fig 10 an increase in x from 3 to 5 increased the annual maximum water allocation volume from 15 to 25 million m3 a and decreased the frequency of water supply decreased in 60 years the number of consecutive years without water supply increased and the number s maximum value increased from 3 to 6 in the first water distribution process and from 2 to 4 in the second process because the total amount of water is small the water rights of g1 and g3 can be satisfied in one or two years therefore with an increase in x the annual water supply rises and the water supply frequency noticeably drops however for g2 and g3 with a large total volume the demand could be fully or partially satisfied with more than 3 years of continuous water allocation contributing a insignificant trend the results of the annual water supply of gate 10 with water rights as g4 1 are illustrated in fig 11 the annual water allocation x 5 is smaller than that when x 4 and not significantly different with that when x 4 with the increase of x the number of consecutive years without water supply increased from 1 2 to 3 4 years in the first water distribution process and from 1 to 3 4 years in the second the results show that the relationship between the annual water allocation number of consecutive years without water supply and x value is different for water right gates with different grades these results demonstrate impact of the change in x on the vegetation growth in the water supply area of each gate although no quantitative conclusions could be drawn on the influence of the allocation interval year and the volume of allocated water in a single year on the vegetation water condition or growth status in particular the water supply areas of the gates with g1 and g3 water rights were more vulnerable to the influence of the two parameters 4 discussion 4 1 benefits for ecological water supply the proposed framework also improved the efficiency of ecological water supply in the mtrb generally the ecological water supply is highly dependent on the flood season and the water supply among the gates have the same priority chen et al 2016 the previous water allocation scheme for the mtrb did not consider the benefits and efficiency of ecological water supply which also showed no relationship among the volumes of water diversion in different years the definition classification and allocation methods of ecological water rights proposed in this study provide an efficient decision making foundation for the water supply management of ecological gates in the mtrb the previous studies defined the water rights within a one year or single fixed period schmid and hanson 2007 and couldn t distinguish the functional differences between vegetation ecosystems of different regions in the ecological water supply garrick et al 2009 wuijts et al 2019 by considering the different ecological water demands and elasticity of water supply in the mtrb this study attempted to define the ecological water rights at a large temporal scale as discussed in section 3 the proposed framework expanded the existing connotation and allocation methods of water rights based on the rotation principle this study also established the temporal allocation process of ecological water rights as described above this work prompts the achievement of goal that the allocation of limited water resources could be optimized to address water scarcity sun et al 2017 4 2 implication for water resources management in drylands to guarantee the stability of river basin ecosystems in drylands the ecological water requirement must be adequately met by optimal water resources allocation ling et al 2016 with the case study of the mtrb this study offers strong implications for ecological water supply management in drylands by considering the elasticity of ecological water demand and the relative importance of ecological water use in different regions authorities can allocate water resources by formulating the operation rules of reservoirs sluices and other engineering facilities to control the hydrological and hydraulic factors in the important areas of the river the use of an ecological network has also helped with the ecological water rights allocation studies have demonstrated that building ecological networks effectively mitigated the negative impact of fragmentation of vegetation and is conducive to the migration and diffusion of species lacher and wilkerson 2014 as per reports the fragmentation of vegetation is common in the mtrb as optimal water resources cannot be allocated during drought or extreme drought years chen et al 2016 the proposed framework coupled with the ecological network can reduce the risk of population extinction of desert flora and fauna moreover if the adoption of ecological networks becomes widespread this study can be used as a useful reference for ecological water supply in other watersheds 4 3 uncertainty it is also interesting to take the uncertainty of the ecological water demand quota w iu and plant area m iu into account for the possible scenarios that appeared over a long period two types of scenarios were take into account in this study as shown in table 4 d1 and d2 scenarios correspond to the deficit of ecological available water volume for cg1 and cg2 scenarios they correspond to the changes in grades of ecological water rights these changes in grades of ecological water rights will happen significantly if the vegetation distribution changes greatly the fsdcd values are listed in table 5 for different scenarios for the changes in water right amounts both fs and ss schedules show obvious differences from the previous results as shown in table 3 with x 3 however the changes in water right grades only have effects on the bs schedule these results indicate that the amounts and grades of ecological water rights need to be redefined when there is a significant change in the vegetation situation these results also highlight the responsibility of the regional government in ecological water rights as the regional government is easier to notice the changes in vegetation cong and ni 2006 ye et al 2014 also pointed out the importance of satisfying the minimum amount of water required by the vegetation s growth and implementing administrative developments on ecological water rights in the course of water resources management 4 4 future scope future studies must explore the combination of ecological and water allocation methods for efficient water use in drylands however this study dismisses the response of vegetation to water supply which is a limitation future research will benefit from using a variable annual water demand of vegetation to reflect the dynamics of the demand this will help avoid deviation between the quantity of ecological water rights and the actual demand in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed a method for water allocation based on ecological water rights the results led to the following conclusions 1 the ecological water rights are simultaneously defined at single year and multi year time scales reflecting the flexibity of vegetation ecological water use in terms of quantity and time the results were verified by a comparison of water allocation under two time sequence processes 2 the priority of ecological water rights was set based on the composition function of the ecological network reflecting the relative importance of ecological water rights in different regions of the basin 3 according to the principle of rotation irrigation and the priority of ecological water rights the time sequence allocation processes of ecological water rights and the allocation method of ecological water rights at the same grade were established this study could be used in the fine management of ecological water supply declaration of competing interest the authors

9529,a robust water supply system is significant to the local ecosystem of riparian vegetation in the arid basin considering the elasticity and relative importance of ecological water use in different regions of the basin this study defines the ecological water rights on a multi year scale divides the priority of those rights based on the ecological network and proposes a rights allocation method the application of the method to the mainstream watershed of tarim river in china shows that when the overall available ecological water is only 77 of the ecological water demand it can ensure that the ecological water demand of vegetation in important areas is fully met and the growth condition is good however the demand in non important areas must be less than 50 and the growth condition will deteriorate this method expands the existing definition and distribution of water rights and the approach of coupling ecological networks can be used for the efficient management of ecological water supply in other arid basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecological water rights arid basin ecological network riparian vegetation tarim river 1 introduction water is one of the most crucial

determining the amount and period of water supply for riparian vegetation in arid regions must be evaluated to devise methods for alleviating water shortage and other water related problems in the desert riparian ecosystem ye et al 2014 it is important to keep the balance between economic and ecological water demands in river basins in drylands calzadilla et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 previous studies suggested that water shortage water use efficiency and water resource protection could benefit from establishing water rights wang et al 2017 di et al 2020 fei et al 2021 ecological water rights are established to protect rivers lakes and natural ecosystems cao et al 2011 according to studies few countries have regulations and laws in place to guarantee ecological water rights while water resource managers may not consider the ecological benefits of the rights cong and ni 2006 zhang and zhang 2007 however the determination of ecological water rights is a prerequisite to implement sustainable ecological protections ye et al 2020 and more efficiently use and protect water resources in drylands the ecological water rights in desert riparian vegetation ecosystems rely on the ecological water demand which can guarantee the normal growth of vegetation and cure its further deterioration si et al 2015 most studies have investigated the ecological water demand at the basin level over the time scale of a year ling et al 2016 which implies that the ecological water rights were viewed as macro descriptions of ecological water use for basin water resources management zheng et al 2008 however the coarse spatial scale makes it difficult to match the ecological water rights with the demand in a given area ye et al 2020 therefore the ecological water rights must be evaluated on a finer spatial scale the allocation of ecological water rights is different from that of industrial agricultural and domestic water rights due to the unique characteristics of the ecosystem kapetas et al 2019 first to ensure ecological water rights authorities must supply water at flexible amount and period as ecosystems can adapt to the water resources availability villeneuve et al 2015 for example trees in drylands such as populus euphratica oliv can subsist on small amounts of water over several years unlike agriculture and industries which have a relatively rigid requirement of water rights therefore a practicable range for ecological water rights must be determined ling et al 2014 huge disparity exists in the water condition and landscape of desert riparian vegetation which make different areas meet different needs like living and migration of the wildlife thriving in desert riparian vegetation ecosystems zuliani et al 2021 this spatial disparity in terms of ecological functions indicates that the priority of water rights is different at the regional scale studies on water rights priority have introduced the principle of prior occupancy kim 2011 water value lee et al 2020 and risk bearing ability li et al 2017 however they did not consider the spatial difference of ecological functions lee et al 2020 in a previous study we found that the ecological network can be used to describe this difference lacher et al 2014 the supporting functions of wildlife activities in the target water catchment area in ecological networks can be introduced in priority identification for ecological water rights the creation of rights reflecting vegetation characteristics xu et al 2007 and relevant supporting functions of wildlife activities will benefit vegetation growth and improve animal habitat conditions livesley et al 2021 which is of more practical significance to arid and water scarce regions this study allocates the ecological water rights for the protection of ecosystems in the upper and middle reaches of the mainstream of the tarim river basin mtrb in arid western china in addition to riverbed leakage another major source of ecological water in riparian vegetation systems in the region is diverted water from the ecological gates of the mtrb to satisfy the limitation of the total volume of available ecological water ecological water rights must be allocated at the gate scale the efficiency of water supply must be maximized zhang et al 2019 and the water demand of vegetation in the important areas playing key roles in riparian vegetation ecosystems must be considered to meet these objectives first we defined the ecological water rights for the mrtb as the maximum water diversion from each ecological gate over several years second we extracted an ecological network of the mtrb to distinguish the high priority water supply regions subsequently we proposed an optimal model for ecological water usage considering the ecosystem service function value based on this we employed two different processes of water rights allocation and evaluated their results finally we discussed the findings and provided conclusions 2 framework for water rights allocation by ecological network it is considered to be a benefit to manage both river and river basin as the responsibility of the regional government dong et al 2018 meyer and diez 2015 which is also very conducive to the implementation of the policies of sustainable plans wang et al 2019 however knowledge gaps in the decision evidence still remain to what extent usage for ecological water bodin 2017 a framework for water rights allocation was proposed in this study as described below 2 1 ecological water rights common water rights frameworks include riparian rights prior appropriation and public rights among three different water rights types the public water rights recognize water for public environmental benefits lukasiewicz and dare 2016 in generally the prior appropriation rights is more common in water scarce regions than the water abundant regions wang et al 2009 which lead to the water shortages will be first borne by water right holders with the least priorities in these areas in arid and semi arid areas ecological water rights have become a vital issue facing scarce water situations ye et al 2014 argued that the establishment of ecological rights is the basis for restoring the fragile environment in arid areas as a typical inland river basin it is reported to have a mixture of prior appropriation rights and public rights for the allocation of water flowing through the upper and middle reaches of mtrb he and tang 2007 since there is a lack of tarim river ecological compensation regulations which was proposed by some researchers ye et al 2014 the ecological water rights didn t have high priority in tarim river basin the water rights for residential consumption industry and domestic uses have a high priority followed by the agricultural water rights in mtrb since local agriculture is the pillar of the local social economy and has been going on for decades the regional administrations operate in management mode implementing sustainable environmental policies with the lowest annual quantity limit according to the water amount flowing in mtrb this situation leads to the fact that the satisfy of ecological water demand in the mtrb mainly depends on the division of water of gates chen et al 2016 the quantity of ecological water rights in mtrb is limited as the difference of the water amount flowing minus the amount of described higher priority water rights considering the loss of water transport in the river channel it is focused on the internal allocation within these ecological water rights in this study a reasonable method of determining the total ecological water rights should consider the water availability in the arid region in general the water supply for production and human living take priority over that for the ecology which leads to the latter s shortage in some years however the water rights should balance the water demand of vegetation and the water supply over several years therefore the ecological water rights need to be set on the multi year scale that is the total quantity of ecological water right of an ecological gate over x years is set as x times the annual water demand of vegetation in the water supply region the value of x can be determined by the characteristics of water demand of vegetation ling et al 2016 the annual ecological water demand d i in a region can be calculated as 1 d i iu 1 v i m iu w iu where i is the number of gates iu are the different types of vegetation m iu is the plant area hm2 and w iu is the annual water demand quota of the different types of vegetation m3 hm2 in order to avoid the uncertainty of d i ralted to the deviation of w iu three different methods the phreatic evaporation method the averyanov formula and the area quota method were employed for determination of values of w iu the arithmetic average values of these values were used in this study by following the treatment of previous literature ye et al 2010 li et al 2018 2 2 ecological network tens of thousands of parcels of land have been irrigated along the mtrb scattering the native flora yu 1996 proposed the ecological network to restructure the ecological patterns for sustainability and health and for the promotion of species migration among habitat patches amid scarcity of water resources at the basin scale the ecological network links the biophysical processes and land use status seriously affected by human activities around the whole basin bodin 2017 which may benefit sustainable environment protection in arid regions a typical ecological network consists of three parts habitat stepping stone and ecological corridor habitat is the area suitable for the thriving of species stepping stone also known as temporary resting region is a niche patch of temporary habitat in the process of species migration and ecological corridor is a linear or zonal layout area connecting the habitat and the stepping stone for improving the ability of species to migrate and communicate an ecological network is constructed in three steps 1 habitats and stepping stones are identified 2 the resistance values are set 3 the ecological network is generated using various cost models in this study the minimum cumulative resistance model mcrm was used to generate an ecological corridor the mcrm uses the simple algebraic rule of calculating the species migration path from the shortest cost distance between the starting point source and the target point yu 1996 based on gridded landscape resistance regions the model is based on the node link pixel mapping expression algorithm from the graph theory and can be defined as 2 a 1 cost 1 cost 2 2 3 a 2 2 cost 2 cost 3 2 4 accum cost i 1 n a i where cost 1 cost 2 and cost 3 are the resistance costs of pixel 1 pixel 2 and pixel 3 respectively a 1 is the total resistance cost of vertical or horizontal connection from pixel 1 to pixel 2 a 2 is the total resistance cost of diagonal connection from pixel 2 to pixel 3 accum cost n is the cumulative drag cost of moving from pixel 1 to pixel n and a i is the drag cost of moving from pixel 1 to pixel n 2 3 grading of water rights by ecological network although the ecological gates along the mtrb were primarily constructed for the manual control of ecological systems they can also be used to reshape the ecological patterns of the mtrb especially when coupled with the ecological water rights allocation zhang et al 2004 the ecological network also reflects the relative importance of each ecological gate for the irrigated areas therefore the priority grades of ecological water rights were set to 1 2 and 3 for the ecological gates corresponding to habitat stepping stone and corridor the smaller grades are high priority if a gate does not correspond to the habitat stepping stone or corridor in its irrigated area its priority grade is 4 2 4 time sequence processes the time sequence allocation of ecological water rights is a periodic dynamic process that changes the inflow status the allocation is constrained to the total volume of ecological water rights as d i where x is a fixed number of years for water allocation eq 5 in addition the allocation should start from the gates with the highest priority water rights and then distribute to each gate gradewise within x years two schedules sequential water allocation schedule ss and forced water allocation schedule fs were proposed by following the rotation principle 2 4 1 sequential water allocation schedule ss according to the order grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 grade 4 water can be allocated to the lower priority grade ecological gate only after the water rights of the highest priority ecological gate are satisfied thus the water rights allocation was repeated in a cycle of different ecological gate grades by this process first the maximum water allocation of each gate in a year was quantified according to the degree of water shortage in that year for one gate the degree of water shortage is 5 s i l x d i aw i l x d i i g k where l represents the current year k represents the current ecological water rights grade k 1 2 3 and 4 and g k are the gates belonging to that grade s i l is the degree of water shortage aw i l m3 is the total volume of ecological water allocated to gate i since the starting year of the current round and up to the previous year for gates with s i l 0 eq 5 becomes x d i aw i l i e the total volume of accumulated water allocated is equal to the volume of water rights and the gates do not require water in the current year otherwise the gates have ecological water demand the maximum ecological water allocation in gates mw i l x 1 s i l d i which indicates that the ecological water demand in x years is satisfied second the remaining available ecological water in the current year should be calculated before the allocation of the k grade ecological water rights as 6 v l f l i g l q i l α i f l where v l is the remaining available water for the ecological gates at the control sections in the current year m3 g l is the gates to which the water supply has been allocated in the current year of the current round q i l is the volume of water allocated m3 f l is the total available ecological water in the control sections m3 α i is the water conveyance efficiency in different sections f l is the volume of water used in the previous cycle of water allocation at the control sections in the current year note that the ecological water rights allocation for the successive year can be transferred from the current year if the ecological water rights of the current grade are not fully satisfied in the current year then the ecological water rights allocation will strart from that grade in next year 2 4 2 forced water allocation schedule fs compared with the ss this schedule judges the mandatory start of a new allocation round suppose a certain cycle continues to the xth year after the start the beginning of a certain round of water allocation is the first year but the available water in this year has been exhausted and no grade of water rights has been fully satisfied then the current cycle of water allocation will terminate the period by the successive cycle of water allocation starting directly in the x 1 th year 2 5 water rights allocation 2 5 1 objective function the ecological water rights with the same grade will be allocated based on the ecosystem service value costanza et al 1997 referring to the benefits that human beings get directly or indirectly from the ecosystem the objective of the ecological water allocation is to achieve the maximum ecological benefits accumulated over the years and it is expressed as 7 max i g k p i dw i l aw i l 8 p i iu 1 4 e iu p iu θ iu d i where l is the current year k is the current ecological water rights grade and g k is the gates belonging to this grade k dw i l are the decision variables representing the water allocated to the gates in the current year p i is the ecosystem service values per unit water cny m3 iu is the type of vegetation p iu is the ecological values per unit area cny hm2 and θ iu is the revised factors related to p iu 2 5 2 constraints the volume of water allocated to the gates is the constraint on the available ecological water in the control section it can be defined as 9 i g k dw i l α i v l further constraints were applied on the upper and lower limits of ecological water rights allocation to reflect the differences in grades of the rights these constraints can be described as 10 a i x d i dw i l aw i l 1 b i x d i where a i and b i are the minimum and maximum allowable coefficients of water quantity at each gate the satisfying degree of available ecological water c can be defined as 11 c v i g k aw i l 1 α i i g k x d i α i as consist with the basic water allocation rules a i and b i should correlate with c under the following principles 1 the values of a i and b i decline with the decrease in c 2 high priority gates have larger a i and b i than the low priority ones under a constant c 3 a i and b i values should ensure that the available ecological water can be fully allocated 3 case study in tarim river basin 3 1 study area and data source 3 1 1 study area located in southern xinjiang the trb is one of the largest inland river basins in the arid region and suffers water scarcity the basin has garnered research focus for its unique and vulnerable ecology the trb has an extreme climate with a temperature ranging from 27 5 43 6 while the annual precipitation of the region is less than 100 mm with a large spatial variation in the basin the trb has nine tributaries aksu yarkant kaxgar hetian keriya weigan kuqa dina kaidu kongque and qarqan yu et al 2017 the basin has a vast desert riparian forest with the largest populus euphratica p euphratica population and various endemic fauna e g lepus yarkandensis or l yarkandensis reports claim that 54 of the world s p euphratica is distributed along the mtrb hukin et al 2005 the p euphratica population has been affected by the shortage of water resources chen et al 2016 l yarkandensis is a rare and endangered species endemic to the trb wu et al 2011 it relies on the riparian forest near the river for subsistence chapman and flux 2013 the mtrb has six water controlled hydro junctions along its stretch and 47 ecological gates to preserve natural ecological systems fig 1 most of the inflow of the mtrb is consumed by agricultural water demand in the region between xinqiman and yingbazha the rest of the water resource caters to ecological water demands 3 1 2 building of an ecological network l yarkandensis was selected as the simulation object for the ecological network a typical desert species l yarkandensis inhabit artificial reservoirs marshlands and river shores hui and zhao 2013 the ecological network with this species was generated by the following steps 3 1 2 1 step 1 spot habitat and stepping stone the habitat and stepping stone of l yarkandensis were defined by two regions 1 near the river and 2 within the lush vegetation such as p euphratica forest tamarix shrub etc the foraging area of l yarkandensis was generated by the intersection of the buffer zone from the tarim river to the areas of open woodland woodland and high coverage grassland in the basin based on a land use map the distance for generating the buffer zone according to the tracing distance of l yarkandensis was chosen as 1 km as per chen 2016 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map was used to distinguish the habitat and stepping stone corresponding to the high and medium ndvi areas we used the annual average value of the ndvi from jun to oct as n to distinguish the different ndvi grades the area with n 0 7 was defined as high ndvi area and the area with 0 5 n 0 7 as medium ndvi area finally based on field observation and investigation 4 habitats and 37 stepping stones were extracted from the upper and middle reaches of the trb by merging small patches and artificially processing the boundary line 3 1 2 2 step 2 set resistance value different land use types have different degrees of promotion of species movement as it needs to overcome the resistance of different land use as it emigrates in a horizontal space the resistance value was defined as the resistance cost of species crossing a specific land which was used as a quantitative expression of the migration process of the target species l yarkandensis in this study across different land use types the factors related to the resistance value in different land use types include the target species ecological habits and behavioral characteristics plant characteristics and land use status the resistance values in the mtrb ranged from 10 to 100 and the low value indicates a beneficial crossing environment for the target species liu et al 2019 meng et al 2016 with these factors we obtained the resistance values for different land use types table 1 3 1 2 3 step 3 generate ecological network as introduced in section 2 2 we employed the cost distance tool in arcgis using the mcrm and a python script for calculating the minimum cumulative cost distance of each pixel from the cost plane then the cost path tool was used to determine the path with the least resistance accumulation based on the gridded landscape resistance surface finally the ecological network of the upper and middle reaches of the tarim river was extracted fig 2 3 1 3 definition of ecological water rights and their grades according to the 2018 land use map of the trb guo et al 2017 the number of vegetation types was set to four by dividing the whole area into four types dredging forest land forested land low cover grassland and high cover grassland the corresponding w iu for these four types of land use were 4 45 104 30 42 104 6 28 104 and 23 40 104 m3 km2 by following the described method in section 2 1 the arithmetic average values of w iu were used in this study so that it is convenient to estimate the ecological water demand according to the land use data and our calculation is consistent with practical management wei et al 2018 the grading is listed in table s1 and the distribution of different grades is illustrated in fig 3 to maintain continuously distributed vegetation we defined the sub grade as 2 1 and 2 2 in grade 2 and 4 1 and 4 2 in grade 4 the water supply areas of subgrade 2 1 are concentrated and near the habitat and the water supply areas of subgrade 4 1 are also concentrated and near the habitat stepping stone and corridor 3 1 4 model calculations here we specify a few details for the calculation in eq 6 f l m3 represents the available water volume of the alar section for ecological gates in the current year α i the water conveyance efficiency of the section from the alar section to the section where the ecological gate is located and f the water volume of the alar section used for the last cycle of water allocation in the current year following wei et al 2018 we assumed the values of α i as 0 853 0 668 0 473 and 0 339 for the different river sections through xinqiman yingbazha wusiman and qiala respectively as the calculation refers to economic values we set p iu eq 8 for open woodland woodland low coverage grassland and high coverage grassland were selected as 302 302 232 and 232 cny hm2 according to costanza et al 1997 while θ iu was 0 7 1 5 0 5 and 1 5 respectively su et al 2006 note that the sum of the available water allocated to each gate is equal to the remaining available water volume in the alar section for ecological water demand the minimum and maximum allowable coefficients of water quantity defined as a i and b i in eq 10 at each gate was significantly affected by the quantity of water supply because the riparian vegetation in the mainstream of tarim river has a highly elastic water demand and no standards are available on the suitable or acceptable status of riparian vegetation in the basin for reference the determination of a suitable range of ecological water supply is difficult when the available water is insufficient therefore the calculation formulas of a i and b i table 2 are determined based on the experience of managers from watershed management agencies similarly tarebari et al 2018 determined the lower limits for water usages for domestic industrial enviromental and agricultural sectors based on expert opinion the allowable ranges of water volume for each grade of water rights are depicted in fig 4 to obtain the available water volume for riparian vegetation awe in the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb we used the annual water volume in the alar section to deduce the economic water consumption and the water required to be discharged to the lower reaches of tarim river the control section of qiala by using the ratio of annual vegetation water demand in the ecological gate water supply area to that in the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb ra the available water for gates awg at the alar station was obtained by multiplying ra with awe the 60 years sequence of the awg at the alar station was obtained from the annual water volume of the alar hydrological station from 1958 to 2017 by following the method mentioned above fig 5a as described by eq 6 f l must be determined to derive the water allocation cycles the awg series of the alar section was taken as the input of f l three different x values x 3 x 4 and x 5 where x is the fixed number of years for water allocation in eq 5 were set to derive the corresponding water allocation volumes with two proposed time sequence schedules section 2 4 3 2 water allocation cycles the awg process at the alar section is depicted in fig 5a the total volume of the awg in the section over 60 years is 23 305 billion m3 the total ecological water demand of all gates is 30 134 billion m3 in 60 years the ratio of the total available water of the total ecological water demand is 0 773 in any consecutive year 3 4 or 5 years the ratio of the total ecological water demand for all gates to the available water in the alar section was 0 33 1 02 0 47 0 97 and 0 52 0 91 with the medians being 0 7560 0 7505 and 0 7515 respectively consequently the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb have a deficit of ecological available water volume the results of water allocation rounds under three different x values are illustrated in fig 5b and c due to the water shortage none of the grades of water rights could be satisfied in 60 years in addition the water rights were met between 4 and 9 years which is longer than the calculated 3 5 years fig 5b the duration of a water allocation round depends on when the ecological available water can be sufficient for all water rights in that round as the total amount of ecological water available in x years can hardly equal the total amount of water demand the last year of the previous water allocation cycle overlapped the first year of the next one in fig 5c all water allocation rounds failed to meet the water rights grades and were terminated except the 20th round of water allocation under x 3 as the two previous consecutive years witnessed an extremely large volume of water regardless of the amount of available ecological water and whether the water rights of this round were fully satisfied each water distribution round will end after x years and the two consecutive water distribution rounds will not have any overlapping years 3 3 processes of water allocation in a single round the first water allocation process can be explained by the first water allocation round when x 3 fig 6 illustrates the change process of the proportion of the annual accumulated water allocation to the volume of water rights satisfaction degree of water right sdwr in that round as per fig 6 a d the water rights of all grades are satisfied at the end of the round grades 1 3 satisfy the water demand for three years while grade 4 do not if the available ecological water is less the round will last longer and more grades of water rights will fail to meet their water supply targets fig 6 e i depicts the accumulative allocation of water volume and the sdwr in the sixth round of water allocation under x 5 with the second time sequence schedule fs in this round the g1 g2 and g3 water rights were fully satisfied in the 1st 4th and 5th years supplying five times the annual water demand for five years however g4 was only partially satisfied in the last year of the round moreover g4 had significantly different sdwr values the sdwr of g4 1 and g4 2 were 0 318 and 0 074 respectively if water is allocated with ss it would continue into the sixth year until g4 water rights are fully satisfied however it would fail to achieve the supply targets hence the supply process of all grades in a single round is affected by the water inflow process and water rights allocation mechanism when the available ecological water is insufficient the high grade water rights are always given priority to receive water and the water supply target is more likely to be achieved regardless of the allocation process adopted 3 4 long term satisfaction degree of ecological water demand to investigate the long term variations of ecological water demand satisfaction under different schedules we calculated the satisfaction degree of cumulative demand sdcd for gates from each grade which can be expressed as the proportion of the annual cumulative water supply divided by the cumulative ecological water demand the variations of sdcd under two different processes fs and ss considering the results under x 5 for further analysis are illustrated in fig 7 a i the vertical line indicates water supplied during the year while the dotted line indicates the downward trend which were also compared with the sdcd without time sequence processes labeled as no processes in fig 7 m the coupling of the water shortage at the alar section with the time sequence process during the water allocation may negatively impact the natural vegetation that depends on ecological water supply in this study vegetation growth was assumed to be related to the satisfaction of ecological water demand based on this the vegetation growth will be in a better situation in the year with sufficient water supply maintain a stable growth condition in the successive years and subsequently deteriorate until the next irrigation cycle in fig 7 a f the vegetation s water demand cannot be fully satisfied in a single water allocation cycle therefore the growth status rose and then decreased during different stages this fluctuation continued for a long time in the first process ss in fig 7 g i vegetation supplied by g1 and g2 gates will maintain stable growth in a single round owing to sufficient water supply in the second process fs vegetation supplied by g3 and g4 gates exhibited a downward trend due to the insufficient water supply however vegetation supplied by g3 and g4 in the fs presented lower and higher decline rates than vegetation supplied by g1 in the ss respectively in the initial stage of water allocation the growth rate of incoming water severely fluctuates which leads to a large difference in the sdcd with the continuous process of water allocation sdcd tends to stabilize in fig 7 a f the sdcd stability values of all water rights gates are the same and less than 1 and are close to those without the time sequence processes in fig 7 g i the stability values of sdcd of g1 g3 gates are the same and greater than 1 the stability value of g4 water rights is less than that without the time sequence processes and the stability values of g4 1 and g4 2 are different these results show that the grade of the gate water rights will affect the short term vegetation growth in both processes but it will only affect the long term vegetation growth in fs table 3 lists the final sdcd fsdcd values under different water rights the values of fsdcd of different water rights are all less than 1 in the first process ss which indicates the demand of gates with different grades was not satisfied when facing water shortage and the vegetation growth condition of all the water supply areas corresponding to the gates deteriorates in the long run in contrast as indicated in table 3 the values of fsdcd of g1 and g2 are equal to 1 which means their conditions were fully satisfied in the second process fs the conditions of the g3 gate were also fully satisfied under x 5 which indicates the gates with the high priority water rights could still meet the ecological water rights under water shortage but those with the low priority rights could not thus the vegetation growth status of the water supply area at the gate with high priority water rights is maintained in the long run in contrast the vegetation growth status of the supply region at the gate with the low priority water rights will deteriorate in the long run fig 8 illustrates the spatial patterns of fsdcd with the average values of fsdcd for each gate at different values of x in the ss process the demand of all gates could not be fully satisfied and the average value of fsdcd was equal to 0 749 fig 8a in the fs process figs 8b 38 4 of the total area had fsdcd values equal to 1 0 20 7 had values between 0 9 and 1 0 36 6 between 0 4 and 0 5 and the remainder between 0 2 and 0 3 in general the area with an fsdcd of less than 0 5 is located between the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb these results show that under the condition of long term awg deficiency in the alar section the vegetation growth status at the gates of the water supply regions with g4 water rights located between the upper and middle reaches of the mtrb faces severe risk of deterioration in conclusion with the overall water shortage within the entire basin the first water allocation scheme deteriorates vegetation growth uniformly throughout the basin whereas the second scheme evidently distinguishes vegetation growth in different gate areas and produces different effects this approach can safeguard the normal growth of vegetation in the most important areas and alleviate the deterioration in the less important ones at the expense of worsening vegetation condition in other areas 3 5 response of the ecosystem services value the growth status of natural vegetation will affect the strength of its ecosystem services assuming the ecosystem service value linearly varies with the degree of ecological water demand satisfaction we calculated the value according to the vegetation type and area the total annual ecosystem service value of the water supply area yearly ecological service value of the water supply area yesvwsa was calculated for the ss and fs processes the yesvwsas for ss and fs are cny 424 895 103 and cny 441 752 103 respectively which demonstrates that the fs process has a larger ecosystem service value the spatial patterns of the yesvwsa are illustrated in fig 9 vegetation supplied by gate 28 with water rights g4 1 had the highest yesvwsa values and areas supplied by gates 1 and 2 with water rights g2 1 in the upper reaches of the mtrb achieved the second high yesvwsa values in the ss process fig 9a on the one hand the average value of yesvwsa in areas supplied by gate 28 decreased by 45 under the fs process on the other hand vegetation supplied by gates 1 and 2 obtained the highest values of yesvwsa which increased by 33 compared with those under the ss process when the ecological water demand is fully satisfied the yesvwsa of the 28th gate is the highest consequently it is the highest in the first water allocation process and decreases drastically because it belongs to the 4th grade and has ecological water demand similarly the differences in vegetation type area water rights grade and ecological water requirement in the water supply area also cause significant changes in the yesvwsa at the first and second gates as well as marginal changes in other gates 3 6 impact of different ecological water rights establishment the changes in parameter x of the ecological water rights will also affect the upper limit of one year and long term water supply frequencies the annual water supply of gate 6 in the first grade water rights is illustrated in fig 10 the water allocation results of other gates in the g1 and g3 water rights are similar to those in fig 10 an increase in x from 3 to 5 increased the annual maximum water allocation volume from 15 to 25 million m3 a and decreased the frequency of water supply decreased in 60 years the number of consecutive years without water supply increased and the number s maximum value increased from 3 to 6 in the first water distribution process and from 2 to 4 in the second process because the total amount of water is small the water rights of g1 and g3 can be satisfied in one or two years therefore with an increase in x the annual water supply rises and the water supply frequency noticeably drops however for g2 and g3 with a large total volume the demand could be fully or partially satisfied with more than 3 years of continuous water allocation contributing a insignificant trend the results of the annual water supply of gate 10 with water rights as g4 1 are illustrated in fig 11 the annual water allocation x 5 is smaller than that when x 4 and not significantly different with that when x 4 with the increase of x the number of consecutive years without water supply increased from 1 2 to 3 4 years in the first water distribution process and from 1 to 3 4 years in the second the results show that the relationship between the annual water allocation number of consecutive years without water supply and x value is different for water right gates with different grades these results demonstrate impact of the change in x on the vegetation growth in the water supply area of each gate although no quantitative conclusions could be drawn on the influence of the allocation interval year and the volume of allocated water in a single year on the vegetation water condition or growth status in particular the water supply areas of the gates with g1 and g3 water rights were more vulnerable to the influence of the two parameters 4 discussion 4 1 benefits for ecological water supply the proposed framework also improved the efficiency of ecological water supply in the mtrb generally the ecological water supply is highly dependent on the flood season and the water supply among the gates have the same priority chen et al 2016 the previous water allocation scheme for the mtrb did not consider the benefits and efficiency of ecological water supply which also showed no relationship among the volumes of water diversion in different years the definition classification and allocation methods of ecological water rights proposed in this study provide an efficient decision making foundation for the water supply management of ecological gates in the mtrb the previous studies defined the water rights within a one year or single fixed period schmid and hanson 2007 and couldn t distinguish the functional differences between vegetation ecosystems of different regions in the ecological water supply garrick et al 2009 wuijts et al 2019 by considering the different ecological water demands and elasticity of water supply in the mtrb this study attempted to define the ecological water rights at a large temporal scale as discussed in section 3 the proposed framework expanded the existing connotation and allocation methods of water rights based on the rotation principle this study also established the temporal allocation process of ecological water rights as described above this work prompts the achievement of goal that the allocation of limited water resources could be optimized to address water scarcity sun et al 2017 4 2 implication for water resources management in drylands to guarantee the stability of river basin ecosystems in drylands the ecological water requirement must be adequately met by optimal water resources allocation ling et al 2016 with the case study of the mtrb this study offers strong implications for ecological water supply management in drylands by considering the elasticity of ecological water demand and the relative importance of ecological water use in different regions authorities can allocate water resources by formulating the operation rules of reservoirs sluices and other engineering facilities to control the hydrological and hydraulic factors in the important areas of the river the use of an ecological network has also helped with the ecological water rights allocation studies have demonstrated that building ecological networks effectively mitigated the negative impact of fragmentation of vegetation and is conducive to the migration and diffusion of species lacher and wilkerson 2014 as per reports the fragmentation of vegetation is common in the mtrb as optimal water resources cannot be allocated during drought or extreme drought years chen et al 2016 the proposed framework coupled with the ecological network can reduce the risk of population extinction of desert flora and fauna moreover if the adoption of ecological networks becomes widespread this study can be used as a useful reference for ecological water supply in other watersheds 4 3 uncertainty it is also interesting to take the uncertainty of the ecological water demand quota w iu and plant area m iu into account for the possible scenarios that appeared over a long period two types of scenarios were take into account in this study as shown in table 4 d1 and d2 scenarios correspond to the deficit of ecological available water volume for cg1 and cg2 scenarios they correspond to the changes in grades of ecological water rights these changes in grades of ecological water rights will happen significantly if the vegetation distribution changes greatly the fsdcd values are listed in table 5 for different scenarios for the changes in water right amounts both fs and ss schedules show obvious differences from the previous results as shown in table 3 with x 3 however the changes in water right grades only have effects on the bs schedule these results indicate that the amounts and grades of ecological water rights need to be redefined when there is a significant change in the vegetation situation these results also highlight the responsibility of the regional government in ecological water rights as the regional government is easier to notice the changes in vegetation cong and ni 2006 ye et al 2014 also pointed out the importance of satisfying the minimum amount of water required by the vegetation s growth and implementing administrative developments on ecological water rights in the course of water resources management 4 4 future scope future studies must explore the combination of ecological and water allocation methods for efficient water use in drylands however this study dismisses the response of vegetation to water supply which is a limitation future research will benefit from using a variable annual water demand of vegetation to reflect the dynamics of the demand this will help avoid deviation between the quantity of ecological water rights and the actual demand in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed a method for water allocation based on ecological water rights the results led to the following conclusions 1 the ecological water rights are simultaneously defined at single year and multi year time scales reflecting the flexibity of vegetation ecological water use in terms of quantity and time the results were verified by a comparison of water allocation under two time sequence processes 2 the priority of ecological water rights was set based on the composition function of the ecological network reflecting the relative importance of ecological water rights in different regions of the basin 3 according to the principle of rotation irrigation and the priority of ecological water rights the time sequence allocation processes of ecological water rights and the allocation method of ecological water rights at the same grade were established this study could be used in the fine management of ecological water supply declaration of competing interest the authors
