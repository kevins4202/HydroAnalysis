18140,wastewater treatment systems are nowadays evolving into systems where energy and resources are recovered from wastewater this work presents the long term operation of a demo scale pilot plant 7 8 m3 with a novel configuration named as mainstream scepphar shortcut enhanced phosphorus and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha recovery and based on two sequencing batch reactors r1 het and r2 aut this is the first report of an implementation at demo scale and under relevant operational conditions of the simultaneous integration of shortcut nitrification p recovery and production of sludge with a higher pha content than conventional activated sludge an operating period under full nitrification mode achieved successful removal efficiencies for total n p and codt 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 in the following period nitrite shortcut with undetectable activity of nitrite oxidising bacteria was achieved by implementing automatic control of the aerobic phase length in r2 aut using ammonium measurement and operating at a lower sludge retention time similar n p and codt removal efficiencies to the full nitrification period were obtained p recovery from the anaerobic supernatant of r1 het was achieved in a separate precipitator by increasing ph and dosing mgcl2 recovering an average value of 45 of the p in the influent as struvite precipitate with a peak up to 63 these values are much higher than the

introduction the water sector has lately changed the paradigm from wastewater treatment to resource recovery hence wastewater treatment plants wwtps are nowadays known as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the major aim of these facilities is to go one step beyond wastewater treatment and is related to the recovery of energy for example as biogas biomethane or hydrogen or water and material resources from wastewater for example as n p based fertilisers bioplastics or cellulose in this frame novel wrrfs configurations have been put forward recently phosphorus arises as a perfect candidate in this paradigm shift since it is essential for our society in the production of fertilizers and thus for securing food supply however the main source of p the phosphate rock shows a faster rate of use relative to its formation and this is why it can be considered as a non renewable source which depending on the assumptions taken is envisaged to be depleted in the next 50 300 years ahmed et al 2015 cieślik and konieczka 2017 cordell et al 2011 theregowda et al 2019 it is estimated that 3 million tons of p are removed yearly via wastewater treatment in the planet which represents 15 20 of the global p demand and therefore implementing efficient p recovery strategies would mitigate the dependence on the phosphate rocks mayer et al 2016 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is based on the enrichment of the microbial community in polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao which have a metabolism capable of accumulating p intracellularly as polyphosphate poly p when alternatively exposed to anaerobic aerobic or anoxic conditions the fraction of pao able to accumulate p under anoxic conditions with nitrate nitrite as electron acceptor are called denitrifying pao dpao thus the influent p is accumulated in the biomass purged at the end of the aerobic stage when the sludge has the maximum amount of poly p accumulated purging biomass with high p content may have some practical drawbacks since undesired struvite precipitation that clogs pumps and pipes can occur when bio p sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion decreasing p entrance to the anaerobic digester for instance implementing p recovery should limit the extent of this uncontrolled precipitation in fact struvite recovery has many benefits for the wrrfs not only for its commercial value but for the reduction of pipe blockage sludge production ferric chloride dosage and operation and maintenance costs of the plant lizarralde et al 2019 however the efficiency of p recovery from the anaerobic digestate is only about 12 of the p entering in the influent remy and jossa 2015 and therefore alternatives must be found to achieve a more significant percentage of p recovery an option to increase the amount of p recovered and to avoid undesired struvite precipitation is the implementation of mainstream p recovery based on ebpr activity some authors have already shown that a significant p extraction from the anaerobic phase of ebpr systems can be maintained at long term without any deleterious effect on pao activity guisasola et al 2019 some examples are the bcfs process biological chemical phosphorus and nitrogen removal meijer et al 2001 van loosdrecht et al 1998 or other reports baeza et al 2017 kodera et al 2013 shi et al 2012 valverde pérez et al 2015 a common conclusion of these works is that up to 60 of the influent p could be recovered at the end of the anaerobic phase under well controlled conditions anaerobic extraction of the supernatant can lead to another advantage in terms of resource recovery since it opens the door to anaerobic purging of ebpr sludge pao accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoate pha under anaerobic conditions from the volatile fatty acids vfa taken up this pha would be used as energy and carbon source in a posterior phase under aerobic anoxic conditions purging at the end of the anaerobic phase results in biomass with the highest pha content of the whole operation whereas the conventional aerobic purging results in a purge with low pha content sludge rich in pha shows two potential advantages i it can be used as a precursor for bioplastics production after its extraction and ii if sent to the anaerobic digester this sludge would have a higher potential methane production due to its higher pha content chan et al 2020 huda et al 2016 wang et al 2016 regarding n removal the nitrite pathway approach i e nitritation nh4 no2 followed by denitritation no2 n2 has been reported to have advantages when compared to conventional nitrification and denitrification processes türk and mavinic 1987 i 25 lower oxygen consumption for n oxidation thus reducing aeration costs and also lowering the carbon footprint of a wwtp ii up to 40 lower cod requirement for denitrification and iii faster denitrification rate 1 5 2 times thus requiring smaller anoxic basin the nitrite pathway has already been reported with low strength municipal wastewater guo et al 2009 ma et al 2009 yang et al 2007 and also integrated with ebpr marcelino et al 2011 moreover nitrite has been also reported as a good electron acceptor for dpao tayà et al 2013 nitritation the first step of the nitrite pathway is achieved by creating conditions where nitrite oxidising bacteria nob are eliminated from the system while ammonia oxidising bacteria aob are retained mathematically equation 1 should be satisfied in order to eliminate nob while retaining aob 1 μnob bnob srt 1 μaob baob where μnob and μaob are the apparent growth rates of nob and aob respectively bnob and baob the apparent decay rates of these populations and srt the sludge retention time most of the strategies enabling the nitrite pathway involve manipulating μnob and μaob such that equation 1 is satisfied in most cases it is inevitably to reduce both μnob and μaob but incurring stronger reductions in μnob a common strategy reported in the literature to obtain nob washout is to decrease the dissolved oxygen do setpoint aslan et al 2009 blackburne et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 jianlong and ning 2004 pollice et al 2002 since it is widely accepted that aob have higher affinity with oxygen than nob the drawback of operating at low do value is that higher n2o emissions may occur massara et al 2018 2017 hence this work proposes a novel wrrf configuration named as mainstream scepphar shortcut enhanced phosphorus and pha recovery which is one of the novel technologies involved in the smart plant project www smart plant eu the whole smart plant project aims to prove the feasibility of novel wastewater treatment technologies at demo pilot scale towards a circular economy scenario not only to treat wastewater but also to recover resources scepphar configuration redesigns the two sludge system proposed by marcelino et al 2011 to include in the mainstream resource recovery struvite and pha rich sludge the system is based on two sequential batch reactors sbr one mainly heterotrophic r1 het performing ebpr under alternating anaerobic anoxic aerobic conditions and another mainly autotrophic r2 aut in charge of ammonia oxidation to nitrite complete nitritation this work presents the critical assessment for long term operations of a demo scale mainstream scepphar pilot plant treating real wastewater from a municipal wwtp showing the resource recovery possibilities of this novel configuration to the best of our knowledge this is the first report in the literature of an implementation at demo scale and under relevant operational conditions of the integration in a mainstream configuration of nitrite pathway p recovery and production of sludge with increased pha content 2 materials and methods 2 1 scepphar pilot plant configuration the demo scale pilot plant was located in the municipal wwtp of manresa barcelona spain fig 1 shows the process diagram of the pilot plant which includes i r1 het anaerobic anoxic aerobic sbr v 2500l for heterotrophic processes ii r2 aut aerobic sbr v 2500l for autotrophic nitrification iii r3 pre reactor v 150l for struvite precipitation and iv r4 int vessel v 2500l for interchanging supernatants between r1 het and r2 aut the pilot plant operated with 70 of volume exchange ratio ver i e 1750 l of wastewater were treated per cycle table 1 summarizes the main operational parameters for the three periods reported start up complete nitrification and nitrite pathway hydraulic residence time hrt is calculated considering both r1 het and r2 aut volume and the independent srt fixed for each reactor is also included r1 het and r2 aut were inoculated with activated sludge from the manresa wwtp anoxic aerobic configuration with n d but no ebpr and r1 het was bioaugmented with pao enriched sludge from an ebpr pilot plant rey martínez et al 2019 the wastewater used was the effluent of the primary settler of the manresa wwtp with the average composition shown in table 2 each of the cycles follows the next operational sequence the process starts with the influent feeding to r1 het then an anaerobic phase takes place and pao uptake organic matter release p and accumulate pha an anaerobic purge is performed and after settling the supernatant of the reactor which is rich in phosphates and ammonia is sent to r4 int then 150 l of r4 int are sent to r3 pre for p precipitation as struvite the rest of content of r4 int is transferred to r2 aut where ammonia is oxidised to nitrate or nitrite depending on the period after settling in r2 aut the supernatant is returned to r1 het for an anoxic phase during this r1 het phase denitrifying pao dpao perform p uptake using nitrite nitrate as electron acceptor finally an aerobic phase is required to complete p uptake after settling the supernatant is discharged to the effluent and the cycle starts again the complete sequence of the pilot plant when operating with a cycle length of 12 h is detailed in table 3 while the 8 h cycle used during part of period i is reported in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 pilot plant monitoring and control system r1 het r2 aut and r4 int had on line monitoring of level endress hauser

grundfos were used for water interchange and dosing pumps seko for sludge purge and dosage of mg and acetic acid all the mechanical equipment and monitoring systems were connected to an industrial computer ppc 3170 advantech through a data acquisition system pci 1711 i o card advantech the software addcontrol developed by the research group was used for automating all the operation monitoring

and cod vario tube test mr and the md100 lobivond spectrophotometer soluble cod cods was measured with samples filtered through 0 22 μm filters while total cod codt was not filtered the pha content in the biomass was measured as follows 0 6 ml of formaldehyde was added to each sample to stop the biological reactions and then the sample was lyophilised the pha was extracted from lyophilised samples using hexane and butanol according to the method of werker et al 2008 subsequently the pha was determined with a gc agilent technologies 7820a as described in montiel jarillo et al 2017 the standards used were 3 hydroxybutyric acid and 3 hydroxyvaleric acid copolymer for polyhydroxybutyrate phb and polyhydroxyvalerate phv and 2 hydroxycaproic acid as standard for polyhydroxy 2 methylvalerate ph2mv 2 4 batch experiments 2 4 1 sampling and monitoring the biomass used in all the batch experiments was withdrawn from the pilot plant at the end of a cycle then biomass was washed three times with tap water and was left overnight with magnetic stirring and aeration in order to consume the remaining cod and to achieve endogenous conditions at the beginning of the experiments the batch experiments were conducted in a 2 l vessel with on line ph do and temperature monitoring as in guisasola et al 2007 the probes ph sentix 81 wtw and do cellox 325 wtw were connected to a multiparametric device inolab 3 wtw which in turn was connected via rs232 to a computer with an own data acquisition software developed in visual basic in every experiment 40 ml samples were extracted every 30min for the analytical tests the samples were processed with a centrifuge beckman coulter avanti j 20 xp and filtered through 0 22 μm pore diameter filters millipore 2 4 2 pao dpao activity batch experiments the pao dpao activity tests were comprised of three sequential phases mimicking the cycle of r1 het an anaerobic phase 180 min followed by an anoxic phase 60 min and a final aerobic phase 120 min the first anaerobic phase was obtained by sparging n2 gas at the beginning of the experiment a pulse of nutrients was added so that the concentrations were phosphorus 10 mg po4 3 p l 1 kh2po4 acetic acid 150 mg l 1 and ammonium 20 mg nh4 n l 1 nh4cl the anoxic conditions were obtained by adding at time 180 min a single dose of nitrite or nitrate so that the concentrations were nitrite 15 mg no2 n l 1 nano2 or nitrate 15 mg no3 n l 1 nano3 the nitrite nitrate added was equivalent to the ammonium that would have been oxidised during the nitrification phase in r2 aut of the pilot plant finally the aerobic phase was accomplished by sparging air maintaining a do between 2 and 5 mg l 1 2 4 3 nitrification activity experiments nitrification activity tests comprised two aerobic phases of 120 min each with a do between 2 and 5 mg l 1 at the beginning of the experiment ammonium nh4cl was added so that an initial concentration of 15 mg nh4 n l 1 was obtained if required a second aerobic phase was planned with a pulse of nitrite nano2 2 5 calculations the observed production and consumption rates of the studied variables were calculated as follows 2 p r o d u c t i o n o r c o n s u m p t i

period with linear behaviour in mg l 1 to and tf are the initial and final time in minutes and vss concentration is in mg l 1 furthermore the ratio p release c consumption p c during the anaerobic phase was calculated as a pao activity indicator 4 p c m o l p m o l c p r e l m p c o d c o n 32 where prel is the phosphorus release during the anaerobic phase in mg po4 3 p l 1 mp is the p molecular weight 30 97 g mol codcon is the cod consumption in the anaerobic phase in mgo2 l 1 and 32 is the factor go2 c mol for acetate total n removal was calculated as ammonium in the influent minus the sum of the nitrogen species measured in the effluent as ammonium nitrite and nitrate 2 6 economic assessment the economic feasibility of the mainstream scepphar configuration was evaluated and compared to a traditional a2 o configuration for a time span of 30 years the detailed methodology and results can be found in the supplementary information the major design assumptions were i primary and secondary settlers are not needed for the scepphar plant while they are considered for the a2 o plant ii three independent scepphar process lines are needed to guarantee the continuous operation and to ease the maintenance and iii just one warehouse spare equipment unit i e blower and pumps for all process lines is purchased as a backup incomes were derived from the net production of electricity i e biogas and wastewater tariff the cash flow relative to struvite was negligible compared to the other costs pha recovery incomes were excluded because of the low pha content but the increase in biogas production due to the pha concentration in the sludge was considered external carbon addition was not accounted since the biochemical oxygen demand bod content was considered high enough to promote both n and p removal 3 results 3 1 period i preliminary results and operational changes during the start up in a first start up period i the system was operated for more than three months with a configuration of 8 h per cycle table s1 ammonia was fully oxidised since r2 aut was enriched in nitrifying organisms however ebpr activity was not detected indicating the absence of pao in r1 het the low cod present in the influent 150 40 mgcod l 1 was a clear bottleneck for the implementation of ebpr in addition specific batch tests in r1 het demonstrated that cod remained almost constant during the anaerobic phase and that no vfa were detected revealing that besides the low cod content there was a lack of cod fermentation to vfa to enhance fermentation and to increase the vfa availability for pao the anaerobic phase was increased from 3 to 6 h and the whole cycle length was extended from 8 to 12 h using the configuration reported in table 3 after several weeks with this extended cycle length pao activity remained very low finally it was decided to add an external carbon source acetic acid additional concentration of 100 mg cod l 1 at the beginning of the anaerobic phase fig s1 compares an example of the anaerobic p release obtained in two different cycles without and with vfa addition considering the low cod available in the wastewater used and the results obtained during period i the scepphar pilot plant was operated from that moment onwards with a cycle configuration of 12 h and with an automated dosage of acetic acid to increase the cod concentration by 100 mgcod l 1 at the beginning of the anaerobic phase in r1 het after this operational change r1 het was progressively enriched in pao and ebpr activity increased promoting stable and good removal for p and n 3 2 period ii stable operation of the scepphar pilot plant with complete nitrification this section reports the results obtained during the long term monitoring of period ii when the pilot plant was operated under complete nitrification mode and had good pao activity fig 2 shows the ammonium phosphate and cods input output profiles of the pilot plant once the pao activity was enhanced and table 4 shows the average solids concentrations during the days 0 175 the effluent p was consistently below the discharge limit with an average of 0 2 0 1 mgpo4 3 p l 1 ammonium oxidation was almost complete with average effluent concentration of 1 9 2 5 mg nh4 n l 1 nitrite nitrate and tn average concentration in the effluent were 0 5 1 2 mg no2 n l 1 3 7 0 9 mg no3 n l 1 and 5 2 3 6 mgtn l 1 hence the pilot plant was accomplishing its main objective which was to meet legal discharge limits for the manresa wwtp p 1 mgp l 1 nh4 n 4 mgn l 1 and tn 10 mgn l 1 eec council 1991 the removal efficiencies during period ii for total n p and codt were 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 ammonia oxidation started to decrease on day 180 because of a significant decrease in temperature fig s2 and because the aeration phase in r2 aut was limited to 3 h concerning to cods fig 2c shows the low influent concentration and high variability 136 39 cods l 1 the values at the effluent of 31 14 mg cods l 1 and removal efficiencies higher than 75 the lack of cod in this wastewater was alleviated by the addition of the 100 mgcod l 1 of acetic acid the need of this addition was corroborated in some cycles days 180 195 where a pump malfunctioning led to the absence of this extra vfa and resulted in a lower p removal fig 3 shows an example of a cycle operation obtained at day 139 of operation when the system was under stable operation with complete nitrification the cycle started with the feeding of 1750 l of wastewater step 1 for r1 het in fig 1 the influent wastewater in this cycle contained 3 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 31 3 mgnh4 n l 1 considering the concentrations in the remaining mixed liquor in r1 het before the feeding 30 of the reactor volume and a possible concentration similar to that of the end of this cycle around 0 mg po4 3 p l 1 and 0 mgnh4 n l 1 the initial concentrations in r1 het after the feeding should have been around 2 7 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 21 8 mg nh4 n l 1 the first measurements t 0 633 h showed that the theoretical ammonium concentration 21 8 mgnh4 n l 1 agreed with the measured value 22 8 mg nh4 n l 1 but did not agree for phosphate the experimental measurement was 13 2 instead of 2 7 mgpo4 3 p l 1 this increase was related to the length of the feeding phase 38 min pao could release p linked to the uptake of the vfa available in the wastewater during the following anaerobic phase step 2 for r1 het p concentration increased linked to vfa consumption by pao reaching 34 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 at the end of this phase an increase of 9 2 times the initial wastewater concentration on the other hand ammonium concentration remained almost constant during this anaerobic phase with 22 3 mg nh4 n l 1 at the end of this phase then biomass was purged step 3 to maintain the srt around 10d and the stirring was turned off for biomass settling after settling step 4 the supernatant of r1 het 70 of the volume was transferred to r4 int step 5 in the following step 6 r1 het received the supernatants of r2 aut containing the water of the previous cycle after nitrification and r3 pre 150l after this water interchange the concentration of ammonium fig 3 at the beginning of the anoxic phase decreased significantly down to 8 5 mg nh4 n l 1 as the content of r1 het 30 remaining after settling was diluted with the nitrified water from r2 aut with ammonium concentration around 0 mg nh4 n l 1 phosphate also decreased to 27 1 mgpo4 3 p l 1 due to the added effect of three different processes i struvite precipitation in r3 pre that reduced the concentration of phosphate in the supernatant of this reactor ii occurrence of some p uptake in r2 aut and iii dpao activity during the filling of r1 het from r2 aut as nitrate content in this exchanged water can be used as electron acceptor for p uptake during the rest of the anoxic phase step 7 the remaining nitrate could be used as electron acceptor for dpao activity in the cycle presented initial nitrite nitrate concentration was low as it was almost depleted during the previous feeding phase and hence anoxic p uptake was low regarding the other monitored variables ammonium concentration did not change significantly and a slight cod consumption was observed finally in the following aerobic phase step 8 p uptake was fast reaching 0 06 mgpo4 3 p l 1 at the end of the phase ammonium was fully oxidised and cods was only 16 mgcod l 1 at the end of this phase finally aeration and stirring were turned off for the last settling step 9 and discharge step 10 where a very high quality effluent was obtained fully accomplishing discharge limits regarding r2 aut it received the anaerobic supernatant of r1 het through the buffer r4 int step 1 for r2 aut the aerobic phase step 2 was designed for ammonia oxidation to nitrate and it accomplished its objective reducing the ammonium concentration from 17 3 to 0 mg nh4 n l 1 and increasing the concentration of nitrate up to 17 6 mg no3 n l 1 during its 2 h of duration fig 3 the rest of the cycle time in r2 aut was devoted to idle settling discharge filling and purge steps 3 4 1 fig 3 also reveals some p removal in r2 aut probably due to the aerobic extended idle configuration used in this reactor the presence of pao in this configuration is attributed to the non aerated extended idle phase acting as a post anaerobic zone wang et al 2012 finally r3 pre receives 150 l of anaerobic supernatant from r4 int this stream has a higher p content than the influent and a similar high content of ammonium phosphate precipitation took place in this reactor when ph was increased up to 8 5 by air sparging for co2 stripping and the addition of 19 mg mg2 l 1 as concentrated solution of mgcl2 typically p concentration in r3 pre decreased around 65 75 at the end of the phase the supernatant of this reactor was also sent to r1 het during step 6 fig 1 3 3 period iii achieving nitrite shortcut in the scepphar configuration before moving to shortcut nitrogen removal the pilot plant was stopped for maintenance and some valves and pumps were replaced because of clogging issues hence period iii starts at day 275 after a new inoculation the input output profiles for phosphate and ammonium during this period are shown in fig 4 the average solids concentration are reported in table 4 and finally fig s3 shows the temperature profile in r1 the plant showed complete nitrification on day 341 with good nutrient removal performance the system recovered a similar removal performance to that observed during period ii with an effluent below discharge limits fig s4 shows a fully monitored cycle on day 362 the profiles during this batch cycle were also similar to those obtained on day 139 fig 3 only slightly lower p release activity was observed during the anaerobic phase once the system was stable day 363 two operational changes were implemented to decrease nob activity in r2 aut i real time control of the length of the aerobic phase using the on line ammonium measurement and ii operating at lower srt the proposed strategy does not require operating at a low do value to achieve nitritation and hence the do setpoint was maintained at 3 mg l 1 avoiding a potential increase of n2o emissions reported at lower do massara et al 2018 2017 fig 5a shows an example of the ammonium and nitrate monitored in some cycles of r2 aut on day 365 two days after implementing the aerobic length control strategy ammonium was oxidised during the aerobic phase linked to the increase of nitrate concentration measured by the same on line sensor aeration and stirring were automatically turned off when the ammonium concentration decreased below 3 mgnh4 n l 1 however stirring was not stopped in the cycles shown in fig 5 a to have representative values of the monitored variables during the non aerated phase ammonium remained almost constant probably related to the detection level of the on line ise analyser while nitrate slightly increased due to some nitrite oxidation probably because of oxygen surface transfer due to the stirring nevertheless this problem was not observed in the conventional operation of the plant fig 5b shows a batch experiment conducted on day 378 15 days after implementing the control strategy during the first part of the experiment ammonium was oxidised at a rate of 5 7 mgnh4 n l 1 h 1 nitrite was accumulated at 3 2 mgno2 n l 1 h 1 and nitrate was produced at 2 7 mgno3 n l 1 h 1 these values indicated that aob activity oxidation of ammonium duplicated the activity of nob production of nitrate leading to accumulation of nitrite moreover in the second part of the experiment after the addition of an excess of nitrite nob activity slightly decreased to 2 2 mgno3 n l 1 d 1 instead of increasing this indicated that nob were the limiting step and that the first actions towards decreasing nob activity were positive after a month of implementing the control strategy nob activity was undetectable and the nitrite shortcut scepphar configuration was effectively obtained fig 6 shows two examples of pilot plant cycles obtained on days 410 and 439 of operation ammonium in r2 aut was completely oxidised to nitrite without detecting nitrate and matching nitrite formation to ammonia oxidation the aeration phase length was shorter on day 439 since the controller adapts this length automatically fig s5 shows an example of a batch test with r2 aut biomass on day 419 where a high ammonium concentration was added at do setpoints of 1 2 and 3 mgo2 l 1 nitrate was not observed at any do setpoint indicating the lack of nob activity returning to the experiments on fig 6 the nitrite rich effluent of r2 aut entered the anoxic phase of r1 het nitrite was not detected in the first sample of the anoxic phase because the feeding time of 28 min was enough to reduce the available nitrite by dpao as already observed for nitrate in the previous cycles no additional nitrite based dpao activity was observed during the rest of anoxic phase due to the lack of nitrite however nitrite dpao were very active as demonstrated in the specific batch experiment shown in fig 7 where a nitrite reduction rate of 0 072 mg n no2 g 1 vss min 1 was observed this high nitrite dpao activity indicates that a fraction of p was uptaken in the anoxic feeding phase of r1 het the most significant result of the scepphar configuration in period iii was the successful p removal using n removal via nitrite moreover some p uptake was also observed in r2 aut similarly to period ii and showing that the nitrite shortcut did not affect potential pao presence in r2 aut regarding the overall removal efficiencies during period iii they were similar to period ii 82 11 for total n 94 12 for p and 80 7 for codt tables 5 and 6 show the main parameters of r1 het and r2 aut in the four cycles presented in this manuscript the maximum specific rates for conventional ebpr processes i e cod uptake and p release were obtained for the case with full nitrification however under nitrite shortcut mode the p removal efficiencies were not affected in spite of the lower specific rates the nature of the influent cod was very diverse from complex cod to vfa thus simultaneous fermentation and cod uptake could be occurring under anaerobic conditions the p c values were quite high for being a real wastewater probably due to the acetic acid amendment regarding the n related processes the specific ammonium oxidation rate increased during time and it was higher when nitrite shortcut was applied probably also due to the lower srt used 5 7d that led to lower biomass concentration table 4 the ratio of nitrate with respect to the initial ammonium was close to one in the complete nitrification cycles while the ratio of nitrite versus initial ammonium was close to one in the two cycles reported with nitrite shortcut 3 4 resource recovery the main purpose of the mainstream scepphar configuration was to examine the feasibility of recovering resources from the wastewater besides obtaining a good effluent quality regarding the recovery of p as struvite the typical values obtained in r3 pre showed p precipitation to be in the range 65 90 depending on the specific cycle and precipitation conditions magnesium was added in the range 1 1 5 molmg2 mol 1p a fixed amount of mg2 was dosed but the p concentration at the beginning of the precipitation phase in r3 pre was variable p recovery in r3 pre was feasible due to the increased concentration of p obtained at the end of the anaerobic phase with respect to the influent the average concentration of p in r3 pre was 6 2 2 4 times the influent concentration with a maximum increase of 9 2 times in the cycle of day 139 an average 45 of the p in the influent could be recovered as struvite following the next considerations a typical precipitation of 70 of the initial p in r3 pre an influent of 1750l of wastewater with 4 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and that 150l of anaerobic supernatant with 30 mgpo4 3 p l 1 were sent to r3 pre when considering the best scenario day 139 a supernatant of 35 mgpo4 3 p l 1 influent 3 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 80 of precipitation the recovery increased up to 63 the biomass extracted at the end of the anaerobic phase has a higher pha content than the typical purge obtained at the end of the aerobic phase pha analyses in a conventional cycle of the pilot plant showed percentages of pha in the biomass gpha g 1tss of 3 1 and 6 9 at the start and end of the anaerobic phase batch experiments with excess of vfa and left overnight increased pha content from 0 7 to 9 1 which is the maximum value measured with this sludge this value would be obtained by adding an excess of vfa in all or some of the cycles in the pilot plant 3 5 economic assessment this section reports the main results obtained for the economic evaluation which is detailed in the supplementary information the net present value for scepphar and a2 o were estimated at 58 2 and 63 4 m respectively considering a wastewater tariff of 0 73 m3 the internal rate of return irr was very high for scepphar and a2 o 21 and 29 respectively the slightly better outcome for the a2 o technology was mainly due to its lower capital expenditures capex 15 9 m compared to scepphar 21 8 m due to the discontinuous nature of the sbr operation the cost advantage of missing settler units in scepphar was off set by the higher total tank volumes and mixing units cost of piping was also higher for scepphar because of its more complex liquid interchange system operational expenditures opex were slightly higher for scepphar mainly due to the higher maintenance costs related to the higher capex the wastewater tariff required to obtain an irr 4 was 0 27 and 0 31 m3 for a2 o and scepphar respectively hence scepphar is outcompeted by a conventional a2 o if only the incomes from biogas production and struvite are considered however the difference in terms of wastewater tariff aid for scepphar is only 15 higher than for a2 o 4 discussion 4 1 cod requirements for the scepphar configuration the pilot plant during period iii showed good removal efficiencies of p 94 12 and n 82 11 with a wastewater enriched in vfa codt 338 81 mgcod l 1 cods 236 39 mgcod l 1 ammonium 40 11 mg nh4 n l 1 and phosphate 4 2 1 1 mg po4 3 p l 1 metcalf and eddy tchobanoglous et al 2013 recommend threshold ratios for the design of wwtp configurations aiming at simultaneous c n and p removal a2 o and uct a readily biodegradable cod rbcod content of 6 6 g rbcod g 1no3 n and 10 g rbcod g 1p these ratios translated to the wastewater treated in this work result in the need of 306 g rbcod l 1 this value is higher than the cods available for the vfa enriched wastewater treated in this work 236 39 mgcod l 1 hence if the wastewater met the design recommendation of metcalf and eddy the scepphar configuration would be able to treat it without the need of adding extra cod if the cod concentration was too low as in the case studied in this work additional vfa would be required fermentation of excess sludge appears as a clear option to obtain extra vfa although the amount produced is highly dependent on the pretreatments used longo et al 2015 luo et al 2019 for the r1 het scenario i e srt around 10 d and with 2 7 gtss l 1 the solids production would be around 675 gtss d 1 to obtain an increase of vfa in the influent around 100 mgcod l 1 for a daily influent of 3500 l d 1 350 gcod d 1 would be required considering a ratio of 0 85 gtvs g 1tss in the sludge this amount of cod could be obtained achieving a fermentation yield of 0 61 gcod g 1tvs by using one of the pretreatments reported in the literature luo et al 2019 additional cod could be also obtained from the fermentation of primary sludge or other fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol guerrero et al 2015 2012 4 2 successful implementation of nitrite shortcut the simultaneous implementation of real time control of the length of the aerobic phase and decrease of srt led to a successful operation with shortcut n removal that was maintained without observing any nob adaptation during the operation of period iii the rationale of the first strategy is that if aeration is switched off around complete ammonia oxidation some residual nitrite should be present that could not be further oxidised by nob due to the lack of aeration thereby limiting their growth fux et al 2006 guisasola et al 2010 guo et al 2009 lemaire et al 2008 marcelino et al 2011 the reduced nob growth would lead to a slightly lower nitrite oxidation rate in the following cycle as a result nitrite accumulation when ammonia oxidation is completed and the aeration phase is terminated would be slightly higher than in the previous cycle further reducing the growth of nob over many cycles the nob population would decrease gradually which will be accompanied by increased nitrite accumulation at the end of the aeration phases while nob growth is repressed through this misalignment between oxygen and nitrite aob are not affected because oxygen is provided until ammonium is depleted moreover it may also result in transitory high free nitrous acid fna levels when aeration is terminated and nitrite is accumulated in the bulk liquid while the reported fna levels inhibitory to aob and nob varied considerably in different studies it is evident that aob are in general much more tolerant to fna than nob jubany et al 2009b park and bae 2009 in summary when aeration is suppressed the conditions are set so that it is likely that μnob decreases more than μaob thus contributing to the decrease of nob activity this strategy can only be successful if it is combined with a proper srt selected to remove nob faster than they grow as shown in equation 1 and explained in previous works guisasola et al 2010 jubany et al 2009a 2009b lemaire et al 2008 marcelino et al 2011 4 3 resource recovery most alternatives to recover p from wrrfs are based on the sludge generated cieślik and konieczka 2017 egle et al 2016 mayer et al 2016 melia et al 2017 rittmann et al 2011 rotta et al 2019 the most accepted strategy is nowadays its precipitation as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o from the supernatant of digested sludge jabr et al 2019 le corre et al 2009 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 struvite is a slow release rate fertiliser with nitrogen and magnesium that has been reported to be a good option for agricultural uses struvite precipitation in a tertiary step is not a viable option due to the low concentration of phosphate and ammonia the most adequate stream for the struvite precipitation is the digestate of anaerobic digestion due to its high ammonia and phosphate concentrations in addition when ebpr is integrated in a wrrf p recovery as struvite from the digestate can be more efficient since the sludge entering anaerobic digestion contains up to 20 times more p as poly p that could be easily released in the digestate münch and barr 2001 shu et al 2006 however typical values of p recovery around 12 are obtained by struvite precipitation from the supernatant of anaerobic digestion remy and jossa 2015 in contrast to the much higher 45 63 of p recovery reported in section 3 4 which is one of the main achievements of the mainstream scepphar the key operational factor in this configuration is obtaining a high anaerobic p release as it determines the maximum resource recovery that can be obtained the amount of p that can be recovered in r3 pre and the percentage of pha in the sludge on the other hand the precipitation reactor does not need to be designed to treat all the influent wastewater as less than 9 of the influent is treated in this case 5 5 of the reactor volume another possibility would be decreasing the number of cycles with precipitation it could be plan a single recovery per day with some extra vfa in this specific cycle this strategy has been proposed in the literature kodera et al 2013 lv et al 2014 although in some cases it has provoked some instability in pao activity acevedo et al 2015 nevertheless the long term operation with an optimised volume of anaerobic supernatant extraction every cycle has been demonstrated to be feasible and stable at lab scale guisasola et al 2019 with respect to pha the values of 6 9 at the end of the anaerobic phase or 9 1 after adding extra vfa obtained in this work are much lower than the 41 gpha g 1vss obtained by a side stream system fed with surplus full scale activated sludge and acclimated with fest famine cycles using fermented vfa liquors from industry or primary sludge sources werker et al 2018 however considering the amount of sludge produced per day and the cod load in the pilot plant our 6 9 of pha in the biomass results in a yield around 5 of the inlet cod finally ending as pha in the produced sludge this result seems low at a first glance but it is much higher than the negligible yields that can be obtained in side stream systems for producing pha the pha content in the biomass could be even improved if r1 het was operated at a lower srt this lower srt would decrease the total biomass and thus would increase the percentage of pha in the sludge if enough anaerobic vfa uptake is maintained in a previous work chan et al 2020 the pha content of ebpr biomass increased from 8 to 18 gpha g 1vss when the srt was decreased from 15 to 5 days this change can easily be implemented in the mainstream scepphar configuration since it is a two sludge system that allows the independent optimization of both srt to elucidate if the experimental pha content in the biomass was reasonable the amount of pha produced with the extra vfa added was calculated considering the anaerobic stoichiometry for pao smolders et al 1994 1 33 molc phb mol 1c acet 0 95 gphb g 1acet the inlet acetic acid 100 mgcod l 1 to r1 het with a typical biomass concentration of 2 7 gtss l 1 would result in an increase of 2 5 of the pha percentage in the biomass therefore the experimental pha increase observed 3 8 was reasonable as some of the inlet cod could be fermented to vfa during the anaerobic phase in the hypothetic case that the biomass concentration was only 1 4 gtss l 1 the increase of pha would have been 4 8 which supports the strategy of decreasing srt for increasing the percentage of pha these results also show that an important amount of vfa should be available or added in view of obtaining biomass with a significant pha percentage although the experimental pha content obtained could be improved by lowering srt or with sporadic vfa dosages its percentage is still far from the requirements for an economical down stream recovery of the pha polymer which recommends a minimum value of 40 gpha g 1vss werker et al 2018 nevertheless purging sludge with high pha content can also be beneficial for an enhanced biogas production several works report a significant increase of biomethane potential bmp of biomass with higher pha content guisasola et al 2019 huda et al 2016 wang et al 2016 chan et al 2020 studied bmp versus the pha content in ebpr sludge at different operational conditions and obtained a linear correlation bmp ml ch4 g 1vss 240 15 3 pha mmol c g 1vss they showed that the percentage of cod in the influent that could be recovered as methane could be increased from 11 srt 15 d and purge extracted from the aerobic reactor to 28 srt 5 d and purge extracted from the anaerobic reactor moreover the main bmp increase was observed during the first days of the test due to the higher biodegradability of pha thus digesting biomass with high pha content would have a significant impact in anaerobic digesters working at relatively low hrt 4 4 integrated assessment this work reports the major benefits of the mainstream scepphar configuration i ebpr can be combined with a high p recovery as struvite ii the sludge generated contains a higher amount of pha than conventional sludge iii it can remove nitrogen via nitrite shortcut and iv high cod n and p removal are stably obtained if enough rbcod is available in the wastewater on the other hand the pha content in the sludge does not allow an economically feasible extraction although this sludge increases the specific biogas production struvite recovery is demonstrated but the incomes that could be obtained are nowadays negligible compared to the other costs current capex estimation for the scepphar configuration is higher than for a typical a2 o configuration without resource recovery and hence further development and optimization is needed to become competitive from an economic point of view the 15 higher wastewater tariff required for scepphar than for a2 o could justify its implementation if resource recovery is considered strategic and incentives are legislated the current study did not consider incomes from pha because of its concentration below the recommended 40 however evidences from other projects e g phario bengsston et al 2017 werker et al 2018 suggest that a pha accumulation up to 40 is feasible if short enrichment periods are planned at the expense of an additional reactor and external vfa dosage this would open the possibility to obtain incomes from pha recovery in scepphar that would potentially improve its economic feasibility bengsston et al 2017 5 conclusions the mainstream scepphar configuration was operated in a demo scale pilot plant and for a long term with successful results in terms of c n and p removal efficiencies under full nitrification and under nitrite shortcut mode regarding p recovery the anaerobic supernatant had a concentration of p of 6 9 times that of the influent allowing that 45 63 of the p in the influent could be recovered as struvite in a separate precipitator this value is much higher than the typical values around 12 reported for sidestream p recovery mainstream scepphar proposes a purge from the anaerobic phase of the ebpr system rather the conventional purging at the end of the aerobic phase this biomass contains 6 9 9 2 of pha a higher percentage than typical activated sludge but its extraction does not seem economically feasible for bioplastic production with the current technologies nevertheless purging biomass with high pha content would increase the methane production when diverting this sludge to anaerobic digestion and thus it would enhance the energy recovery of the system the economic feasibility study shows that the current scepphar technology would require a water tariff 15 higher than that of a conventional a2 o and hence it would be necessary to legislate incentives to favour resource recovery to make it economically viable declaration of competing interest

18140,wastewater treatment systems are nowadays evolving into systems where energy and resources are recovered from wastewater this work presents the long term operation of a demo scale pilot plant 7 8 m3 with a novel configuration named as mainstream scepphar shortcut enhanced phosphorus and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha recovery and based on two sequencing batch reactors r1 het and r2 aut this is the first report of an implementation at demo scale and under relevant operational conditions of the simultaneous integration of shortcut nitrification p recovery and production of sludge with a higher pha content than conventional activated sludge an operating period under full nitrification mode achieved successful removal efficiencies for total n p and codt 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 in the following period nitrite shortcut with undetectable activity of nitrite oxidising bacteria was achieved by implementing automatic control of the aerobic phase length in r2 aut using ammonium measurement and operating at a lower sludge retention time similar n p and codt removal efficiencies to the full nitrification period were obtained p recovery from the anaerobic supernatant of r1 het was achieved in a separate precipitator by increasing ph and dosing mgcl2 recovering an average value of 45 of the p in the influent as struvite precipitate with a peak up to 63 these values are much higher than the

introduction the water sector has lately changed the paradigm from wastewater treatment to resource recovery hence wastewater treatment plants wwtps are nowadays known as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the major aim of these facilities is to go one step beyond wastewater treatment and is related to the recovery of energy for example as biogas biomethane or hydrogen or water and material resources from wastewater for example as n p based fertilisers bioplastics or cellulose in this frame novel wrrfs configurations have been put forward recently phosphorus arises as a perfect candidate in this paradigm shift since it is essential for our society in the production of fertilizers and thus for securing food supply however the main source of p the phosphate rock shows a faster rate of use relative to its formation and this is why it can be considered as a non renewable source which depending on the assumptions taken is envisaged to be depleted in the next 50 300 years ahmed et al 2015 cieślik and konieczka 2017 cordell et al 2011 theregowda et al 2019 it is estimated that 3 million tons of p are removed yearly via wastewater treatment in the planet which represents 15 20 of the global p demand and therefore implementing efficient p recovery strategies would mitigate the dependence on the phosphate rocks mayer et al 2016 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is based on the enrichment of the microbial community in polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao which have a metabolism capable of accumulating p intracellularly as polyphosphate poly p when alternatively exposed to anaerobic aerobic or anoxic conditions the fraction of pao able to accumulate p under anoxic conditions with nitrate nitrite as electron acceptor are called denitrifying pao dpao thus the influent p is accumulated in the biomass purged at the end of the aerobic stage when the sludge has the maximum amount of poly p accumulated purging biomass with high p content may have some practical drawbacks since undesired struvite precipitation that clogs pumps and pipes can occur when bio p sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion decreasing p entrance to the anaerobic digester for instance implementing p recovery should limit the extent of this uncontrolled precipitation in fact struvite recovery has many benefits for the wrrfs not only for its commercial value but for the reduction of pipe blockage sludge production ferric chloride dosage and operation and maintenance costs of the plant lizarralde et al 2019 however the efficiency of p recovery from the anaerobic digestate is only about 12 of the p entering in the influent remy and jossa 2015 and therefore alternatives must be found to achieve a more significant percentage of p recovery an option to increase the amount of p recovered and to avoid undesired struvite precipitation is the implementation of mainstream p recovery based on ebpr activity some authors have already shown that a significant p extraction from the anaerobic phase of ebpr systems can be maintained at long term without any deleterious effect on pao activity guisasola et al 2019 some examples are the bcfs process biological chemical phosphorus and nitrogen removal meijer et al 2001 van loosdrecht et al 1998 or other reports baeza et al 2017 kodera et al 2013 shi et al 2012 valverde pérez et al 2015 a common conclusion of these works is that up to 60 of the influent p could be recovered at the end of the anaerobic phase under well controlled conditions anaerobic extraction of the supernatant can lead to another advantage in terms of resource recovery since it opens the door to anaerobic purging of ebpr sludge pao accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoate pha under anaerobic conditions from the volatile fatty acids vfa taken up this pha would be used as energy and carbon source in a posterior phase under aerobic anoxic conditions purging at the end of the anaerobic phase results in biomass with the highest pha content of the whole operation whereas the conventional aerobic purging results in a purge with low pha content sludge rich in pha shows two potential advantages i it can be used as a precursor for bioplastics production after its extraction and ii if sent to the anaerobic digester this sludge would have a higher potential methane production due to its higher pha content chan et al 2020 huda et al 2016 wang et al 2016 regarding n removal the nitrite pathway approach i e nitritation nh4 no2 followed by denitritation no2 n2 has been reported to have advantages when compared to conventional nitrification and denitrification processes türk and mavinic 1987 i 25 lower oxygen consumption for n oxidation thus reducing aeration costs and also lowering the carbon footprint of a wwtp ii up to 40 lower cod requirement for denitrification and iii faster denitrification rate 1 5 2 times thus requiring smaller anoxic basin the nitrite pathway has already been reported with low strength municipal wastewater guo et al 2009 ma et al 2009 yang et al 2007 and also integrated with ebpr marcelino et al 2011 moreover nitrite has been also reported as a good electron acceptor for dpao tayà et al 2013 nitritation the first step of the nitrite pathway is achieved by creating conditions where nitrite oxidising bacteria nob are eliminated from the system while ammonia oxidising bacteria aob are retained mathematically equation 1 should be satisfied in order to eliminate nob while retaining aob 1 μnob bnob srt 1 μaob baob where μnob and μaob are the apparent growth rates of nob and aob respectively bnob and baob the apparent decay rates of these populations and srt the sludge retention time most of the strategies enabling the nitrite pathway involve manipulating μnob and μaob such that equation 1 is satisfied in most cases it is inevitably to reduce both μnob and μaob but incurring stronger reductions in μnob a common strategy reported in the literature to obtain nob washout is to decrease the dissolved oxygen do setpoint aslan et al 2009 blackburne et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 jianlong and ning 2004 pollice et al 2002 since it is widely accepted that aob have higher affinity with oxygen than nob the drawback of operating at low do value is that higher n2o emissions may occur massara et al 2018 2017 hence this work proposes a novel wrrf configuration named as mainstream scepphar shortcut enhanced phosphorus and pha recovery which is one of the novel technologies involved in the smart plant project www smart plant eu the whole smart plant project aims to prove the feasibility of novel wastewater treatment technologies at demo pilot scale towards a circular economy scenario not only to treat wastewater but also to recover resources scepphar configuration redesigns the two sludge system proposed by marcelino et al 2011 to include in the mainstream resource recovery struvite and pha rich sludge the system is based on two sequential batch reactors sbr one mainly heterotrophic r1 het performing ebpr under alternating anaerobic anoxic aerobic conditions and another mainly autotrophic r2 aut in charge of ammonia oxidation to nitrite complete nitritation this work presents the critical assessment for long term operations of a demo scale mainstream scepphar pilot plant treating real wastewater from a municipal wwtp showing the resource recovery possibilities of this novel configuration to the best of our knowledge this is the first report in the literature of an implementation at demo scale and under relevant operational conditions of the integration in a mainstream configuration of nitrite pathway p recovery and production of sludge with increased pha content 2 materials and methods 2 1 scepphar pilot plant configuration the

from an ebpr pilot plant rey martínez et al 2019 the wastewater used was the effluent of the primary settler of the manresa wwtp with the average composition shown in table 2 each of the cycles follows the next operational sequence the process starts with the influent feeding to r1 het then an anaerobic phase takes place and pao uptake organic matter release p and accumulate pha an anaerobic purge is performed and after settling the supernatant of the reactor which is rich in phosphates and ammonia is sent to r4 int then 150 l of r4 int are sent to r3 pre for p precipitation as struvite the rest of content of r4 int is transferred to r2 aut where ammonia is oxidised to nitrate or nitrite depending on the period after settling in r2 aut the supernatant is returned to r1 het for an anoxic phase during this r1 het phase denitrifying pao dpao perform p uptake using nitrite nitrate as electron acceptor finally an aerobic phase is required to complete p uptake after settling the supernatant is discharged to the effluent and the cycle starts again the complete sequence of the pilot plant when operating with a cycle length of 12 h is detailed in table 3 while the 8 h cycle used during part of period i is reported in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 pilot plant monitoring and control system r1 het r2 aut and r4 int had on line monitoring of level endress hauser

2 4 batch experiments 2 4 1 sampling and monitoring the biomass used in all the batch experiments was withdrawn from the pilot plant at the end of a cycle then biomass was washed three times with tap water and was left overnight with magnetic stirring and aeration in order to consume the remaining cod and to achieve endogenous conditions at the beginning of the experiments the batch experiments were conducted in a 2 l vessel with on line ph do and temperature monitoring as in guisasola et al 2007 the probes ph sentix 81 wtw and do cellox 325 wtw were connected to a multiparametric device inolab 3 wtw which in turn was connected via rs232 to a computer with an own data acquisition software developed in visual basic in every experiment 40 ml samples were extracted every 30min for the

pao dpao activity tests were comprised of three sequential phases mimicking the cycle of r1 het an anaerobic phase 180 min followed by an anoxic phase 60 min and a final aerobic phase 120 min the first anaerobic phase was obtained by sparging n2 gas at the beginning of the experiment a pulse of nutrients was added so that the concentrations were phosphorus 10 mg po4 3 p l 1 kh2po4 acetic acid 150 mg l 1 and ammonium 20 mg nh4 n l 1 nh4cl the anoxic conditions were obtained by adding at time 180 min a single dose of nitrite or nitrate so that the concentrations were nitrite 15 mg no2 n l 1 nano2 or nitrate 15 mg no3 n l 1 nano3 the nitrite nitrate added was equivalent to the ammonium that would have been oxidised during the nitrification phase in r2 aut of the pilot plant finally the aerobic phase was accomplished by sparging air maintaining a do between 2 and 5 mg l 1 2 4 3 nitrification activity experiments nitrification activity tests comprised two aerobic phases of 120 min each with a do between 2 and 5 mg l 1 at the beginning of the experiment ammonium nh4cl was added so that an initial concentration of 15 mg nh4 n l 1 was obtained if required a second aerobic phase was planned with a pulse of nitrite nano2 2 5 calculations the observed production and consumption rates of the studied variables were calculated as follows 2 p r o d u c t i o n o r c o n s u m p t i

and compared to a traditional a2 o configuration for a time span of 30 years the detailed methodology and results can be found in the supplementary information the major design assumptions were i primary and secondary settlers are not needed for the scepphar plant while they are considered for the a2 o plant ii three independent scepphar process lines are needed to guarantee the continuous operation and to ease the maintenance and iii just one warehouse spare equipment unit i e blower and pumps for all process lines is purchased as a backup incomes were derived from the net production of electricity i e biogas and wastewater tariff the cash flow relative to struvite was negligible compared to the other costs pha recovery incomes were excluded because of the low pha content but the increase in biogas production due to the pha concentration in the sludge was considered external carbon addition was not accounted since the biochemical oxygen demand bod content was considered high enough to promote both n and p removal 3 results 3 1 period i preliminary results and operational changes during the start up in a first start up period i the system was operated for more than three months with a configuration of 8 h per cycle table s1 ammonia was fully oxidised since r2 aut was enriched in nitrifying organisms however ebpr activity was not detected indicating the absence of pao in r1 het the low cod present in the influent 150 40 mgcod l 1 was a clear bottleneck for the implementation of ebpr in addition specific batch tests in r1 het demonstrated that cod remained almost constant during the anaerobic phase and that no vfa were detected revealing that besides the low cod content there was a lack of cod fermentation to vfa to enhance fermentation and to increase the vfa availability for pao the anaerobic phase was increased from 3 to 6 h and the whole cycle length was extended from 8 to 12 h using the configuration reported in table 3 after several weeks with this extended cycle length pao activity remained very low finally it was decided to add an external carbon source acetic acid additional concentration of 100 mg cod l 1 at the beginning of the anaerobic phase fig s1 compares an example of the anaerobic p release obtained in two different cycles without and with vfa addition considering the low cod available in the wastewater used and the results obtained during period i the scepphar pilot plant was operated from that moment onwards with a cycle configuration of 12 h and with an automated dosage of acetic acid to increase the cod concentration by 100 mgcod l 1 at the beginning of the anaerobic phase in r1 het after this operational change r1 het was progressively enriched in pao and ebpr activity increased promoting stable and good removal for p and n 3 2 period ii stable operation of the scepphar pilot plant with complete nitrification this section reports the results obtained during the long term monitoring of period ii when the pilot plant was operated under complete nitrification mode and had good pao activity fig 2 shows the ammonium phosphate and cods input output profiles of the pilot plant once the pao activity was enhanced and table 4 shows the average solids concentrations during the days 0 175 the effluent p was consistently below the discharge limit with an average of 0 2 0 1 mgpo4 3 p l 1 ammonium oxidation was almost complete with average effluent concentration of 1 9 2 5 mg nh4 n l 1 nitrite nitrate and tn average concentration in the effluent were 0 5 1 2 mg no2 n l 1 3 7 0 9 mg no3 n l 1 and 5 2 3 6 mgtn l 1 hence the pilot plant was accomplishing its main objective which was to meet legal discharge limits for the manresa wwtp p 1 mgp l 1 nh4 n 4 mgn l 1 and tn 10 mgn l 1 eec council 1991 the removal efficiencies during period ii for total n p and codt were 86 12 93 9 and 79 6 ammonia oxidation started to decrease on day 180 because of a significant decrease in temperature fig s2 and because the aeration phase in r2 aut was limited to 3 h concerning to cods fig 2c shows the low influent concentration and high variability 136 39 cods l 1 the values at the effluent of 31 14 mg cods l 1 and removal efficiencies higher than 75 the lack of cod in this wastewater was alleviated by the addition of the 100 mgcod l 1 of acetic acid the need of this addition was corroborated in some cycles days 180 195 where a pump malfunctioning led to the absence of this extra vfa and resulted in a lower p removal fig 3 shows an example of a cycle operation obtained at day 139 of operation when the system was under stable operation with complete nitrification the cycle started with the feeding of 1750 l of wastewater step 1 for r1 het in fig 1 the influent wastewater in this cycle contained 3 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 31 3 mgnh4 n l 1 considering the concentrations in the remaining mixed liquor in r1 het before the feeding 30 of the reactor volume and a possible concentration similar to that of the end of this cycle around 0 mg po4 3 p l 1 and 0 mgnh4 n l 1 the initial concentrations in r1 het after the feeding should have been around 2 7 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 21 8 mg nh4 n l 1 the first measurements t 0 633 h showed that the theoretical ammonium concentration 21 8 mgnh4 n l 1 agreed with the measured value 22 8 mg nh4 n l 1 but did not agree for phosphate the experimental measurement was 13 2 instead of 2 7 mgpo4 3 p l 1 this increase was related to the length of the feeding phase 38 min pao could release p linked to the uptake of the vfa available in the wastewater during the following anaerobic phase step 2 for r1 het p concentration increased linked to vfa consumption by pao reaching 34 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 at the end of this phase an increase of 9 2 times the initial wastewater concentration on the other hand ammonium concentration remained almost constant during this anaerobic phase with 22 3 mg nh4 n l 1 at the end of this phase then biomass was purged step 3 to maintain the srt around 10d and the stirring was turned off for biomass settling after settling step 4 the supernatant of r1 het 70 of the volume was transferred to r4 int step 5 in the following step 6 r1 het received the supernatants of r2 aut containing the water of the previous cycle after nitrification and r3 pre 150l after this water interchange the concentration of ammonium fig 3 at the beginning of the anoxic phase decreased significantly down to 8 5 mg nh4 n l 1 as the content of r1 het 30 remaining after settling was diluted with the nitrified water from r2 aut with ammonium concentration around 0 mg nh4 n l 1 phosphate also decreased to 27 1 mgpo4 3 p l 1 due to the added effect of three different processes i struvite precipitation in r3 pre that reduced the concentration of phosphate in the supernatant of this reactor ii occurrence of some p uptake in r2 aut and iii dpao activity during the filling of r1 het from r2 aut as nitrate content in this exchanged water can be used as electron acceptor for p uptake during the rest of the anoxic phase step 7 the remaining nitrate could be used as electron acceptor for dpao activity in the cycle presented initial nitrite nitrate concentration was low as it was almost depleted during the previous feeding phase and hence anoxic p uptake was low regarding the other monitored variables ammonium concentration did not change significantly and a slight cod consumption was observed finally in the following aerobic phase step 8 p uptake was fast reaching 0 06 mgpo4 3 p l 1 at the end of the phase ammonium was fully oxidised and cods was only 16 mgcod l 1 at the end of this phase finally aeration and stirring were turned off for the last settling step 9 and discharge step 10 where a very high quality effluent was obtained fully accomplishing discharge limits regarding r2 aut it received the anaerobic supernatant of r1 het through the buffer r4 int step 1 for r2 aut the aerobic phase step 2 was designed for ammonia oxidation to nitrate and it accomplished its objective reducing the ammonium concentration from 17 3 to 0 mg nh4 n l 1 and increasing the concentration of nitrate up to 17 6 mg no3 n l 1 during its 2 h of duration fig 3 the rest of the cycle time in r2 aut was devoted to idle settling discharge filling and purge steps 3 4 1 fig 3 also reveals some p removal in r2 aut probably due to the aerobic extended idle configuration used in this reactor the presence of pao in this configuration is attributed to the non aerated extended idle phase acting as a post anaerobic zone wang et al 2012 finally r3 pre receives 150 l of anaerobic supernatant from r4 int this stream has a higher p content than the influent and a similar high content of ammonium phosphate precipitation took place in this reactor when ph was increased up to 8 5 by air sparging for co2 stripping and the addition of 19 mg mg2 l 1 as concentrated solution of mgcl2 typically p concentration in r3 pre decreased around 65 75 at the end of the phase the supernatant of this reactor was also sent to r1 het during step 6 fig 1 3 3 period iii achieving nitrite shortcut in the scepphar configuration before moving to shortcut nitrogen removal the pilot plant was stopped for maintenance and some valves and pumps were replaced because of clogging issues hence period iii starts at day 275 after a new inoculation the input output profiles for phosphate and ammonium during this period are shown in fig 4 the average solids concentration are reported in table 4 and finally fig s3 shows the temperature profile in r1 the plant showed complete nitrification on day 341 with good nutrient removal performance the system recovered a similar removal performance to that observed during period ii with an effluent below discharge limits fig s4 shows a fully monitored cycle on day 362 the profiles during this batch cycle were also similar to those obtained on day 139 fig 3 only slightly lower p release activity was observed during the anaerobic phase once the system was stable day 363 two operational changes were implemented to decrease nob activity in r2 aut i real time control of the length of the aerobic phase using the on line ammonium measurement and ii operating at lower srt the proposed strategy does not require operating at a low do value to achieve nitritation and hence the do setpoint was maintained at 3 mg l 1 avoiding a potential increase of n2o emissions reported at lower do massara et al 2018 2017 fig 5a shows an example of the ammonium and nitrate monitored in some cycles of r2 aut on day 365 two days after implementing the aerobic length control strategy ammonium was oxidised during the aerobic phase linked to the increase of nitrate concentration measured by the same on line sensor aeration and stirring were automatically turned off when the ammonium concentration decreased below 3 mgnh4 n l 1 however stirring was not stopped in the cycles shown in fig 5 a to have representative values of the monitored variables during the non aerated phase ammonium remained almost constant probably related to the detection level of the on line ise analyser while nitrate slightly increased due to some nitrite oxidation probably because of oxygen surface transfer due to the stirring nevertheless this problem was not observed in the conventional operation of the plant fig 5b shows a batch experiment conducted on day 378 15 days after implementing the control strategy during the first part of the experiment ammonium was oxidised at a rate of 5 7 mgnh4 n l 1 h 1 nitrite was accumulated at 3 2 mgno2 n l 1 h 1 and nitrate was produced at 2 7 mgno3 n l 1 h 1 these values indicated that aob activity oxidation of ammonium duplicated the activity of nob production of nitrate leading to accumulation of nitrite moreover in the second part of the experiment after the addition of an excess of nitrite nob activity slightly decreased to 2 2 mgno3 n l 1 d 1 instead of increasing this indicated that nob were the limiting step and that the first actions towards decreasing nob activity were positive after a month of implementing the control strategy nob activity was undetectable and the nitrite shortcut scepphar configuration was effectively obtained fig 6 shows two examples of pilot plant cycles obtained on days 410 and 439 of operation ammonium in r2 aut was completely oxidised to nitrite without detecting nitrate and matching nitrite formation to ammonia oxidation the aeration phase length was shorter on day 439 since the controller adapts this length automatically fig s5 shows an example of a batch test with r2 aut biomass on day 419 where a high ammonium concentration was added at do setpoints of 1 2 and 3 mgo2 l 1 nitrate was not observed at any do setpoint indicating the lack of nob activity returning to the experiments on fig 6 the nitrite rich effluent of r2 aut entered the anoxic phase of r1 het nitrite was not detected in the first sample of the anoxic phase because the feeding time of 28 min was enough to reduce the available nitrite by dpao as already observed for nitrate in the previous cycles no additional nitrite based dpao activity was observed during the rest of anoxic phase due to the lack of nitrite however nitrite dpao were very active as demonstrated in the specific batch experiment shown in fig 7 where a nitrite reduction rate of 0 072 mg n no2 g 1 vss min 1 was observed this high nitrite dpao activity indicates that a fraction of p was uptaken in the anoxic feeding phase of r1 het the most significant result of the scepphar configuration in period iii was the successful p removal using n removal via nitrite moreover some p uptake was also observed in r2 aut similarly to period ii and showing that the nitrite shortcut did not affect potential pao presence in r2 aut regarding the overall removal efficiencies during period iii they were similar to period ii 82 11 for total n 94 12 for p and 80 7 for codt tables 5 and 6 show the main parameters of r1 het and r2 aut in the four cycles presented in this manuscript the maximum specific rates for conventional ebpr processes i e cod uptake and p release were obtained for the case with full nitrification however under nitrite shortcut mode the p removal efficiencies were not affected in spite of the lower specific rates the nature of the influent cod was very diverse from complex cod to vfa thus simultaneous fermentation and cod uptake could be occurring under anaerobic conditions the p c values were quite high for being a real wastewater probably due to the acetic acid amendment regarding the n related processes the specific ammonium oxidation rate increased during time and it was higher when nitrite shortcut was applied probably also due to the lower srt used 5 7d that led to lower biomass concentration table 4 the ratio of nitrate with respect to the initial ammonium was close to one in the complete nitrification cycles while the ratio of nitrite versus initial ammonium was close to one in the two cycles reported with nitrite shortcut 3 4 resource recovery the main purpose of the mainstream scepphar configuration was to examine the feasibility of recovering resources from the wastewater besides obtaining a good effluent quality regarding the recovery of p as struvite the typical values obtained in r3 pre showed p precipitation to be in the range 65 90 depending on the specific cycle and precipitation conditions magnesium was added in the range 1 1 5 molmg2 mol 1p a fixed amount of mg2 was dosed but the p concentration at the beginning of the precipitation phase in r3 pre was variable p recovery in r3 pre was feasible due to the increased concentration of p obtained at the end of the anaerobic phase with respect to the influent the average concentration of p in r3 pre was 6 2 2 4 times the influent concentration with a maximum increase of 9 2 times in the cycle of day 139 an average 45 of the p in the influent could be recovered as struvite following the next considerations a typical precipitation of 70 of the initial p in r3 pre an influent of 1750l of wastewater with 4 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and that 150l of anaerobic supernatant with 30 mgpo4 3 p l 1 were sent to r3 pre when considering the best scenario day 139 a supernatant of 35 mgpo4 3 p l 1 influent 3 8 mgpo4 3 p l 1 and 80 of precipitation the recovery increased up to 63 the biomass extracted at the end of the anaerobic phase has a higher pha content than the typical purge obtained at the end of the aerobic phase pha analyses in a conventional cycle of the pilot plant showed percentages of pha in the biomass gpha g 1tss of 3 1 and 6 9 at the start and end of the anaerobic phase batch experiments with excess of vfa and left overnight increased pha content from 0 7 to 9 1 which is the maximum value measured with this sludge this value would be obtained by adding an excess of vfa in all or some of the cycles in the pilot plant 3 5 economic assessment this section reports the main results obtained for the economic evaluation which is detailed in the supplementary information the net present value for scepphar and a2 o were estimated at 58 2 and 63 4 m respectively considering a wastewater tariff of 0 73 m3 the internal rate of return irr was very high for scepphar and a2 o 21 and 29 respectively the slightly better outcome for the a2 o technology was mainly due to its lower capital expenditures capex 15 9 m compared to scepphar 21 8 m due to the discontinuous nature of the sbr operation the cost advantage of missing settler units in scepphar was off set by the higher total tank volumes and mixing units cost of piping was also higher for scepphar because of its more complex liquid interchange system operational expenditures opex were slightly higher for scepphar mainly due to the higher maintenance costs related to the higher capex the wastewater tariff required to obtain an irr 4 was 0 27 and 0 31 m3 for a2 o and scepphar respectively hence scepphar is outcompeted by a conventional a2 o if only the incomes from biogas production and struvite are considered however the difference in terms of wastewater tariff aid for scepphar is only 15 higher than for a2 o 4 discussion 4 1 cod requirements for the scepphar configuration the pilot plant during period iii showed good removal efficiencies of p 94 12 and n 82 11 with a wastewater enriched in vfa codt 338 81 mgcod l 1 cods 236 39 mgcod l 1 ammonium 40 11 mg nh4 n l 1 and phosphate 4 2 1 1 mg po4 3 p l 1 metcalf and eddy tchobanoglous et al 2013 recommend threshold ratios for the design of wwtp configurations aiming at simultaneous c n and p removal a2 o and uct a readily biodegradable cod rbcod content of 6 6 g rbcod g 1no3 n and 10 g rbcod g 1p these ratios translated to the wastewater treated in this work result in the need of 306 g rbcod l 1 this value is higher than the cods available for the vfa enriched wastewater treated in this work 236 39 mgcod l 1 hence if the wastewater met the design recommendation of metcalf and eddy the scepphar configuration would be able to treat it without the need of adding extra cod if the cod concentration was too low as in the case studied in this work additional vfa would be required fermentation of excess sludge appears as a clear option to obtain extra vfa although the amount produced is highly dependent on the pretreatments used longo et al 2015 luo et al 2019 for the r1 het scenario i e srt around 10 d and with 2 7 gtss l 1 the solids production would be around 675 gtss d 1 to obtain an increase of vfa in the influent around 100 mgcod l 1 for a daily influent of 3500 l d 1 350 gcod d 1 would be required considering a ratio of 0 85 gtvs g 1tss in the sludge this amount of cod could be obtained achieving a fermentation yield of 0 61 gcod g 1tvs by using one of the pretreatments reported in the literature luo et al 2019 additional cod could be also obtained from the fermentation of primary sludge or other fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol guerrero et al 2015 2012 4 2 successful implementation of nitrite shortcut the simultaneous implementation of real time control of the length of the aerobic phase and decrease of srt led to a successful operation with shortcut n removal that was maintained without observing any nob adaptation during the operation of period iii the rationale of the first strategy is that if aeration is switched off around complete ammonia oxidation some residual nitrite should be present that could not be further oxidised by nob due to the lack of aeration thereby limiting their growth fux et al 2006 guisasola et al 2010 guo et al 2009 lemaire et al 2008 marcelino et al 2011 the reduced nob growth would lead to a slightly lower nitrite oxidation rate in the following cycle as a result nitrite accumulation when ammonia oxidation is completed and the aeration phase is terminated would be slightly higher than in the previous cycle further reducing the growth of nob over many cycles the nob population would decrease gradually which will be accompanied by increased nitrite accumulation at the end of the aeration phases while nob growth is repressed through this misalignment between oxygen and nitrite aob are not affected because oxygen is provided until ammonium is depleted moreover it may also result in transitory high free nitrous acid fna levels when aeration is terminated and nitrite is accumulated in the bulk liquid while the reported fna levels inhibitory to aob and nob varied considerably in different studies it is evident that aob are in general much more tolerant to fna than nob jubany et al 2009b park and bae 2009 in summary when aeration is suppressed the conditions are set so that it is likely that μnob decreases more than μaob thus contributing to the decrease of nob activity this strategy can only be successful if it is combined with a proper srt selected to remove nob faster than they grow as shown in equation 1 and explained in previous works guisasola et al 2010 jubany et al 2009a 2009b lemaire et al 2008 marcelino et al 2011 4 3 resource recovery most alternatives to recover p from wrrfs are based on the sludge generated cieślik and konieczka 2017 egle et al 2016 mayer et al 2016 melia et al 2017 rittmann et al 2011 rotta et al 2019 the most accepted strategy is nowadays its precipitation as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o from the supernatant of digested sludge jabr et al 2019 le corre et al 2009 li et al 2019 rittmann et al 2011 struvite is a slow release rate fertiliser with nitrogen and magnesium that has been reported to be a good option for agricultural uses struvite precipitation in a tertiary step is not a viable option due to the low concentration of phosphate and ammonia the most adequate stream for the struvite precipitation is the digestate of anaerobic digestion due to its high ammonia and phosphate concentrations in addition when ebpr is integrated in a wrrf p recovery as struvite from the digestate can be more efficient since the sludge entering anaerobic digestion contains up to 20 times more p as poly p that could be easily released in the digestate münch and barr 2001 shu et al 2006 however typical values of p recovery around 12 are obtained by struvite precipitation from the supernatant of anaerobic digestion remy and jossa 2015 in contrast to the much higher 45 63 of p recovery reported in section 3 4 which is one of the main achievements of the mainstream scepphar the key operational factor in this configuration is obtaining a high anaerobic p release as it determines the maximum resource recovery that can be obtained the amount of p that can be recovered in r3 pre and the percentage of pha in the sludge on the other hand the precipitation reactor does not need to be designed to treat all the influent wastewater as less than 9 of the influent is treated in this case 5 5 of the reactor volume another possibility would be decreasing the number of cycles with precipitation it could be plan a single recovery per day with some extra vfa in this specific cycle this strategy has been proposed in the literature kodera et al 2013 lv et al 2014 although in some cases it has provoked some instability in pao activity acevedo et al 2015 nevertheless the long term operation with an optimised volume of anaerobic supernatant extraction every cycle has been demonstrated to be feasible and stable at lab scale guisasola et al 2019 with respect to pha the values of 6 9 at the end of the anaerobic phase or 9 1 after adding extra vfa obtained in this work are much lower than the 41 gpha g 1vss obtained by a side stream system fed with surplus full scale activated sludge and acclimated with fest famine cycles using fermented vfa liquors from industry or primary sludge sources werker et al 2018 however considering the amount of sludge produced per day and the cod load in the pilot plant our 6 9 of pha in the biomass results in a yield around 5 of the inlet cod finally ending as pha in the produced sludge this result seems low at a first glance but it is much higher than the negligible yields that can be obtained in side stream systems for producing pha the pha content in the biomass could be even improved if r1 het was operated at a lower srt this lower srt would decrease the total biomass and thus would increase the percentage of pha in the sludge if enough anaerobic vfa uptake is maintained in a previous work chan et al 2020 the pha content of ebpr biomass increased from 8 to 18 gpha g 1vss when the srt was decreased from 15 to 5 days this change can easily be implemented in the mainstream scepphar configuration since it is a two sludge system that allows the independent optimization of both srt to elucidate if the experimental pha content in the biomass was reasonable the amount of pha produced with the extra vfa added was calculated considering the anaerobic stoichiometry for pao smolders et al 1994 1 33 molc phb mol 1c acet 0 95 gphb g 1acet the inlet acetic acid 100 mgcod l 1 to r1 het with a typical biomass concentration of 2 7 gtss l 1 would result in an increase of 2 5 of the pha percentage in the biomass therefore the experimental pha increase observed 3 8 was reasonable as some of the inlet cod could be fermented to vfa during the anaerobic phase in the hypothetic case that the biomass concentration was only 1 4 gtss l 1 the increase of pha would have been 4 8 which supports the strategy of decreasing srt for increasing the percentage of pha these results also show that an important amount of vfa should be available or added in view of obtaining biomass with a significant pha percentage although the experimental pha content obtained could be improved by lowering srt or with sporadic vfa dosages its percentage is still far from the requirements for an economical down stream recovery of the pha polymer which recommends a minimum value of 40 gpha g 1vss werker et al 2018 nevertheless purging sludge with high pha content can also be beneficial for an enhanced biogas production several works report a significant increase of biomethane potential bmp of biomass with higher pha content guisasola et al 2019 huda et al 2016 wang et al 2016 chan et al 2020 studied bmp versus the pha content in ebpr sludge at different operational conditions and obtained a linear correlation bmp ml ch4 g 1vss 240 15 3 pha mmol c g 1vss they showed that the percentage of cod in the influent that could be recovered as methane could be increased from 11 srt 15 d and purge extracted from the aerobic reactor to 28 srt 5 d and purge extracted from the anaerobic reactor moreover the main bmp increase was observed during the first days of the test due to the higher biodegradability of pha thus digesting biomass with high pha content would have a significant impact in anaerobic digesters working at relatively low hrt 4 4 integrated assessment this work reports the major benefits of the mainstream scepphar configuration i ebpr can be combined with a high p recovery as struvite ii the sludge generated contains a higher amount of pha than conventional sludge iii it can remove nitrogen via nitrite shortcut and iv high cod n and p removal are stably obtained if enough rbcod is available in the wastewater on the other hand the pha content in the sludge does not allow an economically feasible extraction although this sludge increases the specific biogas production struvite recovery is demonstrated but the incomes that could be obtained are nowadays negligible compared to the other costs current capex estimation for the scepphar configuration is higher than for a typical a2 o configuration without resource recovery and hence further development and optimization is needed to become competitive from an economic point of view the 15 higher wastewater tariff required for scepphar than for a2 o could justify its implementation if resource recovery is considered strategic and incentives are legislated the current study did not consider incomes from pha because of its concentration below the recommended 40 however evidences from other projects e g phario bengsston et al 2017 werker et al 2018 suggest that a pha accumulation up to 40 is feasible if short enrichment periods are planned at the expense of an additional reactor and external vfa dosage this would open the possibility to obtain incomes from pha recovery in scepphar that would potentially improve its economic feasibility bengsston et al 2017 5 conclusions the mainstream scepphar configuration was operated in a demo scale pilot plant and for a long term with successful results in terms of c n and p removal efficiencies under full nitrification and under nitrite shortcut mode regarding p recovery the anaerobic supernatant had a concentration of p of 6 9 times that of the influent allowing that 45 63 of the p in the influent could be recovered as struvite in a separate precipitator this value is much higher than the typical values around 12 reported for sidestream p recovery mainstream scepphar proposes a purge from the anaerobic phase of the ebpr system rather the conventional purging at the end of the aerobic phase this biomass contains 6 9 9 2 of pha a higher percentage than typical activated sludge but its extraction does not seem economically feasible for bioplastic production with the current technologies nevertheless purging biomass with high pha content would increase the methane production when diverting this sludge to anaerobic digestion and thus it would enhance the energy recovery of the system the economic feasibility study shows that the current scepphar technology would require a water tariff 15 higher than that of a conventional a2 o and hence it would be necessary to legislate incentives to favour resource recovery to make it economically viable declaration of competing interest

18141,accurate modeling of in sewer degradation of sewage borne epidemiological biomarkers requires information on local wastewater temperature we applied a deterministic physical model to map theoretical wastewater temperature on a monthly scale worldwide and incorporated in the model estimated changes in the decay rate of 31 biomarkers of public health relevance frequently used in wastewater based epidemiology wbe over the course of a year 75 of the world s global wastewater temperatures were estimated to fall into the temperature range of 6 9 34 4 c these non fitted results obtained purely a priori were in good agreement with empirical observations n 400 as indicated by coefficients for pearson 0 81 0 76 and spearman 0 86 0 78 correlations for annual minima and maxima respectively application of the q10 rule for biochemical reaction rates showed that depending on wastewater temperature half lives of sewage borne biomarkers will change significantly range 27 7 010 from the baseline at ambient conditions 21 1 c 100 importantly these temperature related modulations of in sewer biomarker decay changed the size of the area observable by wbe in the extreme changes in the distal reach observable by wbe were predicted to be as large as 49 fold over the course of a year at a given location this first model of spatial and temporal variability in wastewater

model output places 75 of the world s global wastewater temperatures in the range of 6 9 34 4 c fig 1 a b 3 2 implications for biomarker half lives and observable capture area the effect of seasonal and spatial variation in wastewater temperature on degradation rates was investigated for a total of 31 sewage borne biomarkers mccall et al 2017 senta et al 2014 cormier et al 2015 benotti and browawell 2009 baz lomba et al 2016 berset et al 2010 castiglioni and zuccato 2011 these included 20 illegal drugs seven markers of physical health and four markers of mental health table 1 wastewater temperature s modulation of half life was estimated to deviate from 100 at ambient conditions 21 1 c within a range between 27 and 7 010 depending on location and season predicted seasonal changes in biomarker degradation vary across the world with equatorial regions having the highest degradation rates i e highest wastewater temperatures refer to fig 1a b but the smallest variation over the course of a year fig 2 a b inland areas are expected to have more variability than coastal ones most extreme fluctuations in theoretical wastewater temperature and observable sewershed extent occur in sparsely populated or unpopulated regions of the world fig 2c however in densely population regions of the world where past monitoring efforts have taken place even relatively small factors translate to significant changes in the size of the population observable as a function of wastewater temperature and biomarker decay fig 2c the population observed is biomarker dependent thus low concentration biomarkers may fall below the practical limit of detection table 2 3 3 comparison of calculated wastewater temperature with observations the theorical wastewater temperatures were compared with nearly 400 observations extracted from 20 studies reporting empirical observations of wastewater temperature for 45 locations around the world fig 3 a b the results show that as parameterized the modeled wastewater temperatures are biased to under estimate the high end 30 40 c of observed wastewater temperatures figs 3a and 4 nevertheless the modeled temperatures are able to replicate seasonal dynamics well for those instances where such finer resolution data were available fig 5 4 discussion here we developed implemented and validated a framework for estimating biomarker degradation over the course of a year for any location around the world the model can be used to better guide comparative sewage metrology efforts by identifying optimal sampling locations times and biomarkers given their likely degradation in the environment within the study area of interest globally modulations of biomarker half lives modulated by seasonal wastewater temperature was calculated to range between 27 and 7 010 relative to rates commonly reported for experiments conducted at ambient 21 1 c conditions few other studies have explored half lives of biomarkers in wastewater at non ambient temperatures and no studies have explored temperatures higher than 22 c cormier et al 2015 reported the modulation of half lives for raw wastewater at 4 c and 21 5 c for 17β estradiol 3077 norethindrone 533 caffeine 342 sulfamethoxazole 425 senta et al 2014 reported half life changes for morphine 3 β d glucuronide 257 6 acetyl morphine 148 cocaine 494 6 acetyl codeine 150 at 10 c and 20 c in municipal wastewater thus the theoretical results of this study are consistent with the empirical observations of available parallels the probable cause for the bias of the model towards the under estimation of observed temperatures is the under estimate of the initial wastewater temperature released into the sewer system discrete discharges e g a hot shower will exceed any one long term average wastewater temperature estimate and lead observed temperatures to rise particularly if observations are made further upstream in a sewer network where the overall wastewater temperature is not modulated by the aggregation of flows the observation sample set illustrates some of the limitations in identifying wastewater temperature empirically observations are scarce certain regions and thus climates of the world are over represented compared to others the relative contribution of wastewater from domestic and industrial sources is not always known and the associated wastewater flowrate is not always known or reported furthermore many of the observations represent a snapshot in time which may be overly biased by activity that is less representative of the area on a long term basis e g a range of 6 35 c captured within the span of a single december day in ede netherlands schilperoort and clemens 2009 based on the calculated range in wastewater temperature over the course of a year and holding initial biomarker loading and analytic detection limit constant the observable sewershed reach changed up to a factor of 49 between winter and summer months fig 2b wastewater temperature strongly impacts the duration of signal retention and thus the quality and return on investment of sewage metrology and wastewater based epidemiology campaigns conducted to collect information on the behavior environmental threats and human health status of large populations additionally if the population markers degrade as quickly as the biomarker and the population monitored was homogenously distributed across the sewershed then the outcome of the seasonal modulation is problematic only in the loss attenuation during summer months of signal however if the population marker is persistent and the biomarker of interest labile large biases would result of the 31 biomarkers included in this study population markers caffeine and nicotine were the second and third most persistent compounds table 1 thus the variability introduced by the seasonality of wastewater temperature and its modulation of biomarker half lives observable sewershed extent and potential population capture fig 2a c may in fact be compounded by differences in biomarker decay rates if the q10 for the selected population marker i e caffeine nicotine and biomarker s of interest to a wbe study are equal then winter and summer per capita results will not be biased by bias in population estimates since both will change in unison this assumes however that the population is homogenous around the sampling location and that the reduced distal reach observable during the hot season captures a population as representative as that observable during the cold season when the reach expands 4 1 sources of uncertainty in numerical wastewater temperature estimates at global scale although long term monthly average wastewater temperature may be expected to follow a seasonal curve such as the one s approximated by the model developed in this study the actual wastewater temperature at any discrete time and location along a wastewater collection system is subject to significant variability generally a diurnal wastewater temperature curve has been observed see cipolla and maglionico 2014 however particularly in systems which 1 co mingle industrial and municipal effluents or 2 sanitary and stormwater flows the temperature of episodic discharges can temporarily lead to a rise or drop in ambient in pipe wastewater temperature which are difficult to simulate hydraulic retention time although it can be bounded when design parameters about a particular wastewater system are known represents one of the largest sources of both parameter uncertainty and model sensitivity table si 2 this is a manifestation of a structural challenge with wastewater based epidemiology studies which are able to preserve the relative anonymity of individuals studied by foregoing the possibility of back casting a single downstream observation into a series of unique upstream origins and contributions 4 2 advantages and limitations the estimates of wastewater temperature and subsequent biomarker degradation presented in this study are founded on a physically based entirely deterministic modeling approach absent of using a training data set model calibration and fitting of model parameters the purely deterministic model relies on relatively few relatively easy to bracket assumptions only few of which e g soil water content at time of interest being time variant and more challenging to parameterize accurately because it is entirely deterministic the model s limitations are related to the simplifying assumptions used to parameterize it efficiently for a global study for instance in this study soil water content was set to the average of field capacity and permanent wilting point varying by soil texture category by invariant across climates precipitation events or prolonged drought can also push soil moisture outside of this range at the selected temporal and spatial resolutions 30 year average month 100 square mile grid spacing the model is best suited for understanding regional and seasonal trends for use at a discrete point or on the local scale most parameters are known or can be directly measured thus the model can be used as is with more refined inputs providing more reliable outputs reflective of field conditions at the time of sampling the model can be easily expanded to a sub daily timestep by applying empirically derived peaking factors for temperature such as those presented for a case study in balogna italy cipolla and maglionico 2014 in addition the likelihood of in pipe wastewater freezing may be addressed by incorporating into the model the existence and extent of temperature insulation measures for refining its use at regional or global scales future iterations may incorporate 1 local or regional building codes specifying sewer burial depth requirements for cold regions 2 the effects of insulated piping on the thermal diffusivity between wastewater and soil in cold regions 3 a recursive calculation of wastewater temperature based on flow rate to transition between low flow upper reaches of a sewer network to high flow downstream trunk lines arriving at a central wastewater treatment plant 4 seasonal changes in initial wastewater temperature discharges and 5 the effects of rainfall runoff to wastewater temperature based on global precipitation datasets 5 conclusions according to both empirical and modeling data compiled and generated here wastewater globally is undergoing considerable fluctuations in temperature over the course of the year this physical change has potentially far reaching consequences for the data quality of wastewater based epidemiological studies assuming constant inputs of biomarkers into a given sewerage system over the course of a year the concentrations and mass of biomarker compounds detectable at a given monitoring location is predicted to be subject to considerable change as a function of temperature in addition the distal reach of wastewater monitoring was determined to change significantly in most regions of the world this implies that the concentrations and mass loads reported in the literature in longitudinal wbe studies potentially could benefit from a correction for temperature effects temperature is anticipated to affect the degradation of indicator compounds tracked in wastewater based epidemiology studies and with it their detectability and concentration over time irrespective of the absolute mass discharged into the sewer to date most wbe studies have been performed in the northern hemisphere between the 20th and 40th parallel in north america and asia and between the 40th and 60th in europe existing observation based studies have simply not covered the entire global spectrum of field conditions if interest in wbe continues to grow and studies expand globally the resulting observations will come from both more and less temperate regions with subsequently greater and lesser seasonal variability in temperature and degradation in order to account for the potential impact of wastewater temperature in wbe studies it would be desirable to collect more empirical data on biomarker attenuation in sewage as a function of temperature the half life values used in this work should be viewed as illustrative only and in the future may be replaced with empirical data that ideally would consider specific characteristics of the sewerage network local wastewater chemistry and the microbiome of the sewage itself as well as that of the sewer pipes with respect to the estimates of per capita consumption or exposure based on de jour population estimates labile chemical population biomarkers e g caffeine nicotine certain pharmaceuticals are also prone to seasonal temperature related degradation this quality makes them even more attractive than de facto e g census based population estimates because the latter would not account for the changing distal reach that is observed during the hotter and colder times of the year in other words in situations where wastewater temperature is suspected to potentially impact the chemical targets of wbe monitoring efforts the robustness of wbe studies may be increased by selecting population size markers whose temperature sensitive half lives match those of the analytical target in conclusion more empirical work is necessary for understanding the temperature dependence of popular biomarker degradation rates as this information is largely lacking in the literature but potentially may be of greater impact on data quality than uncertainties of population estimates in wbe studies in short wastewater temperature varies seasonally in response to fluctuations in air and soil temperature this in turn modulates the longevity of constituents discharged to the wastewater collection system the seasonality in degradation rates results in differing observable downstream concentrations despite equal initial loading when these constituents are biomarkers of interest to the wastewater based epidemiology community inferences about community level public health and changes therein will be biased if seasonality is not appropriately accounted for declaration of competing interest the authors

obtained purely a priori were in good agreement with empirical observations n 400 as indicated by coefficients for pearson 0 81 0 76 and spearman 0 86 0 78 correlations for annual minima and maxima respectively application of the q10 rule for biochemical reaction rates showed that depending on wastewater temperature half lives of sewage borne biomarkers will change significantly range 27 7 010 from the baseline at ambient conditions 21 1 c 100 importantly these temperature related modulations of in sewer biomarker decay changed the size of the area observable by wbe in the extreme changes

field capacity and permanent wilting point a wastewater flow volume of about 11 l per second 0 25 million gallons per day with a density of 1 000 kg m3 and an initial wastewater temperature of 17 8 c model output places 75 of the world s global wastewater temperatures in the range of 6 9 34 4 c fig 1 a b 3 2 implications for biomarker half lives and observable capture area the effect of seasonal and spatial variation in wastewater temperature on degradation rates was investigated for a total of 31 sewage borne biomarkers mccall et al 2017 senta et al 2014 cormier et al 2015 benotti and browawell 2009 baz lomba et al 2016 berset et al 2010 castiglioni and zuccato 2011 these included 20 illegal drugs seven markers of physical health and four markers of mental health table 1 wastewater temperature s modulation of half life was estimated to deviate from 100 at ambient conditions 21 1 c within a range between 27 and 7 010 depending on location and season predicted seasonal changes in biomarker degradation vary across the world with equatorial regions having the highest degradation rates i e highest wastewater temperatures refer to fig 1a b but the smallest variation over the course of a year fig 2 a b inland areas are expected to have more variability than coastal ones most extreme fluctuations in theoretical wastewater temperature and observable sewershed extent occur in sparsely populated or unpopulated regions of the world fig 2c however in densely population regions of the world where past monitoring efforts have taken place even relatively small factors translate to significant changes in the size of the population observable as a function of wastewater temperature and biomarker decay fig 2c the population observed is biomarker dependent thus low concentration biomarkers may fall below the practical limit of detection table 2 3 3 comparison of calculated wastewater temperature with observations the theorical wastewater temperatures were compared with nearly 400 observations extracted from 20 studies reporting empirical observations of wastewater temperature for 45 locations around the world fig 3 a b the results show that as parameterized the modeled wastewater temperatures are biased to under estimate the high end 30 40 c of observed wastewater temperatures figs 3a and 4 nevertheless the modeled temperatures are able to replicate seasonal dynamics well for those instances where such finer resolution data were available fig 5 4 discussion here we developed implemented and validated a framework for estimating biomarker degradation over the course of a year for any location around the world the model can be used to better guide comparative sewage metrology efforts by identifying optimal sampling locations times and biomarkers given their likely degradation in the environment within the study area of interest globally modulations of biomarker half lives modulated by seasonal wastewater temperature was calculated to range between 27 and 7 010 relative to rates commonly reported for experiments conducted at ambient 21 1 c conditions few other studies have explored half lives of biomarkers in wastewater at non ambient temperatures and no studies have explored temperatures higher than 22 c cormier et al 2015 reported the modulation of half lives for raw wastewater at 4 c and 21 5 c for 17β estradiol 3077 norethindrone 533 caffeine 342 sulfamethoxazole 425 senta et al 2014 reported half life changes for morphine 3 β d glucuronide 257 6 acetyl morphine 148 cocaine 494 6 acetyl codeine 150 at 10 c and 20 c in municipal wastewater thus the theoretical results of this study are consistent with the empirical observations of available parallels the probable cause for the bias of the model towards the under estimation of observed temperatures is the under estimate of the initial wastewater temperature released into the sewer system discrete discharges e g a hot shower will exceed any one long term average wastewater temperature estimate and lead observed temperatures to rise particularly if observations are made further upstream in a sewer network where the overall wastewater temperature is not modulated by the aggregation of flows the observation sample set illustrates some of the limitations in identifying wastewater temperature empirically observations are scarce certain regions and thus climates of the world are over represented compared to others the relative contribution of wastewater from domestic and industrial sources is not always known and the associated wastewater flowrate is not always known or reported furthermore many of the observations represent a snapshot in time which may be overly biased by activity that is less representative of the area on a long term basis e g a range of 6 35 c captured within the span of a single december day in ede netherlands schilperoort and clemens 2009 based on the calculated range in wastewater temperature over the course of a year and holding initial biomarker loading and analytic detection limit constant the observable sewershed reach changed up to a factor of 49 between winter and summer months fig 2b wastewater temperature strongly impacts the duration of signal retention and thus the quality and return on investment of sewage metrology and wastewater based epidemiology campaigns conducted to collect information on the behavior environmental threats and human health status of large populations additionally if the population markers degrade as quickly as the biomarker and the population monitored was homogenously distributed across the sewershed then the outcome of the seasonal modulation is problematic only in the loss attenuation during summer months of signal however if the population marker is persistent and the biomarker of interest labile large biases would result of the 31 biomarkers included in this study population markers caffeine and nicotine were the second and third most persistent compounds table 1 thus the variability introduced by the seasonality of wastewater temperature and its modulation of biomarker half lives observable sewershed extent and potential population capture fig 2a c may in fact be compounded by differences in biomarker decay rates if the q10 for the selected population marker i e caffeine nicotine and biomarker s of interest to a wbe study are equal then winter and summer per capita results will not be biased by bias in population estimates since both will change in unison this assumes however that the population is homogenous around the sampling location and that the reduced distal reach observable during the hot season captures a population as representative as that observable during the cold season when the reach expands 4 1 sources of uncertainty in numerical wastewater temperature estimates at global scale although long term monthly average wastewater temperature may be expected to follow a seasonal curve such as the one s approximated by the model developed in this study the actual wastewater temperature at any discrete time and location along a wastewater collection system is subject to significant variability generally a diurnal wastewater temperature curve has been observed see cipolla and maglionico 2014 however particularly in systems which 1 co mingle industrial and municipal effluents or 2 sanitary and stormwater flows the temperature of episodic discharges can temporarily lead to a rise or drop in ambient in pipe wastewater temperature which are difficult to simulate hydraulic retention time although it can be bounded when design parameters about a particular wastewater system are known represents one of the largest sources of both parameter uncertainty and model sensitivity table si 2 this is a manifestation of a structural challenge with wastewater based epidemiology studies which are able to preserve the relative anonymity of individuals studied by foregoing the possibility of back casting a single downstream observation into a series of unique upstream origins and contributions 4 2 advantages and limitations the estimates of wastewater temperature and subsequent biomarker degradation presented in this study are founded on a physically based entirely deterministic modeling approach absent of using a training data set model calibration and fitting of model parameters the purely deterministic model relies on relatively few relatively easy to bracket assumptions only few of which e g soil water content at time of interest being time variant and more challenging to parameterize accurately because it is entirely deterministic the model s limitations are related to the simplifying assumptions used to parameterize it efficiently for a global study for instance in this study soil water content was set to the average of field capacity and permanent wilting point varying by soil texture category by invariant across climates precipitation events or prolonged drought can also push soil moisture outside of this range at the selected temporal and spatial resolutions 30 year average month 100 square mile grid spacing the model is best suited for understanding regional and seasonal trends for use at a discrete point or on the local scale most parameters are known or can be directly measured thus the model can be used as is with more refined inputs providing more reliable outputs reflective of field conditions at the time of sampling the model can be easily expanded to a sub daily timestep by applying empirically derived peaking factors for temperature such as those presented for a case study in balogna italy cipolla and maglionico 2014 in addition the likelihood of in pipe wastewater freezing may be addressed by incorporating into the model the existence and extent of temperature insulation measures for refining its use at regional or global scales future iterations may incorporate 1 local or regional building codes specifying sewer burial depth requirements for cold regions 2 the effects of insulated piping on the thermal diffusivity between wastewater and soil in cold regions 3 a recursive calculation of wastewater temperature based on flow rate to transition between low flow upper reaches of a sewer network to high flow downstream trunk lines arriving at a central wastewater treatment plant 4 seasonal changes in initial wastewater temperature discharges and 5 the effects of rainfall runoff to wastewater temperature based on global precipitation datasets 5 conclusions according to both empirical and modeling data compiled and generated here wastewater globally is undergoing considerable fluctuations in temperature over the course of the year this physical change has potentially far reaching consequences for the data quality of wastewater based epidemiological studies assuming constant inputs of biomarkers into a given sewerage system over the course of a year the concentrations and mass of biomarker compounds detectable at a given monitoring location is predicted to be subject to considerable change as a function of temperature in addition the distal reach of wastewater monitoring was determined to change significantly in most regions of the world this implies that the concentrations and mass loads reported in the literature in longitudinal wbe studies potentially could benefit from a correction for temperature effects temperature is anticipated to affect the degradation of indicator compounds tracked in wastewater based epidemiology studies and with it their detectability and concentration over time irrespective of the absolute mass discharged into the sewer to date most wbe studies have been performed in the northern hemisphere between the 20th and 40th parallel in north america and asia and between the 40th and 60th in europe existing observation based studies have simply not covered the entire global spectrum of field conditions if interest in wbe continues to grow and studies expand globally the resulting observations will come from both more and less temperate regions with subsequently greater and lesser seasonal variability in temperature and degradation in order to account for the potential impact of wastewater temperature in wbe studies it would be desirable to collect more empirical data on biomarker attenuation in sewage as a function of temperature the half life values used in this work should be viewed as illustrative only and in the future may be replaced with empirical data that ideally would consider specific characteristics of the sewerage network local wastewater chemistry and the microbiome of the sewage itself as well as that of the sewer pipes with respect to the estimates of per capita consumption or exposure based on de jour population estimates labile chemical population biomarkers e g caffeine nicotine certain pharmaceuticals are also prone to seasonal temperature related degradation this quality makes them even more attractive than de facto e g census based population estimates because the latter would not account for the changing distal reach that is observed during the hotter and colder times of the year in other words in situations where wastewater temperature is suspected to potentially impact the chemical targets of wbe monitoring efforts the robustness of wbe studies may be increased by selecting population size markers whose temperature sensitive half lives match those of the analytical target in conclusion more empirical work is necessary for understanding the temperature dependence of popular biomarker degradation rates as this information is largely lacking in the literature but potentially may be of greater impact on data quality than uncertainties of population estimates in wbe studies in short wastewater temperature varies seasonally in response to fluctuations in air and soil temperature this in turn modulates the longevity of constituents discharged to the wastewater collection system the seasonality in degradation rates results in differing observable downstream concentrations despite equal initial loading when these constituents are biomarkers of interest to the wastewater based epidemiology community inferences about community level public health and changes therein will be biased if seasonality is not appropriately accounted for declaration of competing interest the authors

18142,lagoon has been widely used to treat animal wastewater however because lagoon effluent often fluctuates in water quality land application of the effluent may pose a risk to the environment and or public health it is necessary to monitor the quality of lagoon water to reduce the risk of its land application this paper proposes an innovative monitoring method for animal wastewater in lagoons we implemented spectral processing techniques to analyze the reflectivity of wastewater samples from lagoons and applied machine learning methods to estimate the water quality parameters of the effluents including the levels of nitrogen phosphorus bacteria total coliform and e coli and total solids this study found significant correlations between the spectral rate of emission and above water quality parameters we used machine learning to train three types of estimators normal equation linear regression lr stochastic gradient descent sgd and ridge regression to quantify these relations the model performance was evaluated by weight coefficient function intercept and mean squared error mse the model showed that ts level and the blue band of spectral reflectance of samples have a relatively good linear relationship and the mse of prediction set and decision coefficient were 0 57 and 0 98 respectively for bacteria level the mse of prediction set was 0 63 and coefficient r2 was 0 96 the results from this study could provide a versatile method for remote sensing of animal waste water keywords lagoon water monitoring image processing spectrum analysis machine learning linear regression 1 introduction concentrated animal feed operations cafos produce tremendous amount of wastewater reusing treated animal wastewater for barn cleaning and irrigation can significantly help to integrate water resource management coogan et al 2007 amaral and ferreira 2005 for most cafos animal wastewater treatment is limited to open lagoons which are often fluctuating in water quality and water holding volume the effluent may contain excessive amount of nutrients detrimental to soil or plant growth and or chemical contaminants salts and pathogens that pose a risk to the wider environment or public health sheng 2005 coats et al 2015 yu et al 2005 vivant et al 2017 these risks can be minimized by carefully monitoring whether the lagoons have provided sufficient treatment and whether the wastewater has met the nutrient need of the crop fields but conventional monitoring systems cannot provide reliable lagoon water information to guide precise reuse of the wastewater due to lack of connectivity of cafos to water laboratories therefore developing a low cost and effective monitoring method of lagoon water has become an urgent issue there have been efforts to enhance lagoon water quality monitoring the but these methods have some drawbacks in terms of cost and transferability for example fornai et al designed an autonomous water monitoring and sampling system which use sensors to test water chemical parameters but this system relies on sensorized autonomous vehicles and complex electrical signal control systems fornai et al 2017 perumal et al proposed an internet of things iot water monitoring system which can measure water level in real time however the monitoring cost of this method is relatively high making the technology less feasible on most farms perumal et al 2015 yang et al combined a chemical oxygen sensor and virtual instrument technique to develop a water quality monitoring system but this system relies not only on the integrity of the sample but also the measurement process is time consuming yang et al 2008 on the other hand artificial intelligence has become an emerging method for water quality monitoring gunda et al 2019 have implemented an ai based mobile platform to monitor the water for presence of bacteria ahmed et al used three evaluation techniques of machine learning to construct prediction model for water quality parameters and it was found that the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis radial basis function neural networks rbf ann and multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp ann models satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters ahmed et al 2019 jeong et al 2020 however there has been little study on characterizing animal wastewater using computer vison and artificial intelligence to address these issues from previous researches we propose an image based processing technology in this study that can provide quick easy and cost effective process for animal wastewater quality monitoring image analysis has become a popular analytical means and it has been applied to various industries almasia et al 2019 de paula vieiraet al 2018 it can potentially greatly reduce

a tristimulus filter senthilnath et al 2016 tominaga and tanaka 2000 the goal of this study is to develop an image based process to facilitate the measurement of lagoon water quality our main objectives are to 1 determine the relationship between image and water quality indicators 2 propose a method for extracting the index of rgb information to assess the image of animal waste water and 3 study the quantitative relationship between the index of rgb information and the composition of lagoon water the project will open the opportunity for studying water resources of farm lagoons and rural ponds on various imaging platform we envision implementing the method on smartphone camera turning it into an inexpensive handheld analytic instrument with web connectivity to enable point of care sensing for the lagoons that have not been practical previously these will enable quick decision making regarding better management of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and treatment the lagoon water samples were collected from wastewater lagoons of the southwest regional dairy center located at stephenville tx the lagoon water consists of manure and barn cleaning water based on the lagoon testing history main water quality parameters of the lagoon water are dissolved organic matter suspended solids algae proliferating nutrients including nitrogen n and phosphorus p and bacteria the color of the water was brown to red and there was no noticeable precipitate neoh et al 2016 vijay and yuan 2017 water samples containing relatively low levels of pollutants were also collected from a pond in texas a m university research park located in college station tx sample collection was conducted at representative sites in the pond lagoon using 1 l sterilized polypropylene containers the samples were then promptly sealed and transferred to a cooler the collected samples were stored in 4 c refrigerator before used for experiments centrifugation was applied to water samples to simulate the change of wastewater quality mason et al 2016 cydzik kwiatkowska and magdalena 2016 the centrifuge time was varied to produce samples with different levels of indicator contaminates and different image information for centrifugation the samples were well mixed and transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged eppendorf usa at a rate of 3000 rpm for desired time 0 5 30 60 and 120 min supernatant of each sample was carefully collected and kept in 4 c refrigerator before used for subsequent image and chemical analysis 2 2 analysis of operating parameters to perform an analysis of chemical parameters of raw and centrifuged water samples the supernatant were sent to soil water and forage testing laboratory college station tx of texas a m university the water quality indicators including total n p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na zinc zn iron fe copper cu manganese mn ph conductivity and total solids were measured bacterial analysis was performed within 12 h of manure sample collection total coliforms and escherichia coli e coli are frequently used as indicators of the potential for pathogen presence in animal manure since they are typically present in higher densities than any single pathogen garzio hadzick et al 2010 mclaughlin et al 2015 in this study the quanti tray method using colilert idexx westbrook me was used to quantitatively determine the level of total coliforms and e coli a 0 85 sodium chloride solution normal saline solution was used for dilution of bacteria to enumerate the cells each sample was serially diluted by applying 1 ml 99 ml of solution making a 10 2 dilution of the original sample up to 10 6 of subsequent serial dilutions were applied as needed in order to estimate a detectable concentration of the bacteria zhang et al 2017b youssef et al 2016 a packet of colilert reagent was added to the diluted samples and well mixed the entire content of each sample was poured into a quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories westbrook me sealed and was then ready for incubation the trays were incubated for 24 4 h at 35 c 0 5 c after incubation the results were examined by observing and counting the wells yellow color for total coliforms and fluorescence emission under ultraviolet light for e coli the most probable number mpn of total coliforms and e coli was determined according to the manufacturer s instructions and was based on the statistical poisson distribution of positive and negative wells 2 3 digital image analysis 2 3 1 pre treatment and correction the camera used in this study has a pixel resolution of 1920 1080 and acquires image of wavelength from 380 to 780 nm in the visible range the software used for pre processing is spectra sens and unscrambled the raw image data was imported for black and white correction the noise was reduced by the principle of smoothing modulus angle separated wavelet analysis gupta et al 2014 stokes et al 1996 the median filtering based on the multifractal spectrum sorting statistics was used to reduce the interference caused by image noise because it is a non linear signal processing method that has a better effect to reduce the noise of spectral data the original baseline translation domain block was established based on the multifractal spectrum for spectral analysis envi 5 3 harris geospatial solution was used in this study region of interest roi module function in envi 5 3 was used to select a specific roi in the image where the image information will be obtained the 15 mm quartz petri dish was used as a sample container when acquire the water image the water depth was kept at 2 4 cm which was deep enough to prevent the reflection from the bottom of the container fig 1 a and b for selecting the roi regions with potential interference such as light reflection diffraction or shadow from the container were avoided mur artal and tardós 2017 raja et al 2015 in addition the rois were selected in a random and representative manner after selection we conducted color correction on the rois fig 1 c in order to reduce the effect of ambient light on the acquired image roi analysis was performed on samples placed before black and white background for each acquisition the black or white background was used as the reference for extreme values to correct the color of the water sample 2 3 2 image mathematical model the rgb true color of sample images was analyzed using the matlab and envi software collected images were in typical 24 bit 8 bit per r g and bchannel encoded format each channel used a count range between 0 and 255 to represent increasing bright shades of red green and blue ranging from completely black and to completely white the rgb true color model is a standard industrial

foundation beaverton or usa firstly the data set 89 observations was randomly split into a training set containing 75 of all observations and a test set containing the rest 25 the predictors were raw 5 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h frequency at spectrum respectively while the target was the reflectivity of rgb channel to eliminate the measurement unit the predictors were normalized by mean and standard deviation before fitting in regression in this paper three methods were mainly used to compare model performance lr ordinary least square sgd linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical

l o l s β i 1 m y i x i β 2 y x β 2 where m is the number of samples and y i denotes the true value of the i th training sample according to eq 3 in order to avoid the over fitting caused by the complexity of the training model we add the optimization item in the loss function so that the weight coefficient of some features can become smaller and the influence of the features of the higher order index can be eliminated so we can improve eq 3 4 l r i d g e β i 1 m y i x i β 2 λ j 1 n β j 2 y x β 2 λ β 2 where m is the number of samples n is the feature number yi is the true value of the

sources the sample images on three rgb channels were analyzed using data within the selected roi the selection and channel separation process was shown in fig 2 the r channel showed significant difference in intensity to the naked eye after 1 min of centrifugation the changes of image for 3 and 10 min centrifuged samples were less obvious to the naked eye but there are significant differences that can be detected by image analysis thus it is the most suitable for the image analysis of pond water if there is potential change in the water quality nevertheless the exact mechanism regarding which substances affect the reflectance of the spectrum during centrifugation is not clear fig 3 shows the result of frequency analysis pond water samples which were processed with four centrifuge times 0 1 3 and 10 min three different colors represent frequencies of rgb channels between 0 and 255 of color threshold the result demonstrated that data value x axis for r g and b channel of centrifuged water sample has obvious difference compared to those of raw pond water fig 3 which corresponds to the results of channel separation fig 2 the increase in centrifugation time was equivalent to reducing the chemical elements in the sample that affect the light transmittance therefore the highest spectral intensity of the r band of each sample groups reached to 9893 2512 11809 and 10605 when centrifugation was applied for 0 1 3 and 10 min respectively the frequency values for other channels were also decreased when 1 min of centrifugation was applied and the frequencies for g and b channel were 2579 and 2816 respectively after 3 and 10 min of centrifugation fig 3 c and d the sedimentation of the water sample has too little difference to be noticed by the naked eye from their images but it can be distinguished using data analysis their data value distribution interval of b channel on the abscissa were significantly different the data source shown in fig 3 c has a small span in the x axis direction while the span in fig 3 d is larger the magnitude relationship of the three rgb channels of fig 3 b and c in the order of frequency is b f g f r f but fig 3 d clearly shows a change of this relationship which become g f b f r f furthermore four different samples are separately analyzed for r channel fig 4 the frequency peak changed from large to small and then changed smoothly the f1 represents the reflectance peak of untreated lagoon water samples similarly f2 represents one minute sample reflectance peak f3 and f4 are 3 min and 10 min of sample reflectance peak centrifugation could produce different characteristics in chemical composition resulted in different image pattern according to the centrifugation treatment time of these lagoon water samples wastewater with different degrees of quality parameters can be well simulated each water sample showed different principle and characteristics in the spectral data analysis of the three channels of rgb the sample of polluted water changed significantly in the r color channel therefore we could find a certain mathematical relationship between image values and concentrations of some indicators of contaminants in the water 3 2 spectral analysis with main chemical indicators to further investigate the relationship between animal waste water quality and its spectral data we measured the distribution of values of three rgb bands in the sample roi fig 5 and the concentrations of pollution indicators of the lagoon water for five treatment groups centrifuge time of 0 5 30 60 and 120 min comparing the distribution of the three bands the longer the wavelength the more dispersed the distribution becomes it suggests that shorter wavelength light has less interaction with the body of lagoon water before it is reflected the distribution of r channel data of 5 treatment group bands were more dispersed than other channels the highest and lowest frequency were 30000 and 15000 respectively which means that the light could be interfering with contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids and bacteria activities etc as discussed in fig 3 r channel was the most favorable channel for analyzing the change of contaminants level for water sample the frequency of 30 min centrifuged group was significantly lower than that of 5 min centrifuged group fig 5 because the lowered contaminants concentration affected the reflection performance of the electromagnetic wave the highest frequency was also shown in 5 min group for g bands there were no significant differences between 1 h and 2 h centrifuged groups and both group showed peak frequencies at data value of 45 it may be because 1 h of centrifuge was the maximum separation capacity in the experimental condition in contrast to the r and g channels b channel showed a different frequency pattern fig 5 the sample frequency of raw sample was still the lowest in b bands but peak frequencies of all experimental group in b bands were concentrated in similar data value although data value of raw and 30 min centrifuged group were separated apart compared to the other groups the overall dispersion of data value of each group in b bands was narrower than other bands as show in table 1 most of components decreased significantly when centrifuge was applied up to 30 min among 15 kinds of different water quality indicators four components n p ts and total coliform were selected as indicators in this study and they showed a specific relationship with a spectral data from image analysis fig 6 shows a diagram of intercept dependency on rgb bands for all sample groups between band number of 1 and 2 the roi means decreased with band number in the same order i e 30 min sample has the lowest value and 2 h one has the highest value at higher band number the reflectivity of 30 min sample was still the lowest but the order of the other samples changed at the highest band number 3 in the study the untreated sample had the highest roi means value it can be concluded that the sample treated with 30 min of centrifuge had the lowest roi average value in all three channels the indicator analysis result described in table 1 represents that k ca and conductivity had the lowest levels in 30 min group which correspond to the roi means fig 6 3 3 model preprocessing analysis to improve model stability and reduce multicollinearity between water quality indicators model variables were standardized and then centered and skewed to the range from 1 to 10 the relationship between normalized vectors of spectra and nitrogen phosphorus total solids and total coliform are shown in fig 7 large changes of these water quality indicators were captured by the 4 to 5 interval in the r channel considering the information from fig 8 fig 9 and table 1 the concentration of p and image spectra showed the lowest correlation in all rgb channels among the four indicators because in the rgb image display mode different channels actually store components on different colors the actual concentrations of each indicator were fitted with each of reflectance value when comparing the image spectral data of rgb channel with the concentrations of four indicators mathematical correlation between these two numerical values could be found in particular b channel of n and total coliform and g channel of total solids showed the strongest links and there were reasonable correlations in other channels for example n concentration and b channel spectral value has a linear relation of r 2 0 968 for r and g channels we could achieve r 2 values of 0 908 and 0 914 respectively overall total solids concentration had the highest r 2 average values 0 941 among the four water quality indicators in addition the r 2 equals to 0 657 in the b channel indicating that b channel is insufficient to estimate the p concentration of lagoon water the relationship between total coliform concentration and image spectral data value showed similar correlation to n level in the water r 2 values includes 0 901 0 9142 and 0 957 in the r g and b channels respectively and trend line equations with greater than 0 9 of r 2 value were derived for all three channels the r 2 value of bacterial concentration and spectral data trend line was the highest in the b channel unlike other indicators total solids showed the lowest r 2 value in the b channel the r 2 values in the trend line between the rgb channels and the actual concentration were 0 960 0 998 and 0 865 respectively indicating that there was the highest correlation in the g channel these results show that image has a potential in water quality monitoring for example satellite images from web portal sites such as google are able to provide approximate water quality information for lagoon water in addition the image analysis allows us to understand the effects of hydrologic events or other changes on lagoon water quality very easily this would bring tremendous economic benefits and savings of time and labor 3 4 estimator performance evaluation the performance of the three models on test data is shown in fig 10 the training target represents the spectral intensity value according to the division rule of the spectrum rgb can be divided into three different intervals we found that the three estimators are similar in evaluation metric the training results were relatively close to the values of the test set in reflectivity when the training target was between 9 and 11 the test dataset and the prediction dataset had a large deviation the most accurate range of predicted value was between 7 5 and 8 5 and between 13 and 16 to sum up this part after the 14 spectral intensity value the prediction accuracy was closest to the test value and this band from 14 to 22 5 belongs to the b channel next we calculated the mse of the three evaluators see table 2 the five values of the weight coefficient represent the weight of the raw data of sample 5 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h of centrifugation after adjusting the values of random state rs the samples treated with 30 min of centrifugation were the most weighted in the whole model where the maximum value was 11 35 in the sgd model and the minimum value was 10 07 in the ridge model the wastewater treated with 1 and 2 h of centrifugation did not show significant change the weight coefficient of 1 h s took the minimum value of 0 98 in the sgd model and the 2 h s sample also achieved the minimum value of 1 83 in the sgd model the peak rate of absorption was about 30 min after centrifugation in summary the ridge based estimator achieved the optimal mse of 405 513 505 322 and 570 532 a small perturbation is added to the least square estimation which makes the unsolvable generalized inverse solvable and makes the data stable in this paper the ridge regression partial least squares rr pls was used for the correction for the best model ridge estimator we calculated the mathematical relationship between the four main water quality parameters and the spectral reflectance the sample predictor matrix x was a b channel digital matrix and its eigenvector was main pollution index coefficient of wastewater mattikalli 1997 zhang et al 2017a as shown in fig 11 the fitting degree of total coliform and total solids were relatively reasonable the experiments consisted of five treatments of centrifugation times where the point sets were partially concentrated to make sure the model is generally representative the point set of fig 11 a and fig 11 b were relatively dispersed the value of b channel data was negatively correlated with the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus it showed that in the ridge and b channel models the determination coefficient of e coli prediction set was r 2 0 987 root mean square error was rmsep 0 47 and rms error of correction set was rmsec 0 39 the r 2 of nitrogen contents prediction set was 0 993 rms of error prediction set was rmsep 0 28 and correction set rms error was rmsec 0 13 the r 2 of phosphorus contents prediction set was 0 927 the rms error of prediction set was rmsep 0 32 and the correction set rms error was rmsec 0 18 the total solids prediction model for soluble solids of wastewater samples also had good predictive performance with r 2 0 992 the results show that the b channel data can be used to estimate the n p total coliform and total solids levels of lagoon wastewater table 3 shows the r 2 of algorithm lr sgd and ridge of the rgb channels as shown in table 3 among the three models the correctness rate of the discriminant model established by the selection method of lr and ridge feature band were high the accuracy of ridge discriminant model was the highest 99 9 and highest accuracy of lr and discriminant models was 96 3 the lr algorithm based on linear regression analysis takes the spectral matrix as an independent variable and the sample physicochemical value as a dependent variable to establish the prediction model then select the wavelength or band and use the gray level co occurrence matrix to cross validate all sample as a ridge modeling method ridge integrates nonlinear factors in the modeling process in general mathematical model of ridge combined with image information of lagoon wastewater is effective and the comprehensive evaluation of the ridge discriminant model takes the best performance 4 conclusions this study proposes a new lab free wastewater monitoring method as cafo water measurement and monitoring supplement the method combines spectral processing techniques with machine learning methods to analyze the change of water quality from reflectivity of water samples the image analysis procedure described in this study establishes a quantitative correlation between image information and numerical water quality data which could be feasible for water quality monitoring to sum up the conclusions of this study are mainly divided into the following four points 1 centrifugation was applied to simulate the change of wastewater quality associated with this process there were significant changes of the wastewater spectral reflectance shown in the processed rgb channel data this provides a data reference for image based measurement of wastewater 2 the lagoon water samples display distinct characteristics with rgb channel separation those features can help to quantitatively estimate the changes of certain water quality indicators this study have found considerable linear fits between the b channel spectral reflectance and the levels of total nitrogen total phosphorus total solids and total coliform 3 this study focused on the mathematical modeling between total solids and total coliform and wastewater spectral reflectance values among all water quality indicators these two showed relatively higher mathematical relationships with the b channel data for total solids the prediction set mse was 0 57 and its decision coefficient r 2 was 0 98 for total coliform the prediction set mse was 0 63 and its decision coefficient r 2 was 0 96 4 in the visible spectral range true color image analysis could detect significant changes of key water quality indicators of lagoon water different types of water quality information were revealed by different color channels the features of reflectivity in one color channel can provide a relatively accurate prediction on the change of corresponding water quality parameters this study is a first and essential step for an image based cafo wastewater analysis technology which enables the lab free estimation of lagoon water and rural ponds this will lay the foundation for as an image based technology capable of lab free testing of animal farm lagoons and rural ponds the method proposed in this paper seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of the image based strategy for lagoon water monitoring this method still has some limitations the estimators of the method can only be applied to a limited number of lagoon effluent pollution indicators components affecting reflectivity outside the visible range such as heavy

18142,lagoon has been widely used to treat animal wastewater however because lagoon effluent often fluctuates in water quality land application of the effluent may pose a risk to the environment and or public health it is necessary to monitor the quality of lagoon water to reduce the risk of its land application this paper proposes an innovative monitoring method for animal wastewater in lagoons we implemented spectral processing techniques to analyze the reflectivity of wastewater samples from lagoons and applied machine learning methods to estimate the water quality parameters of the effluents including the levels of nitrogen phosphorus bacteria total coliform and e coli and total solids this study found significant correlations between the spectral rate of emission and above water quality parameters we used machine learning to train three types of estimators normal equation linear regression lr stochastic gradient descent sgd and ridge regression to quantify these relations the model performance was evaluated by weight coefficient function intercept and mean squared error mse the model showed that ts level and the blue band of spectral reflectance of samples have a relatively good linear relationship and the mse of prediction set and decision coefficient were 0 57 and 0 98 respectively for bacteria level the mse of prediction set was 0 63 and coefficient r2 was 0 96 the results from this study could provide a versatile method for remote sensing of animal waste water keywords lagoon water monitoring image processing spectrum analysis machine learning linear regression 1 introduction concentrated animal feed operations cafos produce tremendous amount of wastewater reusing treated animal wastewater for barn cleaning and irrigation can significantly help to integrate water resource management coogan et al 2007 amaral and ferreira 2005 for most cafos animal wastewater treatment is limited to open lagoons which are often fluctuating in water quality and water holding volume the effluent may contain excessive amount of nutrients detrimental to soil or plant growth and or chemical contaminants salts and pathogens that pose a risk to the wider environment or public health sheng 2005 coats et al 2015 yu et al 2005 vivant et al 2017 these risks can be minimized by carefully monitoring whether the lagoons have provided sufficient treatment and whether the wastewater has met the nutrient need of the crop fields but conventional monitoring systems cannot provide reliable lagoon water information to guide precise reuse of the wastewater due to lack of connectivity of cafos to water laboratories therefore developing a low cost and effective monitoring method of lagoon water has become an urgent issue there have been efforts to enhance lagoon water quality monitoring the but these methods have some drawbacks in terms of cost and transferability for example fornai et al designed an autonomous water monitoring and sampling system which use sensors to test water chemical parameters but this system relies on sensorized autonomous vehicles and complex electrical signal control systems fornai et al 2017 perumal et al proposed an internet of things iot water monitoring system which can measure water level in real time however the monitoring cost of this method is relatively high making the technology less feasible on most farms perumal et al 2015 yang et al combined a chemical oxygen sensor and virtual instrument technique to develop a water quality monitoring system but this system relies not only on the integrity of the sample but also the measurement process is time consuming yang et al 2008 on the other hand artificial intelligence has become an emerging method for water quality monitoring gunda et al 2019 have implemented an ai based mobile platform to monitor the water for presence of bacteria ahmed et al used three evaluation techniques of machine learning to construct prediction model for water quality parameters and it was found that the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis radial basis function neural networks rbf ann and multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp ann models satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters ahmed et al 2019 jeong et al 2020 however there has been little study on characterizing animal wastewater using computer vison and artificial intelligence to address these issues from previous researches we propose an image based processing technology in this study that can provide quick easy and cost effective process for animal wastewater quality monitoring image analysis has become a popular analytical means and it has been applied to various industries almasia et al 2019 de paula vieiraet al 2018 it can potentially greatly reduce both the lab test and labor costs amaral and ferreira 2005 recent developments have indicated that the methods of image processing can be successfully used for monitoring the bacteria in wastewater predicting inflation events and precise positioning of flocs ewa liwarska bizukojc 2005 rgb color coordinates have been used in remote sensing to identify and predict soil and geologic materials of sparsely vegetated regions mattikalli 1997 heikkinen et al 2008 lei et al proposed a rgb value monitoring method of wastewater using digital image from a single point of true color image lei et al 2000 by using a spectrophotometer as the measurement device the american dye manufactures institute 3 and 31 wavelength methods can effectively measure wastewater for true color and apparent color as a tristimulus filter senthilnath et al 2016 tominaga and tanaka 2000 the goal of this study is to develop an image based process to facilitate the measurement of lagoon water quality our main objectives are to 1 determine the relationship between image and water quality indicators 2 propose a method for extracting the index of rgb information to assess the image of animal waste water and 3 study the quantitative relationship between the index of rgb information and the composition of lagoon water the project will open the opportunity for studying water resources of farm lagoons and rural ponds on various imaging platform we envision implementing the method on smartphone camera turning it into an inexpensive handheld analytic instrument with web connectivity to enable point of care sensing for the lagoons that have not been practical previously these will enable quick decision making regarding better management of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and treatment the lagoon water samples were collected from wastewater lagoons of the southwest regional dairy center located at stephenville tx the lagoon water consists of manure and barn cleaning water based on the lagoon testing history main water quality parameters of the lagoon water are dissolved organic matter suspended solids algae proliferating nutrients including nitrogen n and phosphorus p and bacteria the color of the water was brown to red and there was no noticeable precipitate neoh et al 2016 vijay and yuan 2017 water samples containing relatively low levels of pollutants were also collected from a pond in texas a m university research park located in college station tx sample collection was conducted at representative sites in the pond lagoon using 1 l sterilized polypropylene containers the samples were then promptly sealed and transferred to a cooler the collected samples were stored in 4 c refrigerator before used for experiments centrifugation was applied to water samples to simulate the change of wastewater quality mason et al 2016 cydzik kwiatkowska and magdalena 2016 the centrifuge time was varied to produce samples with different levels of indicator contaminates and different image information for centrifugation the samples were well mixed and transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged eppendorf usa at a rate of 3000 rpm for desired time 0 5 30 60 and 120 min supernatant of each sample was carefully collected and kept in 4 c refrigerator before used for subsequent image and chemical analysis 2 2 analysis of operating parameters to perform an analysis of chemical parameters of raw and centrifuged water samples the supernatant were sent to soil water and forage testing laboratory college station tx of texas a m university the water quality indicators including total n p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na zinc zn iron fe copper cu manganese mn ph conductivity and total solids were measured bacterial analysis was performed within 12 h of manure sample collection total coliforms and escherichia coli e coli are frequently used as indicators of the potential for pathogen presence in animal manure since they are typically present in higher densities than any single pathogen garzio hadzick et al 2010 mclaughlin et al 2015 in this study the quanti tray method using colilert idexx westbrook me was used to quantitatively determine the level of total coliforms and e coli a 0 85 sodium chloride solution normal saline solution was used for dilution of bacteria to enumerate the cells each sample was serially diluted by applying 1 ml 99 ml of solution making a 10 2 dilution of the original sample up to 10 6 of subsequent serial dilutions were applied as needed in order to estimate a detectable concentration of the bacteria zhang et al 2017b youssef et al 2016 a packet of colilert reagent was added to the diluted samples and well mixed the entire content of each sample was poured into a quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories westbrook me sealed and was then ready for incubation the trays were incubated for 24 4 h at 35 c 0 5 c after incubation the results were examined by observing and counting the wells yellow color for total coliforms and fluorescence emission under ultraviolet light for e coli the most probable number mpn of total coliforms and e coli was determined according to the manufacturer s instructions and was based on the statistical poisson distribution of positive and negative wells 2 3 digital image analysis 2 3 1 pre treatment and correction the camera used in this study has a pixel resolution of 1920 1080 and acquires image of wavelength from 380 to 780 nm in the visible range the software used for pre processing is spectra sens and unscrambled the raw image data was imported for black and white correction the noise was reduced by the principle of smoothing modulus angle separated wavelet analysis gupta et al 2014 stokes et al 1996 the median filtering based on the multifractal spectrum sorting statistics was used to reduce the interference caused by image noise because it is a non linear signal processing method that has a better effect to reduce the noise of spectral data the original baseline translation domain block was established based on the multifractal spectrum for spectral analysis envi 5 3 harris geospatial solution was used in this study region of interest roi module function in envi 5 3 was used to select a specific roi in the image where the image information will be obtained the 15 mm quartz petri dish was used as a sample container when acquire the water image the water depth was kept at 2 4 cm which was deep enough to prevent the reflection from the bottom of the container fig 1 a and b for selecting the roi regions with potential interference such as light reflection diffraction or shadow from the container were avoided mur artal and tardós 2017 raja et al 2015 in addition the rois were selected in a random and representative manner after selection we conducted color correction on the rois fig 1 c in order to reduce the effect of ambient light on the acquired image roi analysis was performed on samples placed before black and white background for each acquisition the black or white background was used as the reference for extreme values to correct the color of the water sample 2 3 2 image mathematical model the rgb true color of sample images was analyzed using the matlab and envi software collected images were in typical 24 bit 8 bit per r g and bchannel encoded format each channel used a count range between 0 and 255 to represent increasing bright shades of red green and blue ranging from completely black and to completely white the rgb true color model is a standard industrial method that produces rich and extensive colors through different levels of superposition font et al 2014 piva et al 1999 the numerical values of rgb standard colors r s g s b s were calculated from the original rgb values r 8 b i t g 8 b i t b 8 b i t of the raw image by the following equations stokes et al 1996 funamizu et al 2016 1 r s r 8 b i t 255 r b 255 g s g 8 b i t 255 g b 255 b s b 8 b i t 255 b b 255 to calculate the rgb standard values r s g s b s of the color space we have for r s g s b s 0 03928 r s r s 12 92 g s g s 12 92 and b s b s 12 92 for r s g s b s 0 03928 2 r s r s 0

foundation beaverton or usa firstly the data set 89 observations was randomly split into a training set containing 75 of all observations and a test set containing the rest 25 the predictors were raw 5 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h frequency at spectrum respectively while the target was the reflectivity of rgb channel to eliminate the measurement unit the predictors were normalized by mean and standard deviation before fitting in regression in this paper three methods were mainly used to compare model performance lr ordinary least square sgd linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with stochastic gradient descent and ridge regression the model evaluation metrics was mean squared error mse in ordinary least square the total loss function can be defined as gunda et al 2019 3 l o l s β i 1 m y i x i β 2 y x β 2 where m is the number of samples and y i denotes the true value of the i th training sample according to eq 3 in order to avoid the over fitting caused by the complexity of the training model we add the optimization item in the loss function so that the weight coefficient of some features can become smaller and the influence of the features of the higher order index can be eliminated so we can improve eq 3 4 l r i d g e β i 1 m y i x i β 2 λ j 1 n β j 2 y x β 2 λ β 2 where m is the number of samples n is the feature number yi is the true value of the i th training sample and β j is the predicted coefficient for feature j 3 results and discussion 3 1 rgb channel analysis water quality can be affected by different factors from various contaminant sources the sample images on three rgb channels were analyzed using data within the selected roi the selection and channel separation process was shown in fig 2 the r channel showed significant difference in intensity to the naked eye after 1 min of centrifugation the changes of image for 3 and 10 min centrifuged samples were less obvious to the naked eye but there are significant differences that can be detected by image analysis thus it is the most suitable for the image analysis of pond water if there is potential change in the water quality nevertheless the exact mechanism regarding which substances affect the reflectance of the spectrum during centrifugation is not clear fig 3 shows the result of frequency analysis pond water samples which were processed with four centrifuge times 0 1 3 and 10 min three different colors represent frequencies of rgb channels between 0 and 255 of color threshold the result demonstrated that data value x axis for r g and b channel of centrifuged water sample has obvious difference compared to those of raw pond water fig 3 which corresponds to the results of channel separation fig 2 the increase in centrifugation time was equivalent to reducing the chemical elements in the sample that affect the light transmittance therefore the highest spectral intensity of the r band of each sample groups reached to 9893 2512 11809 and 10605 when centrifugation was applied for 0 1 3 and 10 min respectively the frequency values for other channels were also decreased when 1 min of centrifugation was applied and the frequencies for g and b channel were 2579 and 2816 respectively after 3 and 10 min of centrifugation fig 3 c and d the sedimentation of the water sample has too little difference to be noticed by the naked eye from their images but it can be distinguished using data analysis their data value distribution interval of b channel on the abscissa were significantly different the data source shown in fig 3 c has a small span in the x axis direction while the span in fig 3 d is larger the magnitude relationship of the three rgb channels of fig 3 b and c in the order of frequency is b f g f r f but fig 3 d clearly shows a change of this relationship which become g f b f r f furthermore four different samples are separately analyzed for r channel fig 4 the frequency peak changed from large to small and then changed smoothly the f1 represents the reflectance peak of untreated lagoon water samples similarly f2 represents one minute sample reflectance peak f3 and f4 are 3 min and 10 min of sample reflectance peak centrifugation could produce different characteristics in chemical composition resulted in different image pattern according to the centrifugation treatment time of these lagoon water samples wastewater with different degrees of quality parameters can be well simulated each water sample showed different principle and characteristics in the spectral data analysis of the three channels of rgb the sample of polluted water changed significantly in the r color channel therefore we could find a certain mathematical relationship between image values and concentrations of some indicators of contaminants in the water 3 2 spectral analysis with main chemical indicators to further investigate the relationship between animal waste water quality and its spectral data we measured the distribution of values of three rgb bands in the sample roi fig 5 and the concentrations of pollution indicators of the lagoon water for five treatment groups centrifuge time of 0 5 30 60 and 120 min comparing the distribution of the three bands the longer the wavelength the more dispersed the distribution becomes it suggests that shorter wavelength light has less interaction with the body of lagoon water before it is reflected the distribution of r channel data of 5 treatment group bands were more dispersed than other channels the highest and lowest frequency were 30000 and 15000 respectively which means that the light could be interfering with contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids and bacteria activities etc as discussed in fig 3 r channel was the most favorable channel for analyzing the change of contaminants level for water sample the frequency of 30 min centrifuged group was significantly lower than that of 5 min centrifuged group fig 5 because the lowered contaminants concentration affected the reflection performance of the electromagnetic wave the highest frequency was also shown in 5 min group for g bands there were no significant differences between 1 h and 2 h centrifuged groups and both group showed peak frequencies at data value of 45 it may be because 1 h of centrifuge was the maximum separation capacity in the experimental condition in contrast to the r and g channels b channel showed a different frequency pattern fig 5 the sample frequency of raw sample was still the lowest in b bands but peak frequencies of all experimental group in b bands were concentrated in similar data value although data value of raw and 30 min centrifuged group were separated apart compared to the other groups the overall dispersion of data value of each group in b bands was narrower than other bands as show in table 1 most of components decreased significantly when centrifuge was applied up to 30 min among 15 kinds of different water quality indicators four components n p ts and total coliform were selected as indicators in this study and they showed a specific relationship with a spectral data from image analysis fig 6 shows a diagram of intercept dependency on rgb bands for all sample groups between band number of 1 and 2 the roi means decreased with band number in the same order i e 30 min sample has the lowest value and 2 h one has the highest value at higher band number the reflectivity of 30 min sample was still the lowest but the order of the other samples changed at the highest band number 3 in the study the untreated sample had the highest roi means value it can be concluded that the sample treated with 30 min of centrifuge had the lowest roi average value in all three channels the indicator analysis result described in table 1 represents that k ca and conductivity had the lowest levels in 30 min group which correspond to the roi means fig 6 3 3 model preprocessing analysis to improve model stability and reduce multicollinearity between water quality indicators model variables were standardized and then centered and skewed to the range from 1 to 10 the relationship between normalized vectors of spectra and nitrogen phosphorus total solids and total coliform are shown in fig 7 large changes of these water quality indicators were captured by the 4 to 5 interval in the r channel considering the information from fig 8 fig 9 and table 1 the concentration of p and image spectra showed the lowest correlation in all rgb channels among the four indicators because in the rgb image display mode different channels actually store components on different colors the actual concentrations of each indicator were fitted with each of reflectance value when comparing the image spectral data of rgb channel with the concentrations of four indicators mathematical correlation between these two numerical values could be found in particular b channel of n and total coliform and g channel of total solids showed the strongest links and there were reasonable correlations in other channels for example n concentration and b channel spectral value has a linear relation of r 2 0 968 for r and g channels we could achieve r 2 values of 0 908 and 0 914 respectively overall total solids concentration had the highest r 2 average values 0 941 among the four water quality indicators in addition the r 2 equals to 0 657 in the b channel indicating that b channel is insufficient to estimate the p concentration of lagoon water the relationship between total coliform concentration and image spectral data value showed similar correlation to n level in the water r 2 values includes 0 901 0 9142 and 0 957 in the r g and b channels respectively and trend line equations with greater than 0 9 of r 2 value were derived for all three channels the r 2 value of bacterial concentration and spectral data trend line was the highest in the b channel unlike other indicators total solids showed the lowest r 2 value in the b channel the r 2 values in the trend line between the rgb channels and the actual concentration were 0 960 0 998 and 0 865 respectively indicating that there was the highest correlation in the g channel these results show that image has a potential in water quality monitoring for example satellite images from web portal sites such as google are able to provide approximate water quality information for lagoon water in addition the image analysis allows us to understand the effects of hydrologic events or other changes on lagoon water quality very easily this would bring tremendous economic benefits and savings of time and labor 3 4 estimator performance evaluation the performance of the three models on test data is shown in fig 10 the training target represents the spectral intensity value according to the division rule of the spectrum rgb can be divided into three different intervals we found that the three estimators are similar in evaluation metric the training results were relatively close to the values of the test set in reflectivity when the training target was between 9 and 11 the test dataset and the prediction dataset had a large deviation the most accurate range of predicted value was between 7 5 and 8 5 and between 13 and 16 to sum up this part after the 14 spectral intensity value the prediction accuracy was closest to the test value and this band from 14 to 22 5 belongs to the b channel next we calculated the mse of the three evaluators see table 2 the five values of the weight coefficient represent the weight of the raw data of sample 5 min 30 min 1 h and 2 h of centrifugation after adjusting the values of random state rs the samples treated with 30 min of centrifugation were the most weighted in the whole model where the maximum value was 11 35 in the sgd model and the minimum value was 10 07 in the ridge model the wastewater treated with 1 and 2 h of centrifugation did not show significant change the weight coefficient of 1 h s took the minimum value of 0 98 in the sgd model and the 2 h s sample also achieved the minimum value of 1 83 in the sgd model the peak rate of absorption was about 30 min after centrifugation in summary the ridge based estimator achieved the optimal mse of 405 513 505 322 and 570 532 a small perturbation is added to the least square estimation which makes the unsolvable generalized inverse solvable and makes the data stable in this paper the ridge regression partial least squares rr pls was used for the correction for the best model ridge estimator we calculated the mathematical relationship between the four main water quality parameters and the spectral reflectance the sample predictor matrix x was a b channel digital matrix and its eigenvector was main pollution index coefficient of wastewater mattikalli 1997 zhang et al 2017a as shown in fig 11 the fitting degree of total coliform and total solids were relatively reasonable the experiments consisted of five treatments of centrifugation times where the point sets were partially concentrated to make sure the model is generally representative the point set of fig 11 a and fig 11 b were relatively dispersed the value of b channel data was negatively correlated with the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus it showed that in the ridge and b channel models the determination coefficient of e coli prediction set was r 2 0 987 root mean square error was rmsep 0 47 and rms error of correction set was rmsec 0 39 the r 2 of nitrogen contents prediction set was 0 993 rms of error prediction set was rmsep 0 28 and correction set rms error was rmsec 0 13 the r 2 of phosphorus contents prediction set was 0 927 the rms error of prediction set was rmsep 0 32 and the correction set rms error was rmsec 0 18 the total solids prediction model for soluble solids of wastewater samples also had good predictive performance with r 2 0 992 the results show that the b channel data can be used to estimate the n p total coliform and total solids levels of lagoon wastewater table 3 shows the r 2 of algorithm lr sgd and ridge of the rgb channels as shown in table 3 among the three models the correctness rate of the discriminant model established by the selection method of lr and ridge feature band were high the accuracy of ridge discriminant model was the highest 99 9 and highest accuracy of lr and discriminant models was 96 3 the lr algorithm based on linear regression analysis takes the spectral matrix as an independent variable and the sample physicochemical value as a dependent variable to establish the prediction model then select the wavelength or band and use the gray level co occurrence matrix to cross validate all sample as a ridge modeling method ridge integrates nonlinear factors in the modeling process in general mathematical model of ridge combined with image information of lagoon wastewater is effective and the comprehensive evaluation of the ridge discriminant model takes the best performance 4 conclusions this study proposes a new lab free wastewater monitoring method as cafo water measurement and monitoring supplement the method combines spectral processing techniques with machine learning methods to analyze the change of water quality from reflectivity of water samples the image analysis procedure described in this study establishes a quantitative correlation between image information and numerical water quality data which could be feasible for water quality monitoring to sum up the conclusions of this study are mainly divided into the following four points 1 centrifugation was applied to simulate the change of wastewater quality associated with this process there were significant changes of the wastewater spectral reflectance shown in the processed rgb channel data this provides a data reference for image based measurement of wastewater 2 the lagoon water samples display distinct characteristics with rgb channel separation those features can help to quantitatively estimate the changes of certain water quality indicators this study have found considerable linear fits between the b channel spectral reflectance and the levels of total nitrogen total phosphorus total solids and total coliform 3 this study focused on the mathematical modeling between total solids and total coliform and wastewater spectral reflectance values among all water quality indicators these two showed relatively higher mathematical relationships with the b channel data for total solids the prediction set mse was 0 57 and its decision coefficient r 2 was 0 98 for total coliform the prediction set mse was 0 63 and its decision coefficient r 2 was 0 96 4 in the visible spectral range true color image analysis could detect significant changes of key water quality indicators of lagoon water different types of water quality information were revealed by different color channels the features of reflectivity in one color channel can provide a relatively accurate prediction on the change of corresponding water quality parameters this study is a first and essential step for an image based cafo wastewater analysis technology which enables the lab free estimation of lagoon water and rural ponds this will lay the foundation for as an image based technology capable of lab free testing of animal farm lagoons and rural ponds the method proposed in this paper seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of the image based strategy for lagoon water monitoring this method still has some limitations the estimators of the method can only be applied to a limited number of lagoon effluent pollution indicators components affecting reflectivity outside the visible range such as heavy metals cannot be analyzed using this method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18143,drinking water purification and distribution processes shape the bacterial community in tap water however this study calls attention to the impact of source water on tap water bacterial community herein paired source and tap water samples were collected from 46 drinking water supply systems in different watersheds across china and high throughput sequencing delineated that bacterial richness and diversity decreased and biogeographical distribution pattern weakened in tap water compared to source water despite the great changes of bacteria from source to tap bayesian based sourcetracker analysis still verified that the proportional contributions of source water to shaping the tap water bacterial community ranged from 0 to 92 8 49 73 30 22 on average this indelible contribution was further confirmed by the mantel test p 0 001 procrustes test p 0 001 and variance partition analysis which showed that the source water together with geographical location explained 40 11 of tap water bacterial community variation to explore the potential reasons that explain the great differences in the impact of source water among different samples the universal shift pattern of bacterial communities from source to tap was summarized as a classification of dominant bacterial taxa sensitive taxa versus resistant taxa the taxa including planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria could act as biomarkers to distinguish samples between source and tap water and were classified as sensitive taxa in contrast α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were classified as resistant taxa the abundance of sensitive taxa was negatively correlated with the sourcetracker proportion while the abundance of resistant taxa was positively correlated with the sourcetracker proportion p 0 01 thus variation in source water bacterial community could be responsible for the degree of impact on tap water our findings give notice that the impact of source water microbiomes must be taken more seriously and sufficient source water protection and engineering control strategies should be implemented to prevent the biological consequences of source water on tap water graphical abstract image 1 keywords tap water source water bacterial community geographical distribution sourcetracker 1 introduction the availability of biologically safe drinking water is a major public health concern which relies on adequate source water protection effective water treatment and proper distribution system maintenance rosarioortiz et al 2016 until now except for few european countries e g the netherlands roeselers et al 2015 most countries require the persistence of residual disinfectant across distribution networks to control microbial waterborne pathogens in the united states the residual chemical disinfectant in distribution systems is viewed as the last barrier against microbial contamination rosarioortiz et al 2016 it is widely accepted that current treatment processes especially strict disinfection approach limit the influence of fluctuations in source water quality on tap water chemical and microbial safety bautista de los santos et al 2016 hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 however the disinfection cannot absolutely eliminate microbes in water chiao et al 2014 thus understanding the microbial dynamics from source to tap and the origins of tap water bacterial communities are imperative for optimizing water biosafety management strategies it has been revealed that the drinking water microbiome could be influenced by different steps including water purification flocculation sedimentation filtration pinto et al 2012 disinfection hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 distribution el chakhtoura et al 2015 potgieter et al 2018 stagnation ling et al 2018 and secondary water supply li et al 2018 although each treatment step brings samples into closer similarity with tap water disinfection has been widely accepted to be the substantial contributing factor driving bacterial community shift during treatment processes chiao et al 2014 hull et al 2017 the origins of bacteria in tap water might include the filter microbial community pinto et al 2012 loose deposits pipeline biofilms liu et al 2018 and potential contaminant during treatment and distribution processes therefore it has been commonly believed that source water s influence on tap water bacterial communities was substantially eliminated by drinking water treatment operations while several studies speculated that source water might seed the tap water microbiome on the basis of the results that source water and tap water shared a similar dominant bacterial assemblage including proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes hull et al 2017 pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira et al 2013 however whether the source water is an important contributor to the tap water bacterial community and how the source water impacts the tap water bacterial community are still contentious issues currently comprehensive insight into the drinking water microbiome from source to tap has mainly been summarized by full scale spatio temporal investigation of a single drinking water supply system hull et al 2017 perrin et al 2018 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 which was conducted in a limited space with the same source water obviously it will be difficult to explore the impact of bacterial community differences among different source water samples on the tap water bacterial community through such sampling strategy to fill this gap paired samples of source and tap water from individual drinking water supply systems at large geographic scale which could contain extremely diverse source and tap water bacterial communities are useful in the discovery of a more universal change pattern for the bacterial community from source to tap and are needed to explore the contribution of source water to the corresponding tap water bacterial community the rapid development of culture independent high throughput sequencing and the microbial source tracking method have made it possible to assess the origin of bacteria in tap water compared to historical signature based microbial source tracking mst methods korajkic et al 2015 bayesian based sourcetracker has opened a new avenue for mst investigations without a source specific single marker knights et al 2011 lax et al 2014 and has been widely used henry et al 2016 liu et al 2018 mccarthy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b in this study 46 paired samples of source water and tap water spanning 29 main cities across central and eastern china were collected and water physicochemical properties and bacterial communities were characterized the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the geographical distribution pattern and dominant taxa of source water and tap water bacterial communities 2 to identify the proportional contribution of source water to tap water bacterial community by sourcetracker method and 3 to distinguish the treatment resistant bacterial populations in source water and link them to the impact of source water on tap water bacterial community our study sheds light on the generality of drinking water bacterial communities alterations of the communities from source to tap and mechanisms for understanding source water seeding of the tap water bacterial community we have tried to call attention to the indelible contribution of source water microbes to tap water microbes 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 46 source water samples including 23 lake water 18 river water and 5 groundwater

microbiology and plant biology university of oklahoma norman oklahoma usa the sequencing data have been deposited with links to bioproject accession number prjna551910 for tap water and prjna563354 for source water in the ncbi bioproject database 2 4 sequence processing raw sequencing data were preprocessed and analyzed by an in house galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 the sequences were quality trimmed using btrim kong 2011 with an average quality score 30 paired end reads were merged to full length sequencing using flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 the sequences were clustered by uparse edgar 2013 to form operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity cut off and the singleton otus were removed taxonomic assignment was carried out with the ribosomal database project rdp classifier shared and unique otus between source and tap water samples were shown in venn diagrams the community difference between source water and tap water was calculated as the bray curtis dissimilarity and was further visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa by the vegan package dixon 2003 with r 2 5 statistical analysis mantel test canonical correspondence analysis cca variation partition analysis vpa heatmap dissimilarity analyses procrustes test and structural equation model sem were detailed in supplementary information permanova which is a method for non parametric multivariate analysis of variance and has been widely used for dissimilarity analysis of multiple factors as well as univariate cases was conducted for the permutation analysis as its robustness anderson 2001 the bayesian based sourcetracker method was performed to quantify the extent of contribution of potential source to the sink knights et al 2011 recently it succeeded in identifying the source of the microbial community in urban estuaries mccarthy et al 2017 lake water brown et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b and coastal water henry et al 2016 in the present study tap water bacteria were defined as sink and the corresponding source water bacteria were defined as potential source sourcetracker analysis was performed using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 which has been demonstrated to provide high sensitivity specificity precision and accuracy in general henry et al 2016 such calculation was performed three times for each set of paired samples and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 random forest a machine learning based method is an ensemble of unpruned regression or classification trees created using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction breiman 2001 the importance of each predictor was determined by assessing the mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdgini when the data for the predictor was randomly permuted which is a robust method to select variables han et al 2016 wang et al 2016 recently random forest classification was used to identify the biomarker taxa in root microbiota between two subspecies of rice indica and japonica and 18 taxa can be used as biomarkers to differentiate indica and japonica zhang et al 2019a here similar to zhang et al 2019a random forest was used to quantitatively evaluate the important predictors i e biomarkers to distinguish source water and tap water of dominant bacterial groups these analyses were conducted using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in r a bacterial group with significant mda and mdgini p 0 05 assessed by the rfpermute package archer 2013 indicated its substantial and universal difference in relative abundance between source water and tap water and thus was defined as sensitive taxa during the drinking water treatment and distribution process in contrast bacterial groups with insignificant mda or mdgini p 0 05 were defined as resistant taxa 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition diversity and geographical distribution overall 10 204 otus and 2342 otus were obtained in a total of 46 source water samples and corresponding 46 tap water samples respectively the most abundant otus top 10 in tap water were classified as proteobacteria including α β and γ proteobacteria and they were also dominant in source water table s5 there were 20 genera with relative abundance 1 and 19 of them were classified as α β and γ proteobacteria table s6 there were 12 bacterial groups at phylum level except for α β γ and δ proteobacteria with relative abundance 1 in source water however α β and γ proteobacteria became more dominant in tap water average relative abundance 93 in total fig 1c right tables s3 and s4 compared to source water the relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria increased 66 98 and 146 88 in tap water respectively while the relative abundance of other 10 bacterial groups decreased fig 1c right the α and β diversity together with their geographical distribution were also different between source and tap water shannon index simpson index and phylotypes number decreased significantly p 0 001 in the tap water bacterial community 4 79 1 19 0 95 0 07 and 1158 691 respectively compared to source water bacterial community 2 38 0 72 0 76 0 14 and 185 123 respectively the β diversity changed from source to tap illustrated by pcoa plot with test of significance r 0 57 p 0 001 anosim fig 1b the shannon index and phylotypes number were significantly correlated with latitude in source water p 0 05 while not correlated with latitude in tap water p 0 05 fig s2 although the correlation between geographical distance km and bacterial community similarity based on bray curtis distance was significant r 0 074 p 0 018 in tap water such distance decay relationship was clearly stronger in source water r 0 210 p 0 001 fig 2 the correlation between temperature and bacterial community followed similar trend with the distance decay relationship mantel test revealed that the correlation between temperature and source water bacterial community was significant pearson s r 0 244 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 271 p 0 001 while the correlation between temperature and tap water bacterial community was weak pearson s r 0 041 p 0 255 spearman s r 0 088 p 0 092 3 2 evidence of source water seeding of tap water bacteria bayesian based sourcetracker method was used to calculate the extent of contribution of source water bacteria to tap water bacteria and the results showed the proportion of tap water bacteria that came from corresponding source water the sourcetracker proportions ranged from 0 to 92 8 with an average of 49 73 30 22 average standard deviation table s8 in addition more evidence also indicated the effect of source water on tap water significant correlation of bacterial communities between source water and tap water was confirmed by the mantel test pearson s r 0 256 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 285 p 0 001 table 1 and procrustes test sum of squares m2 0 7761 r 0 4731 p 0 0001 9999 permutations fig 3 c a total of 1966 otus of overall tap water samples were detected in overall source water samples which occupied 82 93 of overall tap water otus fig 3a on average 48 24 otus in tap water were detected in the corresponding source water sample fig 3b otus with top 10 relative abundance were all classified into proteobacteria and they also dominated in source water 13 58 in total table s5 interestingly the bacterial community compositions and structures among three source water types river lake and underground were distinct p 0 05 by permanova and such differences still appeared in tap water p 0 05 between groundwater and river between groundwater and lake fig s3 table s7 indicating that the treatment and distribution process could not eliminate the variation between sample types 3 3 classification of dominant bacterial taxa in source water into sensitive taxa and resistant taxa to further identify which dominant bacterial groups average relative abundance 1 in source water or tap water at the phylum level other than proteobacteria fig 1c right changed significantly between source and tap water these dominant bacterial groups were used to distinguish sampling types source water or tap water by random forest modeling fig 1c left a bacterial group with significant mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdgini values indicated that it was an important predictor in distinguishing sampling types which was viewed as a biomarker for source water and tap water here these biomarkers were classified as sensitive taxa because of their difference in source and tap water while other bacterial groups were classified as resistant taxa sensitive taxa in source water including planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria almost disappeared in tap water samples 10 72 and 0 44 in source water and tap water respectively while resistant taxa in source water including α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria showed tolerance to the treatment processes in plants and the distribution processes in pipelines and immigrated successfully to consumers 84 99 and 98 09 in source water and tap water respectively fig 1c 3 4 relationship between sourcetracker proportion and source water bacterial composition to explore the relationship between the impact of a source water sample on the corresponding tap water sample and the community structure of the source water sample pearson correlation between sourcetracker proportion and relative abundance of dominant bacterial groups was conducted the sum of sensitive taxa abundance negatively correlated with sourcetracker proportion r 0 382 p 0 009 while the sum of resistant taxa abundance positively correlated with sourcetracker proportion r 0 423 p 0 003 table 2 some specific bacterial groups including δ proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteria and γ proteobacteria also followed a similar trend table 2 concretely heatmap visualization of 143 otus of sensitive taxa average relative abundance of otus 0 01 in source water divided all samples into four clusters fig 4 a and the sourcetracker proportion sensitive taxa abundance and resistant taxa abundance of the four clusters were compared samples of cluster 1 contained more sensitive taxa and less resistant taxa than others and the sourcetracker proportion of cluster 1 was also smaller than others fig 4b to d high similarity between source water and its corresponding tap water bacterial community also indicated a strong contribution of source water to tap water bacterial community thus bray curtis similarity 1 dissimilarity between source water and the corresponding tap water was calculated and pearson correlation between the bray curtis similarity and relative abundance of dominant bacterial groups was conducted the sum of sensitive taxa abundance negatively correlated with bray curtis similarity r 0 436 p 0 002 while the sum of resistant taxa abundance positively correlated with bray curtis similarity r 0 464 p 0 001 table 2 some specific bacterial groups including δ proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteria and planctomycetes also followed a similar trend p 0 05 table 2 3 5 multivariate statistical analyses between tap water bacterial community and potential influencing factors the mantel test variation partition analysis vpa and structural equation model sem were performed to explore the quantitative correlation between tap water bacterial community and its potential driving factors mantel tests showed that the source water bacterial community was the most important factor shaping the tap water bacterial community pearson s r 0 256 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 285 p 0 001 followed by geographical distribution pearson s r 0 074 p 0 096 spearman s r 0 114 p 0 021 chemical

the variation of tap water bacterial communities was explained by selected variables fig 5 a source related variables source water bacterial community and geographical distribution contributed 37 84 alone and 2 27 together with other variables to the total variation in tap water bacterial communities while chemical properties and residual chlorine concentration only explained 16 53 and 1 94 of the total variation respectively fig 5a the sem quantified the indirect and direct effects of multiple factors on the bacterial community of tap water in accordance with the mantel test and vpa results the source water bacterial community was the key driver λ 0 605 p 0 001 shaping the tap water bacterial community according to sem fig 5b interestingly latitude was not directly correlated to the tap water bacterial community λ 0 273 p 0 05 but it exerted an indirect influence mainly through shaping the source water bacterial community λ 0 608 p 0 001 fig 5b 4 discussion to answer whether and how source water affects tap water bacteriology the present study represented a large scale investigation on bacteriology between source water and tap water by paired sampling across china we verified the indelible influence of source water on tap water bacterial variation revealed a universal shift pattern of bacterial communities between source water and tap water through a classification of sensitive and resistant taxa and provided unique insights into how the source water bacterial community could seed the tap water bacterial community different source water samples showed different ability to seed tap water and this ability might rely on the relative proportion of sensitive and resistant taxa in source water this study collected large scale samples and showed direct depiction of source water s impact on tap water bacteria which was difficult to reveal by microbial monitoring of single sources and pipelines reported previously 4 1 characteristics of bacterial community shifts from source to tap at the national scale based on paired samples fig 1a table s1 harboring a large diversity of bacterial communities we provided unique insights into the characteristics of the bacterial alteration patterns between source water and tap water such shifts were characterized at the otu table s5 genus table s6 phylum class levels fig 1c α diversity fig s1 β diversity fig 1b and geographical distribution figs 2 and s2 perspectives as expected the bacterial richness and diversity were lower in tap water than source water samples fig s1 which was in line with previous investigations hull et al 2017 roeselers et al 2015 consistent with previous studies holinger et al 2014 hull et al 2017 vaz moreira et al 2013 proteobacteria and particularly the two classes α and β proteobacteria became dominant in tap water and α and β proteobacteria were the only two bacterial groups whose relative abundance increased in tap water compared to source water fig 1c proteobacteria most were classified as α β and γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria dominated with 98 of the overall tap water bacterial community according to a large geographical area investigation in the u s a including 17 different drinking water distribution systems with chlorine disinfection holinger et al 2014 similarly our study also proposed that α β γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were classified as the resistant taxa by random forest model on the contrary planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria were essential targets for distinguishing source water or tap water and thus were regarded as sensitive taxa fig 1c compared to previous investigations on bacterial community shifts between source water and tap water based on a single plant or single distribution system hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 roeselers et al 2015 this study contained a large number of samples with various bacterial compositions and paired samples of source and tap thus the classification of resistant and sensitive taxa in this study avoided the possible influence of accident or stochasticity to a certain extent 4 2 variation of source water bacterial communities was responsible for the impact of source water on tap water bacterial communities although treatment processes especially chlorine disinfection limited the influence of source water on tap water bacterial communities the source water bacteria were still the seed for tap water bacteria the sourcetracker proportion of source water was obtained to represent the impact of source water on chlorinated tap water bacteria by the bayesian based sourcetracker method sourcetracker proportion was positively correlated with resistant taxa abundance and negatively correlated with sensitive taxa abundance table 2 and such significant correlation hinted that the source water bacterial community structure especially the relative proportion of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa determined the source water s ability to affect tap water further the chemical parameters of source water might also make contribution to the difference of sourcetracker proportion between samples because of their influence on source water bacterial community source water samples with more resistant taxa showed greater contribution to the tap water bacterial community and vice versa to our knowledge this might be the first demonstration of high correlation between source water bacterial community structure and its potential impact on the tap water bacterial community deepening the understanding of the biological relationship between source water and tap water the impact of source water was mainly contributed by resistant taxa fig s4 and the causes of resistant taxa might be complex on the one hand chlorination could kill bacteria by destroying the cell wall and the difference in chlorine sensitivity among different bacterial populations in source water might be the main reason for bacterial shifts during the treatment process chiao et al 2014 numerous studies have noted the chlorine resistant feature of the above mentioned resistant taxa some genera within proteobacteria phylum including pseudomonas acidovorax pleomonas sphingomonas and undibacterium seemed to greatly increase after chlorination jia et al 2015 γ proteobacteria and actinobacteria were abundant in both source water and treated water disinfected by sodium hypochlorite followed by anhydrous ammonia to produce chloramine hull et al 2017 firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria also occurred ubiquitously in chlorinated drinking water holinger et al 2014 on the other hand some members of bacterial community might gain a competitive edge and undergo greater regrowth during distribution ling et al 2018 nescerecka et al 2018 which is another cause of resistant taxa bacteroidetes exhibited regrowth in the transportation pipeline after chlorine consumption jia et al 2015 and β proteobacteria also showed a significant increase in relative abundance during passage through distribution systems potgieter et al 2018 in fact the underlying causes of biological instability might be higher temperatures lower chlorine residuals and less nutrient carbon phosphorus nitrogen iron limitation thus the differences in limiting nutrients in different source waters also contributed to biological instability in the networks nescerecka et al 2018 numerous studies have explored the dynamics of specific bacterial groups during drinking water treatment and distribution processes and these results are summarized in table 3 which effectively support the classification of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa in this study within resistant taxa consistent with previous results some opportunistic pathogens at genus level including acinetobacter spp 11 05 in source water 7 18 in tap water hou et al 2018 jumat et al 2018 lin et al 2014 vaz moreira et al 2013 burkholderia spp 0 02 in source water 1 12 in tap water cheng et al 2003 khan et al 2016 and pseudomonas spp 2 85 in source water 7 77 in tap water hwang et al 2012 jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 showed tolerance to chlorine disinfection table s6 and appeared in the tap water microbiome it should be noted that more molecular detections at the species level or on virulence genes need to be done for comprehensive depiction of opportunistic pathogens dynamics within the drinking water supply system li et al 2018 4 3 multiple drivers of tap water bacterial community variation mantel test table 1 vpa fig 5a sem fig 5b and distance decay relationship calculation figs 2 and s2 indicated that geographical distribution was also a potential influencing factor on the tap water bacterial community biogeographical patterns of microbes is a common phenomenon in natural ecosystems e g soils lakes delgado baquerizo et al 2018 liu et al 2015 and was also found in four drinking water plants in northern netherlands roeselers et al 2015 and along a 150 km drinking water distribution pipeline in south africa potgieter et al 2018 in the present study weak but significant biogeographical patterns of bacteria in tap water were found at the national scale which indicated that the treatment and distribution processes mitigated the heterogeneity of water microbiomes but could not eliminate the influence of natural climate conditions the biogeographical patterns of drinking water microbe indicated different region might need different strategies for treatment and distribution for instance the higher bacterial richness and diversity in southern areas than northern areas in china fig s2 highlighted that drinking water plants in southern areas had to pay more attention to ensure the effective disinfection step and monitor the biosafety of tap water it should be noted that the distance decay was complex in single drinking water system due to the different network configurations pinto et al 2014 thus the distance decay among different systems at large scale might be more complex we recommend that further effects on disentangling distance decay of drinking water microbiome need careful experimental design to control difference of engineering construction chlorination is accepted as an effective procedure to change the bacterial community during the treatment process chiao et al 2014 hull et al 2017 however residual chlorine concentration is a parameter that is tightly monitored and controlled throughout drinking water distribution systems to reach the same desired concentration perrin et al 2018 and it might not be a significant driver within bacterial communities among tap water samples who had finished the disinfection step in accordance mantel test vpa and sem results all led to the conclusion that the residual chlorine concentration was not significantly correlated to tap water bacterial community similarly a spatio temporal study on tap water in paris found that the total chlorine concentration had no significant impact on the most abundant taxa perrin et al 2018 in the present study several limitations may exist first except for the source water the filter material used in drinking water treatment plants pinto et al 2012 biofilms and loose deposits in distribution systems liu et al 2017 2018 rozej et al 2015 are also sources of tap water microbiomes which should be paid more attention in overall assessment of the origins of tap water microbiome second limited environmental variables especially limited chemical parameters which potentially contributed to biological instability in drinking water ling et al 2018 perrin et al 2018 prest et al 2016 were considered in our study thus the overall variation of tap water bacteria might be the result of the combined effects of source water treatment process distribution system and environmental conditions 4 4 practical implications for drinking water bacteria management our study revealed the impact of source water on the tap water bacterial community even though purification and disinfection steps were carried out it is also indicated that resistant taxa could migrate from source water to residential users if the source water is polluted by treatment resistant opportunistic pathogens the consumers especially the young and the old might be exposed to potential risk of waterborne disease outbreaks thus it is of vital importance to pay more attention to the source water protection from biological pollution i e fecal matter and hospital wastewater and in situ engineering control strategies i e river bank filtration and constructed wetland on the other hand previous researchers have proposed that tap water bacteria could be regulated and controlled by proper purification process pinto et al 2012 found that the filter served as an operational barrier for postfiltration water to exclude harmful bacteria from source water it was possible to populate desired innocuous bacteria in tap water by altering the water quality parameters and process operation parameters which were correlated to leaky colonizers in the filter pinto et al 2012 during the distribution process ecological interactions provide possible approaches using probiotic control in order to reduce the colonization and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens wang et al 2013 the joint efforts of source water protection and engineering intervention optimization might lead to optimal drinking water bacteria management hull et al 2019 5 conclusion compared to source water α β and γ proteobacteria became dominant and bacterial diversity decreased significantly in tap water distance decay relationship was weak but significant in tap water bacterial communities an average of 49 73 30 22 bacteria in tap water might come from its source water at the national scale on the basis of the sourcetracker method a universal change pattern of the bacterial community between source and tap water was explored and dominant bacterial groups in source water could be divided into sensitive taxa and resistant taxa the relative proportion of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa in source water was responsible for a source water s ability to affect tap water the potentially adverse impact of source water on tap water bacterial communities deserves more attention and the tap water bacterial community could possibly be managed by adequate source protection and precise process optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18143,drinking water purification and distribution processes shape the bacterial community in tap water however this study calls attention to the impact of source water on tap water bacterial community herein paired source and tap water samples were collected from 46 drinking water supply systems in different watersheds across china and high throughput sequencing delineated that bacterial richness and diversity decreased and biogeographical distribution pattern weakened in tap water compared to source water despite the great changes of bacteria from source to tap bayesian based sourcetracker analysis still verified that the proportional contributions of source water to shaping the tap water bacterial community ranged from 0 to 92 8 49 73 30 22 on average this indelible contribution was further confirmed by the mantel test p 0 001 procrustes test p 0 001 and variance partition analysis which showed that the source water together with geographical location explained 40 11 of tap water bacterial community variation to explore the potential reasons that explain the great differences in the impact of source water among different samples the universal shift pattern of bacterial communities from source to tap was summarized as a classification of dominant bacterial taxa sensitive taxa versus resistant taxa the taxa including planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria could act as biomarkers to distinguish samples between source and tap water and were classified as sensitive taxa in contrast α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were classified as resistant taxa the abundance of sensitive taxa was negatively correlated with the sourcetracker proportion while the abundance of resistant taxa was positively correlated with the sourcetracker proportion p 0 01 thus variation in source water bacterial community could be responsible for the degree of impact on tap water our findings give notice that the impact of source water microbiomes must be taken more seriously and sufficient source water protection and engineering control strategies should be implemented to prevent the biological consequences of source water on tap water graphical abstract image 1 keywords tap water source water bacterial community geographical distribution sourcetracker 1 introduction the availability of biologically safe drinking water is a major public health concern which relies on adequate source water protection effective water treatment and proper distribution system maintenance rosarioortiz et al 2016 until now except for few european countries e g the netherlands roeselers et al 2015 most countries require the persistence of residual disinfectant across distribution networks to control microbial waterborne pathogens in the united states the residual chemical disinfectant in distribution systems is viewed as the last barrier against microbial contamination rosarioortiz et al 2016 it is widely accepted that current treatment processes especially strict disinfection approach limit the influence of fluctuations in source water quality on tap water chemical and microbial safety bautista de los santos et al 2016 hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 however the disinfection cannot absolutely eliminate microbes in water chiao et al 2014 thus understanding the microbial dynamics from source to tap and the origins of tap water bacterial communities are imperative for optimizing water biosafety management strategies it has been revealed that the drinking water microbiome could be influenced by different steps including water purification flocculation sedimentation filtration pinto et al 2012 disinfection hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 distribution el chakhtoura et al 2015 potgieter et al 2018 stagnation ling et al 2018 and secondary water supply li et al 2018 although each treatment step brings samples into closer similarity with tap water disinfection has been widely accepted to be the substantial contributing factor driving bacterial community shift during treatment processes chiao et al 2014 hull et al 2017 the origins of bacteria in tap water might include the filter microbial community pinto et al 2012 loose deposits pipeline biofilms liu et al 2018 and potential contaminant during treatment and distribution processes therefore it has been commonly believed that source water s influence on tap water bacterial communities was substantially eliminated by drinking water treatment operations while several studies speculated that source water might seed the tap water microbiome on the basis of the results that source water and tap water shared a similar dominant bacterial assemblage including proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes hull et al 2017 pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira et al 2013 however whether the source water is an important contributor to the tap water bacterial community and how the source water impacts the tap water bacterial community are still contentious issues currently comprehensive insight into the drinking water microbiome from source to tap has mainly been summarized by full scale spatio temporal investigation of a single drinking water supply system hull et al 2017 perrin et al 2018 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 which was conducted in a limited space with the same source water obviously it will be difficult to explore the impact of bacterial community differences among different source water samples on the tap water bacterial community through such sampling strategy to fill this gap paired samples of source and tap water from individual drinking water supply systems at large geographic scale which could contain extremely diverse source and tap water bacterial communities are useful in the discovery of a more universal change pattern for the bacterial community from source to tap and are needed to explore the contribution of source water to the corresponding tap water bacterial community the rapid development of culture independent high throughput sequencing and the microbial source tracking method have made it possible to assess the origin of bacteria in tap water compared to historical signature based microbial source tracking mst methods korajkic et al 2015 bayesian based sourcetracker has opened a new avenue for mst investigations without a source specific single marker knights et al 2011 lax et al 2014 and has been widely used henry et al 2016 liu et al 2018 mccarthy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b in this study 46 paired samples of source water and tap water spanning 29 main cities across central and eastern china were collected and water physicochemical properties and bacterial communities were characterized the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the geographical distribution pattern and dominant taxa of source water and tap water bacterial communities 2 to identify the proportional contribution of source water to tap water bacterial community by sourcetracker method and 3 to distinguish the treatment resistant bacterial populations in source water and link them to the impact of source water on tap water bacterial community our study sheds light on the generality of drinking water bacterial communities alterations of the communities from source to tap and mechanisms for understanding source water seeding of the tap water bacterial community we have tried to call attention to the indelible contribution of source water microbes to tap water microbes 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 46 source water samples including 23 lake water 18 river water and 5 groundwater

for source water in the ncbi bioproject database 2 4 sequence processing raw sequencing data were preprocessed and analyzed by an in house galaxy pipeline http mem rcees ac cn 8080 the sequences were quality trimmed using btrim kong 2011 with an average quality score 30 paired end reads were merged to full length sequencing using flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 the sequences were clustered by uparse edgar 2013 to form operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity cut off and the singleton otus were removed taxonomic assignment was carried out with the ribosomal database project rdp classifier shared and unique otus between source and tap water samples were shown in venn diagrams the community difference between source water and tap water was calculated as the bray curtis dissimilarity and was further visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa by the vegan package dixon 2003 with r 2 5 statistical analysis mantel test canonical correspondence analysis cca variation partition analysis vpa heatmap dissimilarity analyses procrustes test and structural equation model sem were detailed in supplementary information permanova which is a method for non parametric multivariate analysis of variance and has been widely used for dissimilarity analysis of multiple factors as well as univariate cases was conducted for the permutation analysis as its robustness anderson 2001 the bayesian based sourcetracker method was performed to quantify the extent of contribution of potential source to the sink knights et al 2011 recently it succeeded in identifying the source of the microbial community in urban estuaries mccarthy et al 2017 lake water brown et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b and coastal water henry et al 2016 in the present study tap water bacteria were defined as sink and the corresponding source water bacteria were defined as potential source sourcetracker analysis was performed using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 which has been demonstrated to provide high sensitivity specificity precision and accuracy in general henry et al 2016 such calculation was performed three times for each set of paired samples and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 random forest a machine learning based method is an ensemble of unpruned regression or classification trees created using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction breiman 2001 the importance of each predictor was determined by assessing the mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdgini when the data for the predictor was randomly permuted which is a robust method to select variables han et al 2016 wang et al 2016 recently random forest classification was used to identify the biomarker taxa in root microbiota between two subspecies of rice indica and japonica and 18 taxa can be used as biomarkers to differentiate indica and japonica zhang et al 2019a here similar to zhang et al 2019a random forest was used to quantitatively evaluate the important predictors i e biomarkers to distinguish source water and tap water of dominant bacterial groups these analyses were conducted using the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 in r a bacterial group with significant mda and mdgini p 0 05 assessed by the rfpermute package archer 2013 indicated its substantial and universal difference in relative abundance between source water and tap water and thus was defined as sensitive taxa during the drinking water treatment and distribution process in contrast bacterial groups with insignificant mda or mdgini p 0 05 were defined as resistant taxa 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition diversity and geographical distribution overall 10 204 otus and 2342 otus were obtained in a total of 46 source water samples and corresponding 46 tap water samples respectively the most abundant otus top 10 in tap water were classified as proteobacteria including α β and γ proteobacteria and they were also dominant in source water table s5 there were 20 genera with relative abundance 1 and 19 of them were classified as α β and γ proteobacteria table s6 there were 12 bacterial groups at phylum level except for α β γ and δ proteobacteria with relative abundance 1 in source water however α β and γ proteobacteria became more dominant in tap water average relative abundance 93 in total fig 1c right tables s3 and s4 compared to source water the relative abundance of α and β proteobacteria increased 66 98 and 146 88 in tap water respectively while the relative abundance of other 10 bacterial groups decreased fig 1c right the α and β diversity together with their geographical distribution were also different between source and tap water shannon index simpson index and phylotypes number decreased significantly p 0 001 in the tap water bacterial community 4 79 1 19 0 95 0 07 and 1158 691 respectively compared to source water bacterial community 2 38 0 72 0 76 0 14 and 185 123 respectively the β diversity changed from source to tap illustrated by pcoa plot with test of significance r 0 57 p 0 001 anosim fig 1b the shannon index and phylotypes number were significantly correlated with latitude in source water p 0 05 while not correlated with latitude in tap water p 0 05 fig s2 although the correlation between geographical distance km and bacterial community similarity based on bray curtis distance was significant r 0 074 p 0 018 in tap water such distance decay relationship was clearly stronger in source water r 0 210 p 0 001 fig 2 the correlation between temperature and bacterial community followed similar trend with the distance decay relationship mantel test revealed that the correlation between temperature and source water bacterial community was significant pearson s r 0 244 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 271 p 0 001 while the correlation between temperature and tap water bacterial community was weak pearson s r 0 041 p 0 255 spearman s r 0 088 p 0 092 3 2 evidence of source water seeding of tap water bacteria bayesian based sourcetracker method was used to calculate the extent of contribution of source water bacteria to tap water bacteria and the results showed the proportion of tap water bacteria that came from corresponding source water the sourcetracker proportions ranged from 0 to 92 8 with an average of 49 73 30 22 average standard deviation table s8 in addition more evidence also indicated the effect of source water on tap water significant correlation of bacterial communities between source water and tap water was confirmed by the mantel test pearson s r 0 256 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 285 p 0 001 table 1 and procrustes test sum of squares m2 0 7761 r 0 4731 p 0 0001 9999 permutations fig 3 c a total of 1966 otus of overall tap water samples were detected in overall source water samples which occupied 82 93 of overall tap water otus fig 3a on average 48 24 otus in tap water were detected in the corresponding source water sample fig 3b otus with top 10 relative abundance were all classified into proteobacteria and they also dominated in source water 13 58 in total table s5 interestingly the bacterial community compositions and structures among three source water types river lake and underground were distinct p 0 05 by permanova and such differences still appeared in tap water p 0 05 between groundwater and river between groundwater and lake fig s3 table s7 indicating that the treatment and distribution process could not eliminate the variation between sample types 3 3 classification of dominant bacterial taxa in source water into sensitive taxa and resistant taxa to further identify which dominant bacterial groups average relative abundance 1 in source water or tap water at the phylum level other than proteobacteria fig 1c right changed significantly between source and tap water these dominant bacterial groups were used to distinguish sampling types source water or tap water by random forest modeling fig 1c left a bacterial group with significant mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdgini values indicated that it was an important predictor in distinguishing sampling types which was viewed as a biomarker for source water and tap water here these biomarkers were classified as sensitive taxa because of their difference in source and tap water while other bacterial groups were classified as resistant taxa sensitive taxa in source water including planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria almost disappeared in tap water samples 10 72 and 0 44 in source water and tap water respectively while resistant taxa in source water including α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria showed tolerance to the treatment processes in plants and the distribution processes in pipelines and immigrated successfully to consumers 84 99 and 98 09 in source water and tap water respectively fig 1c 3 4 relationship between sourcetracker proportion and source water bacterial composition to explore the relationship between the impact of a source water sample on the corresponding tap water sample and the community structure of the source water sample pearson correlation between sourcetracker proportion and relative abundance of dominant bacterial groups was conducted the sum of sensitive taxa abundance negatively correlated with sourcetracker proportion r 0 382 p 0 009 while the sum of resistant taxa abundance positively correlated with sourcetracker proportion r 0 423 p 0 003 table 2 some specific bacterial groups including δ proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteria and γ proteobacteria also followed a similar trend table 2 concretely heatmap visualization of 143 otus of sensitive taxa average relative abundance of otus 0 01 in source water divided all samples into four clusters fig 4 a and the sourcetracker proportion sensitive taxa abundance and resistant taxa abundance of the four clusters were compared samples of cluster 1 contained more sensitive taxa and less resistant taxa than others and the sourcetracker proportion of cluster 1 was also smaller than others fig 4b to d high similarity between source water and its corresponding tap water bacterial community also indicated a strong contribution of source water to tap water bacterial community thus bray curtis similarity 1 dissimilarity between source water and the corresponding tap water was calculated and pearson correlation between the bray curtis similarity and relative abundance of dominant bacterial groups was conducted the sum of sensitive taxa abundance negatively correlated with bray curtis similarity r 0 436 p 0 002 while the sum of resistant taxa abundance positively correlated with bray curtis similarity r 0 464 p 0 001 table 2 some specific bacterial groups including δ proteobacteria chloroflexi acidobacteria and planctomycetes also followed a similar trend p 0 05 table 2 3 5 multivariate statistical analyses between tap water bacterial community and potential influencing factors the mantel test variation partition analysis vpa and structural equation model sem were performed to explore the quantitative correlation between tap water bacterial community and its potential driving factors mantel tests showed that the source water bacterial community was the most important factor shaping the tap water bacterial community pearson s r 0 256 p 0 001 spearman s r 0 285 p 0 001 followed by geographical distribution pearson s r 0 074 p 0 096 spearman s r 0 114 p 0 021 chemical

the variation of tap water bacterial communities was explained by selected variables fig 5 a source related variables source water bacterial community and geographical distribution contributed 37 84 alone and 2 27 together with other variables to the total variation in tap water bacterial communities while chemical properties and residual chlorine concentration only explained 16 53 and 1 94 of the total variation respectively fig 5a the sem quantified the indirect and direct effects of multiple factors on the bacterial community of tap water in accordance with the mantel test and vpa results the source water bacterial community was the key driver λ 0 605 p 0 001 shaping the tap water bacterial community according to sem fig 5b interestingly latitude was not directly correlated to the tap water bacterial community λ 0 273 p 0 05 but it exerted an indirect influence mainly through shaping the source water bacterial community λ 0 608 p 0 001 fig 5b 4 discussion to answer whether and how source water affects tap water bacteriology the present study represented a large scale investigation on bacteriology between source water and tap water by paired sampling across china we verified the indelible influence of source water on tap water bacterial variation revealed a universal shift pattern of bacterial communities between source water and tap water through a classification of sensitive and resistant taxa and provided unique insights into how the source water bacterial community could seed the tap water bacterial community different source water samples showed different ability to seed tap water and this ability might rely on the relative proportion of sensitive and resistant taxa in source water this study collected large scale samples and showed direct depiction of source water s impact on tap water bacteria which was difficult to reveal by microbial monitoring of single sources and pipelines reported previously 4 1 characteristics of bacterial community shifts from source to tap at the national scale based on paired samples fig 1a table s1 harboring a large diversity of bacterial communities we provided unique insights into the characteristics of the bacterial alteration patterns between source water and tap water such shifts were characterized at the otu table s5 genus table s6 phylum class levels fig 1c α diversity fig s1 β diversity fig 1b and geographical distribution figs 2 and s2 perspectives as expected the bacterial richness and diversity were lower in tap water than source water samples fig s1 which was in line with previous investigations hull et al 2017 roeselers et al 2015 consistent with previous studies holinger et al 2014 hull et al 2017 vaz moreira et al 2013 proteobacteria and particularly the two classes α and β proteobacteria became dominant in tap water and α and β proteobacteria were the only two bacterial groups whose relative abundance increased in tap water compared to source water fig 1c proteobacteria most were classified as α β and γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria dominated with 98 of the overall tap water bacterial community according to a large geographical area investigation in the u s a including 17 different drinking water distribution systems with chlorine disinfection holinger et al 2014 similarly our study also proposed that α β γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were classified as the resistant taxa by random forest model on the contrary planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria chloroflexi and δ proteobacteria were essential targets for distinguishing source water or tap water and thus were regarded as sensitive taxa fig 1c compared to previous investigations on bacterial community shifts between source water and tap water based on a single plant or single distribution system hull et al 2017 jia et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 roeselers et al 2015 this study contained a large number of samples with various bacterial compositions and paired samples of source and tap thus the classification of resistant and sensitive taxa in this study avoided the possible influence of accident or stochasticity to a certain extent 4 2 variation of source water bacterial communities was responsible for the impact of source water on tap water bacterial communities although treatment processes especially chlorine disinfection limited the influence of source water on tap water bacterial communities the source water bacteria were still the seed for tap water bacteria the sourcetracker proportion of source water was obtained to represent the impact of source water on chlorinated tap water bacteria by the bayesian based sourcetracker method sourcetracker proportion was positively correlated with resistant taxa abundance and negatively correlated with sensitive taxa abundance table 2 and such significant correlation hinted that the source water bacterial community structure especially the relative proportion of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa determined the source water s ability to affect tap water further the chemical parameters of source water might also make contribution to the difference of sourcetracker proportion between samples because of their influence on source water bacterial community source water samples with more resistant taxa showed greater contribution to the tap water bacterial community and vice versa to our knowledge this might be the first demonstration of high correlation between source water bacterial community structure and its potential impact on the tap water bacterial community deepening the understanding of the biological relationship between source water and tap water the impact of source water was mainly contributed by resistant taxa fig s4 and the causes of resistant taxa might be complex on the one hand chlorination could kill bacteria by destroying the cell wall and the difference in chlorine sensitivity among different bacterial populations in source water might be the main reason for bacterial shifts during the treatment process chiao et al 2014 numerous studies have noted the chlorine resistant feature of the above mentioned resistant taxa some genera within proteobacteria phylum including pseudomonas acidovorax pleomonas sphingomonas and undibacterium seemed to greatly increase after chlorination jia et al 2015 γ proteobacteria and actinobacteria were abundant in both source water and treated water disinfected by sodium hypochlorite followed by anhydrous ammonia to produce chloramine hull et al 2017 firmicutes bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria also occurred ubiquitously in chlorinated drinking water holinger et al 2014 on the other hand some members of bacterial community might gain a competitive edge and undergo greater regrowth during distribution ling et al 2018 nescerecka et al 2018 which is another cause of resistant taxa bacteroidetes exhibited regrowth in the transportation pipeline after chlorine consumption jia et al 2015 and β proteobacteria also showed a significant increase in relative abundance during passage through distribution systems potgieter et al 2018 in fact the underlying causes of biological instability might be higher temperatures lower chlorine residuals and less nutrient carbon phosphorus nitrogen iron limitation thus the differences in limiting nutrients in different source waters also contributed to biological instability in the networks nescerecka et al 2018 numerous studies have explored the dynamics of specific bacterial groups during drinking water treatment and distribution processes and these results are summarized in table 3 which effectively support the classification of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa in this study within resistant taxa consistent with previous results some opportunistic pathogens at genus level including acinetobacter spp 11 05 in source water 7 18 in tap water hou et al 2018 jumat et al 2018 lin et al 2014 vaz moreira et al 2013 burkholderia spp 0 02 in source water 1 12 in tap water cheng et al 2003 khan et al 2016 and pseudomonas spp 2 85 in source water 7 77 in tap water hwang et al 2012 jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 showed tolerance to chlorine disinfection table s6 and appeared in the tap water microbiome it should be noted that more molecular detections at the species level or on virulence genes need to be done for comprehensive depiction of opportunistic pathogens dynamics within the drinking water supply system li et al 2018 4 3 multiple drivers of tap water bacterial community variation mantel test table 1 vpa fig 5a sem fig 5b and distance decay relationship calculation figs 2 and s2 indicated that geographical distribution was also a potential influencing factor on the tap water bacterial community biogeographical patterns of microbes is a common phenomenon in natural ecosystems e g soils lakes delgado baquerizo et al 2018 liu et al 2015 and was also found in four drinking water plants in northern netherlands roeselers et al 2015 and along a 150 km drinking water distribution pipeline in south africa potgieter et al 2018 in the present study weak but significant biogeographical patterns of bacteria in tap water were found at the national scale which indicated that the treatment and distribution processes mitigated the heterogeneity of water microbiomes but could not eliminate the influence of natural climate conditions the biogeographical patterns of drinking water microbe indicated different region might need different strategies for treatment and distribution for instance the higher bacterial richness and diversity in southern areas than northern areas in china fig s2 highlighted that drinking water plants in southern areas had to pay more attention to ensure the effective disinfection step and monitor the biosafety of tap water it should be noted that the distance decay was complex in single drinking water system due to the different network configurations pinto et al 2014 thus the distance decay among different systems at large scale might be more complex we recommend that further effects on disentangling distance decay of drinking water microbiome need careful experimental design to control difference of engineering construction chlorination is accepted as an effective procedure to change the bacterial community during the treatment process chiao et al 2014 hull et al 2017 however residual chlorine concentration is a parameter that is tightly monitored and controlled throughout drinking water distribution systems to reach the same desired concentration perrin et al 2018 and it might not be a significant driver within bacterial communities among tap water samples who had finished the disinfection step in accordance mantel test vpa and sem results all led to the conclusion that the residual chlorine concentration was not significantly correlated to tap water bacterial community similarly a spatio temporal study on tap water in paris found that the total chlorine concentration had no significant impact on the most abundant taxa perrin et al 2018 in the present study several limitations may exist first except for the source water the filter material used in drinking water treatment plants pinto et al 2012 biofilms and loose deposits in distribution systems liu et al 2017 2018 rozej et al 2015 are also sources of tap water microbiomes which should be paid more attention in overall assessment of the origins of tap water microbiome second limited environmental variables especially limited chemical parameters which potentially contributed to biological instability in drinking water ling et al 2018 perrin et al 2018 prest et al 2016 were considered in our study thus the overall variation of tap water bacteria might be the result of the combined effects of source water treatment process distribution system and environmental conditions 4 4 practical implications for drinking water bacteria management our study revealed the impact of source water on the tap water bacterial community even though purification and disinfection steps were carried out it is also indicated that resistant taxa could migrate from source water to residential users if the source water is polluted by treatment resistant opportunistic pathogens the consumers especially the young and the old might be exposed to potential risk of waterborne disease outbreaks thus it is of vital importance to pay more attention to the source water protection from biological pollution i e fecal matter and hospital wastewater and in situ engineering control strategies i e river bank filtration and constructed wetland on the other hand previous researchers have proposed that tap water bacteria could be regulated and controlled by proper purification process pinto et al 2012 found that the filter served as an operational barrier for postfiltration water to exclude harmful bacteria from source water it was possible to populate desired innocuous bacteria in tap water by altering the water quality parameters and process operation parameters which were correlated to leaky colonizers in the filter pinto et al 2012 during the distribution process ecological interactions provide possible approaches using probiotic control in order to reduce the colonization and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens wang et al 2013 the joint efforts of source water protection and engineering intervention optimization might lead to optimal drinking water bacteria management hull et al 2019 5 conclusion compared to source water α β and γ proteobacteria became dominant and bacterial diversity decreased significantly in tap water distance decay relationship was weak but significant in tap water bacterial communities an average of 49 73 30 22 bacteria in tap water might come from its source water at the national scale on the basis of the sourcetracker method a universal change pattern of the bacterial community between source and tap water was explored and dominant bacterial groups in source water could be divided into sensitive taxa and resistant taxa the relative proportion of sensitive taxa and resistant taxa in source water was responsible for a source water s ability to affect tap water the potentially adverse impact of source water on tap water bacterial communities deserves more attention and the tap water bacterial community could possibly be managed by adequate source protection and precise process optimization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18144,anammox the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite is a key microbial process in the nitrogen cycle under mesophilic conditions below 40 c it is widely implemented to remove nitrogen from wastewaters lacking organic carbon despite evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in high temperature environments reports on the cultivation of thermophilic anammox bacteria are limited to a short term experiment of 2 weeks this study showcases the adaptation of a mesophilic inoculum to thermophilic conditions and its characterization first an attached growth technology was chosen to obtain the process in an anoxic fixed bed biofilm bioreactor fbbr a slow linear temperature increase from 38 to over 48 c 0 05 0 07 c d 1 was imposed to the community over 220 days after which the reactor was operated at 48 c for over 200 days maximum total nitrogen removal rates reached up to 0 62 g n l 1 d 1 given this promising performance a suspended growth system was tested the obtained enrichment culture served as inoculum for membrane bioreactors mbr operated at 50 c reaching a maximum total nitrogen removal rate of 1 7 g n l 1 d 1 after 35 days the biomass in the mbr had a maximum specific anammox activity of 1 1 0 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 and the growth rate was estimated at 0 075 0 19 d 1 the thermophilic cultures displayed nitrogen stoichiometry ratios typical for mesophilic

anaob biological nitrogen removal nitrification nutrient removal and recovery sludge reject water packed bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction anammox the anoxic oxidation of ammonium with nitrite is a microbial process autotrophically producing nitrogen gas catalyzed by members of the planctomycetes phylum interest in anammox has grown substantially over the past decades in both research and application for wastewater treatment from its first prediction based on thermodynamics broda 1977 two decades passed before the first enrichment culture was characterized strous et al 1999a and anammox was proposed as a cost efficient alternative to denitrification for the treatment of wastewaters lacking organic carbon jetten et al 1997 by 2014 more than 100 full scale installations had been built treating high strength nitrogenous wastewater with ratios of biologically degradable chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen bcod n 3 under mesophilic conditions lackner et al 2014 current advances towards applying anammox to the treatment of cold wastewaters i e below 15 c could even enable energy autarkic treatment of municipal wastewater agrawal et al 2018 thermophilic conditions have been widely explored for carbon removal wastewater treatment processes revealing advantages over mesophilic treatment such as lower sludge production higher conversion rates and a more effective inactivation of pathogens lapara and alleman 1999 layden et al 2007 van lier 1996 e efforts to develop thermophilic technologies for n removal however are scarce and recent thermophilic nitrogen removal could nonetheless offer a viable alternative to current mesophilic practices in industries generating warm nitrogenous wastewater avoiding the need for cooling prior to mesophilic treatment the biotechnological possibility of thermophilic nitrification nitritation and nitratation and denitrification as well as denitritation have been recently demonstrated at lab scale revealing the benefit of lower heterotrophic sludge production courtens et al 2014 2016a 2016b vandekerckhove et al 2018 2019a 2019b for carbon rich wastewater streams bcod n 4 thermophilic nitrification denitrification would enable high temperature treatment carbon lean streams such as thermophilic digestates however are suitable candidates for shortcut nitrogen removal processes nitritation denitritation is one possibility but when bcod n drops below 2 3 only partial nitritation anammox pn a would enable nitrogen removal without exogenous carbon dosage vlaeminck et al 2012 the application of anammox bacteria to treat wastewater under thermophilic conditions has hardly been explored the maximum growth temperature seems to be dependent on the species i e 37 c for candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis egli et al 2001 42 5 c for candidatus jettenia caeni ali et al 2015 43 c for candidatus brocadia anammoxidans strous et al 1999b and 45 c for candidatus brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2011 nevertheless the evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in high temperature environments suggests that some uncultured strains may have higher temperature growth limits byrne et al 2009 found molecular evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in hydrothermal vents in the mid atlantic ocean the anammox activity was confirmed in incubations with samples from chimneys performed at 60 c and 85 c jaeschke et al 2009 detected traces of ladderane lipids a biomarker for anammox bacteria and found 16s rrna genes closely related to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis in sediment and mat samples from a californian hot spring at 52 c additionally molecular evidence of anammox bacteria has been found in a geothermal spring in japan 50 62 c hirayama et al 2005 and in oil reservoirs in china 55 75 c li et al 2010 recently anammox activity at 50 c was reported for 2 weeks in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a total nitrogen removal rate of 0 53 0 23 g n l 1 d 1 this was achieved after implementing a temperature increase of 2 5 c every two weeks corresponding to 0 18 c d 1 zhang et al 2018 although anammox activity has been shown at 50 c long term cultivation and characterization of the bacterial stoichiometry kinetics and community remain absent this study reports on the first long term operation 200 days of a thermophilic anammox bioreactor 48 c obtained by imposing a linear temperature increase with 0 05 0 01 c d 1 to a mesophilic anammox inoculum a first reactor type was biofilm based to achieve a sufficiently high biomass retention implemented as a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr in this bioreactor we evaluated the changes in microbial community and stoichiometry a second reactor type was based on suspended sludge a membrane bioreactor mbr using microfiltration to retain the biomass with the fbbr enrichment as inoculum the mbr were operated at 50 c and the specific anammox activity and the first thermophilic anammox growth rate were determined finally an economic assessment was performed of the treatment of sludge reject water from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 adaptation and characterization in a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr at 48 c an anoxic upflow bioreactor 3l was used in this experiment the reactor was composed of a cylindrical section of 5 5 cm diameter and 60 cm height and a spherical settling section at the top of the column with a diameter of 15 cm the reactor was fed from the bottom and the effluent discharge occurred through an overflow at the top of the reactor the column was packed with carrier material kaldness k1 and ceramic rings was inoculated with granules from a mesophilic 37 c full scale bioreactor treating anaerobically digested potato wastewater and sludge reject water through pn a olburgen the netherlands provided by paques bv the netherlands the column reactor was placed in a temperature controlled room 34 c to prevent temperature fluctuation in the environment and was heated 40 c by a hose coiled around the reactor connected to water circulating thermostatic bath julabo ma 4 the temperature of the thermostatic bath with a sensitivity of 0 01 c was raised with 0 05 0 01 c d 1 starting from 37 5 c until over 48 c measured daily inside the reactor with a sensitivity of 0 1 c the temperature was measured at the top of the column reactor the reactor was continuously fed with a synthetic autotrophic medium that consisted of nh4hco3 and nano2 cacl2 0 1 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 nah2po4 0 015 g p l 1 yeast extract 4 5 mg l 1 and 1 ml l 1 medium of trace element solution a 9 15 g l 1 feso4 7h2o and 9 62 g l 1 na2edta 2h2o and trace element solution b third et al 2001 the medium was not flushed with n2 gas and had the temperature of the climate room 34 c ammonium and nitrite were dosed at a nitrite limiting ratio of 0 8 0 9g no2 n g 1 nh4 n avoiding the accumulation of nitrite water samples were collected regularly filtered over 0 2 μm pore size syringe filters and stored at 4 c prior to analysis of nh4 no2 and no3 the ph was controlled at 7 6 via the addition of 0 2 m hcl in situ maximum anammox activity vrrntot max tests were performed regularly the vrrntot max was calculated as the volumetric rate of total nitrogen removal over the test period mg nh4 n and no2 n l 1 d 1 during these tests the continuous feeding was interrupted and substrates nano2 and nh4hco3 were spiked at 33 15 mg no2 n l 1 and a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 liquid samples were taken regularly during 1 8 h depending on the n consumption rate and stored at 4 c prior to analysis of nh4 no2 and no3 2 2 cultivation and characterization in membrane bioreactors mbr at 50 c two membrane bioreactors mbr 1l each reactor were started up on days on days 354 and 430 the bioreactors were inoculated with biomass from the fbbr the reactors were fitted with a hollow fibre microfiltration membrane with a pore size of 100 nm that allowed for effluent discharge with complete biomass retention in the bioreactors the fibers originated from a full scale pall microza installation asahi kasei chemicals corporation japan the reactor vessel was jacketed and the temperature was controlled at 50 c by use of a circulating thermostatic water bath julabo ma 4 in both mbr mixing was provided by a magnetic stirrer and the ph was controlled at 7 6 in mbr1 the ph was controlled by dosing 0 2 m hcl in mbr2 the ph was not controlled instead the medium was amended with 2 g nahco3 l 1 and the reactor was continuously flushed with n2 co2 90 10 v v at a flowrate of ca 100 ml min 1 providing a constant ph of 7 6 a water lock in the exhaust gas line provided enough overpressure to prevent air intrusion in the bioreactor this was found to be more reliable than dosing hcl and prevents acid overdose in case of failure of the ph controller the reactors were not run in parallel the synthetic medium for the mbr was the same as the fbbr s feed and was continuously fed to the systems as for the fbbr nitrite was the limiting nitrogen substrate ammonium and nitrite were supplemented to the medium at ratios between 0 8 and 1 1 g no2 n g 1 nh4 n liquid samples handling and in situ activity measurements in mbr2 were performed as previously described for the fbbr a total of three activity tests was performed on operation day 100 2 3 physical chemical analyses of water and sludge ammonium nessler method total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were measured according to standard methods apha 1992 nitrite and nitrate were determined on a 761 compact ion chromatograph metrohm switzerland as explained in the supplementary material the temperature inside the reactor was regularly measured with a digital thermometer ph inside the reactor was regularly checked with a digital ph probe orbisint cps11d 2 4 molecular analyses of the microbial communities samples were collected from the inoculum and from the fbbr biomass at 43 and 48 c operation days 120 and 390 for analysis of the microbial community by amplicon sequencing on the sample from the fbbr at 48 c sanger sequencing was performed as well the samples were stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction dna extraction was performed as explained in the supplementary material 2 4 1 amplicon sequencing and data processing illumina 16s rrna gene amplicon libraries were generated and sequenced by baseclear bv leiden the netherlands the dna extracts were sent to baseclear b v the netherlands for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing on the miseq platform for bacteria as explained in the supplementary material 2 4 2 sanger sequencing primers targeting the planctomycetes community were used namely pla40f cggcrtggattaggcatg pla46f ggattaggcatgcaagtc 1378r cggtgtgtacaaggcccgggaacg and 1492r tacggytaccttgttacgactt the amplification products were purified as indicated in supplementary material and were sent to lgc genomics germany for sanger sequencing 2 5 the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a even though only snapshot views on the kinetics and stoichiometry of thermophilic nitritation and anammox are available a first cost assessment was performed to evaluate which factors could render thermophilic pn a economically interesting the chosen source of wastewater was high temperature 50 c sludge reject water originating from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sewage sludge capital and operational expenditure capex and opex were compared for its mesophilic 30 c and thermophilic 50 c pn a treatment typical influent and effluent characteristics from full scale mesophilic treatment of sludge digestion reject water were assumed for both table s 1 lackner et al 2014 the treatment plant consisted of a continuously fed single sludge reactor tank at a biomass concentration of 4 kg vss m 3 a lamella separator was installed for sludge retention with a mixed liquor recycle stream back to the reactor tank whereas the produced biomass was wasted via a waste flow to a centrifuge even though in practice sludge wasting from a sidestream pn a occurs only on limited occasions and is usually sent back to the digester and mainstream treatment unit this economic assessment incorporated the cost for wasting the produced sludge to see what the difference would be between mesophilic and thermophilic pn a in the mesophilic pn a scenario a cooling installation was added to the design to lower the temperature of the thermophilic sludge reject water applied kinetics are summarized in supplementary material table s 2 capex involved cooling installations only for the mesophilic scenario civil works equipment mechanical and electrical works piping working hours and profit risk opex comprised cooling sludge thickening electricity consumption centrifuge chemicals aeration pumping mixing sludge disposal personnel analyses and maintenance all details on data and assumptions linked to influent characteristics kinetics process design and operation and depreciation can be found in supplementary material section s 3 process diagrams of the mesophilic and thermophilic scenario along with several process parameters can also be found in supplementary material section s 3 3 figure s 4 and s 5 3 results discussion 3 1 adaptation and characterization in a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr at 48 c in a first phase a biofilm based reactor was chosen to achieve a sufficiently high biomass retention implemented as a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr the fbbr inoculated with mesophilic pn a granules was subjected to a loading rate of 276 18 mg ntot l 1 d 1 at a temperature of 37 5 c after 3 days of temperature increase to 38 1 c low concentrations of nitrite accumulated 1 5 0 6 mg n l 1 figure s 1 after which the temperature increase was stopped and the loading rate was lowered to 200 mg ntot l 1 d 1 in order to prevent substrate accumulation the in situ batch activity measurements showed a decreasing maximum total nitrogen removal rate vrrntot max for the first 26 days fig 1 on day 39 vrrntot max did not decrease relative to the previous vrrntot max determination after which the daily temperature increase of 0 05 0 01 c d 1 was resumed the ratios no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed are common indicators of the anammox nitrogen stoichiometry with reported values of 1 15 1 32 and 0 16 0 26 g n g 1 n respectively lotti et al 2014c strous et al 1999b the no2 removed nh4 removed ratio in the fbr remained at 1 16 0 09 g n g 1 n as long as the temperature was below 43 c additionally the nitrate production was lower than expected from anammox stoichiometry during the first 40 days the no3 produced nh4 removed ratio was 0 02 0 02 g n g 1 n at a temperature of 38 1 c this points towards endogenous denitrification i e decay products in the reactor acting as electron donors for nitrate reduction as some members of the inoculum microbial community depending on oxygen and or organics likely could not survive under the newly imposed anoxic autotrophic conditions wang et al 2015 after this start up phase the performance of the fbbr was stable at temperatures up to 43 c with limited nitrite accumulation and a vrrntot max of 703 212 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1 and figure s 1 from day 40 onwards the no3 produced nh4 removed ratio was higher at 0 12 0 02 g n g 1 n but still below the typically reported range for anammox from 43 c onwards total nitrogen removal rate in the reactor vrrntot 45 13 mg n l 1 d 1 and relative nitrate production 0 14 0 06 g n g 1 n remained low with a no2 removed nh4 removed ratio of 1 17 0 30 g n g 1 n the linear temperature increase was maintained until 48 c after which the activity increased again with a vrrntot max of 529 103 mg n l 1 d 1 the increase in anammox activity was accompanied by an increase in nitrate production to 0 20 0 03 g n g 1 n which is within the typically reported range possibly suggesting a lower contribution of denitrification the period of low activity could be the consequence of low initial numbers of the thermophilic anammox species that took over 100 days to provide a measurable activity from the beginning of the linear t increase the no2 removed nh4 removed ratio remained stable at 1 03 0 11 g n g 1 n at thermophilic temperatures slightly below the literature values overall stable operation for over 200 days was achieved at 48 c key to the successful selection for thermophilic anammox bacteria or adaptation of mesophilic anammox bacteria to thermophilic conditions was possibly the slow temperature increase allowing the microorganisms to adapt to changing conditions previous studies investigated temperature shocks and found that for example overheating from 35 to 48 c for 1 h resulted in anammox bacteria damage and death in an irreversible process with recovery requiring two weeks of operation back at 35 c liu et al 2015 another study examined the effect of a stepwise change of temperature between 35 and 46 c on an anammox sequencing batch reactor and found that it caused lysis of anammox cells after which almost no activity was found back the activity recovered over a period of about 20 days and subsequently increased again after restoring the initial temperature of 35 c isanta et al 2015 it was also found that thermophilic anammox bacteria could not be selected at 55 c from industrial coke oven wastewater sludges toh et al 2002 as opposed to the temperature shocks in previous studies this study imposed a slow temperature increase lasting over 200 days which enabled the development of a thermophilic anammox community with sustained activity up to 48 c 3 2 stoichiometry and kinetics in membrane bioreactors mbr at 50 c after obtaining anammox activity at 48 c in the fbbr part of the culture was used to inoculate two membrane bioreactors operated at 50 c mbr1 and mbr2 cultivating anammox bacteria in these mbr enabled homogeneous sampling for the determination of biomass concentration which was not feasible in the fbbr this enabled the determination of several kinetic parameters being the maximum biomass specific anammox activity and the net growth rate μnet within 35 days a high total nitrogen removal rate of 1 8 g n l 1 d 1 was achieved in mbr1 with no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed of 1 14 0 16 and 0 22 0 05 g n g 1 n respectively consistent with known mesophilic anammox stoichiometry fig 2 a the obtained volumetric rates were about a factor 3 higher than a previous study achieving anammox activity at 50 c in a bioreactor using salt amendment for 2 weeks 0 53 0 23 g n l 1 d 1 zhang et al 2018 the increasing anammox activity during the first 35 days of mbr1 operation was used to estimate the net growth rate μnet the result of the actual growth rate and the decay rate over the activity increase substrate levels were 28 7 15 5 mg nh4 n l 1 and 12 3 17 9 mg no2 n l 1 however the affinity indices of this culture were not known so it is not sure that the anammox bacteria were growing at their maximum rate μmax nonetheless μnet is a valuable parameter providing insight into the achievable thermophilic anammox growth rate three different approaches were used for the estimation of μnet at 50 c first an exponential model was fitted to the experimental data using the least squares method fig 2 b yielding a μnet of 0 075 d 1 r2 94 secondly the total nitrogen removal rate was linearized by log transformation and fitted by a linear equation using the least squares method fig 2 c van der star et al 2007 resulting in a μnet of 0 12 0 01 d 1 r2 92 thirdly μnet was calculated at every time interval 1 laureni et al 2015 rendering an average value of 0 19 0 18 d 1 figure s 2 1 μ n e t l n r n t o t t n 1 r n t o t t n t n 1 t n each method yielded a different μnet so caution should be used when using the estimated values nonetheless the obtained μnet range of 0 075 0 19 d 1 is after rescaling to 20 c arrhenius function with theta 1 1 seuntjens et al 2018 comparable to growth rates of anammox bacteria measured under mesophilic conditions table 1 when comparing reactors with high sludge retention time srt the obtained μnet in this study is relatively high compared to growth rates for mesophilic anammox bacteria the high growth rates observed by lotti et al 2015 were obtained by imposing a low srt to the bioreactor in mbr2 operated for 100 days the biomass was kept in suspension and the biomass specific anammox activity could be determined anammox stoichiometry was observed in mbr2 with no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed ratios of 1 10 0 13 and 0 19 0 03 g n g 1 n respectively the actual biomass specific total nitrogen removal rates rx ntot in the reactor 0 52 0 26 g n g 1 vss d 1 figure s 3 b a maximum biomass specific anammox activity of 1 1 0 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 1 8 0 2 g nrem g 1 vss d 1 was obtained from an in situ activity measurement these rates are higher than previously reported from reactors operated at srt 45d under mesophilic conditions and are comparable to those obtained by lotti et al 2015 in a reactor operated at very short srt 3 d table 1 however when considering the anammox bacteria abundance and after rescaling to 20 c arrhenius function with theta 1 1 seuntjens et al 2018 this rate is in the lower range of reported values table 1 the biomass yield can be considered as the ratio of growth rate 0 075 0 19 d 1 and the biomass specific anammox activity 1 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 this results in an estimated biomass yield of 0 07 and 0 17 g vss g 1 nh4 n which is comparable to the reported 0 12 g vss g 1 nh4 n strous et al 1998 in this study biomass was only extracted for occasional sampling rendering an estimated srt of 300 days it remains to be investigated whether a shorter srt control would render higher thermophilic activities as well 3 3 a potentially new thermophilic anammox taxon 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial community in the fbbr inoculum and in the reactor at 43 and 48 c operation days 120 and 390 fig 3 b and c the anammox bacteria in the inoculum were classified as candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia and accounted only for 1 5 and 1 3 of the microbial community respectively at 43 c no ca jettenia was detected whereas ca brocadia was present at a relative bacterial abundance of 2 1 and was the most abundant anammox species the loss of ca jettenia could be attributed to its reported temperature range of activity being slightly lower than reactor conditions 20 42 5 c ali et al 2015 the activity of ca brocadia on the other hand has been confirmed at a wider range of temperatures 25 45 c oshiki et al 2011 thermophilic conditions 48 c resulted in a bacterial community highly enriched in a ca brocadia related anammox species 46 4 of the total bacterial community the reactor conditions anoxic conditions and autotrophic medium and the increasing temperature likely resulted in the selection and high abundance of this putative thermophilic anammox species previous research has also shown that a temperature shock on an anammox reactor resulted in an anammox enriched community after a recovery process as opposed to a very diverse microbial community before the temperature shock isanta et al 2015 parallel to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the thermophilic community sanger sequencing was performed on the dna sample of the fbbr at 48 c using primers targeting the planctomycetes community three out of four sequence pairs could be merged into contigs all yielding a 96 97 similarity to an uncultured anammox bacterium from a geothermal spring in japan hirayama et al 2005 two of the sanger sequences pla46f 1492r and pla40f 1492r were used to construct a phylogenetic tree comparing the obtained sanger sequences to all anammox bacteria reference sequences the closest cultured relatives were ca brocadia caroliniensis 94 95 similarity and ca brocadia anammoxidans 94 95 similarity fig 3a considering the currently applied sequence similarity thresholds of 95 for genus and 98 7 for species rossi tamisier et al 2015 we hypothesize that the community harboured a new anammox species however further research is necessary to establish its phylogenetic novelty and to attribute the necessary functional genes to this planctomycete to validate its association with the observed ammonium oxidation both rhodocyclaceae and rbg1 become abundant at 43 c at the same time that the anammox activity as observed through in situ tests collapses the switch from a mesophilic temperature region to moderately thermophilic conditions caused a change in the whole microbial community in which mesophiles die or are washed out while microorganisms that tolerate higher temperatures take over the rhodocyclaecae that became enriched at 43 c are affiliated to the genus denitratisoma that seem to have thrived by performing denitrification on the decay products of collapsing mesophiles the rbg 1 are affiliated to the genus of zixibacteria castelle et al 2013 it has been found in anoxic sections in anoxic sediments in the sulfate methane transition zone baker et al 2015 and has been suggested to scavenge reduced carbon products it is capable of nitrate and nitric oxide reduction as well as of sulfate reduction momper et al 2017 it seems plausible that it contributed to the denitrification of biomass decay products during this t transition period just like rhodocyclaceae 3 4 practical outlook the presented proof of principle of thermophilic anammox biotechnology opens up a new route for thermophilic biological nitrogen removal namely through pn a thermophilic nitrification has been obtained in lab scale bioreactors and its kinetics have been determined elaborately vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b setting the foundation for research on suppressing nitrite oxidation to obtain partial nitritation and integrating with thermophilic anammox in a single sludge bioreactor thermophilic ammonia oxidation is dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa vandekerckhove et al 2019b only two heterotrophic and one autotrophic thermophilic aob has been isolated so far itoh et al 2013 mevel and prieur 2000 shimaya and hashimoto 2011 kinetic comparison between thermophilic aoa and mesophilic aob revealed that thermophilic aoa had a higher biomass yield lower biomass specific ammonia oxidation rate lower growth rate and higher substrate affinity vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b this first demonstration of long term cultivation of anammox bacteria under thermophilic conditions with volumetric activities and observed growth rates which are comparable to those reported under mesophilic conditions table 1 suggests the feasibility of the application of anammox to warm temperature the obtained maximum biomass specific anammox activity in this study indicates that similar rates might be possible in thermophilic compared to mesophilic sidestream anammox treatment of for example reject water from thermophilic sludge digestion de vrieze et al 2016 however more research is needed to evaluate the feasibility of thermophilic pn a first the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a should be compared to current practices of cooling thermophilic digestates prior to mesophilic pn a secondly more information on the anammox biomass yield and decay rate is necessary to enable a better comparison to mesophilic kinetics thirdly the effect of organic carbon ph temperature fluctuations free ammonia free nitrous acid recurrent dissolved oxygen exposure and real wastewater matrices on the anammox activity should be investigated as stepping stones towards thermophilic pn a fourthly considering the high anammox activity compared to thermophilic aoa activity 1 1 vs ca 0 2 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 the obtainable nitritation rate could be the limiting factor in a pn a system and requires further research however in mesophilic pn a systems nitritation is the limiting factor as well finally mesophilic reactor configurations implemented in practice include moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr granular sludge processes and sequencing batch reactors sbr lackner et al 2014 considering the configurations tested in this study fbbr and mbr there is a need to evaluate more practically relevant reactors to facilitate the implementation 3 5 the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a even though limited data is available on the kinetics and stoichiometry of thermophilic nitritation and anammox a first cost assessment was performed to evaluate which factors could render thermophilic pn a economically interesting the chosen source of wastewater was high temperature 50 c sludge reject water originating from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sewage sludge capital and operational expenditure capex and opex were compared for its mesophilic 30 c and thermophilic 50 c pn a treatment both scenarios showed a similar total treatment cost with thermophilic pn a cost only 0 03 kg 1 n or 2 5 above the mesophilic one opex dominated the total treatment cost amounting to 73 and 75 for the thermophilic and mesophilic scenario respectively table 2 capex and opex associated with influent cooling for the mesophilic scenario contributed only 5 1 to the total treatment cost rendering limited savings attributed to avoided cooling for thermophilic treatment the extra costs for thermophilic pn a were mainly attributed to a higher reactor capex due to the need for insulation and an increased opex for sludge disposal the extra cost for insulation is inevitable the slightly higher sludge disposal cost 9 5 was caused by the higher observed biomass production mainly because thermophilic aoa have a higher maximum biomass yield ymax and lower decay rate kd than mesophilic aob vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b however knowledge on the ymax and kd of thermophilic versus mesophilic ammonia oxidizing organisms is still limited vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b which is also the case for anammox bacteria rendering the need for a more thorough investigation to accurately predict the sludge production difference also as sludge from a sidestream pn a is usually sent back to the anaerobic digester and to the mainstream treatment unit the actual impact on overall sludge disposal cost will be more limited currently the expected thermophilic nitritation rate is below the rates observed in full scale mesophilic pn a systems however if the thermophilic nitritation rate could be increased to the mesophilic rate and thermophilic and mesophilic sludge production would be the same the total treatment cost for thermophilic pn a would be 2 3 cheaper than mesophilic pn a as current knowledge on thermophilic nitritation is still limited further research could focus on obtaining higher rates by investigating different reactor conditions or other microbial species with higher conversion rates overall the first economic estimation highlighted that thermophilic pn a could be cost competitive to mesophilic pn a this means that warm wastewaters for example reject water from thermophilic digestion would not need cooling prior to mesophilic pn a but could be treated thermophilically in a cost effective way thermophilic anaerobic digestion obtains higher conversion rates higher biogas yield higher reduction of pathogens and contributes to higher energy and nutrient recovery compared to mesophilic digestion de vrieze et al 2016 currently the use of cooling equipment prior to mesophilic treatment is prone to failure when the cooling does not work a temperature shock would inhibit the pn a process and result in treatment failure considering the importance of preventing treatment failure and preventing excessive amount of reactive nitrogen to be sent back to the mainstream treatment unit or to the environment thermophilic pn a would be a valuable alternative to the current practices also thermophilic conditions prevent the growth of mesophilic pathogens and enables a more efficient hygienization of the wastewater lapara and alleman 1999 for example legionella grows in biofilms in wastewater treatment plants under mesophilic conditions 25 45 c thermophilic treatment would prevent growth of such pathogens caicedo et al 2019 further research and development on thermophilic nitritation and anammox stoichiometry and kinetics should enable a more accurate assessment 4 conclusions long term thermophilic anammox reactor operation was demonstrated for the first time both for an attached and suspended growth in the fbbr with maximum total nitrogen removal rates up to 0 62 g n l 1 d 1 48 c an adapted enrichment community was obtained by imposing a linear temperature

18144,anammox the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite is a key microbial process in the nitrogen cycle under mesophilic conditions below 40 c it is widely implemented to remove nitrogen from wastewaters lacking organic carbon despite evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in high temperature environments reports on the cultivation of thermophilic anammox bacteria are limited to a short term experiment of 2 weeks this study showcases the adaptation of a mesophilic inoculum to thermophilic conditions and its characterization first an attached growth technology was chosen to

anaob biological nitrogen removal nitrification nutrient removal and recovery sludge reject water packed bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction anammox the anoxic oxidation of ammonium with nitrite is a microbial process autotrophically producing nitrogen gas catalyzed by members of the planctomycetes phylum interest in anammox has grown substantially over the past decades in both research and application for wastewater treatment from its first prediction based on thermodynamics broda 1977 two decades passed before the first enrichment culture was characterized strous et al 1999a and anammox was proposed as a cost efficient alternative to denitrification for the treatment of wastewaters lacking organic carbon jetten et al 1997 by 2014 more than 100 full scale installations had been built treating high strength nitrogenous wastewater with ratios of biologically degradable chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen bcod n 3 under mesophilic conditions lackner et al 2014 current advances towards applying anammox to the treatment of cold wastewaters i e below 15 c could even enable energy autarkic treatment of municipal wastewater agrawal et al 2018 thermophilic conditions have been widely explored for carbon removal wastewater treatment processes revealing advantages over mesophilic treatment such as lower sludge production higher conversion rates and a more effective inactivation of pathogens lapara and alleman 1999 layden et al 2007 van lier 1996 e efforts to develop thermophilic technologies for n removal however are scarce and recent thermophilic nitrogen removal could nonetheless offer a viable alternative to current mesophilic practices in industries generating warm nitrogenous wastewater avoiding the need for cooling prior to mesophilic treatment the biotechnological possibility of thermophilic nitrification nitritation and nitratation and denitrification as well as denitritation have been recently demonstrated at lab scale revealing the benefit of lower heterotrophic sludge production courtens et al 2014 2016a 2016b vandekerckhove et al 2018 2019a 2019b for carbon rich wastewater streams bcod n 4 thermophilic nitrification denitrification would enable high temperature treatment carbon lean streams such as thermophilic digestates however are suitable candidates for shortcut nitrogen removal processes nitritation denitritation is one possibility but when bcod n drops below 2 3 only partial nitritation anammox pn a would enable nitrogen removal without exogenous carbon dosage vlaeminck et al 2012 the application of anammox bacteria to treat wastewater under thermophilic conditions has hardly been explored the maximum growth temperature seems to be dependent on the species i e 37 c for candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis egli et al 2001 42 5 c for candidatus jettenia caeni ali et al 2015 43 c for candidatus brocadia anammoxidans strous et al 1999b and 45 c for candidatus brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2011 nevertheless the evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in high temperature environments suggests that some uncultured strains may have higher temperature growth limits byrne et al 2009 found molecular evidence of the presence of anammox bacteria in hydrothermal vents in the mid atlantic ocean the anammox activity was confirmed in incubations with samples from chimneys performed at 60 c and 85 c jaeschke et al 2009 detected traces of ladderane lipids a biomarker for anammox bacteria and found 16s rrna genes closely related to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis in sediment and mat samples from a californian hot spring at 52 c additionally molecular evidence of anammox bacteria has been found in a geothermal spring in japan 50 62 c hirayama et al 2005 and in oil reservoirs in china 55 75 c li et al 2010 recently anammox activity at 50 c was reported for 2 weeks in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a total nitrogen removal rate of 0 53 0 23 g n l 1 d 1 this was achieved after implementing a temperature increase of 2 5 c every two weeks corresponding to 0 18 c d 1 zhang et al 2018 although anammox activity has been shown at 50 c long term cultivation and characterization of the bacterial stoichiometry kinetics and community remain absent this study reports on the first long term operation 200 days of a thermophilic anammox bioreactor 48 c obtained by imposing a linear temperature increase with 0 05 0 01 c d 1 to a mesophilic anammox inoculum a first reactor type was biofilm based to achieve a sufficiently high biomass retention implemented as a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr in this bioreactor we evaluated the changes in microbial community and stoichiometry a second reactor type was based on suspended sludge a membrane bioreactor mbr using microfiltration to retain the biomass with the fbbr enrichment as inoculum the mbr were operated at 50 c and the specific anammox activity and the first thermophilic anammox growth rate were determined finally an economic assessment was performed of the treatment of sludge reject water from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 adaptation and characterization in a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr at 48 c an anoxic upflow bioreactor 3l was used in this experiment the reactor was composed of a cylindrical section of 5 5 cm diameter and 60 cm height and a spherical settling section at the top of the column with a diameter of 15 cm the reactor was fed from the bottom and the effluent discharge occurred through an overflow at the top of the reactor the column was packed with carrier material kaldness k1 and ceramic rings was inoculated with granules from a mesophilic 37 c full scale bioreactor treating anaerobically digested potato wastewater and sludge reject water through pn a olburgen the netherlands provided by paques bv the netherlands the column reactor was placed in a temperature controlled room 34 c to prevent temperature fluctuation in the environment and was heated 40 c by a hose coiled around the reactor connected to water circulating thermostatic bath julabo ma 4 the temperature of the thermostatic bath with a sensitivity of 0 01 c was raised with 0 05 0 01 c d 1 starting from 37 5 c until over 48 c measured daily inside the reactor with a sensitivity of 0 1 c the temperature was measured at the top of the column reactor the reactor was continuously fed with a synthetic autotrophic medium that consisted of nh4hco3 and nano2 cacl2 0 1 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 nah2po4 0 015 g p l 1 yeast extract 4 5 mg l 1 and 1 ml l 1 medium of trace element solution a 9 15 g l 1 feso4 7h2o and 9 62 g l 1 na2edta 2h2o and trace element solution b third et al 2001 the medium was not flushed with n2 gas and had the temperature of the climate room 34 c ammonium and nitrite were dosed at a nitrite limiting ratio of 0 8 0 9g no2 n g 1 nh4 n avoiding the accumulation of nitrite water samples were collected regularly filtered over 0 2 μm pore size syringe filters and stored at 4 c prior to analysis of nh4 no2 and no3 the ph was controlled at 7 6 via the addition of 0 2 m hcl in situ maximum anammox activity vrrntot max tests were performed regularly the vrrntot max was calculated as the volumetric rate of total nitrogen removal over the test period mg nh4 n and no2 n l 1 d 1 during these tests the continuous feeding was interrupted and substrates nano2 and nh4hco3 were spiked at 33 15 mg no2 n l 1 and a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 liquid samples were taken regularly during 1 8 h depending on the n consumption rate and stored at 4 c prior to analysis of nh4 no2 and no3 2 2 cultivation and characterization in membrane bioreactors mbr at 50 c two membrane bioreactors mbr 1l each reactor were started up on days on days 354 and 430 the bioreactors were inoculated with biomass from the fbbr the reactors were fitted with a hollow fibre microfiltration membrane with a pore size of 100 nm that allowed for effluent discharge with complete biomass retention in the bioreactors the fibers originated from a full scale pall microza installation asahi kasei chemicals corporation japan the reactor vessel was jacketed and the temperature was controlled at 50 c by use of a circulating thermostatic water bath julabo ma 4 in both mbr mixing was provided by a magnetic stirrer and the ph was controlled at 7 6 in mbr1 the ph was controlled by dosing 0 2 m hcl in mbr2 the ph was not controlled instead the medium was amended with 2 g nahco3 l 1 and the reactor was continuously flushed with n2 co2 90 10 v v at a flowrate of ca 100 ml min 1 providing a constant ph of 7 6 a water lock in the exhaust gas line provided enough overpressure to prevent air intrusion in the bioreactor this was found to be more reliable than dosing hcl and prevents acid overdose in case of failure of the ph controller the reactors were not run in parallel the synthetic medium for the mbr was the same as the fbbr s feed and was continuously fed to the systems as for the fbbr nitrite was the limiting nitrogen substrate ammonium and nitrite were supplemented to the medium at ratios between 0 8 and 1 1 g no2 n g 1 nh4 n liquid samples handling and in situ activity measurements in mbr2 were performed as previously described for the fbbr a total of three activity tests was performed on operation day 100 2 3 physical chemical analyses of water and sludge ammonium nessler method total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were measured according to standard methods apha 1992 nitrite and nitrate were determined on a 761 compact ion chromatograph metrohm switzerland as explained in the supplementary material the temperature inside the reactor was regularly measured with a digital thermometer ph inside the reactor was regularly checked with a digital ph probe orbisint cps11d 2 4 molecular analyses of the microbial communities samples were collected from the inoculum and from the fbbr biomass at 43 and 48 c operation days 120 and 390 for analysis of the microbial community by amplicon sequencing on the sample from the fbbr at 48 c sanger sequencing was performed as well the samples were stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction dna extraction was performed as explained in the supplementary material 2 4 1 amplicon sequencing and data processing illumina 16s rrna gene amplicon libraries were generated and sequenced by baseclear bv leiden the netherlands the dna extracts were sent to baseclear b v the netherlands for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing on the miseq platform for bacteria as explained in the supplementary material 2 4 2 sanger sequencing primers targeting the planctomycetes community were used namely pla40f cggcrtggattaggcatg pla46f ggattaggcatgcaagtc 1378r cggtgtgtacaaggcccgggaacg and 1492r tacggytaccttgttacgactt the amplification products were purified as indicated in supplementary material and were sent to lgc genomics germany for sanger sequencing 2 5 the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a even though only snapshot views on the kinetics and stoichiometry of thermophilic nitritation and anammox are available a first cost assessment was performed to evaluate which factors could render thermophilic pn a economically interesting the chosen source of wastewater was high temperature 50 c sludge reject water originating from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sewage sludge capital and operational expenditure capex and opex were compared for its mesophilic 30 c and thermophilic 50 c pn a treatment typical influent and effluent characteristics from full scale mesophilic treatment of sludge digestion reject water were assumed for both table s 1 lackner et al 2014 the treatment plant consisted of a continuously fed single sludge reactor tank at a biomass concentration of 4 kg vss m 3 a lamella separator was installed for sludge retention with a mixed liquor recycle stream back to the reactor tank whereas the produced biomass was wasted via a waste flow to a centrifuge even though in practice sludge wasting from a sidestream pn a occurs only on limited occasions and is usually sent back to the digester and mainstream treatment unit this economic assessment incorporated the cost for wasting the produced sludge to see what the difference would be between mesophilic and thermophilic pn a in the mesophilic pn a scenario a cooling installation was added to the design to lower the temperature of the thermophilic sludge reject water applied kinetics are summarized in supplementary material table s 2 capex involved cooling installations only for the mesophilic scenario civil works equipment mechanical and electrical works piping working hours and profit risk opex comprised cooling sludge thickening electricity consumption centrifuge chemicals aeration pumping mixing sludge disposal personnel analyses and maintenance all details on data and assumptions linked to influent characteristics kinetics process design and operation and depreciation can be found in supplementary material section s 3 process diagrams of the mesophilic and thermophilic scenario along with several process parameters can also be found in supplementary material section s 3 3 figure s 4 and s 5 3 results discussion 3 1 adaptation and characterization in a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr at 48 c in a first phase a biofilm based reactor was chosen to achieve a sufficiently high biomass retention implemented as a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr the fbbr inoculated with mesophilic pn a granules was subjected to a loading rate of 276 18 mg ntot l 1 d 1 at a temperature of 37 5 c after 3 days of temperature increase to 38 1 c low concentrations of nitrite accumulated 1 5 0 6 mg n l 1 figure s 1 after which the temperature increase was stopped and the loading rate was lowered to 200 mg ntot l 1 d 1 in order to prevent substrate accumulation the in situ batch activity measurements showed a decreasing maximum total nitrogen removal rate vrrntot max for the first 26 days fig 1 on day 39 vrrntot max did not decrease relative to the previous vrrntot max determination after which the daily temperature increase of 0 05 0 01 c d 1 was resumed the ratios no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed are common indicators of the anammox nitrogen stoichiometry with reported values of 1 15 1 32 and 0 16 0 26 g n g 1 n respectively lotti et al 2014c strous et al 1999b the no2 removed nh4 removed ratio in the fbr remained at 1 16 0 09 g n g 1 n as long as the temperature was below 43 c additionally the nitrate production was lower than expected from anammox stoichiometry during the first 40 days the no3 produced nh4 removed ratio was 0 02 0 02 g n g 1 n at a temperature of 38 1 c this points towards endogenous denitrification i e decay products in the reactor acting as electron donors for nitrate reduction as some members of the inoculum microbial community depending on oxygen and or organics likely could not survive under the newly imposed anoxic autotrophic conditions wang et al 2015 after this start up phase the performance of the fbbr was stable at temperatures up to 43 c with limited nitrite accumulation and a vrrntot max of 703 212 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 1 and figure s 1 from day 40 onwards the no3 produced nh4 removed ratio was higher at 0 12 0 02 g n g 1 n but still below the typically reported range for anammox from 43 c onwards total nitrogen removal rate in the reactor vrrntot 45 13 mg n l 1 d 1 and relative nitrate production 0 14 0 06 g n g 1 n remained low with a no2 removed nh4 removed ratio of 1 17 0 30 g n g 1 n the linear temperature increase was maintained until 48 c after which the activity increased again with a vrrntot max of 529 103 mg n l 1 d 1 the increase in anammox activity was accompanied by an increase in nitrate production to 0 20 0 03 g n g 1 n which is within the typically reported range possibly suggesting a lower contribution of denitrification the period of low activity could be the consequence of low initial numbers of the thermophilic anammox species that took over 100 days to provide a measurable activity from the beginning of the linear t increase the no2 removed nh4 removed ratio remained stable at 1 03 0 11 g n g 1 n at thermophilic temperatures slightly below the literature values overall stable operation for over 200 days was achieved at 48 c key to the successful selection for thermophilic anammox bacteria or adaptation of mesophilic anammox bacteria to thermophilic conditions was possibly the slow temperature increase allowing the microorganisms to adapt to changing conditions previous studies investigated temperature shocks and found that for example overheating from 35 to 48 c for 1 h resulted in anammox bacteria damage and death in an irreversible process with recovery requiring two weeks of operation back at 35 c liu et al 2015 another study examined the effect of a stepwise change of temperature between 35 and 46 c on an anammox sequencing batch reactor and found that it caused lysis of anammox cells after which almost no activity was found back the activity recovered over a period of about 20 days and subsequently increased again after restoring the initial temperature of 35 c isanta et al 2015 it was also found that thermophilic anammox bacteria could not be selected at 55 c from industrial coke oven wastewater sludges toh et al 2002 as opposed to the temperature shocks in previous studies this study imposed a slow temperature increase lasting over 200 days which enabled the development of a thermophilic anammox community with sustained activity up to 48 c 3 2 stoichiometry and kinetics in membrane bioreactors mbr at 50 c after obtaining anammox activity at 48 c in the fbbr part of the culture was used to inoculate two membrane bioreactors operated at 50 c mbr1 and mbr2 cultivating anammox bacteria in these mbr enabled homogeneous sampling for the determination of biomass concentration which was not feasible in the fbbr this enabled the determination of several kinetic parameters being the maximum biomass specific anammox activity and the net growth rate μnet within 35 days a high total nitrogen removal rate of 1 8 g n l 1 d 1 was achieved in mbr1 with no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed of 1 14 0 16 and 0 22 0 05 g n g 1 n respectively consistent with known mesophilic anammox stoichiometry fig 2 a the obtained volumetric rates were about a factor 3 higher than a previous study achieving anammox activity at 50 c in a bioreactor using salt amendment for 2 weeks 0 53 0 23 g n l 1 d 1 zhang et al 2018 the increasing anammox activity during the first 35 days of mbr1 operation was used to estimate the net growth rate μnet the result of the actual growth rate and the decay rate over the activity increase substrate levels were 28 7 15 5 mg nh4 n l 1 and 12 3 17 9 mg no2 n l 1 however the affinity indices of this culture were not known so it is not sure that the anammox bacteria were growing at their maximum rate μmax nonetheless μnet is a valuable parameter providing insight into the achievable thermophilic anammox growth rate three different approaches were used for the estimation of μnet at 50 c first an exponential model was fitted to the experimental data using the least squares method fig 2 b yielding a μnet of 0 075 d 1 r2 94 secondly the total nitrogen removal rate was linearized by log transformation and fitted by a linear equation using the least squares method fig 2 c van der star et al 2007 resulting in a μnet of 0 12 0 01 d 1 r2 92 thirdly μnet was calculated at every time interval 1 laureni et al 2015 rendering an average value of 0 19 0 18 d 1 figure s 2 1 μ n e t l n r n t o t t n 1 r n t o t t n t n 1 t n each method yielded a different μnet so caution should be used when using the estimated values nonetheless the obtained μnet range of 0 075 0 19 d 1 is after rescaling to 20 c arrhenius function with theta 1 1 seuntjens et al 2018 comparable to growth rates of anammox bacteria measured under mesophilic conditions table 1 when comparing reactors with high sludge retention time srt the obtained μnet in this study is relatively high compared to growth rates for mesophilic anammox bacteria the high growth rates observed by lotti et al 2015 were obtained by imposing a low srt to the bioreactor in mbr2 operated for 100 days the biomass was kept in suspension and the biomass specific anammox activity could be determined anammox stoichiometry was observed in mbr2 with no2 removed nh4 removed and no3 produced nh4 removed ratios of 1 10 0 13 and 0 19 0 03 g n g 1 n respectively the actual biomass specific total nitrogen removal rates rx ntot in the reactor 0 52 0 26 g n g 1 vss d 1 figure s 3 b a maximum biomass specific anammox activity of 1 1 0 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 1 8 0 2 g nrem g 1 vss d 1 was obtained from an in situ activity measurement these rates are higher than previously reported from reactors operated at srt 45d under mesophilic conditions and are comparable to those obtained by lotti et al 2015 in a reactor operated at very short srt 3 d table 1 however when considering the anammox bacteria abundance and after rescaling to 20 c arrhenius function with theta 1 1 seuntjens et al 2018 this rate is in the lower range of reported values table 1 the biomass yield can be considered as the ratio of growth rate 0 075 0 19 d 1 and the biomass specific anammox activity 1 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 this results in an estimated biomass yield of 0 07 and 0 17 g vss g 1 nh4 n which is comparable to the reported 0 12 g vss g 1 nh4 n strous et al 1998 in this study biomass was only extracted for occasional sampling rendering an estimated srt of 300 days it remains to be investigated whether a shorter srt control would render higher thermophilic activities as well 3 3 a potentially new thermophilic anammox taxon 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial community in the fbbr inoculum and in the reactor at 43 and 48 c operation days 120 and 390 fig 3 b and c the anammox bacteria in the inoculum were classified as candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia and accounted only for 1 5 and 1 3 of the microbial community respectively at 43 c no ca jettenia was detected whereas ca brocadia was present at a relative bacterial abundance of 2 1 and was the most abundant anammox species the loss of ca jettenia could be attributed to its reported temperature range of activity being slightly lower than reactor conditions 20 42 5 c ali et al 2015 the activity of ca brocadia on the other hand has been confirmed at a wider range of temperatures 25 45 c oshiki et al 2011 thermophilic conditions 48 c resulted in a bacterial community highly enriched in a ca brocadia related anammox species 46 4 of the total bacterial community the reactor conditions anoxic conditions and autotrophic medium and the increasing temperature likely resulted in the selection and high abundance of this putative thermophilic anammox species previous research has also shown that a temperature shock on an anammox reactor resulted in an anammox enriched community after a recovery process as opposed to a very diverse microbial community before the temperature shock isanta et al 2015 parallel to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the thermophilic community sanger sequencing was performed on the dna sample of the fbbr at 48 c using primers targeting the planctomycetes community three out of four sequence pairs could be merged into contigs all yielding a 96 97 similarity to an uncultured anammox bacterium from a geothermal spring in japan hirayama et al 2005 two of the sanger sequences pla46f 1492r and pla40f 1492r were used to construct a phylogenetic tree comparing the obtained sanger sequences to all anammox bacteria reference sequences the closest cultured relatives were ca brocadia caroliniensis 94 95 similarity and ca brocadia anammoxidans 94 95 similarity fig 3a considering the currently applied sequence similarity thresholds of 95 for genus and 98 7 for species rossi tamisier et al 2015 we hypothesize that the community harboured a new anammox species however further research is necessary to establish its phylogenetic novelty and to attribute the necessary functional genes to this planctomycete to validate its association with the observed ammonium oxidation both rhodocyclaceae and rbg1 become abundant at 43 c at the same time that the anammox activity as observed through in situ tests collapses the switch from a mesophilic temperature region to moderately thermophilic conditions caused a change in the whole microbial community in which mesophiles die or are washed out while microorganisms that tolerate higher temperatures take over the rhodocyclaecae that became enriched at 43 c are affiliated to the genus denitratisoma that seem to have thrived by performing denitrification on the decay products of collapsing mesophiles the rbg 1 are affiliated to the genus of zixibacteria castelle et al 2013 it has been found in anoxic sections in anoxic sediments in the sulfate methane transition zone baker et al 2015 and has been suggested to scavenge reduced carbon products it is capable of nitrate and nitric oxide reduction as well as of sulfate reduction momper et al 2017 it seems plausible that it contributed to the denitrification of biomass decay products during this t transition period just like rhodocyclaceae 3 4 practical outlook the presented proof of principle of thermophilic anammox biotechnology opens up a new route for thermophilic biological nitrogen removal namely through pn a thermophilic nitrification has been obtained in lab scale bioreactors and its kinetics have been determined elaborately vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b setting the foundation for research on suppressing nitrite oxidation to obtain partial nitritation and integrating with thermophilic anammox in a single sludge bioreactor thermophilic ammonia oxidation is dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa vandekerckhove et al 2019b only two heterotrophic and one autotrophic thermophilic aob has been isolated so far itoh et al 2013 mevel and prieur 2000 shimaya and hashimoto 2011 kinetic comparison between thermophilic aoa and mesophilic aob revealed that thermophilic aoa had a higher biomass yield lower biomass specific ammonia oxidation rate lower growth rate and higher substrate affinity vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b this first demonstration of long term cultivation of anammox bacteria under thermophilic conditions with volumetric activities and observed growth rates which are comparable to those reported under mesophilic conditions table 1 suggests the feasibility of the application of anammox to warm temperature the obtained maximum biomass specific anammox activity in this study indicates that similar rates might be possible in thermophilic compared to mesophilic sidestream anammox treatment of for example reject water from thermophilic sludge digestion de vrieze et al 2016 however more research is needed to evaluate the feasibility of thermophilic pn a first the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a should be compared to current practices of cooling thermophilic digestates prior to mesophilic pn a secondly more information on the anammox biomass yield and decay rate is necessary to enable a better comparison to mesophilic kinetics thirdly the effect of organic carbon ph temperature fluctuations free ammonia free nitrous acid recurrent dissolved oxygen exposure and real wastewater matrices on the anammox activity should be investigated as stepping stones towards thermophilic pn a fourthly considering the high anammox activity compared to thermophilic aoa activity 1 1 vs ca 0 2 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 the obtainable nitritation rate could be the limiting factor in a pn a system and requires further research however in mesophilic pn a systems nitritation is the limiting factor as well finally mesophilic reactor configurations implemented in practice include moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr granular sludge processes and sequencing batch reactors sbr lackner et al 2014 considering the configurations tested in this study fbbr and mbr there is a need to evaluate more practically relevant reactors to facilitate the implementation 3 5 the economic prospect of thermophilic pn a even though limited data is available on the kinetics and stoichiometry of thermophilic nitritation and anammox a first cost assessment was performed to evaluate which factors could render thermophilic pn a economically interesting the chosen source of wastewater was high temperature 50 c sludge reject water originating from thermophilic anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sewage sludge capital and operational expenditure capex and opex were compared for its mesophilic 30 c and thermophilic 50 c pn a treatment both scenarios showed a similar total treatment cost with thermophilic pn a cost only 0 03 kg 1 n or 2 5 above the mesophilic one opex dominated the total treatment cost amounting to 73 and 75 for the thermophilic and mesophilic scenario respectively table 2 capex and opex associated with influent cooling for the mesophilic scenario contributed only 5 1 to the total treatment cost rendering limited savings attributed to avoided cooling for thermophilic treatment the extra costs for thermophilic pn a were mainly attributed to a higher reactor capex due to the need for insulation and an increased opex for sludge disposal the extra cost for insulation is inevitable the slightly higher sludge disposal cost 9 5 was caused by the higher observed biomass production mainly because thermophilic aoa have a higher maximum biomass yield ymax and lower decay rate kd than mesophilic aob vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b however knowledge on the ymax and kd of thermophilic versus mesophilic ammonia oxidizing organisms is still limited vandekerckhove et al 2019a 2019b which is also the case for anammox bacteria rendering the need for a more thorough investigation to accurately predict the sludge production difference also as sludge from a sidestream pn a is usually sent back to the anaerobic digester and to the mainstream treatment unit the actual impact on overall sludge disposal cost will be more limited currently the expected thermophilic nitritation rate is below the rates observed in full scale mesophilic pn a systems however if the thermophilic nitritation rate could be increased to the mesophilic rate and thermophilic and mesophilic sludge production would be the same the total treatment cost for thermophilic pn a would be 2 3 cheaper than mesophilic pn a as current knowledge on thermophilic nitritation is still limited further research could focus on obtaining higher rates by investigating different reactor conditions or other microbial species with higher conversion rates overall the first economic estimation highlighted that thermophilic pn a could be cost competitive to mesophilic pn a this means that warm wastewaters for example reject water from thermophilic digestion would not need cooling prior to mesophilic pn a but could be treated thermophilically in a cost effective way thermophilic anaerobic digestion obtains higher conversion rates higher biogas yield higher reduction of pathogens and contributes to higher energy and nutrient recovery compared to mesophilic digestion de vrieze et al 2016 currently the use of cooling equipment prior to mesophilic treatment is prone to failure when the cooling does not work a temperature shock would inhibit the pn a process and result in treatment failure considering the importance of preventing treatment failure and preventing excessive amount of reactive nitrogen to be sent back to the mainstream treatment unit or to the environment thermophilic pn a would be a valuable alternative to the current practices also thermophilic conditions prevent the growth of mesophilic pathogens and enables a more efficient hygienization of the wastewater lapara and alleman 1999 for example legionella grows in biofilms in wastewater treatment plants under mesophilic conditions 25 45 c thermophilic treatment would prevent growth of such pathogens caicedo et al 2019 further research and development on thermophilic nitritation and anammox stoichiometry and kinetics should enable a more accurate assessment 4 conclusions long term thermophilic anammox reactor operation was demonstrated for the first time both for an attached and suspended growth in the fbbr with maximum total nitrogen removal rates up to 0 62 g n l 1 d 1 48 c an adapted enrichment community was obtained by imposing a linear temperature increase 0 05 0 07 c d 1 to a mesophilic pn a inoculum kinetic characterization in subsequent mbr operation at 50 c revealed an estimated net growth rate between 0 075 and 0 19 d 1 and a maximum biomass specific anammox activity of 1 1 0 1 g nh4 n g 1 vss d 1 when taking into account anammox bacteria abundance and rescaling to 20 c however these rates were relatively low compared to mesophilic anammox in all reactors the nitrogen stoichiometry known for mesophilic anammox was observed no2 removed nh4 removed 1 03 1 14 g n g 1 n no3 produced nh4 removed 0 20 0 22 g n g 1 n amplicon and sanger sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed planctomycetes members with only 94 95 similarity to brocadia anammoxidans and b caroliniensis accounting for 45 of the adapted thermophilic bacterial community in the fbbr a first economic estimation revealed that thermophilic pn a could be cost competitive to mesophilic pn a this novel process may present opportunities for
