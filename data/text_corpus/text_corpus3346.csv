16730,the wish for rapid degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants along with the increase concern with respect to greenhouse effect and bioenergy methane production have created urgent needs to explore synchronous regulation approach microbial electrolysis cell was established under four degressive cathode potential settings from 0 15v to 0 60v to regulate γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch reduction while ch4 cumulation in this study the synchronous facilitation of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation was occurred in 0 15v treatment while the facilitation of γ hch reductive removal together with the inhibition of ch4 cumulation was showed in 0 30v treatment electrochemical patterns via cyclic voltammetry and morphological performances via scanning electron microscopy illustrated bioelectrostimulation promoted redox reactions and helped to construct mature biofilms located on bioelectrodes also bioelectrostimulated regulation pronouncedly affected the bacteria and archaeal communities and subsequently assembled distinctly core sensitive responders across bioanode biocathode and plankton clostridum longilinea and methanothrix relatively accumulated in the plankton and cupriavidus and methanospirillum and perimonas and nonoarcheaum in biocathode and bioanode respectively while pseudomonas stenotrophomonas methanoculleus and methanosarcina were diffusely enriched microbial interactions in the ecological network were more complicated in 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potential treatments coincident with the increasement of γ hch reduction the co existence between putative dechlorinators and methanogens was less significant in 0 30v treatment when compared to that in 0 15v treatment relevant with the variations of ch4 cumulation in all this study firstly corroborated the availability to synchronously regulate γ hch reductive removal and methanogenesis besides it paves an advanced approach controlling γ hch reduction in cooperation with ch4 cumulation of which to achieve γ hch degradation facilitation along with biogas ch4 production promotion with 0 15v cathode potential during anaerobic γ hch contaminated wastewater digestion or to realize γ hch degradation facilitation with the inhibition of ch4 emission with 0 30v cathode potential for an all win remediation in γ hch polluted anaerobic environment such as paddy soil graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic γ hch reduction ch4 cumulation microbial electrolysis cell synchronous regulation 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds cops have been widely used for agricultural and industrial developments in the past decade years because of the thermal and chemical stability such as pentachlorophenol as pesticide xu et al 2019 trichlorophenol as leather antiseptics lin et al 2019a some of them are toxic recalcitrant meanwhile under excessive impertinently usage leading to ubiquitous distributions in groundwater soils wetlands and sludge even after longtime forbidden which adversely pose a threat to environment and human health chen et al 2019a zhu et al 2019a environmental removal of cops via anaerobic reductive dechlorination has been considered as one of the most crucial bioremediation routes owing to the high effective eco friendly and cost competitive advantages cheng et al 2019 the reductive removal of cops have been verified as essentially step by step electron transfer processes in which cops are dechlorinated through accepting electrons xu et al 2015 the recapitulative reaction of typical cop reduction is showed as r c l x h e r h c l x 1 c l microbial electrolysis cell mec as one of the promising bioelectrostimulation technology with sufficient intermediate h2 supply and inexhaustible electron support has attracted intensive attention in recent years adekunle et al 2019 it showed great capacity in the terms of promoting cop reduction including chlorobenzene ying et al 2021 chlorophenols leon fernandez et al 2021 and chloramphenicol liang et al 2019 worth noting methane ch4 is also substantially cumulated during this process for example zhu et al 2020a demonstrated ch4 took up 82 0 biogas in 2 4 6 trichlorophenol contaminated mec system and the portion of ch4 increased to 83 8 with granular sludge also added yang et al 2021 inferred ch4 essimion was intensified during lindane reductive removal under the loss of microbial diversity in paddy soil as a ch4 mass produced process under reductive proceeded reducing condition methanogenesis employs methanogens to degrade various organic biomass which is also a terminal electron accepting process boss and cristinzio 2014 zhu et al 2019b the recapitulative reaction of methanogenesis is c o 2 8 h 8 e c h 4 2 h 2 o xu et al 2015 and cheng et al 2021 have confirmed the co occurrence of cop dechlorination and methanogenesis in theory as the redox potentials required by cop dechlorination and ch4 production were overlapped the synchronous coupling between dechlorination and methanogenesis p 0 05 have been confirmed in most cases choi et al 2021 zhu et al 2019a and the acceleration of dechlorination generally co occurred with the facilitation of methanogenesis was concluded among 337 observations from 68 articles as reviewed by cheng et al 2021 and also revealed with zero valent iron supplement zhang et al 2020 the electron h2 or other vital cofactors like vitamin b12 produced by methanogens could be delivered to cop by reduced electron carriers thereby participated in the core dechlorination process kumar et al 2021 in addition the expects towards the regulation of ch4 cumulation varied including the wish to increase biogas ch4 amount during anaerobic digestion of cop contaminated wastewater as ch4 shows great capacity as the sustainable energy xu et al 2020 and the urgency to inhibit ch4 cumulation in cop contaminated paddy soil as paddy fields account for around a quarter of anthropogenic ch4 emission to the atmosphere that contribute to the exacerbation of climate change conrad 2020 the increasing demand of elimination of cop environmental persistence as well as the control of ch4 cumulation according to different situations alert the necessity of focus on ch4 cumulation during cop reductive removal weatherill et al 2018 and subsequently search for the possibility to synchronous regulation which are to the best of our knowledge received less study before in addition mec possesses tremendous potential to support unfavorable biological reactions energetically with biocatalyzed electrodes because of the advantage of reducing energy barrier by the supply of an external electric field logan et al 2019 briefly it employs enriched electrode microbiomes to catalyze oxidative reactions in anode and reductive reactions in cathode jiang et al 2018 and at the biocathode the reduction of h to molecular h2 takes place contributing to overcome the lack of electron donors which is majorly caused by the low h2 solubility or electron scramble of competitive metabolic process chen et al 2019b it has been demonstrated that both the electron transfer among biofilm microorganisms and the rate and extent of cop dechlorination and methanogenesis highly relied on the applied cathode potential bajracharya et al 2016 for example the enriched electrode and planktonic communities exhibited different structures among five redox potential between 400 and 750mv v s ag agcl lam et al 2019 contrasting assembly of microbes has been verified under different cathodic electrostimulation with particular microbial structures subsequently formed across anode cathode and suspension which in return accounted for the variations in cop reductive removal and ch4 production chen et al 2019c with the setting of gradient cathodic potentials it provides advanced approach testing the variations of ch4 cumulation along with cop reductive removal with the purpose to facilitate cop removal while regulate ch4 cumulation in this study bio mec system was conducted under cathode potential settings of 0 15v 0 30v 0 45v and 0 60v γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch the typical brad spectrum cop with insecticidal activity yuan et al 2021a was selected as a representative of cops its physicochemical properties were showed in supporting information si table s1 a mixed dechlorinating consortium enriched in our laboratory for more than two years from polychlorinated biphenyl pcb polluted paddy soil was considered as the electrolyte in addition the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was defined on the basis of kokkoli et al 2018 in order to present the extent of ch4 cumulation in all this study aims to 1 find out the treatments under which γ hch reductive removal was facilitated 2 investigate the relations between γ hch facilitated reductive removal and ch4 cumulation in response to different bioelectrostimulation 3 demonstrate the community structure and composition across bioanode biocathode and plankton with identification of sensitive microbes and core functional groups involved 4 delineate the underlying electro microbial mediated mechanisms it was hypothesized that 1 γ hch reductive removal was coupled with methanogenesis 2 the application of mec would alter the symbiosis and 3 the different cathodic stimulation would induce peculiarities of microbial composition and structure across bioanode biocathode and plankton which then altogether underpin the changed γ hch removal and ch4 cumulation as well as their synergistic effect 2 materials methods 2 1 inocula and medium the microbial consortium used as the inocula was originally obtained from pcb polluted paddy soil from taizhou zhejiang province china detailed information of the microbial mixed culture enrichment process was described in si section 1 after acclimatization for more than two years the culture could stably dechlorinate 50 mg l 1 pcb with the rate of 6 01 μ mol cl l 1 day 1 subsequently after several successive transfers with the replacement of target pollutant to γ hch the microbial mixed culture also showed stable capacity of dechlorinating 50 mg l 1 γ hch by utilizing 10 mm of sodium lactate as the electron donor the detailed γ hch removal result was shown in figs s1 s2 the mineral salt medium applied in this study was

potential maintaining all of the potential data reported herein were against she 2 3 reactor acclimation and operation all the systems with different cathode potential settings were firstly operated in same acclimation procedure to keep the biofilms located on electrodes constant chen et al 2019b after sterilizing at 121 c 15 psi for 30 min and purging with n2 99 purity for 15 min to remove oxygen and maintain anaerobic condition the systems were initially fed with γ hch 50 mg l 1 sodium lactate 10 mm the inocula 10 ml and the mineral salt medium 90 ml for 4 days with one of the applied potentials 0 30v to continuously develop biofilms once γ hch dechlorination activity was observed the electrolyte was discharged and the system was replenished after repeated inoculation for about four times until γ hch reductive removal was stably maintained the microbial inocula terminated and the electrolyte exchange continued for another round to strength the maturity of biofilms lin et al 2019a the whole acclimation process was persistently cyclically operated for approximately 60 d until the stable current variation had emerged fig s3 all the solution replacement was performed in an anaerobic workstation a35 don whitley scientific limited england treatments were simultaneously started up with gradient decrease of cathode potentials including 1 0 15v 2 0 30v 3 0 45v and 4 0 60v

sterilized where both the negative potential and inocula application were abandoned were simultaneously conducted besides 10 mm sodium lactate was separately fed for each treatment to avoid any effect of deficiency in carbon source and electron donors each mec was run as quadruplicate and all the experiments were performed at around 25 c during incubation treatments were evenly sampled with every quadruplicate bottle at hours 0 3 6 33 50 69 84 and 96 2 4 analytical methods the γ hch 99 pure was purchased from sigma aldrich co st louis usa sodium lactate 98 was purchased from macklin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china all other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the concentration of γ hch was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms after extracted with n hexane and dehydrated with sodium sulfate anhydrous based on the method of yuan et al 2021a the concentration of co2 and ch4 in the headspace were determined using gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid according to xu et al 2015 detailed procedures of extraction and detection can be found in si section 2 scanning electron microscopy sem equipped with an energy dispersion spectroscope was used for the observation of microbial morphology at the end of incubation the anode cathode suspension in 0 30v treatment as well as the suspension in ck were sampled and pretreated for morphological characterization cyclic voltammetry cv of each mec reactor was performed using the electrochemical workstation bio logic vmp3 claix france equipped with three electrode system the bioanode or biocathode was set as a working electrode and an ag agcl electrode was used as the reference electrode all the tests were operated with 5 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs as catholyte under ph 7 2 the cv curves were recorded from 0 2v to 1 0v and from 1 0v to 0 2v for bioanode and biocathode at the scanning rate of 2 mv s respectively detailed procedures regarding sem and cv tests showed in si section 3 the microbial community in bioanode biocathode and plankton among all treatments that were collected at the end of incubation were analyzed by 16s rrna illumina miseq sequencing all sequences have been submitted to ncbi sequence read archive sra database with accession number srp320113 for the bacteria and srp320084 for the archaea the quantitative real time pcr qpcr was subsequently performed to quantify the copy numbers of dhc typical organochloride respiring gene and mcra synthesis of methyl coenzyme

sequencing and taxonomic classification and qpcr were demonstrated in detail in si section 4 2 5 statistical calculation statistical analyses and graphics were conducted using spss 19 0 origin pro 2018 and r 3 4 3 in brief one way analysis of variance anova was calculated to compare variations among treatments with statistical significance screened at 5 level shannon index was used to measure bacterial and archaeal alpha diversity principal coordinate analysis pcoa and permutational multivariate analyses of variance permanova based on bray curtis distance matrix were conducted to assess the difference in community composition among all non sterilized treatments statistical analyses of significantly differential operational taxonomic units otus abundance were performed using r deseq2 package pearson correlation between microbes with crucial environmental variables including γ hch degradation efficiency γ hch and the extent of ch4 cumulation ch4 co2 was revealed using r corrplot package bipartite network visualization was applied using cytoscape 3 7 1 considering detected otus as node connectivity chen et al 2018b molecular ecological networks were constructed with the random matrix theory based interface approach the nodes in the network represented sensitive responded otus for bacteria and archaea and the edges that connected these nodes represented correlation between otus the constructed networks were visualized by gephi 0 9 2 3 results 3 1 variations of γ hch reductive removal and ch4 cumulation the mixed dechlorinating consortium with the capacity of degrading γ hch in 35 7 within 4 days fig s2 was applied as the inocula in mec to clarify the effect of cathodic potential stimulation on γ hch reductive removal meanwhile to reveal the capacity to synchronously regulate ch4 cumulation the result of 9 85 γ hch was dissipated in abiotic mec confirmed pure electrochemical process played a neglectable role during cop decomposition fig 1 a a compared to the ck with open circuit the efficiency of γ hch reductive removal was significantly increased in the treatments with cathode potentials of 0 15v and 0 30v but significantly decreased in 0 45v and 0 60v treatments with 0 30v shown as the most optimal cathodic potential that induced the highest γ hch degradation rate 61 47 fig 1a a the accumulation of ch4 showed great differences in response to the contrasting potentials compared to the ck it was increased to 4 95 mmol at 0 15v and reached the maximum 15 76mmol at 0 45v cathode potential while remained marginal changes in 0 30v and 0 60v fig 1a b as for co2 accumulation no significant differences existed in all treatments except that under abiotic conditions fig 1a c besides the extent of ch4 cumulation representing as the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was painted out the extent of ch4 cumulation was remarkably increased in 0 45v mec system as the indicator was significantly increased by one order of magnitude when compared to the ck from 0 003 to 0 067 p 0 05 it was also significantly improved by three times in 0 15v treatment p 0 05 while remained no changes in 0 30v and 0 60v when compared to ck p 0 05 fig 1b 3 2 electrochemical performances as indicated by cv curves the cv is a widely employed potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement to reflect the electrochemical distinction of biofilm with the use of which the redox variation of bioanode and biocathode can be intuitively obtained fig 1c the result that no recognizable peak was observed from the clean and sterilized electrodes guaranteed the precision of cv curves fig s4 regardless of differences of applied cathode potentials current was slightly increased in the bioanode when relative to the abiotic anode demonstrating that electron transfer was increased and the corresponding oxidation was promoted under bioelectrochemical stimulation fig 1c a besides it also indicated the microbes located on bioanode played predominant roles in electron donating process since the abiotic anode only provided subtle electrons no remarkable peak was observed at around 0 35v in the absence of γ hch fig s5 while it went significant in mec systems with γ hch addition fig 1c b kracke et al 2015 indicated the peak at 0 557 0 237v was identical to that of electrochemically active biofilm that was vital to electron transfer the peak of 0 35v was very close to the potential of the outer membrane redox proteins suggesting its potential relative to outer membrane cytochromes zhang et al 2018 the reduction peak at 0 35v was observed steeper in the treatments of 0 15v and 0 30v when compared to the abiotic ck relevant to the facilitation of γ hch reduction in these treatments fig 1c b in compassion with the abiotic cathode two obvious reduction peaks were found at around 0 6v peak a and 0 8v peak b and the difference between each mec system was significant peaks a and b were shifted in response to cathodic potentials showed as peak e and f in 0 15v treatment while peak g and h in 0 45v treatment also the peak intensity was on average of 1 51 and 2 51 times higher in 0 15v and 0 45v treatment respectively which demonstrated that the introducing of mec at 0 15v and 0 45v cathodic potentials facilitated electron transfer paralleled with the same tendency in ch4 cumulation by comparision the peak a and b of abiotic electrode and that of 0 30v electrode peak c and d it could be found that both the peak area and the peak current had a small difference fig 1c b collectively the electro chemical evidences indicated the optimal cathode potential of 0 30v for the achievement of facilitated γ hch reduction meanwhile inhibited ch4 cumulation while that of 0 15v for the synchronous enhancement of both γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation respectively fig 1 3 3 responses of microbial community across bioanode biocathode and plankton showed by sem images of the representative mec at 0 30v large numbers of microbial aggregates were adhered tightly on the surface of graphite rods that evidenced the formation of biofilm on the surface of both anode and cathode fig 2 a besides the distinct differences of morphological formed between bioelectrochemical treatment and the ck also suggested the reassembly of microbial community in response to mec application responses in microbial composition of both bacteria and archaea in terms of alpha diversity and at phyla level were described in si section 4 in brief the shannon index was remarkably increased in bacteria and archaea across bioanode biocathode and plankton among all mec systems fig 2b a and fig 2b b for bacteria and archaea respectively suggesting the enrichment effect of microbes under bioelectrochemical stimulation proteobacteria was the most abundant in plankton in all treatments while proteobacteria together with firmicutes were dominate bacteria in bioelectrode biofilms euryarchaeota crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeota were the dominant abundant phyla accounting for over 99 of all the archaeal sequences fig 2c a and fig 2c b for bacteria and archaea respectively pcoa results showed the strikingly different microbial community between clusters of electro stimulated samples and the ck p 0 05 suggesting the electro stimulation remarkably altered microbial structure of both bacteria and archaea fig 3 a a and fig 3a b respectively in addition communities from bioanode biocathode and plankton were separated well with each other further indicating their differentiation in microbial habitats with specific sets of microbes with the use of indicator species analysis in terms of bipartite network the significant otu associations across bioanode biocathode and plankton could be vividly distinguished chen et al 2019b for bacterial community a total of 202 out of 553 otus were shared and these genera were gathered in the center fig 3c a members of these bacteria included pseudomonas bacillus sedimentibacter and desulfovibrio which have been confirmed capable of dechlorinating cops or being electroactive and highly enriched in mec ammeri et al 2017 gacitua et al 2018 while 0 9 of total otus in archaeal community were found gathering together fig 3c b the majority of shared otus were affiliated with the genera such as methanobacterium methanosarcina methanocella methanoculleus and methanothermobacter among which the genera like methanobacterium and methanosarcina were reported capable of regulating dechlorination and methanogenesis synergistically and the genus like methanobacterium that was enriched on the electrode participated in interspecies h2 transfer gomes et al 2014 lin et al 2019b in addition statistical analyses of differentially abundant otus as comparison of those in the ck were subsequently conducted using r deseq 2 fig 3b with the application of mec 22 otus significantly increased while 12 otus significantly decreased within the relative abundance in bacterial community in bioanode and that were 25 increased and 15 decreased otus in biocathode and 19 and 23 in plankton respectively fig 3b a c as for archaeal community 106 notably enriched and 30 notably depleted otus were found in bioanode and that were 68 and 132 in biocathode and 199 and 175 in plankton respectively fig 3b d f in connection with electrochemical evidences it suggested the microbial community responded uniquely across bioanode biocathode and plankton towards the application of bioelectrostimulation and in return the exclusive groups were reassembled together contributing to the distinct redox based on these the otus that were supported by either shared in the center in bipartite network fig 3c or the noticeably changed showing in volcano plot fig 3b were screened out as the sensitive responders hereafter sotus 3 4 core functional groups participating in γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation bubble plots of sotus were painted out to visually demonstrate the changes of bacterial and archaeal relative abundance at genera level among different treatments fig 4 a pearson correlation of the relative abundance of sotus with environmental variables including γ hch reduction efficiency shown as γ hch and the extent of ch4 cumulation shown as ch4 co2 was simultaneously displayed fig 4b additionally net proportional changes in relative abundance in comparison with the ck were calculated to statistically reveal the effects of different cathode potential on the assembly of microbial community at family level fig s6 and fig s7 for bacteria and archaea respectively worth noting the relative abundance of typical obligate dechlorinator dehalococcoides was significantly decreased even to no detection under bioelectrostimulation when compared to the ck fig 4a a similarly the copy numbers of typical organochloride respiring gene dhc was also remarkably depleted in mec systems fig 4c a that suggested the irrelevance roles of typical obligate dechlorinators in this study the electro stimulation significantly promoted the enrichment of pseudomonas as its relative abundance increased 9 times and that of pseudomonadaceae the family increased by 11 on an average when compared to the ck fig 4a a and fig s6 yun et al 2018 wang et al 2014 reminiscent of the above result that the highest γ hch reduction appeared in 0 30v the relative abundance of pseudomonas showed the maximum in the same treatment fig 1b and fig 4a a in addition pseudomonas linked positive correlation with the indicator γ hch reduction efficiency in both bioanode biocathode and plankton fig 4b the relative abundance of stenotrophomonas was increased by an average of 26 4 and 21 9 in bioanode and biocathode respectively fig 4a a its relative abundance owned positively relevance with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode and biocathode fig 4b the relative abundance of cupriavidus was significantly increased with electro stimulation at 0 15v and 0 30v and reached the highest in 0 30v which was consistent with the facilitation of γ hch degradation fig 1b and fig 4a a meanwhile it showed positive relevance with γ hch reduction in biocathode but not in bioanode and plankton fig 4b petrimonas was remarkably enriched in bioanode as the relative abundance increased to an average of 2 79 given that the relative abundance of petrimonas owned positive relationships with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode the enriched petrimonas was thought helpful for both reductive processes in bioanode clostridium and longilinea were both positively correlated with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in plankton while linked inconspicuous and even negative relationship in bioanode and biocathode fig 4b the relative abundance of clostridium was significantly decreased by 1 55 and 1 65 in the treatments of 0 45v and 0 60v respectively in the plankton while barely unchanged in biocathode and bioanode when compared to the ck similarly longilinea was significantly depleted by 2 63 and 2 90 in 0 45v and 0 60v treatments respectively that was in conformity with the suppression of γ hch reductive removal in 0 45v and 0 60v fig 1b and fig 4a a although the relative abundance of acinetobacter occupied the majority in plankton in bio mec system when compared to the ck an average of 56 2 with the family moraxellaceae increased by 56 1 it revealed no noticeable relevance with γ hch reduction indicating its inactive role in γ hch removal in this study fig 4b and fig s6 similar plots were drawn for archaeal community fig 4a b and fig s7 the relative abundance of methanoculleus was significantly increased by an average of 5 19 and that of methanomicrobiaceae the family was increased to an average of 3 22 under electrochemical stimulation indicating the growth of this group was remarkably promoted with the application of mec given that methanospirillum positively linked with the extent of ch4 cumulation meanwhile the variation of its relative abundance was consistent with the change of ch4 cumulation in biocathode methanospirillum was speculated beneficial for methanogenesis in biocathode fig 1a fig 4b when compared to the ck the relative abundance of nanoarchaeum was significantly increased by 4 31 in bioanode and the relative abundance of methanothrix was significantly increased by 8 83 in plankton while remained merely unchanged in bioelectrodes methanothrix was found linking a positive relevance with ch4 cumulation in plankton fig 4b worth noting in spite of the difference of ch4 cumulation between 0 30v and 0 45v treatments no significant differences were observed related to the copy number of mcra gene fig 1 and 4c b and at 0 15v and 0 45v high abundance of mcra copy numbers further supported the high cumulation of ch4 in all the distinctly core sensitive responders across bioanode biocathode and plankton were identified further revealing the configuration role of bioelectrostimulation on the assembly i e the microbial community structure of bioelectrodes and plankton 3 5 effects of differed bioelectrostimulation on the network structure lastly we explored the co occurrence patterns of sotus in response to different bioelectrostimulation with core functional genera mapping out in the microbial networks fig 4d the obviously different topological properties indicated the great difference in microbial structure table s6 overall remarkably more abundant links and higher average degree and connectivity indicated a more complex microbial network ma et al 2016 the networks with 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potential possessed distinctly higher averaged clustering coefficient in comparison to that in the treatments of 0 45v and 0 60v correspondingly the average connectivity of network was higher in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments 16 85 and 14 47 respectively but lower in 0 45v and 0 60v 4 77 of both that demonstrated more complex network and closer relationship existed in treatments of 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potentials compared to other nodes pseudomonas owned higher degree and lower betweenness centrality value further confirming its keystone role in mec systems according to banerjee et al 2019 particularly the degree of nodes from the genus pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas significantly increased in 0 15v treatment and reached the highest in the 0 30v network 5 88 and 17 88 respectively besides pseudomonas and clostridium shared complex associations with both bacteria such as stenotrophenomonas and archaea such as methanoculleus and methanothrix in 0 15v and 0 30v networks suggesting their tight relationships with others in combination of the strongly positive relation between the relative abundance of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas and the indicator of γ hch reduction efficiency it indicated the abundance and connectivity of core functional groups accounted for the facilitated γ hch reduction in 0 15v and 0 30v bioelectrostimulation fig 1b fig 4d noticeable increase in negative interactions was appeared in 0 30v treatment 24 4 when compared to that in 0 15v treatment 20 7 also the core groups with dechlorinating functions linked dimly positive even negative relations with methanogens in 0 30v treatment like clostridium negatively linked with methanospirillum in 0 30v network in addition core functional archaea like methanospirillum and methanoculleus species occupied the highest betweenness centrality in 0 45v network consistent with their increased abundance and diverse physiologies further explaining the occurrence of highest ch4 accumulation in 0 45v mec system 4 discussion 4 1 coupling of γ hch reduction to methanogenesis in this study the remarkably differed patterns of γ hch reductive removal ch4 cumulation as well as the underlying interrelation were revealed in different mec systems by supplying gradient of constant cathode potentials of 0 15v 0 30v 0 45v and 0 60v the noticeably enhanced γ hch reductive removal was obtained with 0 30v cathodic potential along with the control of ch4 cumulation when compared to the ck the synchronous enhancement of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation was appeared with 0 15 cathodic potential fig 1 the reduction peak at 0 35v from cv curve in mec cathode with the addition of γ hch was assigned to outer membrane cyochromones that were vital to electron transfer zhang et al 2018 fig 1c the suitable potential applied to cathode could promote microbial oxidoreductase of electron transfer while the lower i e 0 45v and 0 60v in this study could have an undesirable impact on the microorganism activity the steepness of the 0 35v peak in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments might be ascribed to the promotion of outer membrane cytochromes secretion which then contributed to the facilitation of γ hch reduction fig 1b kobayashi et al 2017 indicated the reduction peak at 0 65v corresponded to electromethanogens that accepted electrons directly and the peak lower than 0 65v was identical to hydrogenotrophic electromethanogens the peak at 0 6v and 0 8v could then be assigned to methanogens according to fu et al 2015 at the setting of 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potentials methanogens tended to accept electrons directly as the theoretical redox potential for direct electron transfer det mediated methanogenesis was 0 287v vs she c o 2 8 h 8 e c h 4 2 h 2 o while with the decrease of cathode potential 0 45v and 0 60v in this study the hydrogen evolution reaction her was occurred 2 h 2 e h 2 theoretical redox potential 0 456v vs she and the molecular h2 was immediately utilized for the conduct of her methanogenesis kracke et al 2020 kobayashi et al 2017 the introduction of mec system significantly increased the amount of electron donor fig 1c a under 0 15v bioelectrostimulation the system reacted quickly and assembled complex microbial network and positive relationships between putative dechloinators and methanogens for facilitation of γ hch reduction and methanogenesis fig 1a and fig conspicuous4c when the cathodic potential reached at 0 30v the electron amount that derived from electrodes was barely unchanged 2 3 mmol e l 1 compared to 2 0 mmol e l 1 in 0 15v while more electrons was transferred to γ hch thus leading to the inhibition of methanogenesis while the lower potentials 0 45v and 0 60v resulted in the inhibited γ hch reduction fig 1a a the cathode potential of 0 45v became negative enough for the induction of her mediated methanogenesis resulting in an improvement in the ch4 production rate and current capture efficiency fig 1a and fig 1c the electrons derived from bioanodes flowed more to methanogenesis instead of γ hch reduction leading to the suppressed γ hch reductive removal and facilitated ch4 cumulation in 0 45v treatment fig 1c however the similarity of the voltammetric behavior was not conslusive and therefore additional investigation on the composition of the microbial communities was depicted previous studies suggested several methanogens like methanosarcina and methanobacterium have been proved to be helpful for dechlorination of cop in pure culture and bioreactors cheng et al 2021 especially the newly research of yuan et al 2021b indicated a vital role of methanogenic coenzyme f430 in decreasing the activation barrier to dechlorination the core dechlorinating group displayed either collaborative or competitive interrelations with methanogens in mec systems in this study pseudomonas was showed the positive correlation with methanoculleus in 0 15v treatment while linked no relation even negative relation with methanogens such as methanoculleus and methanospirillum in 0 30v treatment fig 4d besides the sum of the relative abundance of core dechlorinating groups that included stenotrophomonas pseudomonas cupriavidus was increased in 0 15v treatment 35 0 and showed the highest in 0 30v treatment 38 9 revealing the same tendency of γ hch reduction facilitation in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments fig 4a a and the same change pattern also showed in the sum of core methanogens methanospirillum methanobacterium methanoculleus and meethanocella the sum of whose relative abundance was 26 2 in 0 15v treatment while was 18 3 in 0 30v treatment fig 4a b collectively it stressed the complicated coupling between γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation and revealed the possibility of coordinating methanogenesis while promoting γ hch reductive removal 4 2 microbial assembly towards different bioelectrostimulation the specific set of microbes in mec systems and the ck revealed the clear separation by compartment in the ordination analyses which was agreement with previous studies that bioelectrostimulated regulation could remarkably alter microbial structures fig 2 logan et al 2019 this distinctiveness was also found in the microbiome across biocathode bioanode and plankton regardless of cathodic potentials fig 2a fig 3a lin et al 2019a demonstrated the remarkably different topological properties of biofilm and plankton microbial community in 2 4 6 trichlorophenol amended mec system the significant difference in community composition was found between bioanode and biocathode in membrane free bioelectrochemical systems jiang et al 2016 consistent with previous studies the results of pearson correlation between the relative abundance of sotus and system performances further explicated the assembly of exclusive functional groups across plankton bioanode and biocathode fig 4 for example petrimonas linked positive correlations with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode rather than in biocathode and plankton meanwhile its relative abundance also increased along with the decrease of cathodic potential fig 4b the electro active fermentative petrimonas can utilize lactate to produce acetic acid and co2 delivered to biocathode for metabolization and cop dechlorination and methanogenesis zeppilli et al 2015 as another distinguished core genera in bioanode nanoarchaeum was known as holding intimate association with ignicoccus the ubiquitous microbe in this study and ignicoccus was suggested owning kinds of multiheme cytochrome c which was indispensable carrier participating in direct interspecies electron transfer diet morris et al 2013 nanoarchaeum was likely involved in mediating electron transfer in bioanode biofilm this implied the electrostimulation effectively recruited bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer and further promoted the electron transfer process in bioanode cupriavidus was capacity of degrading organic pollutants like halogenated nitrophenols min et al 2020 and dichloroethylene fraraccio et al 2017 krieg et al 2018 demonstrated the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum as dominant genera on the surface of biocathode and its capacity of participating in interspecies h2 transfer since the changes of relative abundance of cupriavidus and methanospirillum in biocathode was in conformity with the variation of γ hch reduction it indicated the hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum enriched in mec system helped to transfer hydrogen that generated by electrode as an extra substrate to dechlorinating functional genera like cupriavidus to participate in γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in biocathode fig 1 fig 4a b majority of microbial community in plankton came from the detachment of biofilms the relative abundance of pseudomonas and methanoculleus were both highly increased not only in biofilms but in plankton meanwhile owned the positive relationship with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation pseudomonas has been proved possessing functions of dechlorinating various cops and participating in diet on anode and cathode choi and sang 2016 methanoculleus was evidenced as the typical methanogen owning the capacity of electron transfer chen et al 2020 this suggested the positively active roles of pseudomonas and methanoculleus in both biofilms and plankton while worth noting the relative abundance of clostridium and longilinea linked positive relations with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation and that of mthanothrix showed a positive relation with ch4 cumulation in plankton rather than in bioelectrodes clostridium has been proved capable of dechlorinating cop li et al 2018 longilinea was suggested participating in organic degradation in rice paddy soil li et al 2021 methanothrix was reported enriched in mec system at 500mv and genes associated with diet were more highly expressed liu et al 2019 that suggested the function regarding dechlorination of clostridium and longilinea and biogas production of methanothrix in plankton taken together the application of bioelectrostimulation markedly gathered thereby formed differed core functional groups across bioanode biocathode and plankton subsequently the topological network of sotus responding to different cathodic potential reflected the variations of microbial co occurrence berry and widder 2014 demonstrated keystone taxa linked frequently interact with many other taxa and thereby played important roles in the overall community the improvement of averaged connectivity and the increase of average degree of nodes from core functional groups in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments explained the facilitation of γ hch reduction fig 4d feng et al 2017 deciphered the internal resource or spatial competition of key functional taxa led fundamental impacts to the performance of microbial communities the assembly of microbial co occurrence might be one of the key processes to shift environmental functions zhang et al 2019 shade 2017 consistent with these the inconspicuous relationship between core dechlorinating functional groups and methanogens as revealed by network analysis further accounted for the simultaneous control of ch4 cumulation regardless of the relatively constant of the copy number of mcra gene among different treatments methanogens largely dependent of their connectivity with core dechlorinating groups and in turn regulated the performances ch4 cumulation figs 1 2 4 cerrillo et al 2017 4 3 environmental implications recently increasing attention has been paid on ch4 flux in anaerobic environment such as wetland and paddy soil since ch4 is an acute greenhouse gas with the global warming potential 25 times higher than that of co2 especially in cop polluted anaerobic environment traditional methods aiming at degrading cops could lead to promote ch4 cumulation for example zhu et al 2019b suggested the positive application of coenzyme m on the facilitation of pentachlorophenol reduction which also led to enhanced methanogenesis the supplement of biochar could predominately promote ch4 cumulation during cop degradation in mangrove soil zhu et al 2020b the facilitated γ hch reduction co occurring with the control even inhibition of ch4 cumulation in 0 30v mec system in this study sheds lights on a freshly advanced approach towards the suppression of methanogenesis during bio remediation of cop polluted anaerobic environment such as paddy soils fig 5 further researches on sludge based mec system are needed to boost our understanding of relationships in core functional groups alternatively however ch4 is also the predominant and efficient component of renewable and environment friendly biogas and plays a promising role to cut the reliance on fossil fuels and meet global energy demand omar et al 2019 numbers of previous studies have investigated the possibility of enhancement of ch4 cumulation called biogas upgrading in bioelectrochemical systems during wastewater treatment processes especially those contaminated by cops zhou et al 2020 ability to regulate microbial communities with the use of 0 15v cathodic potential in this study opens new opportunities for the achievement of synchronous rapid cop remediation and accelerated biogas ch4 cumulation guiding the desirable application in the fields of biogas upgrading and renewable energy production in cooperation with cop polluted remediation 5 conclusion the indicator with respect to the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was newly defined to illustrate the extent of ch4 cumulation in this study the performances of γ hch dechlorination and ch4 cumulation together with the electrochemical evidence by cv clearly revealed the co occurrence of the facilitated γ hch reductive removal and the inhibited ch4 emission at 0 30v treatment and the synchronous enhancement of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in 0 15v treatment electro stimulation selectively assembled and enriched exclusively core functional groups across bioanode biocathode and plankton regardless of the cathodic potential for example cupriavidus stenotrophomonas were enriched at biocathode participating in γ hch reduction petrimonas clostridium nanoarchaeum were assembled in bioanode and promoting extracellular electron transfer in bioanode that sheds lights on the possibility of the enrichment and manipulation of microbiome with dechlorinating traits on biocathode and that are capable of electron transfer on bioanode to boost up the functions of mec system more complex microbial community network was appeared in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments contributing to the enhancement of γ hch reduction the increase of negative relationship between potential dechlorinators and methanogens in the mec system with 0 30v cathode potential accounted for the suppression of ch4 cumulation when compared to that with 0 15v the distinctly correlations of γ hch reductive removal and ch4 cumulation in response to different cathodic potentials highlighted the coordination of methanogenesis in cop added mec system to achieve either biogas upgrading in cop contaminated wastewater industry as ch4 could be collected and utilized as green energy or ch4 flux inhibition for an all win remediation in cop polluted paddy soil as the increased ch4 cumulation is a potential risk for climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16730,the wish for rapid degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants along with the increase concern with respect to greenhouse effect and bioenergy methane production have created urgent needs to explore synchronous regulation approach microbial electrolysis cell was established under four degressive cathode potential settings from 0 15v to 0 60v to regulate γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch reduction while ch4 cumulation in this study the synchronous facilitation of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation was occurred in 0 15v treatment while the facilitation of γ hch reductive removal together with the inhibition of ch4 cumulation was showed in 0 30v treatment electrochemical patterns via cyclic voltammetry and morphological performances via scanning electron microscopy illustrated bioelectrostimulation promoted redox reactions and helped to construct mature biofilms located on bioelectrodes also bioelectrostimulated regulation pronouncedly affected the bacteria and archaeal communities and subsequently assembled distinctly core sensitive responders across bioanode biocathode and plankton clostridum longilinea and methanothrix relatively accumulated in the plankton and cupriavidus and methanospirillum and perimonas and nonoarcheaum in biocathode and bioanode respectively while pseudomonas stenotrophomonas methanoculleus and methanosarcina were diffusely enriched microbial interactions in the ecological network were more complicated in 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potential treatments coincident with the increasement of γ hch reduction the co existence between putative dechlorinators and methanogens was less significant in 0 30v treatment when compared to that in 0 15v treatment relevant with the variations of ch4 cumulation in all this study firstly corroborated the availability to synchronously regulate γ hch reductive removal and methanogenesis besides it paves an advanced approach controlling γ hch reduction in cooperation with ch4 cumulation of which to achieve γ hch degradation facilitation along with biogas ch4 production promotion with 0 15v cathode potential during anaerobic γ hch contaminated wastewater digestion or to realize γ hch degradation facilitation with the inhibition of ch4 emission with 0 30v cathode potential for an all win remediation in γ hch polluted anaerobic environment such as paddy soil graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic γ hch reduction ch4 cumulation microbial electrolysis cell synchronous regulation 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds cops have been widely used for agricultural and industrial developments in the past decade years because of the thermal and chemical stability such as pentachlorophenol as pesticide xu et al 2019 trichlorophenol as leather antiseptics lin et al 2019a some of them are toxic recalcitrant meanwhile under excessive impertinently usage leading to ubiquitous distributions in groundwater soils wetlands and sludge even after longtime forbidden which adversely pose a threat to environment and human health chen et al 2019a zhu et al 2019a environmental removal of cops via anaerobic reductive dechlorination has been considered as one of the most crucial bioremediation routes owing to the high effective eco friendly and cost competitive advantages cheng et al 2019 the reductive removal of cops have been verified as essentially step by step electron transfer processes in which cops are dechlorinated through accepting electrons xu et al 2015 the recapitulative reaction of typical cop reduction is showed as r c l x h e r h c l x 1 c l microbial electrolysis cell mec as one of the promising bioelectrostimulation technology with sufficient intermediate h2 supply and inexhaustible electron support has attracted intensive attention in recent years adekunle et al 2019 it showed great capacity in the terms of promoting cop reduction including chlorobenzene ying et al 2021 chlorophenols leon fernandez et al 2021 and chloramphenicol liang et al 2019 worth noting methane ch4 is also substantially cumulated during this process for example zhu et al 2020a demonstrated ch4 took up 82 0 biogas in 2 4 6 trichlorophenol contaminated mec system and the portion of ch4 increased to 83 8 with granular sludge also added yang et al 2021 inferred ch4 essimion was intensified during lindane reductive removal under the loss of microbial diversity in paddy soil as a ch4 mass produced process under reductive proceeded reducing condition methanogenesis employs methanogens to degrade various organic biomass which is also a terminal electron accepting process boss and cristinzio 2014 zhu et al 2019b the recapitulative reaction of methanogenesis is c o 2 8 h 8 e c h 4 2 h 2 o xu et al 2015 and cheng et al 2021 have confirmed the co occurrence of cop dechlorination and methanogenesis in theory as the redox potentials required by cop dechlorination and ch4 production were overlapped the synchronous coupling between dechlorination and methanogenesis p 0 05 have been confirmed in most cases choi et al 2021 zhu et al 2019a and the acceleration of dechlorination generally co occurred with the facilitation of methanogenesis was concluded among 337 observations from 68 articles as reviewed by cheng et al 2021 and also revealed with zero valent iron supplement zhang et al 2020 the electron h2 or other vital cofactors like vitamin b12 produced by methanogens could be delivered to cop by reduced electron carriers thereby participated in the core dechlorination process kumar et al 2021 in addition the expects towards the regulation of ch4 cumulation varied including the wish to increase biogas ch4 amount during anaerobic digestion of cop contaminated wastewater as ch4 shows great capacity as the sustainable energy xu et al 2020 and the urgency to inhibit ch4 cumulation in cop contaminated paddy soil as paddy fields account for around a quarter of anthropogenic ch4 emission to the atmosphere that contribute to the exacerbation of climate change conrad 2020 the increasing demand of elimination of cop environmental persistence as well as the control of ch4 cumulation according to different situations alert the necessity of focus on ch4 cumulation during cop reductive removal weatherill et al 2018 and subsequently search for the possibility to synchronous regulation which are to the best of our knowledge received less study before in addition mec possesses tremendous potential to support unfavorable biological reactions energetically with biocatalyzed electrodes because of the advantage of reducing energy barrier by the supply of an external electric field logan et al 2019 briefly it employs enriched electrode microbiomes to catalyze oxidative reactions in anode and reductive reactions in cathode jiang et al 2018 and at the biocathode the reduction of h to molecular h2 takes place contributing to overcome the lack of electron donors which is majorly caused by the low h2 solubility or electron scramble of competitive metabolic process chen et al 2019b it has been demonstrated that both the electron transfer among biofilm microorganisms and the rate and extent of cop dechlorination and methanogenesis highly relied on the applied cathode potential bajracharya et al 2016 for example the enriched electrode and planktonic communities exhibited different structures among five redox potential between 400 and 750mv v s ag agcl lam et al 2019 contrasting assembly of microbes has been verified under different cathodic electrostimulation with particular microbial structures subsequently formed across anode cathode and suspension which in return accounted for the variations in cop reductive removal and ch4 production chen et al 2019c with the setting of gradient cathodic potentials it provides advanced approach testing the variations of ch4 cumulation along with cop reductive removal with the purpose to facilitate cop removal while regulate ch4 cumulation in this study bio mec system was conducted under cathode potential settings of 0 15v 0 30v 0 45v and 0 60v γ hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch the typical brad spectrum cop with insecticidal activity yuan et al 2021a was selected as a representative of cops its physicochemical properties were showed in supporting information si table s1 a mixed dechlorinating consortium enriched in our laboratory for more than two years from polychlorinated biphenyl pcb polluted paddy soil was considered as the electrolyte in addition the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was defined on the basis of kokkoli et al 2018 in order to present the extent of ch4 cumulation in all this study aims to 1 find out the treatments under which γ hch reductive removal was facilitated 2 investigate the relations between γ hch facilitated reductive removal and ch4 cumulation in response to different bioelectrostimulation 3 demonstrate the community structure and composition across bioanode biocathode and plankton with identification of sensitive microbes and core functional groups involved 4 delineate the underlying electro microbial mediated mechanisms it was hypothesized that 1 γ hch reductive removal was coupled with methanogenesis 2 the application of mec would alter the symbiosis and 3 the different cathodic stimulation would induce peculiarities of microbial composition and structure across bioanode biocathode and plankton which then altogether underpin the changed γ hch removal and ch4 cumulation as well as their synergistic effect 2 materials methods 2 1 inocula and medium the microbial consortium used as the inocula was originally obtained from pcb polluted paddy soil from taizhou zhejiang province china detailed information of the microbial mixed culture enrichment process was described in si section 1 after acclimatization for more than two years the culture could stably dechlorinate 50 mg l 1 pcb with the rate of 6 01 μ mol cl l 1 day 1 subsequently after several successive transfers with the replacement of target pollutant to γ hch the microbial mixed culture also showed stable capacity of dechlorinating 50 mg l 1 γ hch by utilizing 10 mm of sodium lactate as the electron donor the detailed γ hch removal result was shown in figs s1 s2 the mineral salt medium applied in this study was

in same acclimation procedure to keep the biofilms located on electrodes constant chen et al 2019b after sterilizing at 121 c 15 psi for 30 min and purging with n2 99 purity for 15 min to remove oxygen and maintain anaerobic condition the systems were initially fed with γ hch 50 mg l 1 sodium lactate 10 mm the inocula 10 ml and the mineral salt medium 90 ml for 4 days with one of the applied potentials 0 30v to continuously develop biofilms once γ hch dechlorination activity was observed the electrolyte was discharged and the system was replenished after repeated inoculation for about four times until γ hch reductive removal was stably maintained the microbial inocula terminated and the electrolyte exchange continued for another round to strength the maturity of biofilms lin et al 2019a the whole acclimation process was persistently cyclically operated for approximately 60 d until the stable current variation had emerged fig s3 all the solution replacement was performed in an

hch in 35 7 within 4 days fig s2 was applied as the inocula in mec to clarify the effect of cathodic potential stimulation on γ hch reductive removal meanwhile to reveal the capacity to synchronously regulate ch4 cumulation the result of 9 85 γ hch was dissipated in abiotic mec confirmed pure electrochemical process played a neglectable role during cop decomposition fig 1 a a compared to the ck with open circuit the efficiency of γ hch reductive removal was significantly increased in the treatments with cathode potentials of 0 15v and 0 30v but significantly decreased in 0 45v and 0 60v treatments with 0 30v shown as the most optimal cathodic potential that induced the highest γ hch degradation rate 61 47 fig 1a a the accumulation of ch4 showed great differences in response to the contrasting potentials compared to the ck it was increased to 4 95 mmol at 0 15v and reached the maximum 15 76mmol at 0 45v cathode potential while remained marginal changes in 0 30v and 0 60v fig 1a b as for co2 accumulation no significant differences existed in all treatments except that under abiotic conditions fig 1a c besides the extent of ch4 cumulation representing as the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was painted out the extent of ch4 cumulation was remarkably increased in 0 45v mec system as the indicator was significantly increased by one order of magnitude when compared to the ck from 0 003 to 0 067 p 0 05 it was also significantly improved by three times in 0 15v treatment p 0 05 while remained no changes in 0 30v and 0 60v when compared to ck p 0 05 fig 1b 3 2 electrochemical performances as indicated by cv curves the cv is a widely employed potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement to reflect the electrochemical distinction of biofilm with the use of which the redox variation of bioanode and biocathode can be intuitively obtained fig 1c the result that no recognizable peak was observed from the clean and sterilized electrodes guaranteed the precision of cv curves fig s4 regardless of differences of applied cathode potentials current was slightly increased in the bioanode when relative to the abiotic anode demonstrating that electron transfer was increased and the corresponding oxidation was promoted under bioelectrochemical stimulation fig 1c a besides it also indicated the microbes located on bioanode played predominant roles in electron donating process since the abiotic anode only provided subtle electrons no remarkable peak was observed at around 0 35v in the absence of γ hch fig s5 while it went significant in mec systems with γ hch addition fig 1c b kracke et al 2015 indicated the peak at 0 557 0 237v was identical to that of electrochemically active biofilm that was vital to electron transfer the peak of 0 35v was very close to the potential of the outer membrane redox proteins suggesting its potential relative to outer membrane cytochromes zhang et al 2018 the reduction peak at 0 35v was observed steeper in the treatments of 0 15v and 0 30v when compared to the abiotic ck relevant to the facilitation of γ hch reduction in these treatments fig 1c b in compassion with the abiotic cathode two obvious reduction peaks were found at around 0 6v peak a and 0 8v peak b and the difference between each mec system was significant peaks a and b were shifted in response to cathodic potentials showed as peak e and f in 0 15v treatment while peak g and h in 0 45v treatment also the peak intensity was on average of 1 51 and 2 51 times higher in 0 15v and 0 45v treatment respectively which demonstrated that the introducing of mec at 0 15v and 0 45v cathodic potentials facilitated electron transfer paralleled with the same tendency in ch4 cumulation by comparision the peak a and b of abiotic electrode and that of 0 30v electrode peak c and d it could be found that both the peak area and the peak current had a small difference fig 1c b collectively the electro chemical evidences indicated the optimal cathode potential of 0 30v for the achievement of facilitated γ hch reduction meanwhile inhibited ch4 cumulation while that of 0 15v for the synchronous enhancement of both γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation respectively fig 1 3 3 responses of microbial community across bioanode biocathode and plankton showed by sem images of the representative mec at 0 30v large numbers of microbial aggregates were adhered tightly on the surface of graphite rods that evidenced the formation of biofilm on the surface of both anode and cathode fig 2 a besides the distinct differences of morphological formed between bioelectrochemical treatment and the ck also suggested the reassembly of microbial community in response to mec application responses in microbial composition of both bacteria and archaea in terms of alpha diversity and at phyla level were described in si section 4 in brief the shannon index was remarkably increased in bacteria and archaea across bioanode biocathode and plankton among all mec systems fig 2b a and fig 2b b for bacteria and archaea respectively suggesting the enrichment effect of microbes under bioelectrochemical stimulation proteobacteria was the most abundant in plankton in all treatments while proteobacteria together with firmicutes were dominate bacteria in bioelectrode biofilms euryarchaeota crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeota were the dominant abundant phyla accounting for over 99 of all the archaeal sequences fig 2c a and fig 2c b for bacteria and archaea respectively pcoa results showed the strikingly different microbial community between clusters of electro stimulated samples and the ck p 0 05 suggesting the electro stimulation remarkably altered microbial structure of both bacteria and archaea fig 3 a a and fig 3a b respectively in addition communities from bioanode biocathode and plankton were separated well with each other further indicating their differentiation in microbial habitats with specific sets of microbes with the use of indicator species analysis in terms of bipartite network the significant otu associations across bioanode biocathode and plankton could be vividly distinguished chen et al 2019b for bacterial community a total of 202 out of 553 otus were shared and these genera were gathered in the center fig 3c a members of these bacteria included pseudomonas bacillus sedimentibacter and desulfovibrio which have been confirmed capable of dechlorinating cops or being electroactive and highly enriched in mec ammeri et al 2017 gacitua et al 2018 while 0 9 of total otus in archaeal community were found gathering together fig 3c b the majority of shared otus were affiliated with the genera such as methanobacterium methanosarcina methanocella methanoculleus and methanothermobacter among which the genera like methanobacterium and methanosarcina were reported capable of regulating dechlorination and methanogenesis synergistically and the genus like methanobacterium that was enriched on the electrode participated in interspecies h2 transfer gomes et al 2014 lin et al 2019b in addition statistical analyses of differentially abundant otus as comparison of those in the ck were subsequently conducted using r deseq 2 fig 3b with the application of mec 22 otus significantly increased while 12 otus significantly decreased within the relative abundance in bacterial community in bioanode and that were 25 increased and 15 decreased otus in biocathode and 19 and 23 in plankton respectively fig 3b a c as for archaeal community 106 notably enriched and 30 notably depleted otus were found in bioanode and that were 68 and 132 in biocathode and 199 and 175 in plankton respectively fig 3b d f in connection with electrochemical evidences it suggested the microbial community responded uniquely across bioanode biocathode and plankton towards the application of bioelectrostimulation and in return the exclusive groups were reassembled together contributing to the distinct redox based on these the otus that were supported by either shared in the center in bipartite network fig 3c or the noticeably changed showing in volcano plot fig 3b were screened out as the sensitive responders hereafter sotus 3 4 core functional groups participating in γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation bubble plots of sotus were painted out to visually demonstrate the changes of bacterial and archaeal relative abundance at genera level among different treatments fig 4 a pearson correlation of the relative abundance of sotus with environmental variables including γ hch reduction efficiency shown as γ hch and the extent of ch4 cumulation shown as ch4 co2 was simultaneously displayed fig 4b additionally net proportional changes in relative abundance in comparison with the ck were calculated to statistically reveal the effects of different cathode potential on the assembly of microbial community at family level fig s6 and fig s7 for bacteria and archaea respectively worth noting the relative abundance of typical obligate dechlorinator dehalococcoides was significantly decreased even to no detection under bioelectrostimulation when compared to the ck fig 4a a similarly the copy numbers of typical organochloride respiring gene dhc was also remarkably depleted in mec systems fig 4c a that suggested the irrelevance roles of typical obligate dechlorinators in this study the electro stimulation significantly promoted the enrichment of pseudomonas as its relative abundance increased 9 times and that of pseudomonadaceae the family increased by 11 on an average when compared to the ck fig 4a a and fig s6 yun et al 2018 wang et al 2014 reminiscent of the above result that the highest γ hch reduction appeared in 0 30v the relative abundance of pseudomonas showed the maximum in the same treatment fig 1b and fig 4a a in addition pseudomonas linked positive correlation with the indicator γ hch reduction efficiency in both bioanode biocathode and plankton fig 4b the relative abundance of stenotrophomonas was increased by an average of 26 4 and 21 9 in bioanode and biocathode respectively fig 4a a its relative abundance owned positively relevance with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode and biocathode fig 4b the relative abundance of cupriavidus was significantly increased with electro stimulation at 0 15v and 0 30v and reached the highest in 0 30v which was consistent with the facilitation of γ hch degradation fig 1b and fig 4a a meanwhile it showed positive relevance with γ hch reduction in biocathode but not in bioanode and plankton fig 4b petrimonas was remarkably enriched in bioanode as the relative abundance increased to an average of 2 79 given that the relative abundance of petrimonas owned positive relationships with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode the enriched petrimonas was thought helpful for both reductive processes in bioanode clostridium and longilinea were both positively correlated with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in plankton while linked inconspicuous and even negative relationship in bioanode and biocathode fig 4b the relative abundance of clostridium was significantly decreased by 1 55 and 1 65 in the treatments of 0 45v and 0 60v respectively in the plankton while barely unchanged in biocathode and bioanode when compared to the ck similarly longilinea was significantly depleted by 2 63 and 2 90 in 0 45v and 0 60v treatments respectively that was in conformity with the suppression of γ hch reductive removal in 0 45v and 0 60v fig 1b and fig 4a a although the relative abundance of acinetobacter occupied the majority in plankton in bio mec system when compared to the ck an average of 56 2 with the family moraxellaceae increased by 56 1 it revealed no noticeable relevance with γ hch reduction indicating its inactive role in γ hch removal in this study fig 4b and fig s6 similar plots were drawn for archaeal community fig 4a b and fig s7 the relative abundance of methanoculleus was significantly increased by an average of 5 19 and that of methanomicrobiaceae the family was increased to an average of 3 22 under electrochemical stimulation indicating the growth of this group was remarkably promoted with the application of mec given that methanospirillum positively linked with the extent of ch4 cumulation meanwhile the variation of its relative abundance was consistent with the change of ch4 cumulation in biocathode methanospirillum was speculated beneficial for methanogenesis in biocathode fig 1a fig 4b when compared to the ck the relative abundance of nanoarchaeum was significantly increased by 4 31 in bioanode and the relative abundance of methanothrix was significantly increased by 8 83 in plankton while remained merely unchanged in bioelectrodes methanothrix was found linking a positive relevance with ch4 cumulation in plankton fig 4b worth noting in spite of the difference of ch4 cumulation between 0 30v and 0 45v treatments no significant differences were observed related to the copy number of mcra gene fig 1 and 4c b and at 0 15v and 0 45v high abundance of mcra copy numbers further supported the high cumulation of ch4 in all the distinctly core sensitive responders across bioanode biocathode and plankton were identified further revealing the configuration role of bioelectrostimulation on the assembly i e the microbial community structure of bioelectrodes and plankton 3 5 effects of differed bioelectrostimulation on the network structure lastly we explored the co occurrence patterns of sotus in response to different bioelectrostimulation with core functional genera mapping out in the microbial networks fig 4d the obviously different topological properties indicated the great difference in microbial structure table s6 overall remarkably more abundant links and higher average degree and connectivity indicated a more complex microbial network ma et al 2016 the networks with 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potential possessed distinctly higher averaged clustering coefficient in comparison to that in the treatments of 0 45v and 0 60v correspondingly the average connectivity of network was higher in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments 16 85 and 14 47 respectively but lower in 0 45v and 0 60v 4 77 of both that demonstrated more complex network and closer relationship existed in treatments of 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potentials compared to other nodes pseudomonas owned higher degree and lower betweenness centrality value further confirming its keystone role in mec systems according to banerjee et al 2019 particularly the degree of nodes from the genus pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas significantly increased in 0 15v treatment and reached the highest in the 0 30v network 5 88 and 17 88 respectively besides pseudomonas and clostridium shared complex associations with both bacteria such as stenotrophenomonas and archaea such as methanoculleus and methanothrix in 0 15v and 0 30v networks suggesting their tight relationships with others in combination of the strongly positive relation between the relative abundance of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas and the indicator of γ hch reduction efficiency it indicated the abundance and connectivity of core functional groups accounted for the facilitated γ hch reduction in 0 15v and 0 30v bioelectrostimulation fig 1b fig 4d noticeable increase in negative interactions was appeared in 0 30v treatment 24 4 when compared to that in 0 15v treatment 20 7 also the core groups with dechlorinating functions linked dimly positive even negative relations with methanogens in 0 30v treatment like clostridium negatively linked with methanospirillum in 0 30v network in addition core functional archaea like methanospirillum and methanoculleus species occupied the highest betweenness centrality in 0 45v network consistent with their increased abundance and diverse physiologies further explaining the occurrence of highest ch4 accumulation in 0 45v mec system 4 discussion 4 1 coupling of γ hch reduction to methanogenesis in this study the remarkably differed patterns of γ hch reductive removal ch4 cumulation as well as the underlying interrelation were revealed in different mec systems by supplying gradient of constant cathode potentials of 0 15v 0 30v 0 45v and 0 60v the noticeably enhanced γ hch reductive removal was obtained with 0 30v cathodic potential along with the control of ch4 cumulation when compared to the ck the synchronous enhancement of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation was appeared with 0 15 cathodic potential fig 1 the reduction peak at 0 35v from cv curve in mec cathode with the addition of γ hch was assigned to outer membrane cyochromones that were vital to electron transfer zhang et al 2018 fig 1c the suitable potential applied to cathode could promote microbial oxidoreductase of electron transfer while the lower i e 0 45v and 0 60v in this study could have an undesirable impact on the microorganism activity the steepness of the 0 35v peak in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments might be ascribed to the promotion of outer membrane cytochromes secretion which then contributed to the facilitation of γ hch reduction fig 1b kobayashi et al 2017 indicated the reduction peak at 0 65v corresponded to electromethanogens that accepted electrons directly and the peak lower than 0 65v was identical to hydrogenotrophic electromethanogens the peak at 0 6v and 0 8v could then be assigned to methanogens according to fu et al 2015 at the setting of 0 15v and 0 30v cathodic potentials methanogens tended to accept electrons directly as the theoretical redox potential for direct electron transfer det mediated methanogenesis was 0 287v vs she c o 2 8 h 8 e c h 4 2 h 2 o while with the decrease of cathode potential 0 45v and 0 60v in this study the hydrogen evolution reaction her was occurred 2 h 2 e h 2 theoretical redox potential 0 456v vs she and the molecular h2 was immediately utilized for the conduct of her methanogenesis kracke et al 2020 kobayashi et al 2017 the introduction of mec system significantly increased the amount of electron donor fig 1c a under 0 15v bioelectrostimulation the system reacted quickly and assembled complex microbial network and positive relationships between putative dechloinators and methanogens for facilitation of γ hch reduction and methanogenesis fig 1a and fig conspicuous4c when the cathodic potential reached at 0 30v the electron amount that derived from electrodes was barely unchanged 2 3 mmol e l 1 compared to 2 0 mmol e l 1 in 0 15v while more electrons was transferred to γ hch thus leading to the inhibition of methanogenesis while the lower potentials 0 45v and 0 60v resulted in the inhibited γ hch reduction fig 1a a the cathode potential of 0 45v became negative enough for the induction of her mediated methanogenesis resulting in an improvement in the ch4 production rate and current capture efficiency fig 1a and fig 1c the electrons derived from bioanodes flowed more to methanogenesis instead of γ hch reduction leading to the suppressed γ hch reductive removal and facilitated ch4 cumulation in 0 45v treatment fig 1c however the similarity of the voltammetric behavior was not conslusive and therefore additional investigation on the composition of the microbial communities was depicted previous studies suggested several methanogens like methanosarcina and methanobacterium have been proved to be helpful for dechlorination of cop in pure culture and bioreactors cheng et al 2021 especially the newly research of yuan et al 2021b indicated a vital role of methanogenic coenzyme f430 in decreasing the activation barrier to dechlorination the core dechlorinating group displayed either collaborative or competitive interrelations with methanogens in mec systems in this study pseudomonas was showed the positive correlation with methanoculleus in 0 15v treatment while linked no relation even negative relation with methanogens such as methanoculleus and methanospirillum in 0 30v treatment fig 4d besides the sum of the relative abundance of core dechlorinating groups that included stenotrophomonas pseudomonas cupriavidus was increased in 0 15v treatment 35 0 and showed the highest in 0 30v treatment 38 9 revealing the same tendency of γ hch reduction facilitation in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments fig 4a a and the same change pattern also showed in the sum of core methanogens methanospirillum methanobacterium methanoculleus and meethanocella the sum of whose relative abundance was 26 2 in 0 15v treatment while was 18 3 in 0 30v treatment fig 4a b collectively it stressed the complicated coupling between γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation and revealed the possibility of coordinating methanogenesis while promoting γ hch reductive removal 4 2 microbial assembly towards different bioelectrostimulation the specific set of microbes in mec systems and the ck revealed the clear separation by compartment in the ordination analyses which was agreement with previous studies that bioelectrostimulated regulation could remarkably alter microbial structures fig 2 logan et al 2019 this distinctiveness was also found in the microbiome across biocathode bioanode and plankton regardless of cathodic potentials fig 2a fig 3a lin et al 2019a demonstrated the remarkably different topological properties of biofilm and plankton microbial community in 2 4 6 trichlorophenol amended mec system the significant difference in community composition was found between bioanode and biocathode in membrane free bioelectrochemical systems jiang et al 2016 consistent with previous studies the results of pearson correlation between the relative abundance of sotus and system performances further explicated the assembly of exclusive functional groups across plankton bioanode and biocathode fig 4 for example petrimonas linked positive correlations with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in bioanode rather than in biocathode and plankton meanwhile its relative abundance also increased along with the decrease of cathodic potential fig 4b the electro active fermentative petrimonas can utilize lactate to produce acetic acid and co2 delivered to biocathode for metabolization and cop dechlorination and methanogenesis zeppilli et al 2015 as another distinguished core genera in bioanode nanoarchaeum was known as holding intimate association with ignicoccus the ubiquitous microbe in this study and ignicoccus was suggested owning kinds of multiheme cytochrome c which was indispensable carrier participating in direct interspecies electron transfer diet morris et al 2013 nanoarchaeum was likely involved in mediating electron transfer in bioanode biofilm this implied the electrostimulation effectively recruited bacteria capable of extracellular electron transfer and further promoted the electron transfer process in bioanode cupriavidus was capacity of degrading organic pollutants like halogenated nitrophenols min et al 2020 and dichloroethylene fraraccio et al 2017 krieg et al 2018 demonstrated the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum as dominant genera on the surface of biocathode and its capacity of participating in interspecies h2 transfer since the changes of relative abundance of cupriavidus and methanospirillum in biocathode was in conformity with the variation of γ hch reduction it indicated the hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum enriched in mec system helped to transfer hydrogen that generated by electrode as an extra substrate to dechlorinating functional genera like cupriavidus to participate in γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in biocathode fig 1 fig 4a b majority of microbial community in plankton came from the detachment of biofilms the relative abundance of pseudomonas and methanoculleus were both highly increased not only in biofilms but in plankton meanwhile owned the positive relationship with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation pseudomonas has been proved possessing functions of dechlorinating various cops and participating in diet on anode and cathode choi and sang 2016 methanoculleus was evidenced as the typical methanogen owning the capacity of electron transfer chen et al 2020 this suggested the positively active roles of pseudomonas and methanoculleus in both biofilms and plankton while worth noting the relative abundance of clostridium and longilinea linked positive relations with γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation and that of mthanothrix showed a positive relation with ch4 cumulation in plankton rather than in bioelectrodes clostridium has been proved capable of dechlorinating cop li et al 2018 longilinea was suggested participating in organic degradation in rice paddy soil li et al 2021 methanothrix was reported enriched in mec system at 500mv and genes associated with diet were more highly expressed liu et al 2019 that suggested the function regarding dechlorination of clostridium and longilinea and biogas production of methanothrix in plankton taken together the application of bioelectrostimulation markedly gathered thereby formed differed core functional groups across bioanode biocathode and plankton subsequently the topological network of sotus responding to different cathodic potential reflected the variations of microbial co occurrence berry and widder 2014 demonstrated keystone taxa linked frequently interact with many other taxa and thereby played important roles in the overall community the improvement of averaged connectivity and the increase of average degree of nodes from core functional groups in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments explained the facilitation of γ hch reduction fig 4d feng et al 2017 deciphered the internal resource or spatial competition of key functional taxa led fundamental impacts to the performance of microbial communities the assembly of microbial co occurrence might be one of the key processes to shift environmental functions zhang et al 2019 shade 2017 consistent with these the inconspicuous relationship between core dechlorinating functional groups and methanogens as revealed by network analysis further accounted for the simultaneous control of ch4 cumulation regardless of the relatively constant of the copy number of mcra gene among different treatments methanogens largely dependent of their connectivity with core dechlorinating groups and in turn regulated the performances ch4 cumulation figs 1 2 4 cerrillo et al 2017 4 3 environmental implications recently increasing attention has been paid on ch4 flux in anaerobic environment such as wetland and paddy soil since ch4 is an acute greenhouse gas with the global warming potential 25 times higher than that of co2 especially in cop polluted anaerobic environment traditional methods aiming at degrading cops could lead to promote ch4 cumulation for example zhu et al 2019b suggested the positive application of coenzyme m on the facilitation of pentachlorophenol reduction which also led to enhanced methanogenesis the supplement of biochar could predominately promote ch4 cumulation during cop degradation in mangrove soil zhu et al 2020b the facilitated γ hch reduction co occurring with the control even inhibition of ch4 cumulation in 0 30v mec system in this study sheds lights on a freshly advanced approach towards the suppression of methanogenesis during bio remediation of cop polluted anaerobic environment such as paddy soils fig 5 further researches on sludge based mec system are needed to boost our understanding of relationships in core functional groups alternatively however ch4 is also the predominant and efficient component of renewable and environment friendly biogas and plays a promising role to cut the reliance on fossil fuels and meet global energy demand omar et al 2019 numbers of previous studies have investigated the possibility of enhancement of ch4 cumulation called biogas upgrading in bioelectrochemical systems during wastewater treatment processes especially those contaminated by cops zhou et al 2020 ability to regulate microbial communities with the use of 0 15v cathodic potential in this study opens new opportunities for the achievement of synchronous rapid cop remediation and accelerated biogas ch4 cumulation guiding the desirable application in the fields of biogas upgrading and renewable energy production in cooperation with cop polluted remediation 5 conclusion the indicator with respect to the ratio of accumulation of ch4 to co2 ch4 co2 was newly defined to illustrate the extent of ch4 cumulation in this study the performances of γ hch dechlorination and ch4 cumulation together with the electrochemical evidence by cv clearly revealed the co occurrence of the facilitated γ hch reductive removal and the inhibited ch4 emission at 0 30v treatment and the synchronous enhancement of γ hch reduction and ch4 cumulation in 0 15v treatment electro stimulation selectively assembled and enriched exclusively core functional groups across bioanode biocathode and plankton regardless of the cathodic potential for example cupriavidus stenotrophomonas were enriched at biocathode participating in γ hch reduction petrimonas clostridium nanoarchaeum were assembled in bioanode and promoting extracellular electron transfer in bioanode that sheds lights on the possibility of the enrichment and manipulation of microbiome with dechlorinating traits on biocathode and that are capable of electron transfer on bioanode to boost up the functions of mec system more complex microbial community network was appeared in 0 15v and 0 30v treatments contributing to the enhancement of γ hch reduction the increase of negative relationship between potential dechlorinators and methanogens in the mec system with 0 30v cathode potential accounted for the suppression of ch4 cumulation when compared to that with 0 15v the distinctly correlations of γ hch reductive removal and ch4 cumulation in response to different cathodic potentials highlighted the coordination of methanogenesis in cop added mec system to achieve either biogas upgrading in cop contaminated wastewater industry as ch4 could be collected and utilized as green energy or ch4 flux inhibition for an all win remediation in cop polluted paddy soil as the increased ch4 cumulation is a potential risk for climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16731,according to the european directives ue 2020 2184 and 2009 54 ec which establishes the sanitary criteria for water intended for human consumption in europe water suitable for human consumption must be free of the bacterial indicators escherichia coli clostridium perfringens and enterococcus spp drinking water is also monitored for heterotrophic bacteria which are not a human health risk but can serve as an index of bacteriological water quality therefore a rapid accurate and cost effective method for the identification of these colonies would improve our understanding of the culturable bacteria of drinking water and facilitate the task of water management by treatment facilities matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms is potentially such a method although most of the currently available mass spectral libraries have been developed in a clinical setting and have limited environmental applicability in this work a maldi tof ms drinking water library dwl was defined and developed by targeting bacteria present in water intended for human consumption this database made up of 319 different bacterial strains can contribute to the routine microbiological control of either treated drinking water or mineral bottled water carried out by water treatment and distribution operators offering a faster identification rate compared to a clinical sample based library the dwl made up of 96 bacterial genera 44 of which are not represented in the maldi tof ms bacterial bruker daltonics bdal database was found to significantly improve the identification of bacteria present in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial identification maldi tof ms drinking water distribution network bottled water spectra database 1 introduction water quality for human consumption is regulated by the european directives ue 2020 2184 and 2009 54 ec which cover tap water and natural mineral water respectively in both types of water an absence of fecal bacterial indicators is an indicator of safety and heterotrophic bacteria are enumerated to manage water quality bartram et al 2003 serving as an indicator of the efficacy of water treatment processes mainly disinfection though not directly a risk for human health heterotrophic communities can influence water quality as they may include opportunistic pathogens and can form biofilms on surfaces the complex ecosystems of drinking waters also contain viable but non culturable bacteria which represent a minor fraction of the overall drinking water communities and are still highly underexplored a wide range of techniques are available for bacterial identification they can be culture based involving the use of chromogenic media or biochemical testing or molecular such as high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene differing considerably in performance and requirements culture based methods can be time consuming whereas molecular methods are more expensive and need specific technical skills and expertise proteomics offers a well balanced approach through the application of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms which analyses the constantly expressed high abundance proteins mainly ribosomal of a microbial cell this promising tool has equivalent identification power to sanger 16s rrna gene sequencing and provides faster results sala comorera et al 2016 sárvári et al 2018 timperio et al 2017 moreover according to previous studies tan et al 2012 the use of maldi tof can produce annually net savings of 87 8 in reagent costs compared to traditional methods or up to 57 1 savings when including technologist and maintenance even though initial investment in the equipment is high it is offset after a short period typically three years at a reasonable use identification can be performed by non skilled personnel and the time to obtain results is shortened by one working day compared to biochemical methods tsuchida et al 2020 meanwhile in genomic technologies a high expertise in molecular techniques is needed and also the results take longer it depends on sequencing type within few days to two weeks despite the power of genomics some discrepancies have been observed between maldi tof analysis of cultivable bacteria and 16s rrna high throughput sequencing since they are targeting different populations heterotrophic populations versus total bacteria comorera et al 2020 in this case although genomics is thought to be more powerful a lower diversity index was observed in samples analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing compared to heterotrophic bacteria by maldi tof ms probably because the dominance of certain species hindered the identification of minor genera by high throughput sequencing furthermore other biases including primer bias and the lack of a standardized methodology are still a major shortcoming which difficult its use in routine analysis boers et al 2019 on the other hand current water quality regulations still rely on culture based methods to assess water safety in addition to the mandatory monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria and heterotrophic plate counts a more in depth characterization of heterotrophic bacteria by maldi tof ms could provide a better understanding of these bacterial communities and improve water management and distribution studies have demonstrated the reliability speed and easy to use features of maldi tof ms in different areas including food angelakis et al 2011 pavlovic et al 2013 yu et al 2019 groundwater santos et al 2017 wastewater eddabra et al 2012 mining avanzi et al 2017 or even in space craft and associated surfaces seuylemezian et al 2018 recent research sala comorera et al 2017 showed the suitability of maldi tof ms for the routine monitoring of heterotrophic bacteria in a drinking water treatment plant as well as in mineral water sala comorera et al 2020 however there is general agreement that the resolving power of maldi tof ms is currently limited by the lack of environmental spectra in commercial databases and there is a need to create in house libraries with the bacterial spectra of interest de carolis et al 2014 kopcakova et al 2014 rahi et al 2016 santos et al 2016 seuylemezian et al 2018 another drawback of this approach is that identification can be affected by differences in analytical variables i e the extraction method culture conditions matrix and database rahi et al 2016 ruelle et al 2004 among the different maldi sample preparation methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction the formic acid extended direct transfer has been described as the most cost effective and time saving ghosh et al 2015 theel et al 2012 however other authors have achieved better results when using extraction methods in fungal cells chalupová et al 2014 and gram positive bacteria alatoom et al 2011 as the complex and rigid cell walls need extra lysis to access their proteins in addition manufacturer recommended protocols may also vary depend on their ability to inactivate pathogenic organisms safety measures with respect to handling maldi tof ms samples requires at least work under a biosafety level 2 conditions bsl 2 and extraction procedures reducing risk of exposure to potential pathogens according to some studies certain chemical or physical treatment used in sample preparation before processing on maldi tof ms contribute to biological inactivation of samples e g trifluoracetic acid tfa inactivates potential pathogens especially bacterial endospores lasch et al 2008 drevinek et al 2012 tube based ethanol formic acid acetonitrile extraction followed by filtration is recommended for security sensitive biological agents tracz et al 2016 or 70 ethanol is suggested to be sufficient for non spore forming bacteria inactivation cunningham and patel 2015 the choice of an appropriate extraction method is therefore crucial for good results and biological safety we here report to our knowledge the first maldi tof ms database constructed specifically for the identification of bacteria present in water for human consumption named the drinking water library dwl it was created using spectra from a selection of related environmental reference strains from the spanish type culture collection cect as well as drinking water isolates properly identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing the spectra were generated by standardized procedures and compiled in a dedicated database the dwl will assist the monitoring of culturable bacterial communities in drinking water by allowing a rapid and accurate identification of isolates in addition this study provides the basis to increase the dwl by further characterization of drinking water heterotrophic bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and sampling conditions two hundred and nine samples were taken of different types of water including water from distribution networks 109 process water 68 spring water 2 and bottled natural mineral water 30 the samples were grouped into two categories based on their origin treated from distribution networks and process water and non treated natural mineral water and spring water sampling and processing conditions were slightly different for each group as described below for the treated water category 109 chlorinated drinking water samples 0 2 1 ppm free chlorine from distribution networks in catalonia north east spain andorra and south france were analyzed 68 process water samples were collected at nine different stages of treatment in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in barcelona corresponding to river water groundwater sand filters ozonation granular activated carbon gac filters ultrafiltration cartridge filters reverse osmosis and chlorinated water for all 177 samples 1 liter of water was collected in polyethylene sterile bottles with sodium thiosulfate 24 mg l and transported to the laboratory at 4ºc for further analysis within 24 h for the non treated water category 12 different bottled water brands natural mineral water and spring water were selected and a total of 30 samples were analyzed natural mineral water samples consisted of water bottled in 1 5 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles acquired from different retailers and stored in the dark at room temperature 22 2 c until analysis within one month after bottling in the case of spring water two different sources were sampled in sterile 1 liter polyethylene bottles kept at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h 2 2 isolation of heterotrophic bacteria from treated and non treated drinking water heterotrophic bacteria from drinking water samples were recovered by concentration through membrane filtration hollow fiber membrane ultrafiltration or mass inoculation 2 2 1 treated water out of 177 treated water samples 112 were processed by membrane filtration volumes of 100 ml were filtered through 0 22 or 0 45 µm pore sized mixed cellulose ester filters millipore germany filters were incubated on water plate count agar iso wpca oxoid spain at 22 2 c for 72 3 h for the process water samples as concentration methods for early stage samples from the dwtp were not required decimal serial dilutions between 0 01 ml and 1 ml were cultured by mass inoculation in wpca at 22 2 c for 72 3 h iso 1999 spread plating of the samples onto wpca by a mass inoculation method was also done to recover a higher diversity in chlorinated matrices larger volumes were sampled thus 25 samples from distribution networks were filtered through the hollow fiber filter rexeed 25 a asahi kasei medical co japan which is a haemodialysis ultrafilter typically used for clinical purposes but recently applied to concentrate water samples the main advantage of this method is its capacity to concentrate bacteria viruses and protozoa in large volumes of water from 10 to 1000 l hill et al 2007 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 briefly samples ranging between 50 and 700 l were processed by this technique after filtration and elution 0 2 ml of the sample was inoculated onto wpca by the spread plate

subcultured in wpca for purification prior to maldi tof ms analysis 2 3 identification of bacterial isolates by maldi tof ms using the bruker library bacterial isolates were obtained by subculturing one single well isolated colony on new wpca in order to achieve fresh pure cultures sample preparation for maldi tof ms was carried out using the formic acid extended direct transfer method recommended by bruker daltonics thus biological material a single colony from fresh agar cultures was smeared directly onto a spot on a maldi target plate and then overlayed with 1 µl of 70 formic acid after air drying 1 µl of matrix solution saturated solution of a cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid in a standard solvent sigma aldrich was added the bruker bacterial test standard bruker daltonics germany containing an extract of escherichia coli dh5 alpha peptide with a protein profile was included for each plate to calibrate the instrument and validate the run mass spectra ranging from 2000

bruker daltonics germany the obtained spectra were analyzed using maldi biotyper real time classification software package bruker daltonics germany with the bacterial bruker daltonics bdal database mbt compass library db 7311 and checked using the flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany the bruker identification results are classified with a score based on matches between the mass spectra of the analyzed sample and the mass spectra database the identification categories were as recommended by bruker unreliable identification was in red score 1 699 probable genus identification in yellow score 1 700 1 999 secure genus and probable species identification in green score 2 000 2 299 and highly probable species identification also in green score 2 300 3 000 2 4 selection of isolates to be included in the drinking water library the dwl consisted of spectra obtained from strains isolated in different water matrices and the spectra of reference strains from the cect the selection procedure was as follows 2 4 1 selection of non successfully identified isolates red category recovered from the different water matrices under study non successfully identified isolates were grouped into similarity clusters subcultured and reanalyzed using the acid acetonitrile extraction method bruker daltonics germany ca 10 mg biomass from agar cultures was first suspended in 300 ml water by careful mixing and then the suspension was mixed with 900 ml ethanol the biomass was collected by centrifugation and the pellet was re suspended in 1 80 µl 70 formic acid the suspension was mixed carefully with 1 80 µl acetonitrile immediately after centrifugation the supernatant was removed and aliquots of 1 µl were placed on each spot of a stainless steel target plate after air drying 1 µl of matrix solution was added the isolates were analyzed generating 9 spectra per isolate which constitute the mini main spectrum profile mmsp a useful approximation to simplify the clustering spectra were acquired processed and compared by maldi biotyper software version 3 1 bruker daltonics germany and checked for quality using the flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany all spectra were processed using the default program settings for smoothing savitzky golay baseline subtraction tophat and normalization an averaged mass spectrum was created by eliminating those with the higher deviation the parameters used were a mass range from 3000 to 10 000 da and 500 ppm as a maximum error for the main spectrum profile msp the mmsps were incorporated into an ad hoc database for clustering purposes clustering of non identified bacterial isolates was carried out in two steps first a dendrogram was created by the standard maldi biotyper 3 1 msp creation method bruker daltonics germany where distance values are relative and normalized to a maximum value of 1 000 second a comparison based on log score values where each mmsp was compared with the ad hoc mmsp database on this basis isolates representing each cluster were selected for identification by 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis 2 4 2 selection of cect reference bacterial strains for the construction of the dwl database reference environmental and water related bacterial strains were selected from the cect catalogue table s1 the selection was based on the source of isolation environmental and water related growth temperature 20 30 c and growth culture medium mostly wpca and r2a or other media such as gsp glutamate starch phenol red agar also known as pseudomonas aeromonas selective agar glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide agar xylose lysine deoxycholate agar and brain heart infusion agar related species same genus to those selected were also included even though they had not been isolated from the environment all the selected reference strains were cultured according to the growth conditions described for each bacterial strain in the cect catalogue and processed with the acid acetonitrile extraction method recommended by bruker daltonics to obtain their msp as described below in section 2 6 2 5 identification of isolates selected as representative for dwl spectra 2 5 1

madrid spain subsequent sequencing reactions were done on an abi prism 3700 automated sequencer using the big dye terminator v3 1 cycle sequencing kit sequencing primers were the same ones as used in the amplification reaction but diluted five fold 10 pmol μl the taxonomic classification of bacterial isolates was performed using eztaxon kim et al 2012 yoon et al 2017 and blast https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi altschul et al 1997 identification criteria for species delimitation varied depending on the phyla ranging from 98 2 for strains of the phylum bacteroidetes to 99 0 for actinobacteria and those sequences with less than the respective cut off values were considered potential new species as in meier kolthoff et al 2013 all strains are currently deposited at the public catalogue of the cect and their identification results are shown in table s2 2 5 2 gc fame analysis complementary to the 16s rrna gene sequencing gc fame gas chromatographic fatty acid methyl esters analysis of bacterial strains was carried out as a method of strain authentication fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from biomass grown for 48 h on wpca oxoid spain at 26ºc and prepared according to standard protocols as described for the midi microbial identification system sasser 1990 at the cect cellular fatty acid content was analyzed by gc with an agilent 6850 chromatographic unit with the midi microbial identification system using the rtsba6 method midi inc newark us and identified using the microbial identification sherlock software package only for those strains that did not show growth under these conditions was the analysis performed at their optimal growth conditions 2 6 generation of reference msp for inclusion in the dwl selected isolates were inoculated in wpca at 22 2 c and fresh cultures were used for msp creation to generate msps for inclusion in the dwl a total of eight independent replicates of each isolate were processed obtaining a collection of 24 spectra three per replicate sample preparation for maldi tof ms was carried out using the acid acetonitrile extraction method recommended by bruker daltonics as described before in section 4 b the spectra measurements were recorded using the ultraflextreme bruker daltonics germany at visavet ucm madrid spain the instruments are equipped with a nitrogen laser all spectra were recorded in linear positive mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kv spectra were acquired by accumulating 250 laser shots across a spot a mass range of 2000 20 000 m z was used for analysis the mass spectrometer was externally calibrated with the bruker bacterial test standard bruker daltonics germany flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany was used for baseline subtraction smoothing of spectra and mass labelling of peaks msps in the dwl were represented by 18 24 good quality spectra 2 7 validation of the dwl to evaluate the dwl performance five internal and four external validation exercises were carried out by different technicians and different maldi tof spectrometers validation exercises consisted of blind studies for the identification of bacterial isolates whose msp had been included in the dwl for internal validation selected strains were analyzed to evaluate the identification results based on different protein extraction methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction corresponding spectra were obtained with the online acquisition method biotyper real time classification and the microflex mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany for identification dwl and bdal libraries were used in addition six other research centers in spain performed the external validation samples consisted of 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tubes of bacterial pellet resuspended in ethanol water 1 3 and stored at 20ºc until analysis in this trial 30 strains were processed in parallel for maldi tof ms analysis using an extraction method and different mass spectrometer devices ultraflex iii bruker daltonics germany ultraflextreme bruker daltonics germany and microflex bruker daltonics germany all spectra were obtained with the online acquisition method biotyper real time classification bruker daltonics germany matrix blaster function was previously performed by firing eight initial laser shots at 25 intensity to get rid of the very first layer on sample then mass spectra were automatically acquired in steps of 50 shots for a total of 250 shots accumulated with initial laser power at 15 and maximal at 25 the results based on log score value and identification were compared with the dwl and bdal libraries 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of isolates using the bruker daltonics bdal database a total of 3809 bacterial isolates were analyzed by maldi tof ms using the bdal database 1085 from distribution networks 442 from process water 356 from spring water and 1926 from bottled natural mineral water regarding the treated water samples 288 isolates from distribution networks were identified up to species level 26 5 266 at the genus level 24 5 and 531 were not reliably identified 49 in process water samples 143 out of 442 isolates were identified at the species level 32 4 115 at the genus level 26 and 184 were unidentified 41 6 fig 1 a in the non treated water samples 182 out of 356 isolates 51 1 from spring water were identified at the species level 72 20 2 at the genus level and 102 28 7 remained unidentified in bottled natural mineral water 490 out of 1926 isolates 24 5 were identified at the species level 165 8 5 at the genus level whereas 1271 isolates 66 were unidentified representing the highest number of unknown strains among the different samples fig 1 a in summary 1721 isolates 45 were successfully identified with the bdal database at the species and or genus level whereas 2088 isolates remained unidentified 55 3 2 identification of isolates not matched to the bdal database a total of 134 cluster representative isolates were selected for identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing however after preservation only 120 grew satisfactorily and could be sequenced and further characterized by fame profiles data not shown which established affiliation to 53 genera table s2 the isolates identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing corresponded to distribution networks 45 process water 28 bottled natural mineral water 35 and spring water 12 fig 2 b therefore the water from distribution networks accounted for the highest number of species not represented in the bdal database fourteen out of the 53 identified genera were absent in the bdal database in addition some isolates 67 belonged to species not included in the bdal database or to yet to be described identification of non matched isolates by 16s rrna sequencing allowed the bdal database to be expanded after the incorporation of their msps to the dwl table 1 a high variability in origin was observed among these isolates some of the genera were recovered from multiple sources and others from only one these results might be affected by a bias in the colony selection as the main aim of the study was to recover the highest bacterial diversity from the four water sources nineteen genera were recovered from both treated distribution network and process water and non treated water spring water and bottled mineral water acidovorax bacillus bosea brevundimonas caulobacter chryseobacterium deinococcus dyadobacter flavobacterium hydrogenophaga methylobacterium microbacterium mycobacterium paenibacillus pedobacter pseudomonas sphingobium sphingomonas and sphingopyxis nine genera were isolated only from distribution networks acinetobacter blastomonas domibacillus ensifer micrococcus novosphingobium porphyrobacter pseudoxanthomonas and shinella eight genera were recovered only from process water cloacibacterium ideonella massilia nocardioides novispirillum rheinheimera rhodoferax and roseomonas similarly for non treated water samples a total of six genera were exclusively recovered in spring water aeromicrobium herminiimonas nocardia psychrobacillus williamsia and xanthomonas and finally regarding bottled natural mineral water samples 11 different genera were identified as aquabacterium bradyrhizobium janibacter limnobacter methylibium pararhizobium phyllobacterium polaromonas psychrobacter rhizobium and variovorax 3 3 the drinking water library the dwl constructed in this study fig 2 includes 319 msps generated for isolates unmatched to the bdal database and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing 120 representing the different clusters in which the isolates were grouped table s2 also included are spectra from reference strains 199 selected for their environmental or water related origins table s1 the maldi tof ms identification capacity increased when using the dwl with the newly incorporated msps as half the genera in the library were absent from the bdal database at the beginning of the study in 2016 the bdal database included 428 bacterial genera which allowed the identification of 35 of drinking water isolates the msps included in the dwl correspond to species belonging to 96 bacterial genera table 1 44 of which were absent from the bdal database and one was potentially a new genus for the remaining 52 genera 74 msps corresponding to one or more species were included reaching a total of 319 msps the predominant genera were mucilaginibacter with 10 msps followed by bosea with 5 msps and aquabacterium chitinimonas and polaromonas with 3 msps each the newly added genera are shown in table 1 of the 44 new genera included in the dwl 30 correspond to reference strains and 14 to isolates from treated water and non treated water at the species level the dwl database provides 189 species not represented in the bdal database 67 of which are potentially new taxa independently of their origin whether environmental or reference strains the new msps expanded the in house database and improved the capacity of maldi tof ms to identify drinking water isolates distribution of the dwl msps per genera and origin is shown in table 1 briefly the genera included in the dwl were represented by variable numbers of msps the most highly represented genus was aeromonas with 38 msp entries 11 9 followed by chryseobacterium with 22 msps 6 9 flavobacterium with 18 msps 5 6 sphingomonas with 13 msps 4 1 and methylobacterium with 11 msps 3 4 the genera pedobacter pseudomonas sphingopyxis and mucilaginibacter contributed 10 msps 3 1 each whereas brevundimonas provided 9 msps 2 8 psychrobacter 8 msps 2 5 mycobacterium 7 msps 2 2 and sphingobium and paenibacillus 6 msps 1 9 each the genera blastomonas rhodococcus bosea novosphigobium and caulobacter provided 5 msps 1 6 each and the genera bacillus rheinheimera and massilia 4 msps 1 3 each 3 4 validation of the dwl database the newly developed dwl was validated by a internal assays with reference cect strains and drinking water isolates b external blind trials c re identification of the drinking water isolates recovered in this project and d identification of new isolates from routine laboratory analysis 3 4 1 internal assays an internal assay was carried out with 9 cect reference strains cect 317 brevundimonas diminuta cect 7302 chryseobacterium aquaticum cect 7791 flavobacterium tructae cect 5998 methylobacterium aquaticum cect 7550 mucilaginibacter myungsuensis cect 7273 mycobacterium llatzerense cect 153 paenibacillus polymyxa cect 7114 pedobacter aquatilis and cect 8016 sphingopyxis italica the selection was based on the bacterial diversity found in drinking water and protein extraction difficulty in order to challenge the identification capacity of the new database the strains were analyzed by maldi tof ms as described in material and methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction methods six out of the nine strains were successfully identified at the species level with scores of 2 04 2 55 two strains were identified at the genus level 1 73 1 94 and one was not identified 1 48 1 56 table s3 in general differences between extraction methods were not observed the score values being very close strain cect 7273 mycobacterium llatzerenze was only identified to the genus level by the extraction method score 1 73 1 80 as described in other studies due to their complex cell walls mycobacterium spp require a specific extraction method for a better protein recovery which may affect maldi tof results alcolea medina et al 2019 strain cect 153 paenibacillus polymyxa was not identified scores 1 49 1 56 when using the dwl but genus level identification was achieved with the bdal database scores 1 84 1 98 it is well known that sporulation can affect identification by maldi tof analysis as spores differ in protein content compared to vegetative cells lasch et al 2009 3 4 2 external blind trials for external validation four rounds of proficiency testing of the dwl were carried out each round involving at least three spanish research centers and 29 strains table s4 which represents about 10 of the dwl content one batch of cell culture was prepared per strain and distributed among the centers for the parallel analysis by maldi tof ms using the acid acetonitrile extraction method and the mass spectrometer device available in the center in all three different instruments were used as a result 81 of measurements resulted in identification at probable species level score 2 000 and 13 at probable genus level score 1 700 1 999 6 not leading to identification score 1 699 in general spectra were consistent although occasional inter laboratory and even intra laboratory variability was observed differences in log score values between research centers can be explained either because of the cell composition sporulated cultures cell wall complexity the elapsed time before sample processing the conditions of sample preservation or sample handling likewise inter laboratory differences in analytical sensitivity were registered for certain taxonomic groups that are nearly identical by 16s rrna gene sequencing janda and abbott 2007 this was the case of strain flavobacterium sp cect 9288 for which the highest log score value matched a closely related phylogenetic species of the genus flavobacterium as a result two out of six centers only achieved identification at the genus level slightly different results were observed depending on the spectrometer device used for some strains profiles clustered separately in microflex vs ultraflextreme ultraflex ii moreover the quality of spectra also directly affected the results the higher laser intensity of automatic compared to manual acquisition may produce background noise that impairs sensitivity resulting in false or unreliable classification for instance one of the six laboratories in the trial acquired three spectra for strain cect 9470 phyllobacterium myrsinacearum yet identification at species level was achieved with only one spectrum 3 4 3 re identification of the drinking water isolates recovered in this study the extended database bdal plus dwl allowed offline re analysis of isolates unidentified with previously acquired spectra the performances of both databases are shown in fig 3 the bdal database could identify 35 of isolates to levels of probable genus score 1 700 1 999 secure genus and probable species score 2 000 2 299 or highly probable species identification score 2 300 3 000 which increased up to 95 when the dwl was used as well the bdal library alone failed to identify 2088 54 8 of the isolates whereas 618 16 2 were identified at the genus level and 1103 29 at the species level in contrast when the same spectra were searched against the bdal database plus the dwl the identification performance improved by 47 2904 of the isolates being identified at the species level 76 2 and 296 remaining unidentified 7 8 the unidentified fraction corresponded to single representatives non clustered isolates not included in the dwl as they were detected only once throughout the study in general the addition of new msp entries in the dwl increased the coverage of genus and species diversity thereby improving the discrimination capacity of the original database as a result see fig 1 b 714 isolates from the distribution networks were successfully identified at the species level 65 8 263 at the genus level 24 2 and 108 isolates remained unknown 10 the results for process water samples were similar from a total of 1085 isolates 240 were identified at species level 54 3 122 at genus level 27 6 and 80 remained unknown 18 1 in the two groups the percentage of unknown samples decreased by 38 9 and 23 5 respectively when using dwl surprisingly this reduction was significantly greater for the bottled natural mineral water samples when the 1926 spectra were searched against the extended database 1671 were identified at the species level 86 8 and another 157 8 2 at the genus level only 98 isolates remained unidentified which represented an improvement of 60 9 over the bdal database fig 1 a the extended database also gave better results in spring water samples a total of 97 2 346 out of 356 of isolates were successfully identified 78 4 at species level and 18 8 at genus level with only 10 isolates unidentified as shown the dwl contributed new mpss on environmental strains lacking in the original database and constitutes a good tool for the routine testing of drinking water samples although databases are frequently updated by the providers results of the present study highlighted in accordance with other authors de carolis et al 2014 kopcakova et al 2014 rahi et al 2016 seuylemezian et al 2018 that there is a need for continuously updated in house databases to increase taxonomic resolution especially for microbial ecology studies 4 conclusions the drinking water library presented here is composed of 319 maldi tof ms profiles of 120 bacteria isolated from different drinking water sources distribution networks and mineral water of different origins mainly catalonia north east spain andorra and the south of france and a selection of 199 reference strains of environmental or water related origin from the spanish type culture collection the new library created using bruker ultraflextreme maldi tof ms equipment contains msps for 164 species of 53 genera already included in the bruker daltonics database increasing the species coverage and 67 possible new species belonging to 44 genera not previously included strains of 120 bacteria including representative strains of potential new species were deposited at the cect for public accession following the established protocols further studies are in progress to elucidate the taxonomic status of strains that might belong to new taxa the new dwl which extended the original bruker daltonics database with 319 new msps for 96 genera from water and other related environments improved the resolution power for bacterial identification by up to 76 overall bacterial identification by maldi tof ms is an easy and fast high throughput technique with low running costs and remarkable specificity in the present study there were slight differences in the results between spectrometers but the method still proved a good choice for interlaboratory collaboration moreover using the formic acid extended direct transfer protocol allowed the operation time to be significantly reduced and when combined with the dwl it provided a rapid and successful identification of drinking water bacteria able to improve identification maldi tof ms and the dwl constitute an excellent tool for multiple applications ranging from basic research on water bacterial communities to routine analysis i e in water testing

16731,according to the european directives ue 2020 2184 and 2009 54 ec which establishes the sanitary criteria for water intended for human consumption in europe water suitable for human consumption must be free of the bacterial indicators escherichia coli clostridium perfringens and enterococcus spp drinking water is also monitored for heterotrophic bacteria which are not a human health risk but can serve as an index of bacteriological water quality therefore a rapid accurate and cost effective method for the identification of these colonies would improve our understanding of the culturable bacteria of drinking water and facilitate the task of water management by treatment facilities matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms is potentially such a method although most of the currently available mass spectral libraries have been developed in a clinical setting and have limited environmental applicability in this work a maldi tof ms drinking water library dwl was defined and developed by targeting bacteria present in water intended for human consumption this database made up of 319 different bacterial strains can contribute to the routine microbiological control of either treated drinking water or mineral bottled water carried out by water treatment and distribution operators offering a faster identification rate compared to a clinical sample based library the dwl made up of 96 bacterial genera 44 of which are not represented in the maldi tof ms bacterial bruker daltonics bdal database was found to significantly improve the identification of bacteria present in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterial identification maldi tof ms drinking water distribution network bottled water spectra database 1 introduction water quality for human consumption is regulated by the european directives ue 2020 2184 and 2009 54 ec which cover tap water and natural mineral water respectively in both types of water an absence of fecal bacterial indicators is an indicator of safety and heterotrophic bacteria are enumerated to manage water quality bartram et al 2003 serving as an indicator of the efficacy of water treatment processes mainly disinfection though not directly a risk for human health heterotrophic communities can influence water quality as they may include opportunistic pathogens and can form biofilms on surfaces the complex ecosystems of drinking waters also contain viable but non culturable bacteria which represent a minor fraction of the overall drinking water communities and are still highly underexplored a wide range of techniques are available for bacterial identification they can be culture based involving the use of chromogenic media or biochemical testing or molecular such as high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene differing considerably in performance and requirements culture based methods can be time consuming whereas molecular methods are more expensive and need specific technical skills and expertise proteomics offers a well balanced approach through the application of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms which analyses the constantly expressed high abundance proteins mainly ribosomal of a microbial cell this promising tool has equivalent identification power to sanger 16s rrna gene sequencing and provides faster results sala comorera et al 2016 sárvári et al 2018 timperio et al 2017 moreover according to previous studies tan et al 2012 the use of maldi tof can produce annually net savings of 87 8 in reagent costs compared to traditional methods or up to 57 1 savings when including technologist and maintenance even though initial investment in the equipment is high it is offset after a short period typically three years at a reasonable use identification can be performed by non skilled personnel and the time to obtain results is shortened by one working day compared to biochemical methods tsuchida et al 2020 meanwhile in genomic technologies a high expertise in molecular techniques is needed and also the results take longer it depends on sequencing type within few days to two weeks despite the power of genomics some discrepancies have been observed between maldi tof analysis of cultivable bacteria and 16s rrna high throughput sequencing since they are targeting different populations heterotrophic populations versus total bacteria comorera et al 2020 in this case although genomics is thought to be more powerful a lower diversity index was observed in samples analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing compared to heterotrophic bacteria by maldi tof ms probably because the dominance of certain species hindered the identification of minor genera by high throughput sequencing furthermore other biases including primer bias and the lack of a standardized methodology are still a major shortcoming which difficult its use in routine analysis boers et al 2019 on the other hand current water quality regulations still rely on culture based methods to assess water safety in addition to the mandatory monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria and heterotrophic plate counts a more in depth characterization of heterotrophic bacteria by maldi tof ms could provide a better understanding of these bacterial communities and improve water management and distribution studies have demonstrated the reliability speed and easy to use features of maldi tof ms in different areas including food angelakis et al 2011 pavlovic et al 2013 yu et al 2019 groundwater santos et al 2017 wastewater eddabra et al 2012 mining avanzi et al 2017 or even in space craft and associated surfaces seuylemezian et al 2018 recent research sala comorera et al 2017 showed the suitability of maldi tof ms for the routine monitoring of heterotrophic bacteria in a drinking water treatment plant as well as in mineral water sala comorera et al 2020 however there is general agreement that the resolving power of maldi tof ms is currently limited by the lack of environmental spectra in commercial databases and there is a need to create in house libraries with the bacterial spectra of interest de carolis et al 2014 kopcakova et al 2014 rahi et al 2016 santos et al 2016 seuylemezian et al 2018 another drawback of this approach is that identification can be affected by differences in analytical variables i e the extraction method culture conditions matrix and database rahi et al 2016 ruelle et al 2004 among the different maldi sample preparation methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction the formic acid extended direct transfer has been described as the most cost effective and time saving ghosh et al 2015 theel et al 2012 however other authors have achieved better results when using extraction methods in fungal cells chalupová et al 2014 and gram positive bacteria alatoom et al 2011 as the complex and rigid cell walls need extra lysis to access their proteins in addition manufacturer recommended protocols may also vary depend on their ability to inactivate pathogenic organisms safety measures with respect to handling maldi tof ms samples requires at least work under a biosafety level 2 conditions bsl 2 and extraction procedures reducing risk of exposure to potential pathogens according to some studies certain chemical or physical treatment used in sample preparation before processing on maldi tof ms contribute to biological inactivation of samples e g trifluoracetic acid tfa inactivates potential pathogens especially bacterial endospores lasch et al 2008 drevinek et al 2012 tube based ethanol formic acid acetonitrile extraction followed by filtration is recommended for security sensitive biological agents tracz et al 2016 or 70 ethanol is suggested to be sufficient for non spore forming bacteria inactivation cunningham and patel 2015 the choice of an appropriate extraction method is therefore crucial for good results and biological safety we here report to our knowledge the first maldi tof ms database constructed specifically for the identification of bacteria present in water for human consumption named the drinking water library dwl it was created using spectra from a selection of related environmental reference strains from the spanish type culture collection cect as well as drinking water isolates properly identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing the spectra were generated by standardized procedures and compiled in a dedicated database the dwl will assist the monitoring of culturable bacterial communities in drinking water by allowing a rapid and accurate identification of isolates in addition this study provides the basis to increase the dwl by further characterization of drinking water heterotrophic bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and sampling conditions two hundred and nine samples were taken of different types of water including water from distribution networks 109 process water 68 spring water 2 and bottled natural mineral water 30 the samples were grouped into two categories based on their origin treated from distribution networks and process water and non treated natural mineral water and spring water sampling and processing conditions were slightly different for each group as described below for the treated water category 109 chlorinated drinking water samples 0 2 1 ppm free chlorine from distribution networks in catalonia north east spain andorra and south france were analyzed 68 process water samples were collected at nine different stages of treatment in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in barcelona corresponding to river water groundwater sand filters ozonation granular activated carbon gac filters ultrafiltration cartridge filters reverse osmosis and chlorinated water for all 177 samples 1 liter of water was collected in polyethylene sterile bottles with sodium thiosulfate 24 mg l and transported to the laboratory at 4ºc for further analysis within 24 h for the non treated water category 12 different bottled water brands natural mineral water and spring water were selected and a total of 30 samples were analyzed natural mineral water samples consisted of water bottled in 1 5 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles acquired from different retailers and stored in the dark at room temperature 22 2 c until analysis within one month after bottling in the case of spring water two different sources were sampled in sterile 1 liter polyethylene bottles kept at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h 2 2 isolation of heterotrophic bacteria from treated and non treated drinking water heterotrophic bacteria from drinking water samples were recovered by concentration through membrane filtration hollow fiber membrane ultrafiltration or mass inoculation 2 2 1 treated water out of 177 treated water samples 112 were processed by membrane filtration volumes of 100 ml were filtered through 0 22 or 0 45 µm pore sized mixed cellulose ester filters millipore germany filters were incubated on water plate count agar iso wpca oxoid spain at 22 2 c for 72 3 h for the process water samples as concentration methods for early stage samples from the dwtp were not required decimal serial dilutions between 0 01 ml and 1 ml were cultured by mass inoculation in wpca at 22 2 c for 72 3 h iso 1999 spread plating of the samples onto wpca by a mass inoculation method was also done to recover a higher diversity in chlorinated matrices larger volumes were sampled thus 25 samples from distribution networks were filtered through the hollow fiber filter rexeed 25 a asahi kasei medical co japan which is a haemodialysis ultrafilter typically used for clinical purposes but recently applied to concentrate water samples the main advantage of this method is its capacity to concentrate bacteria viruses and protozoa in large volumes of water from 10 to 1000 l hill et al 2007 gunnarsdottir et al 2020 briefly samples ranging between 50 and 700 l were processed by this technique after filtration and elution 0 2 ml of the sample was inoculated onto wpca by the spread plate technique and incubated at 22 2 c for 72 3 h those samples that showed no growth on wpca were re analyzed using r2a plates becton dickinson u s at 22 c for 120 4 h r2a agar is a low nutrient medium reported to improve the recovery of stressed and chlorine tolerant bacteria from drinking water systems reasoner and geldreich 1985 colonies were picked up and subcultured on the corresponding culture media and they were further characterized by maldi tof ms analysis 2 2 2 non treated water samples from spring water and bottled natural mineral water were concentrated by membrane filtration different sample volumes 0 1 ml 1 ml 10 ml 100 ml were filtered through 0 22 µm pore size nitrocellulose membrane filters millipore germany and incubated on wpca oxoid spain supplemented with 0 5 g l 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc at 22 c for 120 3 h due to bacterial metabolism colorless ttc is reduced to formazan a red compound helping the visualization of the colonies colonies were subcultured in wpca for purification prior to maldi tof ms analysis 2 3 identification of bacterial isolates by maldi tof ms using the bruker library bacterial isolates were obtained by subculturing one single well isolated colony on new wpca in order to achieve fresh pure cultures sample preparation for maldi tof ms was carried out using the formic acid extended direct transfer method recommended by bruker daltonics thus biological material a single colony from fresh agar cultures was smeared directly onto a spot on a maldi target plate and then overlayed with 1 µl of 70 formic acid after air drying 1 µl of matrix solution saturated solution of a cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid in a standard solvent sigma aldrich was added the bruker bacterial test standard bruker daltonics germany containing an extract of escherichia coli dh5 alpha peptide with a protein profile was included for each plate to calibrate the instrument and validate the run mass spectra ranging from 2000 to 20 000 da of each isolate were automatically acquired using the microflex lt maldi tof ms device and maldi biotyper software version 3 1 bruker daltonics germany with flexcontrol software package bruker daltonics germany the obtained spectra were analyzed using maldi biotyper real time classification software package bruker daltonics germany with the bacterial bruker daltonics bdal database mbt compass library db 7311 and checked using the flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany the bruker identification results are classified with a score based on matches between the mass spectra of the analyzed sample and the mass spectra database the identification categories were as recommended by bruker unreliable identification was in red score 1 699 probable genus identification in yellow score 1 700 1 999 secure genus and probable species identification in green score 2 000 2 299 and highly probable species identification also in green score 2 300 3 000 2 4 selection of isolates to be included in the drinking water library the dwl consisted of spectra obtained from strains isolated in different water matrices and the spectra of reference strains from the cect the selection procedure was as follows 2 4 1 selection of non successfully identified isolates red category recovered from the different water matrices under study non successfully identified isolates were grouped into similarity clusters subcultured and reanalyzed using the acid acetonitrile extraction method bruker daltonics germany ca 10 mg biomass from agar cultures was first suspended in 300 ml water by careful mixing and then the suspension was mixed with 900 ml ethanol the biomass was collected by centrifugation and the pellet was re suspended in 1 80 µl 70 formic acid the suspension was mixed carefully with 1 80 µl acetonitrile immediately after centrifugation the supernatant was removed and aliquots of 1 µl were placed on each spot of a stainless steel target plate after air drying 1 µl of matrix solution was added the isolates were analyzed generating 9 spectra per isolate which constitute the mini main spectrum profile mmsp a useful approximation to simplify the clustering spectra were acquired processed and compared by maldi biotyper software version 3 1 bruker daltonics germany and checked for quality using the flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany all spectra were processed using the default program settings for smoothing savitzky golay baseline subtraction tophat and normalization an averaged mass spectrum was created by eliminating those with the higher deviation the parameters used were a mass range from 3000 to 10 000 da and 500 ppm as a maximum error for the main spectrum profile msp the mmsps were incorporated into an ad hoc database for clustering purposes clustering of non identified bacterial isolates was carried out in two steps first a dendrogram was created by the standard maldi biotyper 3 1 msp creation method bruker daltonics germany where distance values are relative and normalized to a maximum value of 1 000 second a comparison based on log score values where each mmsp was compared with the ad hoc mmsp database on this basis isolates representing each cluster were selected for identification by 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis 2 4 2 selection of cect reference bacterial strains for the construction of the dwl database reference environmental and water related bacterial strains were selected from the cect catalogue table s1 the selection was based on the source of isolation environmental and water related growth temperature 20 30 c and growth culture medium mostly wpca and r2a or other media such as gsp glutamate starch phenol red agar also known as pseudomonas aeromonas selective agar glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide agar xylose lysine deoxycholate agar and brain heart infusion agar related species same genus to those selected were also included even though they had not been isolated from the environment all the selected reference strains were cultured according to the growth conditions described for each bacterial strain in the cect catalogue and processed with the acid acetonitrile extraction method recommended by bruker daltonics to obtain their msp as described below in section 2 6 2 5 identification of isolates selected as representative for dwl spectra 2 5 1 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene representative bacterial strains from each cluster were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing on a genius thermocycler techne burlington nj usa the amplification mixture 50 μl comprised 1 μl 50 pmol μl each of universal primers amplifying a 1000 bp region of the 16s rrna gene 616 v forward 5 agagtttgatymtggctcag 3 and p699r reverse 5

denaturation at 94ºc for 30 s annealing at 56ºc for 30 s extension at 72ºc for 45 s and a final extension at 72ºc for 10 min negative controls devoid of dna were simultaneously included in the amplification process pcr amplicons of the partial 16s rrna gene were verified by visualization in 1 agarose gel electrophoresis amplicons were purified and sequenced by the macrogen company inc madrid spain subsequent sequencing reactions were done on an abi prism 3700 automated sequencer using the big dye terminator v3 1 cycle sequencing kit sequencing primers were the same ones as used in the amplification reaction but diluted five fold 10 pmol μl the taxonomic classification of bacterial isolates was performed using eztaxon kim et al 2012 yoon et al 2017 and blast https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi altschul et al 1997 identification criteria for species delimitation varied depending on the phyla ranging from 98 2 for strains of the phylum bacteroidetes to 99 0 for actinobacteria and those sequences with less than the respective cut off values were considered potential new species as in meier kolthoff et al 2013 all strains are currently deposited at the public catalogue of the cect and their identification results are shown in table s2 2 5 2 gc fame analysis complementary to the 16s rrna gene sequencing gc fame gas chromatographic fatty acid methyl esters analysis of bacterial strains was carried out as a method of strain authentication fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from biomass grown for 48 h on wpca oxoid spain at 26ºc and prepared according to standard protocols as described for the midi microbial identification system sasser 1990 at the cect cellular fatty acid content was analyzed by gc with an agilent 6850 chromatographic unit with the midi microbial identification system using the rtsba6 method midi inc newark us and identified using the microbial identification sherlock software package only for those strains that did not show growth under these conditions was the analysis performed at their optimal growth conditions 2 6 generation of reference msp for inclusion in the dwl selected isolates were inoculated in wpca at 22 2 c and fresh cultures were used for msp creation to generate msps for inclusion in the dwl a total of eight independent replicates of each isolate were processed obtaining a collection of 24 spectra three per replicate sample preparation for maldi tof ms was carried out using the acid acetonitrile extraction method recommended by bruker daltonics as described before in section 4 b the spectra measurements were recorded using the ultraflextreme bruker daltonics germany at visavet ucm madrid spain the instruments are equipped with a nitrogen laser all spectra were recorded in linear positive mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kv spectra were acquired by accumulating 250 laser shots across a spot a mass range of 2000 20 000 m z was used for analysis the mass spectrometer was externally calibrated with the bruker bacterial test standard bruker daltonics germany flexanalysis software bruker daltonics germany was used for baseline subtraction smoothing of spectra and mass labelling of peaks msps in the dwl were represented by 18 24 good quality spectra 2 7 validation of the dwl to evaluate the dwl performance five internal and four external validation exercises were carried out by different technicians and different maldi tof spectrometers validation exercises consisted of blind studies for the identification of bacterial isolates whose msp had been included in the dwl for internal validation selected strains were analyzed to evaluate the identification results based on different protein extraction methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction corresponding spectra were obtained with the online acquisition method biotyper real time classification and the microflex mass spectrometer bruker daltonics germany for identification dwl and bdal libraries were used in addition six other research centers in spain performed the external validation samples consisted of 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tubes of bacterial pellet resuspended in ethanol water 1 3 and stored at 20ºc until analysis in this trial 30 strains were processed in parallel for maldi tof ms analysis using an extraction method and different mass spectrometer devices ultraflex iii bruker daltonics germany ultraflextreme bruker daltonics germany and microflex bruker daltonics germany all spectra were obtained with the online acquisition method biotyper real time classification bruker daltonics germany matrix blaster function was previously performed by firing eight initial laser shots at 25 intensity to get rid of the very first layer on sample then mass spectra were automatically acquired in steps of 50 shots for a total of 250 shots accumulated with initial laser power at 15 and maximal at 25 the results based on log score value and identification were compared with the dwl and bdal libraries 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of isolates using the bruker daltonics bdal database a total of 3809 bacterial isolates were analyzed by maldi tof ms using the bdal database 1085 from distribution networks 442 from process water 356 from spring water and 1926 from bottled natural mineral water regarding the treated water samples 288 isolates from distribution networks were identified up to species level 26 5 266 at the genus level 24 5 and 531 were not reliably identified 49 in process water samples 143 out of 442 isolates were identified at the species level 32 4 115 at the genus level 26 and 184 were unidentified 41 6 fig 1 a in the non treated water samples 182 out of 356 isolates 51 1 from spring water were identified at the species level 72 20 2 at the genus level and 102 28 7 remained unidentified in bottled natural mineral water 490 out of 1926 isolates 24 5 were identified at the species level 165 8 5 at the genus level whereas 1271 isolates 66 were unidentified representing the highest number of unknown strains among the different samples fig 1 a in summary 1721 isolates 45 were successfully identified with the bdal database at the species and or genus level whereas 2088 isolates remained unidentified 55 3 2 identification of isolates not matched to the bdal database a total of 134 cluster representative isolates were selected for identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing however after preservation only 120 grew satisfactorily and could be sequenced and further characterized by fame profiles data not shown which established affiliation to 53 genera table s2 the isolates identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing corresponded to distribution networks 45 process water 28 bottled natural mineral water 35 and spring water 12 fig 2 b therefore the water from distribution networks accounted for the highest number of species not represented in the bdal database fourteen out of the 53 identified genera were absent in the bdal database in addition some isolates 67 belonged to species not included in the bdal database or to yet to be described identification of non matched isolates by 16s rrna sequencing allowed the bdal database to be expanded after the incorporation of their msps to the dwl table 1 a high variability in origin was observed among these isolates some of the genera were recovered from multiple sources and others from only one these results might be affected by a bias in the colony selection as the main aim of the study was to recover the highest bacterial diversity from the four water sources nineteen genera were recovered from both treated distribution network and process water and non treated water spring water and bottled mineral water acidovorax bacillus bosea brevundimonas caulobacter chryseobacterium deinococcus dyadobacter flavobacterium hydrogenophaga methylobacterium microbacterium mycobacterium paenibacillus pedobacter pseudomonas sphingobium sphingomonas and sphingopyxis nine genera were isolated only from distribution networks acinetobacter blastomonas domibacillus ensifer micrococcus novosphingobium porphyrobacter pseudoxanthomonas and shinella eight genera were recovered only from process water cloacibacterium ideonella massilia nocardioides novispirillum rheinheimera rhodoferax and roseomonas similarly for non treated water samples a total of six genera were exclusively recovered in spring water aeromicrobium herminiimonas nocardia psychrobacillus williamsia and xanthomonas and finally regarding bottled natural mineral water samples 11 different genera were identified as aquabacterium bradyrhizobium janibacter limnobacter methylibium pararhizobium phyllobacterium polaromonas psychrobacter rhizobium and variovorax 3 3 the drinking water library the dwl constructed in this study fig 2 includes 319 msps generated for isolates unmatched to the bdal database and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing 120 representing the different clusters in which the isolates were grouped table s2 also included are spectra from reference strains 199 selected for their environmental or water related origins table s1 the maldi tof ms identification capacity increased when using the dwl with the newly incorporated msps as half the genera in the library were absent from the bdal database at the beginning of the study in 2016 the bdal database included 428 bacterial genera which allowed the identification of 35 of drinking water isolates the msps included in the dwl correspond to species belonging to 96 bacterial genera table 1 44 of which were absent from the bdal database and one was potentially a new genus for the remaining 52 genera 74 msps corresponding to one or more species were included reaching a total of 319 msps the predominant genera were mucilaginibacter with 10 msps followed by bosea with 5 msps and aquabacterium chitinimonas and polaromonas with 3 msps each the newly added genera are shown in table 1 of the 44 new genera included in the dwl 30 correspond to reference strains and 14 to isolates from treated water and non treated water at the species level the dwl database provides 189 species not represented in the bdal database 67 of which are potentially new taxa independently of their origin whether environmental or reference strains the new msps expanded the in house database and improved the capacity of maldi tof ms to identify drinking water isolates distribution of the dwl msps per genera and origin is shown in table 1 briefly the genera included in the dwl were represented by variable numbers of msps the most highly represented genus was aeromonas with 38 msp entries 11 9 followed by chryseobacterium with 22 msps 6 9 flavobacterium with 18 msps 5 6 sphingomonas with 13 msps 4 1 and methylobacterium with 11 msps 3 4 the genera pedobacter pseudomonas sphingopyxis and mucilaginibacter contributed 10 msps 3 1 each whereas brevundimonas provided 9 msps 2 8 psychrobacter 8 msps 2 5 mycobacterium 7 msps 2 2 and sphingobium and paenibacillus 6 msps 1 9 each the genera blastomonas rhodococcus bosea novosphigobium and caulobacter provided 5 msps 1 6 each and the genera bacillus rheinheimera and massilia 4 msps 1 3 each 3 4 validation of the dwl database the newly developed dwl was validated by a internal assays with reference cect strains and drinking water isolates b external blind trials c re identification of the drinking water isolates recovered in this project and d identification of new isolates from routine laboratory analysis 3 4 1 internal assays an internal assay was carried out with 9 cect reference strains cect 317 brevundimonas diminuta cect 7302 chryseobacterium aquaticum cect 7791 flavobacterium tructae cect 5998 methylobacterium aquaticum cect 7550 mucilaginibacter myungsuensis cect 7273 mycobacterium llatzerense cect 153 paenibacillus polymyxa cect 7114 pedobacter aquatilis and cect 8016 sphingopyxis italica the selection was based on the bacterial diversity found in drinking water and protein extraction difficulty in order to challenge the identification capacity of the new database the strains were analyzed by maldi tof ms as described in material and methods direct transfer formic acid extended direct transfer and acid acetonitrile extraction methods six out of the nine strains were successfully identified at the species level with scores of 2 04 2 55 two strains were identified at the genus level 1 73 1 94 and one was not identified 1 48 1 56 table s3 in general differences between extraction methods were not observed the score values being very close strain cect 7273 mycobacterium llatzerenze was only identified to the genus level by the extraction method score 1 73 1 80 as described in other studies due to their complex cell walls mycobacterium spp require a specific extraction method for a better protein recovery which may affect maldi tof results alcolea medina et al 2019 strain cect 153 paenibacillus polymyxa was not identified scores 1 49 1 56 when using the dwl but genus level identification was achieved with the bdal database scores 1 84 1 98 it is well known that sporulation can affect identification by maldi tof analysis as spores differ in protein content compared to vegetative cells lasch et al 2009 3 4 2 external blind trials for external validation four rounds of proficiency testing of the dwl were carried out each round involving at least three spanish research centers and 29 strains table s4 which represents about 10 of the dwl content one batch of cell culture was prepared per strain and distributed among the centers for the parallel analysis by maldi tof ms using the acid acetonitrile extraction method and the mass spectrometer device available in the center in all three different instruments were used as a result 81 of measurements resulted in identification at probable species level score 2 000 and 13 at probable genus level score 1 700 1 999 6 not leading to identification score 1 699 in general spectra were consistent although occasional inter laboratory and even intra laboratory variability was observed differences in log score values between research centers can be explained either because of the cell composition sporulated cultures cell wall complexity the elapsed time before sample processing the conditions of sample preservation or sample handling likewise inter laboratory differences in analytical sensitivity were registered for certain taxonomic groups that are nearly identical by 16s rrna gene sequencing janda and abbott 2007 this was the case of strain flavobacterium sp cect 9288 for which the highest log score value matched a closely related phylogenetic species of the genus flavobacterium as a result two out of six centers only achieved identification at the genus level slightly different results were observed depending on the spectrometer device used for some strains profiles clustered separately in microflex vs ultraflextreme ultraflex ii moreover the quality of spectra also directly affected the results the higher laser intensity of automatic compared to manual acquisition may produce background noise that impairs sensitivity resulting in false or unreliable classification for instance one of the six laboratories in the trial acquired three spectra for strain cect 9470 phyllobacterium myrsinacearum yet identification at species level was achieved with only one spectrum 3 4 3 re identification of the drinking water isolates recovered in this study the extended database bdal plus dwl allowed offline re analysis of isolates unidentified with previously acquired spectra the performances of both databases are shown in fig 3 the bdal database could identify 35 of isolates to levels of probable genus score 1 700 1 999 secure genus and probable species score 2 000 2 299 or highly probable species identification score 2 300 3 000 which increased up to 95 when the dwl was used as well the bdal library alone failed to identify 2088 54 8 of the isolates whereas 618 16 2 were identified at the genus level and 1103 29 at the species level in contrast when the same spectra were searched against the bdal database plus the dwl the identification performance improved by 47 2904 of the isolates being identified at the species level 76 2 and 296 remaining unidentified 7 8 the unidentified fraction corresponded to single representatives non clustered isolates not included in the dwl as they were detected only once throughout the study in general the addition of new msp entries in the dwl increased the coverage of genus and species diversity thereby improving the discrimination capacity of the original database as a result see fig 1 b 714 isolates from the distribution networks were successfully identified at the species level 65 8 263 at the genus level 24 2 and 108 isolates remained unknown 10 the results for process water samples were similar from a total of 1085 isolates 240 were identified at species level 54 3 122 at genus level 27 6 and 80 remained unknown 18 1 in the two groups the percentage of unknown samples decreased by 38 9 and 23 5 respectively when using dwl surprisingly this reduction was significantly greater for the bottled natural mineral water samples when the 1926 spectra were searched against the extended database 1671 were identified at the species level 86 8 and another 157 8 2 at the genus level only 98 isolates remained unidentified which represented an improvement of 60 9 over the bdal database fig 1 a the extended database also gave better results in spring water samples a total of 97 2 346 out of 356 of isolates were successfully identified 78 4 at species level and 18 8 at genus level with only 10 isolates unidentified as shown the dwl contributed new mpss on environmental strains lacking in the original database and constitutes a good tool for the routine testing of drinking water samples although databases are frequently updated by the providers results of the present study highlighted in accordance with other authors de carolis et al 2014 kopcakova et al 2014 rahi et al 2016 seuylemezian et al 2018 that there is a need for continuously updated in house databases to increase taxonomic resolution especially for microbial ecology studies 4 conclusions the drinking water library presented here is composed of 319 maldi tof ms profiles of 120 bacteria isolated from different drinking water sources distribution networks and mineral water of different origins mainly catalonia north east spain andorra and the south of france and a selection of 199 reference strains of environmental or water related origin from the spanish type culture collection the new library created using bruker ultraflextreme maldi tof ms equipment contains msps for 164 species of 53 genera already included in the bruker daltonics database increasing the species coverage and 67 possible new species belonging to 44 genera not previously included strains of 120 bacteria including representative strains of potential new species were deposited at the cect for public accession following the established protocols further studies are in progress to elucidate the taxonomic status of strains that might belong to new taxa the new dwl which extended the original bruker daltonics database with 319 new msps for 96 genera from water and other related environments improved the resolution power for bacterial identification by up to 76 overall bacterial identification by maldi tof ms is an easy and fast high throughput technique with low running costs and remarkable specificity in the present study there were slight differences in the results between spectrometers but the method still proved a good choice for interlaboratory collaboration moreover using the formic acid extended direct transfer protocol allowed the operation time to be significantly reduced and when combined with the dwl it provided a rapid and successful identification of drinking water bacteria able to improve identification maldi tof ms and the dwl constitute an excellent tool for multiple applications ranging from basic research on water bacterial communities to routine analysis i e in water testing

16732,in flow anode systems surface bound hydroxyl radicals oh are generated at the solid liquid interface of suspended particulate charge carriers at potentials well below that required for oxygen evolution as a result of water splitting while these surface bound radicals are powerful indiscriminant oxidants that often lead to complete mineralization of organic pollutants the more selective process of direct electron transfer det may also occur at the particle electrode interfaces and play a critical role in the degradation of some contaminants in this study we investigated det processes in a flow anode system in which carbon black was utilized as the flow anode material and pt ti irru and irta meshes were used as the current collectors the results indicate that the use of a carbon black flow anode enhanced the det rate by 20 times at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment with no carbon black particles present low solution conductivity had a more obvious negative effect on the det process compared to oh mediated oxidation due to the high potential drop and inhibition of mass transfer processes at the solid liquid interfaces of the anode particles the det rates were dependent on the particular anode current collector used i e ti irru irta or pt mesh with differences in rates ascribed to the electron transfer resistance of the current collectors in the flow anode system detailed investigation of the degradation of phenol in a flow anode system revealed that this widely studied contaminant could be degraded with an energy consumption of 3 08 kwh m 3 a value substantially lower than that required with other techniques results of this study provide a better understanding of the det mechanism at the solid solid and solid liquid interfaces with these insights expected to benefit the design of flow anode materials and current collectors and lead to the improvement in performance of flow anode systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow anode carbon black current collector electron transfer 1 introduction electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop have been proposed as a promising treatment technology for the degradation of toxic or biorefractory organic compounds in water and wastewater martínez huitle and panizza 2018 martínez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 traditional eaop reactors consist of two parallel plate electrodes placed at a distance of several millimeters with water flowing through the narrow channel between the plate electrodes in what is termed flow by mode the steady state diffusion layer thickness of the flow by electrochemical reactors can be as high as 100 µm chaplin 2014 which limits the accessibility of surface hydroxyl radicals oh to aqueous organic compounds this leads to the mass transport process in conventional electrochemical reactors becoming rate limiting in order to overcome this issue porous electrodes operated in a flow through mode also referred to as reactive electrochemical membranes rems have been developed that can promote the mass transfer significantly due to a sharp decrease of the diffusion layer thickness and a high number of surface active sites le et al 2019 shi et al 2019 theoretical calculations show that the thickness of the diffusion layer of porous electrodes can be less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates in flow through operation however a high permeate flux may promote the oxygen evolution reaction oer by sweeping gas bubbles from the rem surface leading to a low contaminant removal rate and low current efficiency trellu et al 2018 besides smaller pore size and high flow rates result in higher pressure drop across the rem and increase the possibility of pore blockage jing et al 2016 with an additional energy cost associated with maintaining flow through the electrochemical system chaplin 2014 alternatively fixed bed or fluidized bed systems in which particle electrodes are packed or fluidized between the parallel anode and cathode in an undivided electrochemical cell have been shown to be particularly effective in water wastewater treatment li et al 2019 meng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the mechanism for the enhanced performance relates to the formation of bipolar particles that may however cause short circuiting of the system zhang et al 2013 resulting in reduction in energy and current efficiencies recently we have proposed a novel flow anode system in which a cation exchange membrane cem is used as a separator and salt bridge for the anode current collector and the cathode with the flow anode materials capable of oxidizing water to surface bound hydroxyl radicals oh at an ultralow anode potential xie et al 2021 this design avoids the risk of short circuiting but maintains good performance even under dilute conditions the energy consumption per order of magnitude removal eeo of tetracycline and orange ii were reported to be 6 7 and 1 5 wh m 3 which is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than that possible by other techniques xie et al 2021 anodic oxidation of organic compounds occurs via two mechanisms namely direct electron transfer det and hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation our recent study has shown that the flow anode system can efficiently generate and utilize oh to degrade various organic compounds while hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation is critical to the degradation of a wide range of organic compounds the det process where organic compounds lose electrons directly at the anode surface also plays a key role in the oxidation of some recalcitrant compounds carter and farrell 2008 chaplin et al 2009 2010 song et al 2018 zhuo et al 2011 furthermore electron donation of organic compounds at the anode may result in the formation of radical species e g r which are more likely to react with oh according to density functional theory simulations by gayen et al 2018 the reaction energy of r with oh is significantly lower than that of r with oh which means that the occurrence of an initial det process may well be followed by a thermodynamically favorable reaction of resulting intermediates with oh for instance the ndma 2 intermediate formed via loss of two electrons from the parent ndma to the anode can react with oh without an activation barrier chaplin et al 2009 although we have discussed the surface oh generation mechanisms in a flow anode system in our previous work xie et al 2021 a gap in understanding of the det process in a flow anode system and how this process promotes oxidation of organic compounds still remains in this study we investigated the det mechanism in a flow anode system using oxalate which has a low reaction rate with oh k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 as a det probe carbon black cb which exhibits good det activity toward the oxidation of oxalate was chosen as the representative anode material xie et al 2020b and different current collectors made of pt ti irta and irru were used to examine the impact of the interaction between the anode material i e cb and anode current collectors on the det process and resultant oxalate oxidation efficiencies in addition phenol was used as a model pollutant as the oxidation of phenol on the surface of cb is recognized to involve a contribution from det boudenne and cerclier 1999 boudenne et al 1996 the overarching goal of this study is to develop a better understanding of the det process in a flow anode system and to clarify the criteria for choice of the flow anode materials and the anode current collectors such that the use of flow anode systems for contaminant degradation can be optimized 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials pt irta and irru meshes purchased from kunshan yiwan co ltd china were used as the

all solutions a solid cb electrode was prepared to investigate the electrochemical properties of the cb powder the detailed preparation method can be found in section s1 of supplementary information 2 2 experimental setup the homemade flow anode reactor fig 1 was used to conduct experiments in a three electrode system with the electrical field provided by a chi 660e electrochemical workstation the anode tank where cb was used as the anode material and the cathode tank where ti mesh was used as the cathode were separated by a cation exchange membrane fujifilm europe the effective area and the percentage of opening of the ti mesh were 16 cm2 and 35 respectively pt ti irta and irru meshes were used as the anode current collectors with these meshes exhibiting an effective area of 16 cm2 and a percentage of opening of 20 an ag agcl reference electrode 196 mv vs she was located 0 5 cm away from the anode current collector in the anode tank the supporting electrolytes were kh2po4 solutions with studies conducted over a range of electrolyte concentrations 1 5 and 50 mm magnetic stirring was used to maintain the anode particles in suspension with the stirring rate set to 120 rpm the kh2po4 electrolyte is electrochemically inert at least under the conditions used in this study and as such no redox reactions associated with the solution matrix are expected 2 3 characterization of the electrodes scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova usa was used to evaluate the structure size and surface morphology of the cb particles x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps equipped with a mono chromatic x ray source using al kα radiation 1486 68 ev was used to characterize the binding energies of elements on the cb and ti mesh surface the c 1 s o 1 s and ti 2p peak spectra were analyzed using xps peak version 4 1 the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the cb were measured on an asap 2010 micrometitics norcross instrument via nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests at 77 k followed by bjh calculation ftir spectra were collected at a rate of 0 2 cm s 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 using a perkin elmer frontier ir spectrophotometer a chi 660e electrochemical working station was used to conduct different electrochemical characterization experiments such as linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurement the lsv measurements were conducted in a solution containing 50 mm kh2po4 and 1 mm oxalate in order to determine the oer potentials and oxalate oxidation potentials the eis measurements were performed over the frequency range of 10 3 106 hz in a 50 5 or 1 mm kh2po4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate at open circuit potential ocp the impedance data was fitted using z view software the model circuit shown in fig s1 was used to simulate eis data where w 1 is the warburg diffusion resistance cpe1 is the double layer capacitance r ct is the equivalent polarization resistance and r s is the equivalent series resistance the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e electrochemical working stations one was used for polarization of the anode current collector and the other to measure the potentials in the solutions by using an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode all the electrochemical tests in this work were corrected with ir compensation 2 4 calculations and analyses the concentrations of oxalate and phenol were determined at predetermined time intervals and measured using high performance liquid chromatography with a c18 column and a uv detector wavelength 210 nm for oxalate and wavelength 270 nm for phenol the mobile phases consisted of h3po4 ph 2 5 acetonitrile at 80 20 v v for oxalate and acetonitrile di water at 70 30 v v for phenol with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 jing and chaplin 2017 xie et al 2020b the solution conductivity was measured via a conductivity meter con bta vernier the eeo can be obtained according to eq 1 1 e e o e i d t v t log c t o 0 c t o t where t is the time v is the solution volume 100 ml e is the cell potential the total charge idt c could be calculated by the integration of the corresponding current i over time t where c to 0 and c to t are the initial molar concentration of target organic compound and that at time t respectively pseudo first order rate constants were calculated using eq 2 2 c t o t c t o 0 exp k a p p t where kapp represents the apparent rate constant min 1 the concentration of oh was obtained by eq 3 3 oh k dta k dta oh where k dta is the first order apparent rate constant for dta oxidation assuming that oh is at steady state and kdta oh is the second order reaction rate constant for the reaction between dta and oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 the initial maximum rates of oxalate and phenol removal by oh can be estimated according to eq 4 4 k r k r oh r oh where k r oh is the second order reaction rate constants k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s

collector sem micrographs of the cb particles fig 2 a indicated that the size of the cb particles is in a range of 74 98 nm the pore structure and the bet specific surface area of the cb particles were then evaluated using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measurements as shown in fig 2b the specific surface area calculated by the bet method is 281 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter is 8 0 nm indicating a moderate physical adsorption capacity the raman spectra of the particles revealed relatively broad d and g bands at 1350 cm 1 and 160 cm 1 respectively with the width of these bands a result of the small crystallite size and high degree of disorder fig 2c the position of these bands is indicative of sp2 bonds c c jawhari et al 1995 xie et al 2020a which is consistent with the xps results fig 2d in addition the c 1 s spectrum of the cb particles indicated the minor presence of other surface groups including c c 285 3 ev c o 286 3 ev c o 287 5 ev and o c o 288 7 ev fig 2d gong et al 2020 the electrochemical activities of the anode current collectors and the cb electrode were evaluated using lsv with oer and oxalate oxidation potentials determined in a 50 mm kh2po4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate oxalate was added to probe the faradaic current resulting from if any electron transfer from oxalate to the flow anode xie et al 2020b as shown in fig 2e the oer potentials of irru irta pt and ti current collectors are 1 11 1 14 1 28 and 1 61 v vs ag agcl respectively with a notable oxidation pe observed at 1 1 v vs ag agcl for the carbon electrode which can be attributed to oxalate oxidation as there was no oxidation peak in the control experiment fig s2 while the lsv results showed the critical potential above which direct oxidation of organics may occur on the solid electrode surface it should be noted that the potential drops across the flow electrode as a result of higher ohmic resistances would require compensation in order to initiate the det process as such higher potentials such as 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the oxalate oxidation potential were chosen at which to conduct the following experiments although surface hydroxyl radicals may be formed at these potentials oxalate oxidation mediated by hydroxyl radicals is largely excluded considering the relatively low reaction rate k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 the rate of removal of oxalate by oh was estimated by determining the steady state concentration of oh generated during the oxidation process using disodium terephthalate dta as the oh probe since it has a high redox potential e 2 76 v she jing and chaplin 2017 and can react with both surface bound and free hydroxyl radicals liu et al 2019 the first order apparent rate constant for oh mediated dta oxidation 2 10 4 s 1 was obtained at 1 5 v vs ag agcl in 50 mm kh2po4 solution fig s3 thus the oxalate removal rate by oh was estimated to be 4 2 10 6 min 1 which is far less than the oxalate removal rate 0 19 min 1 obtained in the flow anode system at 1 5 v fig 3 b compared to conventional solid electrodes where the oxidation of organics occurs at the solid liquid i e electrode electrolyte interface the transfer of electrons in the flow anode may occur via multiple pathways including electrode particle to electrode particle transfer or transfer via direct contact with the current collector 3 2 evaluation of the det process in flow anodic oxidation oxalate was used in the first instance as the probe to investigate the det process in the flow anode system cb particles were used as the flow anode due to their low cost excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity ma et al 2019 pt mesh was chosen as the starting current collector to explore and optimize the flow anode system due to its high electrochemical surface stability under anodic polarization since any change of the current collector surface may have a significant effect on the electron transfer processes chakraborty et al 2020 chattot et al 2019 guo et al 2020 note that the contributions of physical sorption and electro adsorption to the removal of oxalate were respectively evaluated at the open circuit potential and 0 6 v vs ag agcl with results indicating that physical sorption effects in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions are minimal but should be considered in 5 and 1 mm kh2po4 solutions fig s4 while electro adsorption effects can be ignored in all solutions fig s5 the electro adsorbed oxalate at 0 6 v was released into solution when a reverse voltage was applied while there was no oxalate released into solution when 1 5 v was applied fig s5 with these results showing that electro adsorption can facilitate the removal of oxalate with subsequent complete oxidation of oxalate by the det process in the flow anode system provided the applied potential is high enough time course results of oxalate oxidation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no flow anode materials in the anolyte are shown in fig 3a while the cb particle mass 1 0 g was much less than that of the anodic current collector 7 8 g the addition of cb into the anode tank significantly increased the removal rate of oxalate however the addition of tixo2x 1 which mainly consisted of magneli phase titanium sub oxide of approximate stoichiometry ti4o7 fig s6 was unable to obviously accelerate the oxalate oxidation process in view of the relatively high electron transfer resistance of tixo2x 1 at least under the conditions tested in this study these findings show that the selection of the flow anode material is vital to the efficacy of the det process in a flow anode system oxalate oxidation was also investigated in 50 mm na2so4 solution with results showing that the oxalate removal rate in na2so4 solution was faster than that in kh2po4 solution fig s7 this difference in oxalate removal rates can most likely be ascribed to the higher conductivity of na2so4 solution 12 180 16 µs cm 1 compared to that of kh2po4 solution 6372 9 µs cm 1 the ph value of the 50 mm na2so4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate changed from 3 32 at the start of the experiment to 5 72 at the end of experiment the effects of the cb loads were investigated at 1 5 v in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions containing 1 mm oxalate fig s8 the apparent rate constant for oxalate oxidation increases with increase of cb loads through plateaus at higher cb loads 10 g l 1 fig s8 with this result indicating that charge transfer between the anode current collector and flow anode particles is effectively saturated at high cb loads therefore the following experiments were conducted in kh2po4 solutions containing 10 g l 1 cb if not otherwise stated compared to the control the apparent rate constants when using cb as the flow anode increased from 0 007 to 0 144 min 1 at 1 0 v in a 50 mm kh2po4 solution much larger apparent rate constants of 0 154 0 161 and 0 190 min 1 were obtained at 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 v respectively fig 3a and b however the removal of oxalate was obviously inhibited at 2 0 v in all likelihood as a result of both the extensive oxidation of cb fig s9 and the generation of oxygen at the surface of the pt mesh that occurred at this potential fig s10 the presence of c o 287 5 ev and o c o 288 7 ev at the surface of cb obviously increased the electron transfer resistance and thus inhibited the oxidation of oxalate gao et al 2015 xie et al 2020b it should be noted that ph excursion during the tests in fig 3b was minimal with results showing that the solution ph values changed from 3 69 at the start of the experiments to 3 78 3 83 3 85 3 91 or 3 66 at the end of experiments when 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 or 2 0 v was applied respectively indicating that oxalate pka values are 1 27 and 4 27 was always in negative monovalent state during the oxidation process low solution conductivity also had a negative effect on the electron transfer process smaller apparent rate constants of 0 085 and 0 053 min 1 were observed in 5 and 1 mm kh2po4 solutions at 1 5 v vs ag agcl compared to that in 50 mm kh2po4 solution fig 3c and d it should be noted that the enhancement by the flow anode compared to the control became less significant with a decrease in the solution conductivity fig 3b d indicating the critical role of the solution conductivity in the det process in the flow anode system the addition of 1 wt cb increased the conductivity of 1 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions from 135 3 611 5 and 5573 8 µs cm 1 to 338 5 883 6 and 6372 9 µs cm 1 respectively fig 4 a as shown in fig s4 the presence of the lewis base h2po4 influences the sorption of oxalate on the carbon surface with competition for sorption sites particularly severe at higher phosphate concentrations however results of this study showed that this effect was not significant in the flow anode system with increasing rate and extent of removal of oxalate on increasing the phosphate buffer concentration presumably the higher potential drop and the higher electron transfer resistance of the flow anode in a dilute environment accounted for the lower oxidation efficiency to confirm this the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e systems fig 4b and c the rate of potential drop in the 1 mm kh2po4 solution 0 022 v cm 1 was higher than that in 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions 0 017 and 0 011 v cm 1 in accord with the expected higher ohmic resistance in solutions with a low ionic strength in addition the initial solution potentials leaving the anode current collector were 1 22 1 35 and 1 48 v vs ag agcl respectively in 1 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions at 1 5 v vs ag agcl fig 4b indicating that a more dilute electrolyte concentration resulted in a more significant potential loss at the interface of the anode current collector the potential drop rates and the initial potential losses in the corresponding controls were both larger compared to that in the flow anode system due to the obviously lower solution conductivities fig 4c this was further confirmed by the eis analysis the fitted parameter values according to the equivalent circuit are summarized in table s1 unsurprisingly r s and r ct values gradually increased from 1 77 to 14 48 ω and 2 50 to 25 82 ω respectively with kh2po4 concentration decrease from 50 to 1 mm fig 4d and table s1 warburg diffusion resistances also increased from 11 24 to 342 5 ω fig 4d and table s1 showing a retarded mass transfer process in 1 mm kh2po4 solution likewise the r s r ct and warburg diffusion resistances in the control increased more significantly fig 4d and table s1 due to the absence of cb therefore we assume that the rate of the det process occurring at the solid liquid interface in the flow anode system is closely related to the solution conductivity with the presence of the flow anode cb particles enhancing the det rate due to the reduced resistance 3 3 influence of anode current collectors on the det process the direct contact of the flow anode with the current collector plays an important role in charge transfer with increasing potential loss observed on increasing distance from the surface of the anode current collector as a result the influence of the anode current collector on the det process in the flow anode system was investigated using cb as the flow anode material temporal changes of aqueous oxalate concentrations with use of ti irru and irta meshes as the anode current collectors at an anode potential of 1 5 v vs ag agcl are shown in fig 5 a c the initial removal rates of oxalate were 0 051 0 085 and 0 11 min 1 respectively when using ti irru and irta meshes compared to 0 003 0 012 and 0 014 min 1 in the control indicating the effectiveness of the flow anodic oxidation under various conditions the different oxalate removal rates should be associated with the particular electron transfer resistance at the electrode current collector interfaces it can be seen from fig s11 that the initial solution potential values were 1 31 1 41 and 1 45 v at 0 cm from the ti irru and irta anode current collectors though the same potential drop rates were measured different r ct values of 14 45 6 16 and 5 27 ω were obtained according to the impedance spectra fig 5d when using ti irru and irta meshes respectively these findings indicate that use of an anode current collector with a high charge transfer resistance at the interface would cause a significant initial potential loss and deteriorate the det efficiency the low efficiency when using the ti current collector is likely associated with the low chemical stability of ti to oxidation tioh was initially observed on the surface of the ti current collector fig s12 to further confirm this issue polarization at 3 0 v for 3 h was conducted to grow a passive film tioh on the surface of ti mesh sarkar and khan 2019 sham and lazarus 1979 the intensity of the o2 peak of the polarized ti mesh significantly decreased with the intensities of the peaks i e oh s and tioh relating to the increasing extent of formation of the passive film fig s12 as expected the flow anode system with the polarized ti mesh exhibited an extremely low oxalate removal rate of 0 001 min 1 at 1 5 v vs ag agcl fig 5a indicating that the electron transfer between the flow anode cb particles and the polarized ti mesh was limited due to the high charge transfer resistance of the passive film in contrast the oxalate removal rates remained the same when using pt irru and irta meshes as the anode current collectors after polarization at 3 0 v for 5 h with no change observed in the xps spectra fig s13 and fig s14 indicating the high electrochemical stability of these anode current collectors in regard to the obtained results we ascribe the enhanced det rates in flow anodic oxidation to the substantial increase in active surface sites and small increase in solution conductivity provided by the cb particles once an appropriate anode potential is applied to the anode current collector cb particles in the anolyte will be positively polarized and have the capability of oxidizing oxalate to co2 in view of the limited potential drop in the highly conductive flow anode the enhanced det rates are significantly affected by the following two aspects first the potential drop across the flow anode plays a vital role in determining the det efficiency fig 6 a with the extent of this decrease dependent on the conductivity of the solution the addition of cb obviously increased the solution conductivity a higher conductivity provides a smaller potential drop and a faster mass transfer rate thus resulting in a higher oxalate removal rate second the initial potential drop at the anode current collector interface is related to the electron transfer resistance at the interface fig 6b which is determined by the electrochemical property of the anode current collector and the solution conductivity a smaller r ct at the interface has a positive effect on the det process in the flow anode system 3 4 application of the flow anode system to oxidation of phenol the outcomes of this study are applicable to the range of organic compounds that are oxidized via the det process phenol a typical refractory organic compound was introduced as a more realistic contaminant than oxalate the adsorption isotherms of phenol on cb are categorized as freundlich type asakawa and ogino 1984 asakawa et al 1985 the experimental adsorption data was fitted by the freundlich isotherm model eq 5 5 q e k c e 1 n where q e is the amount of phenol adsorbed on a unit weight of carbon mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 and k and 1 n are the freundlich constants k is an empirical constant equal to the intercept at c e 1 mg l 1 and 1 n is the slope of the line on a log log plot since phenol can be oxidized via the det process at an anode potential from 1 1 to 1 6 v vs she jiang et al 2017 lizhang et al 2016 sun et al 2012 the det process would be expected to play a critical role in the oxidation of phenol on the surface of cb especially at a potential significantly lower than the oer potential boudenne and cerclier 1999 ren et al 2019 the contribution of hydroxyl radicals to phenol oxidation was also estimated according to fig s3 with results showing that the calculated apparent rate constant for phenol oxidation by hydroxyl radicals was 0 01 min 1 a value somewhat less than that 0 018 min 1 in the flow anode system at 1 5 v vs ag agcl as such results of this study indicate that both hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation and det oxidation processes play an important role in the oxidation of phenol in the flow anode system as shown in fig 7 a the flow anode system enhanced the removal of phenol by 450 in 60 mins at 1 5 v vs ag agcl by deducting the amount of phenol sorbed on cb according to the freundlich isotherm fig 7b it was estimated that 67 6 of the phenol present was removed via electrochemical oxidation the total organic carbon toc concentration of the solution was further investigated showing that the flow anode system increased the removal of toc from 6 5 to 35 7 compared to the control fig s15 it should be noted that electrosorption contributed minimally to the removal of phenol fig s16 since phenol pka 10 will be electrically neutral in the ph 4 52 kh2po4 buffer solution the solution ph decreased slightly throughout the oxidation process with a ph of 4 21 at the end of the experiment in addition the apparent rate constants for phenol removal were maintained consistent over 10 successive cycles of operation fig 7d with this result indicating that the flow anode particles were not passivated by polymer deposition on their surfaces further evidence in support of this conclusion can be seen in the ftir spectra shown in fig s17 with no obvious difference between the spectra of cb before and after the phenol oxidation process indicating that the surfaces of the cb particles were not covered by phenolic polymers the minimal extent of adsorption including electro sorption of phenol to the cb particles may account for the apparent lack of presence of polymeric products on the cb particle surfaces additionally as noted by chaplin 2014 the polymer formation pathway can be minimized by oxidation of phenols via reaction with oh with this a possible reason why polymer deposition on the cb particles did not appear to be significant as described earlier the generation of oh in the flow anode system at 1 5 v was investigated using dta as the oh probe the calculated steady state oh concentration in the flow anode system at 1 5 v is 5 10 11 mol l 1 with this concentration potentially sufficient to alleviate the formation of polymers on the surface of cb in support of this conclusion no change in the functional groups at the surface of the cb particles before and after long term oxidation operation in the presence of 400 mg l 1 phenol was discernible fig s18 in addition a long term 10 h polarization on cb particles at 1 5 v vs ag agcl without phenol was performed only minor change in the functional groups at the surface of the cb particles according to the xps results fig s19 was observed with this result indicating a high degree of electrochemical stability at least under the conditions investigated in this study tixo2x 1 was also used as the flow anode to oxidize phenol with results showing that only 47 8 of phenol was removed fig 7a this relatively limited extent of removal can be attributed to its low specific surface area and high mass density compared to cb leading to insignificant adsorption of phenol to these particles fig s20 and a lower particle number per unit volume in the anode tank however the eeo of phenol using tixo2x 1 2 42 kwh m 3 was lower than that using cb 3 08 kwh m 3 with the higher energy consumption in the case of cb possibly related to the occurrence of side reactions e g oxygen evolution on carbon materials with these reactions leading to a lower current efficiency the eeo of phenol in the flow anode system is compared with other decontamination techniques in fig 7c fajardo et al 2017 lee et al 2017 lizhang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 yavuz and koparal 2006 the energy consumption of the flow anode system is much lower than that of other techniques with this comparison highlighting the commercial opportunities of this novel flow anodic oxidation electrochemical technology moreover the concomitant production of h2 and h2o2 and or the reduction of co2 in the cathodic compartment would seem possible with this dual approach to utilization of flow electrodes further broadening the possibilities for energy exploitation and utilization chang et al 2016 choi et al 2019 xia et al 2019 as such we believe that flow anode cathode systems have considerable future potential in environment and energy applications 4 conclusions in this study the det processes occurring at the solid liquid and the solid solid interfaces in a flow anode system were investigated using different flow anode materials and anode current collectors our results indicate that the flow anode system can significantly enhance the det mediated oxidation of particular organic compounds with relatively low energy consumption the flow anode materials should possess catalytic behavior towards the target organic compound and exhibit high electrochemical stability the single metal and dimensional stable anode dsa meshes such as pt irru and irta with high electrochemical stability and low electron transfer resistance are appropriate candidates for the anode current collector in order to avoid energy loss during the electron transfer processes the solution conductivity which determines the potential drop and mass transfer processes in the flow anode plays a critical role and its limitation on use of the flow anode in dilute streams requires

16732,in flow anode systems surface bound hydroxyl radicals oh are generated at the solid liquid interface of suspended particulate charge carriers at potentials well below that required for oxygen evolution as a result of water splitting while these surface bound radicals are powerful indiscriminant oxidants that often lead to complete mineralization of organic pollutants the more selective process of direct electron transfer det may also occur at the particle electrode interfaces and play a critical role in the degradation of some contaminants in this study we investigated det processes in a flow anode system in which carbon black was utilized as the flow anode material and pt ti irru and irta meshes were used as the current collectors the results indicate that the use of a carbon black flow anode enhanced the det rate by 20 times at 1 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the control experiment with no carbon black particles present low solution conductivity had a more obvious negative effect on the det process compared to oh mediated oxidation due to the high potential drop and inhibition of mass transfer processes at the solid liquid interfaces of the anode particles the det rates were dependent on the particular anode current collector used i e ti irru irta or pt mesh with differences in rates ascribed to the electron transfer resistance of the current collectors in the flow anode system detailed investigation of the degradation of phenol in a flow anode system revealed that this widely studied contaminant could be degraded with an energy consumption of 3 08 kwh m 3 a value substantially lower than that required with other techniques results of this study provide a better understanding of the det mechanism at the solid solid and solid liquid interfaces with these insights expected to benefit the design of flow anode materials and current collectors and lead to the improvement in performance of flow anode systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract

degradation of toxic or biorefractory organic compounds in water and wastewater martínez huitle and panizza 2018 martínez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 traditional eaop reactors consist of two parallel plate electrodes placed at a distance of several millimeters with water flowing through the narrow channel between the plate electrodes in what is termed flow by mode the steady state diffusion layer thickness of the flow by electrochemical reactors can be as high as 100 µm chaplin 2014 which limits the accessibility of surface hydroxyl radicals oh to aqueous organic compounds this leads to the mass transport process in conventional electrochemical reactors becoming rate limiting in order to overcome this issue porous electrodes operated in a flow through mode also referred to as reactive electrochemical membranes rems have been developed that can promote the mass transfer significantly due to a sharp decrease of the diffusion layer thickness and a high number of surface active sites le et al 2019 shi et al 2019 theoretical calculations show that the thickness of the diffusion layer of porous electrodes can be less than the electrode pore radius at high flow rates in flow through operation however a high permeate flux may promote the oxygen evolution reaction oer by sweeping gas bubbles from the rem surface leading to a low contaminant removal rate and low current efficiency trellu et al 2018 besides smaller pore size and high flow rates result in higher pressure drop across the rem and increase the possibility of pore blockage jing et al 2016 with an additional energy cost associated with maintaining flow through the electrochemical system chaplin 2014 alternatively fixed bed or fluidized bed systems in which particle electrodes are packed or fluidized between the parallel anode and cathode in an undivided electrochemical cell have been shown to be particularly effective in water wastewater treatment li et al 2019 meng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the mechanism for the enhanced performance relates to the formation of bipolar particles that may however cause short circuiting of the system zhang et al 2013 resulting in reduction in energy and current efficiencies recently we have proposed a novel flow anode system in which a cation exchange membrane cem is used as a separator and salt bridge for the anode current collector and the cathode with the flow anode materials capable of oxidizing water to surface bound hydroxyl radicals oh at an ultralow anode potential xie et al 2021 this design avoids the risk of short circuiting but maintains good performance even under dilute conditions the energy consumption per order of magnitude removal eeo of tetracycline and orange ii were reported to be 6 7 and 1 5 wh m 3 which is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than that possible by other techniques xie et al 2021 anodic oxidation of organic compounds occurs via two mechanisms namely direct electron transfer det and hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation our recent study has shown that the flow anode system can efficiently generate and utilize oh to degrade various organic compounds while hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation is critical to the degradation of a wide range of organic compounds the det process where organic compounds lose electrons directly at the anode surface also plays a key role in the oxidation of some recalcitrant compounds carter and farrell 2008 chaplin et al 2009 2010 song et al 2018 zhuo et al 2011 furthermore electron donation of organic compounds at the anode may result in the formation of radical species e g r which are more likely to react with oh according to density functional theory simulations by gayen et al 2018 the reaction energy of r with oh is significantly lower than that of r with oh which means that the occurrence of an initial det process may well be followed by a thermodynamically favorable reaction of resulting intermediates with oh for instance the ndma 2 intermediate formed via loss of two electrons from the parent ndma to the anode can react with oh without an activation barrier chaplin et al 2009 although we have discussed the surface oh generation mechanisms in a flow anode system in our previous work xie et al 2021 a gap in understanding of the det process in a flow anode system and how this process promotes oxidation of organic compounds still remains in this study we investigated the det mechanism in a flow anode system using oxalate which has a low reaction rate with oh k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 as a det probe carbon black cb which exhibits good det activity toward the oxidation of oxalate was chosen as the representative anode material xie et al 2020b and different current collectors made of pt ti irta and irru were used to examine the impact of the interaction between the anode material i e cb and anode current collectors on the det process and resultant oxalate oxidation efficiencies in addition phenol was used as a model pollutant as the oxidation of phenol on the surface of cb is recognized to involve a contribution from det boudenne and cerclier 1999 boudenne et al 1996 the overarching goal of this study is to develop a better understanding of the det process in a flow anode system and to clarify the criteria for choice of the flow anode materials and the anode current collectors such that the use of flow anode systems for contaminant degradation can be optimized 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials pt irta and irru meshes purchased from kunshan yiwan co ltd china were used as the

2 experimental setup the homemade flow anode reactor fig 1 was used to conduct experiments in a three electrode system with the electrical field provided by a chi 660e electrochemical workstation the anode tank where cb was used as the anode material and the cathode tank where ti mesh was used as the cathode were separated by a cation exchange membrane fujifilm europe the effective area and the percentage of opening of the ti mesh were 16 cm2 and 35 respectively pt ti irta and irru meshes were used as the anode current collectors with these meshes exhibiting an effective area of 16 cm2 and a percentage of opening of 20 an ag agcl reference electrode 196 mv vs she was located 0 5 cm away from the anode current collector in the anode tank the supporting electrolytes were kh2po4 solutions with studies conducted over a range of electrolyte concentrations 1 5 and 50 mm magnetic stirring was used to maintain the anode particles in suspension with the stirring rate set to 120 rpm the kh2po4 electrolyte is electrochemically inert at least under the conditions used in this study and as such no redox reactions associated with the solution matrix are expected 2 3 characterization of the electrodes scanning electron microscopy sem fei nova usa was used to evaluate the structure size and surface morphology of the cb particles x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps equipped with a mono chromatic x ray source using al kα radiation 1486 68 ev was used to characterize the binding energies of elements on the cb and ti mesh surface the c 1 s o 1 s and ti 2p peak spectra were analyzed using xps peak version 4 1 the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the cb were measured on an asap 2010 micrometitics norcross instrument via nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests at 77 k followed by bjh calculation ftir spectra were collected at a rate of 0 2 cm s 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 using a perkin elmer frontier ir spectrophotometer a chi 660e electrochemical working station was used to conduct different electrochemical characterization experiments such as linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurement the lsv measurements were conducted in a solution containing 50 mm kh2po4 and 1 mm oxalate in order to determine the oer potentials and oxalate oxidation potentials the eis measurements were performed over the frequency range of 10 3 106 hz in a 50 5 or 1 mm kh2po4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate at open circuit potential ocp the impedance data was fitted using z view software the model circuit shown in fig s1 was used to simulate eis data where w 1 is the warburg diffusion resistance cpe1 is the double layer capacitance r ct is the equivalent polarization resistance and r s is the equivalent series resistance the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e electrochemical working stations one was used for polarization of the anode current collector and the other to measure the potentials in the solutions by using an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode all the electrochemical tests in this work were corrected with ir compensation 2 4 calculations and analyses the concentrations of oxalate and phenol were determined at predetermined time intervals and measured using high performance liquid chromatography with a c18 column and a uv detector wavelength 210 nm for oxalate and wavelength 270 nm for phenol the mobile phases consisted of h3po4 ph 2 5 acetonitrile at 80 20 v v for oxalate and acetonitrile di water at 70 30 v v for phenol with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 jing and chaplin 2017 xie et al 2020b the solution conductivity was measured via a conductivity meter con bta vernier the eeo can be obtained according to eq 1 1 e e o e i d t v t log c t o 0 c t o t where t is the time v is the solution volume 100 ml e is the cell potential the total charge idt c could be calculated by the integration of the corresponding current i over time t where c to 0 and c to t are the initial molar concentration of target organic compound and that at time t respectively pseudo first order rate constants were calculated using eq 2 2 c t o t c t o 0 exp k a p p t where kapp represents the apparent rate constant min 1 the concentration of oh was obtained by eq 3 3 oh k dta k dta oh where k dta is the first order apparent rate constant for dta oxidation assuming that oh is at steady state and kdta oh is the second order reaction rate constant for the reaction between dta and oh 4 109 m 1 s 1 the initial maximum rates of oxalate and phenol removal by oh can be estimated according to eq 4 4 k r k r oh r oh where k r oh is the second order reaction rate constants k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s

collector sem micrographs of the cb particles fig 2 a indicated that the size of the cb particles is in a range of 74 98 nm the pore structure and the bet specific surface area of the cb particles were then evaluated using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measurements as shown in fig 2b the specific surface area calculated by the bet method is 281 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter is 8 0 nm indicating a moderate physical adsorption capacity the raman spectra of the particles revealed relatively broad d and g bands at 1350 cm 1 and 160 cm 1 respectively with the width of these bands a result of the small crystallite size and high degree of disorder fig 2c the position of these bands is indicative of sp2 bonds c c jawhari et al 1995 xie et al 2020a which is consistent with the xps results fig 2d in addition the c 1 s spectrum of the cb particles indicated the minor presence of other surface groups including c c 285 3 ev c o 286 3 ev c o 287 5 ev and o c o 288 7 ev fig 2d gong et al 2020 the electrochemical activities of the anode current collectors and the cb electrode were evaluated using lsv with oer and oxalate oxidation potentials determined in a 50 mm kh2po4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate oxalate was added to probe the faradaic current resulting from if any electron transfer from oxalate to the flow anode xie et al 2020b as shown in fig 2e the oer potentials of irru irta pt and ti current collectors are 1 11 1 14 1 28 and 1 61 v vs ag agcl respectively with a notable oxidation pe observed at 1 1 v vs ag agcl for the carbon electrode which can be attributed to oxalate oxidation as there was no oxidation peak in the control experiment fig s2 while the lsv results showed the critical potential above which direct oxidation of organics may occur on the solid electrode surface it should be noted that the potential drops across the flow electrode as a result of higher ohmic resistances would require compensation in order to initiate the det process as such higher potentials such as 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 v vs ag agcl compared to the oxalate oxidation potential were chosen at which to conduct the following experiments although surface hydroxyl radicals may be formed at these potentials oxalate oxidation mediated by hydroxyl radicals is largely excluded considering the relatively low reaction rate k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 the rate of removal of oxalate by oh was estimated by determining the steady state concentration of oh generated during the oxidation process using disodium terephthalate dta as the oh probe since it has a high redox potential e 2 76 v she jing and chaplin 2017 and can react with both surface bound and free hydroxyl radicals liu et al 2019 the first order apparent rate constant for oh mediated dta oxidation 2 10 4 s 1 was obtained at 1 5 v vs ag agcl in 50 mm kh2po4 solution fig s3 thus the oxalate removal rate by oh was estimated to be 4 2 10 6 min 1 which is far less than the oxalate removal rate 0 19 min 1 obtained in the flow anode system at 1 5 v fig 3 b compared to conventional solid electrodes where the oxidation of organics occurs at the solid liquid i e electrode electrolyte interface the transfer of electrons in the flow anode may occur via multiple pathways including electrode particle to electrode particle transfer or transfer via direct contact with the current collector 3 2 evaluation of the det process in flow anodic oxidation oxalate was used in the first instance as the probe to investigate the det process in the flow anode system cb particles were used as the flow anode due to their low cost excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity ma et al 2019 pt mesh was chosen as the starting current collector to explore and optimize the flow anode system due to its high electrochemical surface stability under anodic polarization since any change of the current collector surface may have a significant effect on the electron transfer processes chakraborty et al 2020 chattot et al 2019 guo et al 2020 note that the contributions of physical sorption and electro adsorption to the removal of oxalate were respectively evaluated at the open circuit potential and 0 6 v vs ag agcl with results indicating that physical sorption effects in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions are minimal but should be considered in 5 and 1 mm kh2po4 solutions fig s4 while electro adsorption effects can be ignored in all solutions fig s5 the electro adsorbed oxalate at 0 6 v was released into solution when a reverse voltage was applied while there was no oxalate released into solution when 1 5 v was applied fig s5 with these results showing that electro adsorption can facilitate the removal of oxalate with subsequent complete oxidation of oxalate by the det process in the flow anode system provided the applied potential is high enough time course results of oxalate oxidation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no flow anode materials in the anolyte are shown in fig 3a while the cb particle mass 1 0 g was much less than that of the anodic current collector 7 8 g the addition of cb into the anode tank significantly increased the removal rate of oxalate however the addition of tixo2x 1 which mainly consisted of magneli phase titanium sub oxide of approximate stoichiometry ti4o7 fig s6 was unable to obviously accelerate the oxalate oxidation process in view of the relatively high electron transfer resistance of tixo2x 1 at least under the conditions tested in this study these findings show that the selection of the flow anode material is vital to the efficacy of the det process in a flow anode system oxalate oxidation was also investigated in 50 mm na2so4 solution with results showing that the oxalate removal rate in na2so4 solution was faster than that in kh2po4 solution fig s7 this difference in oxalate removal rates can most likely be ascribed to the higher conductivity of na2so4 solution 12 180 16 µs cm 1 compared to that of kh2po4 solution 6372 9 µs cm 1 the ph value of the 50 mm na2so4 solution containing 1 mm oxalate changed from 3 32 at the start of the experiment to 5 72 at the end of experiment the effects of the cb loads were investigated at 1 5 v in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions containing 1 mm oxalate fig s8 the apparent rate constant for oxalate oxidation increases with increase of cb loads through plateaus at higher cb loads 10 g l 1 fig s8 with this result indicating that charge transfer between the anode current collector and flow anode particles is effectively saturated at high cb loads therefore the following experiments were conducted in kh2po4 solutions containing 10 g l 1 cb if not otherwise stated compared to the control the apparent rate constants when using cb as the flow anode increased from 0 007 to 0 144 min 1 at 1 0 v in a 50 mm kh2po4 solution much larger apparent rate constants of 0 154 0 161 and 0 190 min 1 were obtained at 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 v respectively fig 3a and b however the removal of oxalate was obviously inhibited at 2 0 v in all likelihood as a result of both the extensive oxidation of cb fig s9 and the generation of oxygen at the surface of the pt mesh that occurred at this potential fig s10 the presence of c o 287 5 ev and o c o 288 7 ev at the surface of cb obviously increased the electron transfer resistance and thus inhibited the oxidation of oxalate gao et al 2015 xie et al 2020b it should be noted that ph excursion during the tests in fig 3b was minimal with results showing that the solution ph values changed from 3 69 at the start of the experiments to 3 78 3 83 3 85 3 91 or 3 66 at the end of experiments when 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 or 2 0 v was applied respectively indicating that oxalate pka values are 1 27 and 4 27 was always in negative monovalent state during the oxidation process low solution conductivity also had a negative effect on the electron transfer process smaller apparent rate constants of 0 085 and 0 053 min 1 were observed in 5 and 1 mm kh2po4 solutions at 1 5 v vs ag agcl compared to that in 50 mm kh2po4 solution fig 3c and d it should be noted that the enhancement by the flow anode compared to the control became less significant with a decrease in the solution conductivity fig 3b d indicating the critical role of the solution conductivity in the det process in the flow anode system the addition of 1 wt cb increased the conductivity of 1 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions from 135 3 611 5 and 5573 8 µs cm 1 to 338 5 883 6 and 6372 9 µs cm 1 respectively fig 4 a as shown in fig s4 the presence of the lewis base h2po4 influences the sorption of oxalate on the carbon surface with competition for sorption sites particularly severe at higher phosphate concentrations however results of this study showed that this effect was not significant in the flow anode system with increasing rate and extent of removal of oxalate on increasing the phosphate buffer concentration presumably the higher potential drop and the higher electron transfer resistance of the flow anode in a dilute environment accounted for the lower oxidation efficiency to confirm this the potential distributions in the anode tank were measured using two chi 660e systems fig 4b and c the rate of potential drop in the 1 mm kh2po4 solution 0 022 v cm 1 was higher than that in 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions 0 017 and 0 011 v cm 1 in accord with the expected higher ohmic resistance in solutions with a low ionic strength in addition the initial solution potentials leaving the anode current collector were 1 22 1 35 and 1 48 v vs ag agcl respectively in 1 5 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions at 1 5 v vs ag agcl fig 4b indicating that a more dilute electrolyte concentration resulted in a more significant potential loss at the interface of the anode current collector the potential drop rates and the initial potential losses in the corresponding controls were both larger compared to that in the flow anode system due to the obviously lower solution conductivities fig 4c this was further confirmed by the eis analysis the fitted parameter values according to the equivalent circuit are summarized in table s1 unsurprisingly r s and r ct values gradually increased from 1 77 to 14 48 ω and 2 50 to 25 82 ω respectively with kh2po4 concentration decrease from 50 to 1 mm fig 4d and table s1 warburg diffusion resistances also increased from 11 24 to 342 5 ω fig 4d and table s1 showing a retarded mass transfer process in 1 mm kh2po4 solution likewise the r s r ct and warburg diffusion resistances in the control increased more significantly fig 4d and table s1 due to the absence of cb therefore we assume that the rate of the det process occurring at the solid liquid interface in the flow anode system is closely related to the solution conductivity with the presence of the flow anode cb particles enhancing the det rate due to the reduced resistance 3 3 influence of anode current collectors on the det process the direct contact of the flow anode with the current collector plays an important role in charge transfer with increasing potential loss observed on increasing distance from the surface of the anode current collector as a result the influence of the anode current collector on the det process in the flow anode system was investigated using cb as the flow anode material temporal changes of aqueous oxalate concentrations with use of ti irru and irta meshes as the anode current collectors at an anode potential of 1 5 v vs ag agcl are shown in fig 5 a c the initial removal rates of oxalate were 0 051 0 085 and 0 11 min 1 respectively when using ti irru and irta meshes compared to 0 003 0 012 and 0 014 min 1 in the control indicating the effectiveness of the flow anodic oxidation under various conditions the different oxalate removal rates should be associated with the particular electron transfer resistance at the electrode current collector interfaces it can be seen from fig s11 that the initial solution potential values were 1 31 1 41 and 1 45 v at 0 cm from the ti irru and irta anode current collectors though the same potential drop rates were measured different r ct values of 14 45 6 16 and 5 27 ω were obtained according to the impedance spectra fig 5d when using ti irru and irta meshes respectively these findings indicate that use of an anode current collector with a high charge transfer resistance at the interface would cause a significant initial potential loss and deteriorate the det efficiency the low efficiency when using the ti current collector is likely associated with the low chemical stability of ti to oxidation tioh was initially observed on the surface of the ti current collector fig s12 to further confirm this issue polarization at 3 0 v for 3 h was conducted to grow a passive film tioh on the surface of ti mesh sarkar and khan 2019 sham and lazarus 1979 the intensity of the o2 peak of the polarized ti mesh significantly decreased with the intensities of the peaks i e oh s and tioh relating to the increasing extent of formation of the passive film fig s12 as expected the flow anode system with the polarized ti mesh exhibited an extremely low oxalate removal rate of 0 001 min 1 at 1 5 v vs ag agcl fig 5a indicating that the electron transfer between the flow anode cb particles and the polarized ti mesh was limited due to the high charge transfer resistance of the passive film in contrast the oxalate removal rates remained the same when using pt irru and irta meshes as the anode current collectors after polarization at 3 0 v for 5 h with no change observed in the xps spectra fig s13 and fig s14 indicating the high electrochemical stability of these anode current collectors in regard to the obtained results we ascribe the enhanced det rates in flow anodic oxidation to the substantial increase in active surface sites and small increase in solution conductivity provided by the cb particles once an appropriate anode potential is applied to the anode current collector cb particles in the anolyte will be positively polarized and have the capability of oxidizing oxalate to co2 in view of the limited potential drop in the highly conductive flow anode the enhanced det rates are significantly affected by the following two aspects first the potential drop across the flow anode plays a vital role in determining the det efficiency fig 6 a with the extent of this decrease dependent on the conductivity of the solution the addition of cb obviously increased the solution conductivity a higher conductivity provides a smaller potential drop and a faster mass transfer rate thus resulting in a higher oxalate removal rate second the initial potential drop at the anode current collector interface is related to the electron transfer resistance at the interface fig 6b which is determined by the electrochemical property of the anode current collector and the solution conductivity a smaller r ct at the interface has a positive effect on the det process in the flow anode system 3 4 application of the flow anode system to oxidation of phenol the outcomes of this study are applicable to the range of organic compounds that are oxidized via the det process phenol a typical refractory organic compound was introduced as a more realistic contaminant than oxalate the adsorption isotherms of phenol on cb are categorized as freundlich type asakawa and ogino 1984 asakawa et al 1985 the experimental adsorption data was fitted by the freundlich isotherm model eq 5 5 q e k c e 1 n where q e is the amount of phenol adsorbed on a unit weight of carbon mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 and k and 1 n are the freundlich constants k is an empirical constant equal to the intercept at c e 1 mg l 1 and 1 n is the slope of the line on a log log plot since phenol can be oxidized via the det process at an anode potential from 1 1 to 1 6 v vs she jiang et al 2017 lizhang et al 2016 sun et al 2012 the det process would be expected to play a critical role in the oxidation of phenol on the surface of cb especially at a potential significantly lower than the oer potential boudenne and cerclier 1999 ren et al 2019 the contribution of hydroxyl radicals to phenol oxidation was also estimated according to fig s3 with results showing that the calculated apparent rate constant for phenol oxidation by hydroxyl radicals was 0 01 min 1 a value somewhat less than that 0 018 min 1 in the flow anode system at 1 5 v vs ag agcl as such results of this study indicate that both hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation and det oxidation processes play an important role in the oxidation of phenol in the flow anode system as shown in fig 7 a the flow anode system enhanced the removal of phenol by 450 in 60 mins at 1 5 v vs ag agcl by deducting the amount of phenol sorbed on cb according to the freundlich isotherm fig 7b it was estimated that 67 6 of the phenol present was removed via electrochemical oxidation the total organic carbon toc concentration of the solution was further investigated showing that the flow anode system increased the removal of toc from 6 5 to 35 7 compared to the control fig s15 it should be noted that electrosorption contributed minimally to the removal of phenol fig s16 since phenol pka 10 will be electrically neutral in the ph 4 52 kh2po4 buffer solution the solution ph decreased slightly throughout the oxidation process with a ph of 4 21 at the end of the experiment in addition the apparent rate constants for phenol removal were maintained consistent over 10 successive cycles of operation fig 7d with this result indicating that the flow anode particles were not passivated by polymer deposition on their surfaces further evidence in support of this conclusion can be seen in the ftir spectra shown in fig s17 with no obvious difference between the spectra of cb before and after the phenol oxidation process indicating that the surfaces of the cb particles were not covered by phenolic polymers the minimal extent of adsorption including electro sorption of phenol to the cb particles may account for the apparent lack of presence of polymeric products on the cb particle surfaces additionally as noted by chaplin 2014 the polymer formation pathway can be minimized by oxidation of phenols via reaction with oh with this a possible reason why polymer deposition on the cb particles did not appear to be significant as described earlier the generation of oh in the flow anode system at 1 5 v was investigated using dta as the oh probe the calculated steady state oh concentration in the flow anode system at 1 5 v is 5 10 11 mol l 1 with this concentration potentially sufficient to alleviate the formation of polymers on the surface of cb in support of this conclusion no change in the functional groups at the surface of the cb particles before and after long term oxidation operation in the presence of 400 mg l 1 phenol was discernible fig s18 in addition a long term 10 h polarization on cb particles at 1 5 v vs ag agcl without phenol was performed only minor change in the functional groups at the surface of the cb particles according to the xps results fig s19 was observed with this result indicating a high degree of electrochemical stability at least under the conditions investigated in this study tixo2x 1 was also used as the flow anode to oxidize phenol with results showing that only 47 8 of phenol was removed fig 7a this relatively limited extent of removal can be attributed to its low specific surface area and high mass density compared to cb leading to insignificant adsorption of phenol to these particles fig s20 and a lower particle number per unit volume in the anode tank however the eeo of phenol using tixo2x 1 2 42 kwh m 3 was lower than that using cb 3 08 kwh m 3 with the higher energy consumption in the case of cb possibly related to the occurrence of side reactions e g oxygen evolution on carbon materials with these reactions leading to a lower current efficiency the eeo of phenol in the flow anode system is compared with other decontamination techniques in fig 7c fajardo et al 2017 lee et al 2017 lizhang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 yavuz and koparal 2006 the energy consumption of the flow anode system is much lower than that of other techniques with this comparison highlighting the commercial opportunities of this novel flow anodic oxidation electrochemical technology moreover the concomitant production of h2 and h2o2 and or the reduction of co2 in the cathodic compartment would seem possible with this dual approach to utilization of flow electrodes further broadening the possibilities for energy exploitation and utilization chang et al 2016 choi et al 2019 xia et al 2019 as such we believe that flow anode cathode systems have considerable future potential in environment and energy applications 4 conclusions in this study the det processes occurring at the solid liquid and the solid solid interfaces in a flow anode system were investigated using different flow anode materials and anode current collectors our results indicate that the flow anode system can significantly enhance the det mediated oxidation of particular organic compounds with relatively low energy consumption the flow anode materials should possess catalytic behavior towards the target organic compound and exhibit high electrochemical stability the single metal and dimensional stable anode dsa meshes such as pt irru and irta with high electrochemical stability and low electron transfer resistance are appropriate candidates for the anode current collector in order to avoid energy loss during the electron transfer processes the solution conductivity which determines the potential drop and mass transfer processes in the flow anode plays a critical role and its limitation on use of the flow anode in dilute streams requires further investigation results of this study provide insight into the criteria for choosing appropriate anode materials and anode current collectors and lay a foundation for the optimization of flow

mechanism has not been thoroughly evaluated this work aims to compare and reveal the promoting mechanism of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 processes and to illustrate the practical use potential of fe vi h2o2 system many lines of evidence verified the involvement of oh and o2 in pollutant degradation were excluded in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems meaning that high dosage of h2o2 cannot trigger an activation pathway different from in situ h2o2 the better oxidation performance of the fe vi h2o2 system than fe vi alone was ascribed to the catalytic role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 which can directly and or indirectly facilitate the formation of fe iv and fe v considering the structural similarity of peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds with h2o2 as well as their universality in water pollutant remediation the oxidation properties and reactive oxidants of fe vi pms and fe vi pds processes were also examined besides the fe vi h2o2 system suffered from less restriction by inorganic ions and natural organic matter and exhibited satisfactory pollutant removal effects in real water overall this work provides a further and comprehensive cognition about the role of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate vi hydrogen peroxide self decay sulfamethoxazole two electron transfer 1 introduction a large number of poisonous and harmful organic pollutants and heavy metals are directly or indirectly discharged into the aquatic environment leading to frequent eutrophication blackening and odors in natural water bodies li et al 2019a recently ferrate fe vi as fe in the 6 valent has received extensive attention in efficient control of heavy metals organic contaminants and antibiotics resistance gene due to its synthetic characteristics of chemical oxidation coagulation and disinfection sharma et al 2015 shin et al 2018 however the oxidation capacity of fe vi is highly dependent on the solution ph with the redox potential of 0 72 v at alkaline ph wu et al 2020a that is at the related ph of wastewater treatment fe vi presents a low reactivity besides fe vi possesses distinct selectivity with organic components which significantly relies on the chemical structure of contaminants and poorly degrades some recalcitrant constituents gao et al 2020 these crucial inadequacies impede the practical use of fe vi in water pollution remediation according to previous literature intensifying fe vi mainly contains the following four pathways i acid activation enhances the redox capacity of fe vi and improves the dissolved organic carbon removal by fe vi manoli et al 2017 ii reducing agents such as calcium sulphate caso3 shao et al 2019a carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotube and graphene oxide pan et

2020a until now limited information about intensifying fe vi is available thus necessitating exploring more green and economical technologies to boost fe vi generally h2o2 as a green oxidant plays a critical role in environmental remediation since it is a frequently used precursor to generate oh e0 oh h2o 1 9 2 7 v liu et al 2015 shi et al 2020 several studies have been conscious of the enhancement contribution of h2o2 towards fe vi decomposition as well as pollutant degradation in the fe vi system lacina and goold 2015 shao et al 2019a that is the combination of exogenic h2o2 and fe vi may be a viable alternative to remove a wide array of organic contaminants however the oxidation mechanism of the fe vi h2o2 system is far from clear pms a derivative of h2o2 has been suggested to promote fe vi to oxidation of atrazine by forming so4 wu et al 2018 does the fe vi h2o2 process promote fe vi activity by generating radicals like the fe vi pms system furthermore h2o2 is also an essential product of fe vi decomposition in aqueous solution the short lived high valent fe ions are extremely unstable and could be immediately decomposed into ferric oxyhydr oxides and h2o2 by attacking water or themselves as early as in 1996 one work employed stopped flow spectrum and premix pulse radiolysis apparatus to reveal the stoichiometric factor between fe vi and h2o2 and regarded o2 as the final product rush et al 1996 based on the above job some studies elaborated in situ h2o2 produced by fe vi self decay can further convert fe vi and fe iv into fe iv and fe ii zhu et al 2020 indicating the two electron reductive property of h2o2 moreover according to the linear fitting between redox potentials and the logarithm of the reaction rates sharma et al deemed h2o2 matched well with the two electron transfer peculiarity sharma 2010 nevertheless a previous research presented in the fe vi system o2 was detected by using tetranitro methane as a probe lee et al 2014 suggesting the existence of one electron transfer process besides by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis li et al manifested the involvement of oh in fe vi oxidizing phenolic compounds li et al 2021 therefore there is a necessity to systematically illustrate the transform pathway of h2o2 in fe vi self decay process and confirm the roles of oh and o2 in consideration of the promoting effect of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems our work expects to provide a comprehensive reveal regarding the h2o2 activation mechanism in both systems in this work sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as a model contaminant not only because it is one of the highest detection rates in the environment but also because its degradation intermediates by fe vi and other reactive oxidants have been well demonstrated wu et al 2020b specifically we first evaluated the effect of h2o2 including in situ h2o2 produced by fe vi self decay and exogenic h2o2 ex situ h2o2 on smx degradation by fe vi then we identified the reactive oxidants in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems and comprehensively summarized the role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in activating fe vi by integrating with experimental analysis and density functional theory dft calculations in addition in view of the universality of peroxide coupled with fe vi oxidation process as well as the structural similarity of peroxide the characteristics of low dosage peroxide activating fe vi were revealed finally the possibility of environmental application of the fe vi h2o2 system was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in this work potassium ferrate k2feo4 was synthesized via a wet chemical method according to the thompsons approach thompson et al 1951 other chemicals were purchased from commercial reagent companies the specific information about these reagents is listed in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 degradation procedures degradation experiment was performed in a 250 ml beaker containing 150 ml reaction solution with a magnetic stirrer 500 r min 1 in a temperature controlled at 25 1 c solution ph was maintained from 7 0 9 0 by 20 mm borate buffer the oxidation reaction was initiated by simultaneously adding h2o2 and 50 ml fe vi solution into a ph buffered solution containing the desired concentration 1 15 μm of target contaminant an aliquot of 1 5 ml sample was collected at predetermined time intervals filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and quenched with 20 μl of 1 g l 1 hydroxylamine sulfate all the degradation experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average results and standard deviations were shown more specific experimental procedures are described in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pollutants e g smx 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp atrazine atz bisphenol a bpa carbamazepine cbz p nitrophenol pnp methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was monitored by a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus agilent 1260 usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c 18 5 μm 4 6 250 mm column for details summarized in table s1 and text s3 besides detailed experimental procedures for measuring residual fe vi and h2o2 and verifying the generation of fe ⅳ were presented in text s4 6 dft calculation processes were depicted in text s7 the degradation products of smx were analyzed by an ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms ms agilent 6500 and the details were provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ and ex situ h2o2 accelerated fe vi towards oxidation of smx to evaluate the role of h2o2 in fe vi self decay process the h2o2 concentration in the fe vi system was measured fig 1 a suggests the decomposition rate of fe vi with an initial dosage of 100 μm is higher than 50 μm which is generally ascribed by the autocatalytic role of in situ induced iron oxide solids in previous studies huang et al 2018 however the catalytic effect of h2o2 seems to be also important according to sharma et al reported one molecule of fe vi can assault two water to stimulate fe vi self decay and eventually convert into a molecule of h2o2 at near neutral situation r1 in table 1 zhu et al 2020 that is based on the fe vi consumption 73 μm fe vi was decomposed at an initial dosage of 100 μm after reaction 20 min the solution can theoretically contain approximate 73 μm h2o2 while merely about 5 μm h2o2 was detected no h2o2 was examined at an initial fe vi dosage of 50 μm which is likely to present the participation of in situ h2o2 in promoting fe vi self decay meanwhile more rapid oxidation of smx was observed at higher dosage of fe vi fig s1a the phenomenon might indicate that apart from the promotion role of magnetic nanocrystalline iron oxide h2o2 possibly contributed to activating fe vi decomposition thereby improving smx degradation meanwhile the influence of ex situ h2o2 on smx degradation was also determined as depicted in fig 1b ex situ h2o2 significantly promotes fe vi to remove smx and the efficiency increases from 35 to 78 within 300 s at ph 8 0 alone h2o2 was powerless for smx degradation the above dates were well fitted with the pseudo first order rate law and the obtained conversion frequencies of fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are 0 08 and 0 30 min 1 respectively fig s1b moreover fig s2a shows the enhancement caused by h2o2 considerably depends on the additive amount of h2o2 as the initial h2o2 dosage varied from 10 to 70 μm the removal of smx increased dramatically when adding more than 70 μm h2o2 the promotion effect was suppressed this phenomenon may be explained as excessive h2o2 can compete with smx for reactive species thus restraining smx degradation therefore 70 μm h2o2 was considered as the initial dosage for the subsequent experiments besides ex situ h2o2 significantly promoted fe vi to oxidize smx at ph 7 0 9 0 fig s2b for the fe vi system with increasing reaction ph smx degradation was gradually inhibited and the removal rate decreased from 56 0 to 4 4 the oxidation capacity of fe vi is obviously ph dependent because the protonated h2feo4 and hfeo4 have larger spin density to possess higher oxidation potential than the deprotonated feo4 2 luo et al 2020 while in the fe vi h2o2 system the highest removal efficiency was exhibited at ph 8 0 this may be associated with the instability of fe vi in an acid ambient and the competitive consumption of reactive species by h2o2 3 2 negligible contribution of radicals in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems 3 2 1 identification of active oxidants in view of the intricate self decomposition products of fe vi including fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and h2o2 the possible active oxidants e g fe v fe iv oh and o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems were seriatim examined to preliminarily evaluate the role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 epr spectroscopic technique has been frequently employed to monitor radicals zhou et al 2020a the fe vi h2o2 system showed a faint distinctive signal of the dmpo oh adduct αn αh 14 9 g zhou et al 2020b while it was not presented in the fe vi system fig 2 a this seems to suggest the formation of oh with the addition of ex situ h2o2 recently because of the involvement of inverted spin trapping dmpo dmpo dmpo oh or the forrester hepburn mechanism dmpo dmpo oh dmpo oh the detected dmpo oh signal is accounted for the oxidation of dmpo by high valent fe intermediates or and oh jing and chaplin 2017 tert butyl alcohol tba as a typical scavenger of oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was used to further explore the generation of oh lai et al 2020a once oh participated in the degradation of smx smx removal rate would be inhibited by tba fig 2b and 2c suggest that tba cannot affect smx removal no matter in fe vi system or in fe vi h2o2 system it is well known that oh could be trapped by benzoic acid to produce p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba hong et al 2020 no p hba was detected and benzoic acid was not degraded in both systems fig s3a and b further demonstrating that oh is not the active oxidant in brief in situ h2o2 and even adding ex situ h2o2 cannot induce the production of oh for degrading smx in fe vi oxidation process therefore the false epr signal of oh in the fe vi h2o2 system is likely to be deciphered by the forrester hepburn mechanism caused by reactive fe species which agreed well with the higher yields of fe iv and fe v in the fe vi h2o2 system see the discussion in the next section besides since there may be a one electron transfer pathway between fe vi and h2o2 to generate o2 it is imperative to certify the existence of o2 superoxide dismutase sod as a representative scavenger and nitro blue tetrazolium nbt as a characteristic probe were employed to verify the generation of o2 you et al 2020 as depicted in fig s3c there is no characteristic absorption peak at 560 nm which belongs to the characteristic wavelength of formazan the product of the reaction between nbt and o2 li et al 2018 negligible effects of sod on smx degradation were presented in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems fig 2b and c moreover dmpo was adopted to trap o2 and the six characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 were not examined in both systems fig 2a these phenomena collectively indicated no o2 was generated and high valent fe species might go through a two electron transfer step to react with in situ and ex situ h2o2 it has been well demonstrated that methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso can be oxidized by high valent fe species to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 through an oxygen atom transfer step r2 r4 which observably differs from the radicals based oxidation pathway ren et al 2020 wang et al 2020 smx degradation was completely inhibited by 30 μm pmso in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 oxidation processes fig 2b and c on account of the insignificant effect of pmso addition on fe vi consumption fig s4a fe vi is inefficient to react with pmso moreover based on the previous study and our results it can be found that fe vi presents a similar reactivity with smx 34 9 m 1 s 1 fig s1c and pmso 4 05 m 1 s 1 r2 at ph 8 0 indicating that smx degradation could be partly confined by the competition reaction between pmso and smx for fe vi overall fe vi fe v and fe iv may collectively contribute to smx degradation but fe v and or fe iv are the main reactive oxidants for smx removal the consumption of pmso and the generation of pmso2 were also examined fig 3 a and b suggest that ex situ h2o2 can significantly promote fe vi to oxidize pmso specifically the pmso removal rates in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are 24 and 65 respectively meaning that with the addition of ex situ h2o2 more high valent fe intermediates were generated approximate 100 pmso2 yields further illustrate that the role of radicals is ignorable in in situ and ex situ h2o2 activating fe vi it is an indisputable fact that fe iv goes through a two electron transfer step to oxidize pmso and then converts into fe ii r4 to confirm the involvement of fe iv bpy was employed to chelate with fe ii the characteristic absorbance peaks at 522 nm resulted by fe ii bpy complex ε 8650 m 1 cm 1 were presented in both systems fig s4b shao et al 2020 suggesting the existence of fe iv however since of the instability of fe iv and fe v and the inaccessibility of the apparatuses the direct evidence about the formation of fe v and fe iv is hard to obtain to sum up even with the exogenous addition of h2o2 the involvement of radicals is insignificant thereby only high valent fe species contributed to pollutant degradation in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems 3 2 2 selective oxidation in general high valent metal oxo species will present obvious selectivity in removing organic compounds zong et al 2020 2021 to further evaluate the influence of h2o2 on fe vi oxidation process the degradation efficiencies of 2 4 dcp atz bpa cbz pnp and atz were measured fig 3c and d show ex situ h2o2 can accelerate fe vi to remove all of the tested organic contaminants except atz the enhancement effects were obviously different which greatly rested with the chemical structure of organic compounds except for the tailing data the pseudo first order rate method was used to simulate the main parts of each data set and the obtained rate constants were shown in fig s5 the fe vi h2o2 system for oxidizing organic pollutants was 3 75 18 39 fold faster than those examined in fe vi system however negligible degradation of atz was displayed in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems this might be accounted for the weak electron donating capacity of atz although fe iv and fe v are more active than fe vi they are still insensitive to oxidizing electron deficient compounds which agreed well with previous studies shao et al 2019a zong et al 2021 in short the distinct selective oxidation phenomena manifested the obstacle of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in fostering fe vi to oxidize electron deficient pollutants and the few contribution of radicals 3 2 3 degradation intermediates of smx taking into account the difference in oxidative activity between radicals and high valent fe species smx degradation products were also confirmed to further determine the contribution of reactive oxidants a total of eleven products in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems were examined and were listed in table s2 with the corresponding ms ms spectrums were exhibited in figs s6 s16 noteworthily the total ion chromatograms depict the inapparent difference in product peaks in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 oxidation processes fig s17 and almost identical oxidation intermediates were detected in both systems table s2 the results exactly coincide the identical reactive species in the two oxidation processes since the degradation pathway of smx in the coupling process of fe vi and h2o2 has not been reported yet we minutely analyzed the smx conversion pathways which were shown in fig 4 smx degradation was initiated with hydrogen replacement reaction resulting in the generation of tp1 and tp2 then tp2 was further oxidized via the oxygen transfer step to produce tp3 given the abundant h atoms of aromatic amines hydrogen abstraction step was considered thus there will be a lot of n centered radicals involved in the reaction thus forming tp4 and tp5 the two products were also detected in the caso3 fe vi system where fe iv and fe v were considered as the main reactive species shao et al 2019a due to the electrophilic addition of the hydroxyl group the hydroxylated product tp6 of smx would be introduced furthermore sharma et al have revealed that fe vi is inclined to nucleophilic attack of isoxazole moiety rather than electrophilic attack sharma et al 2015 therefore the ring opening reaction of isoxazole moiety was likely to be involved to generate tp7 in pathway e tp8 tp9 and tp10 were derived from successive oxygen atom transfer steps overall the degradation products determined in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are highly similar to other high valent metal oxo species oxidation processes zong et al 2020 and greatly coincide with the oxidation characteristics of high valent fe species e g inner sphere substitution or electrophilic addition via one or two electron transfer pathway rush et al 1995 besides radicals e g oh and o2 were revealed to primitively oxidize the methyl group on the isoxzaole ring of smx to produce corresponding hydroxylation products e g m z 288 m h and 256 m h du et al 2018 song et al 2021 these products were not checked no matter in the fe vi system or in the fe vi h2o2 system further indicating their similar reactive oxidants and the negligible contribution of oh and o2 3 3 mechanistic insights 3 3 1 h2o2 reduced high valent fe species via a two electron transfer pathway on the basis of the above experimental findings the participation of o2 and oh in pollutant degradation are excluded in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems suggesting h2o2 performed as a reductant to intensify fe vi oxidation reactivity via forming more fe iv and fe v therefore in the absence of smx fe vi consumption was monitored to testify the reducing property of h2o2 fig s18a indicates only a small amount of fe vi was decomposed without adding h2o2 9 2 μm with increasing the initial dosage of ex situ h2o2 fe vi consumption became higher furthermore the low detection rate of in situ h2o2 in the fe vi system also proves the crucial reducibility of h2o2 fig 1a moreover no evidence regarding the generation of o2 illustrates the two electron transfer peculiarity of in situ as well as ex situ h2o2 this is because once h2o2 only transfers one electron to fe vi the one electron transfer product o2 will participate in degrading smx in order to further confirm the above mechanism density functional theory dft calculation was applied since the oxidation of h2o2 demands preferential complexation with the hydrogen atom of metal ions to stimulate the inner sphere oxidation mechanism unprotonated feo4 2 could not achieve such coordination and cut no ice with h2o2 rush et al 1996 hence in our experimental condition ph 8 0 protonated hfeo4 was employed as the representative component for calculation fig 5 a and b show that the energy barriers for o2 and o2 formation are 16 690 and 43 537 kcal mol 1 severally a general rule of thumb suggested reactions with a barrier of 21 kcal mol 1 or less will proceed readily at room temperature young 2001 that is although the reaction of fe vi and h2o2 to form fe iv and o2 presented a positive gibbs free energy change the reaction can also proceed the results powerfully verify the favorable thermodynamics situation to oxidize h2o2 by fe vi via a two electron step at room temperature while o2 cannot be produced through the reaction between fe vi and h2o2 specifically the oxidation process is started with the polymerization pathway that two hydrogen atoms of h2o2 integrate with the hydrogen atom of hfeo4 and its adjacent oxygen atom and eventually releases o2 r5 the dissolved oxygen do content of reaction solution was monitored to demonstrate the generation of o2 fig 5c shows the do value in the fe vi h2o2 system increases as the reaction proceeds for single fe vi solution the do value did not changed which is possibly deciphered that in the process of fe vi self decay in situ produced h2o2 is too few to affect the do content 3 3 2 proposed reaction pathways for the generation of fe iv and fe v since reactive fe species i e fe vi fe v and fe iv generally oxidize contaminant via a direct one or two electron transfer process such as transforming pmso to the correlative sulfone pmso2 luo et al 2020 wu et al 2020a it is sensible to be analogous to the similar mechanism with fe vi regarding the oxidation of h2o2 by fe iv and fe v r6 and r7 therefore fe ii and fe iii can be generated through the reductive reactions of fe v and fe iv by h2o2 a previous work stated uncomplexed fe iii can reinforce fe vi decomposition and improve pollutant degradation jiang et al considered fe oh 3 can catalyze fe vi reduction by h2o2 thus contributing to the enhancement jiang et al 2016 while a cutting edge study revealed that fe oh 3 can make fe iv at a higher content through the oxidation process between fe vi and fe iii r8 zhang et al 2021 moreover fe vi presents a flexible reactivity with fe ii to form fe v r9 lee et al 2014 that is apart from in situ h2o2 fe ii and fe iii induced by chain reactions can also make a partial contribution to accelerating the generation of fe iv and fe v therefore the effects of exogenic fe ii and fe iii on smx degradation were examined fig s18b and c show both the two low valent fe species can accelerate fe vi to remove smx above results illustrate that even adding ex situ h2o2 similar reactive oxidants were formed in fe vi oxidation process indicating that in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems h2o2 showed similar contribution for activating fe vi incorporating our conclusion with the previous literature the schematic diagram of in situ and ex situ h2o2 activating fe vi is depicted in fig 6 initially ex situ h2o2 reduces fe vi via a two electron transfer step to produce fe iv 21 18 m 1 s 1 r5 which is faster than fe vi self coupling reaction 4 05 m 1 s 1 r1 lee et al 2014 thus accelerating the formation of fe iv intermediate then fe iv is put forward to be reduced by h2o2 to yield fe ii or go through self decay leading to the generation of fe iii r7 and r10 although the catalytic mechanism of fe iii is indistinct our results show fe iii definitely facilitates fe vi to degrade smx in addition newly formed fe ii can react with fe vi to form fe v r9 thus competing with fe vi self decay as well as h2o2 to expend fe vi fe v makes a similar contribution with fe iv referring to going through self decay or being reduced by h2o2 r6 and r11 meanwhile fe vi fe v and fe iv continually decompose to release in situ h2o2 which performs an identical effect with ex situ h2o2 resulting in quickly generating fe iv and fe v to elevate target contaminant removal 3 4 proposed reaction characteristics of peroxide activation of fe vi reductive agents play non negligible roles in accelerating the oxidation of organic contaminants by fe vi feng et al 2018 in this work we elaborate that h2o2 as a reductant contributes to promoting fe vi decomposition via a two electron redox pathway whether pms and peroxydisulfate pds which are derivatives of h2o2 can also strengthen fe vi through such a two electron reduction mechanism remains unclear therefore we carried out related experiments to reveal the oxidation performance and mechanism of fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems noteworthily if there is a one electron transfer pathway radicals e g so4 and oh will be generated and participate in contaminant removal as shown in fig s19a pms and pds slightly accelerate smx degradation in contrast with the fe vi oxidation process and the promotion effects are inferior to h2o2 the results are exactly corresponding with the standard redox potential of the three kinds of oxidant e0 1 76 v h2o2 e0 1 82 v pms and e0 2 01 v pds georgi and kopinke 2005 govindan et al 2014 h2o2 provides the optimal reducibility thus more likely to reduce fe vi however it has been well documented that pms is easier to be activated than h2o2 and pds since of its asymmetric molecular structure geogre and dionysios 2004 that is the promotion phenomenon caused by peroxide is inconsistent with the radicals based activation process to verify whether radicals are involved in smx oxidation pmso degradation and methanol meoh scavenging experiments were carried out fig s19b and c show that pms and pds can promote fe vi to convert pmso moreover the yields of pmso2 in both fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems are about 100 indicating that only high valent fe species contribute to smx oxidation generally meoh is regarded as a scavenger of both so4 k1 so4 meoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k1 oh meoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020b and was employed to certify the contributions of so4 and oh as expected the removal rate of smx was not affected fig s19d all the results verified that no radicals are generated in fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems however wu et al illuminated there is a synergistic effect on degradation of atrazine by coupling fe vi with pms where so4 is the major active species wu et al 2018 it is exactly contradictory with our results and the reason why resulted in the consequence may be accounted for the disparity in reaction ph and dosage actually in most radicals based fe vi oxidation processes high dosages of fe vi were added to catalyze pms or other oxidants which mainly utilized the catalytic reactivity of fe vi self decay product fe iii particles thereby underutilizing fe vi and increasing the cost of water treatment given the negligible effect of radicals in the fe vi peroxide oxidation process the conclusion that oxidant with peroxo o o bond is inclined to react with fe vi via a two electron transfer pathway can be concluded moreover the conclusion might provide an unique insight into the fe vi h2o2 system overall it is promising to further explore the reactive relationship between fe vi and o o bond 3 5 practical application of the fe vi h2o2 system the above results suggest the fe vi h2o2 system is a feasible alternative to remove pollutants as its stronger oxidation property than fe vi alone and harmless reductive product o2 the background components e g dissolved organic matter and different kinds of ions ubiquitously present in water environment which may significantly affect chemical oxidation process wu et al 2020b to investigate the applicability of the fe vi h2o2 system the effects of representative inorganic ions in water including four kinds of anions no3 hco3 cl so4 2 and two kinds of cations ca2 and mg2 on smx degradation were researched furthermore humic acid ha is a primary ingredient of dissolved organic matter and its influence was also revealed correlative results are shown in figs s20 and s21 when 10 mm coexisting ions were added except for hco3 negligible restriction effects on smx degradation were presented these results are different from the oxidation process with radicals e g oh o2 and so4 as the principal reactive species take oh as an example li et al have reported that in the process of hydroxylamine promoted fe3o4 pms for degradation of atz the removal efficiency of atz decreased from 94 to 82 in the presence of 10 mm cl where oh was the main reactive oxidant li et al 2019b this is because cl2 with lower redox potential will be produced through the chemical reaction between oh and cl lai et al 2020b in this work high concentration hco3 slightly inhibited smx degradation due to the increasing reaction ph data not shown which could change the protonated state of fe vi thus deteriorating smx removal rate besides fig s21c suggests that the inhibitory effect of smx degradation becomes more evident with increasing the dosage of ha the results could be ascribed as that i reductive constituents in ha may reduce fe iv and fe v to fe ii or and fe iii ii ha can compete with target pollutant to react with high valent fe species moreover a series of degradation experiments in surrounding water were implemented as presented in fig s22 the maximum smx degradation efficiency was achieved in deionized water and a similar result was observed in tap water this may be because there were few natural organics to compete with smx in deionized water and tap water in contrast the residual rates of smx in river water and lake water were 40 1 and 50 0 respectively merely after reaction 5 min the results could be explained by the relatively high dissolved organic constituents in real water table s3 these consequences attempt to show the fe vi h2o2 system is an efficient technology for removing contaminants in practical application 4 conclusion in this work we systematically demonstrated the activation mechanism of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in fe vi oxidation process active oxidants identification selective oxidation characteristic degradation product analysis and dft calculations collectively suggested that even exogenous addition of h2o2 did not induce the generation of radicals high valent fe species were proposed to oxidize in situ and ex situ h2o2 via a two electron transfer step thus directly or indirectly accelerating the generation of fe iv and fe v to boost fe vi reactivity in addition fe vi h2o2 system was put forward to be a feasible strategy for water pollutant remediation due to its strong oxidizing property and good resistance to natural water substances compared with other homogeneous reducing additives e g s iv fe iii no2 and i to activate fe vi h2o2 seems to be more environmentally friendly because of its harmless product o2 more interestingly our work utilized the degradation intermediates of target compound to determine the contribution of reactive oxidants which might be a good paradigm for the identification of active species in fe vi based oxidation process besides pds and pms were manifested to perform a similar role as h2o2 in activating fe vi it would be necessary to further evaluate the characteristics environmental risk and economic benefits of the fe vi peroxide system in contrast with other fe vi reductant systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16733,recently several studies have been conscious of the promotion effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 a self decay product of ferrate fe vi on fe vi to oxidize contaminations but the pivotal activation mechanism has not been thoroughly evaluated this work aims to compare and reveal the promoting mechanism of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 processes and to illustrate the practical use potential of fe vi h2o2 system many lines of evidence verified the involvement of oh and o2 in pollutant degradation were excluded in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems meaning that high dosage of h2o2 cannot trigger an activation pathway different from in situ h2o2 the better oxidation performance of the fe vi h2o2 system than fe vi alone was ascribed to the catalytic role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 which can directly and or indirectly facilitate the formation of fe iv and fe v considering the structural similarity of peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds with h2o2 as well as their universality in water pollutant remediation the oxidation properties and reactive oxidants of fe vi pms and fe vi pds processes were also examined besides the fe vi h2o2 system suffered from less restriction by inorganic ions and natural organic matter and exhibited satisfactory pollutant removal effects in real water overall this work provides a further and comprehensive cognition about the role of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate vi hydrogen peroxide self decay sulfamethoxazole two electron transfer 1 introduction a large number of poisonous and harmful organic pollutants and heavy metals are directly or indirectly discharged into the aquatic environment leading to frequent eutrophication blackening and odors in natural water bodies li et al 2019a recently ferrate fe vi as fe in the 6 valent has received extensive attention in efficient control of heavy metals organic contaminants and antibiotics resistance gene due to its synthetic characteristics of chemical oxidation coagulation and disinfection sharma et al 2015 shin et al 2018 however the oxidation capacity of fe vi is highly dependent on the solution ph with the redox potential of 0 72 v at alkaline ph wu et al 2020a that is at the related ph of wastewater treatment fe vi presents a low reactivity besides fe vi possesses distinct selectivity with organic components which significantly relies on the chemical structure of contaminants and poorly degrades some recalcitrant constituents gao et al 2020 these crucial inadequacies impede the practical use of fe vi in water pollution remediation according to previous literature intensifying fe vi mainly contains the following four pathways i acid activation enhances the redox capacity of fe vi and improves the dissolved organic carbon removal by fe vi manoli et al 2017 ii reducing agents such as calcium sulphate caso3 shao et al 2019a carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotube and graphene oxide pan et

2020a until now limited information about intensifying fe vi is available thus necessitating exploring more green and economical technologies to boost fe vi generally h2o2 as a green oxidant plays a critical role in environmental remediation since it is a frequently used precursor to generate oh e0 oh h2o 1 9 2 7 v liu et al 2015 shi et al 2020 several studies have been conscious of the enhancement contribution of h2o2 towards fe vi decomposition as well as pollutant degradation in the fe vi system lacina and goold 2015 shao et al 2019a that is the combination of exogenic h2o2 and fe vi may be a viable alternative to remove a wide array of organic contaminants however the oxidation mechanism of the fe vi h2o2 system is far from clear pms a derivative of h2o2 has been suggested to promote fe vi to oxidation of atrazine by forming so4 wu et al 2018 does the fe vi h2o2 process promote fe vi activity by generating radicals like the fe vi pms system furthermore h2o2 is also an essential product of fe vi decomposition in aqueous solution the short lived high valent fe ions are extremely unstable and could be immediately decomposed into ferric oxyhydr oxides and h2o2 by attacking water or themselves as early as in 1996 one work employed stopped flow spectrum and premix pulse radiolysis apparatus to reveal the stoichiometric factor between fe vi and h2o2 and regarded o2 as the final product rush et al 1996 based on the above job some studies elaborated in situ h2o2 produced by fe vi self decay can further convert fe vi and fe iv into fe iv and fe ii zhu et al 2020 indicating the two electron reductive property of h2o2 moreover according to the linear fitting between redox potentials and the logarithm of the reaction rates sharma et al deemed h2o2 matched well with the two electron transfer peculiarity sharma 2010 nevertheless a previous research presented in the fe vi system o2 was detected by using tetranitro methane as a probe lee et al 2014 suggesting the existence of one electron transfer process besides by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis li et al manifested the involvement of oh in fe vi oxidizing phenolic compounds li et al 2021 therefore there is a necessity to systematically illustrate the transform pathway of h2o2 in fe vi self decay process and confirm the roles of oh and o2 in consideration of the promoting effect of h2o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems our work expects to provide a comprehensive reveal regarding the h2o2 activation mechanism in both systems in this work sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as a model contaminant not only because it is one of the highest detection rates in the environment but also because its degradation intermediates by fe vi and other reactive oxidants have been well demonstrated wu et al 2020b specifically we first evaluated the effect of h2o2 including in situ h2o2 produced by fe vi self decay and exogenic h2o2 ex situ h2o2 on smx degradation by fe vi then we identified the reactive oxidants in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems and comprehensively summarized the role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in activating fe vi by integrating with experimental analysis and density functional theory dft calculations in addition in view of the universality of peroxide coupled with fe vi oxidation process as well as the structural similarity of peroxide the characteristics of low dosage peroxide activating fe vi were revealed finally the possibility of environmental application of the fe vi h2o2 system was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals in this work potassium ferrate k2feo4 was synthesized via a wet chemical method according to the thompsons approach thompson et al 1951 other chemicals were purchased from commercial reagent companies the specific information about these reagents is listed in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 degradation procedures degradation experiment was performed in a 250 ml beaker containing 150 ml reaction solution with a magnetic stirrer 500 r min 1 in a temperature controlled at 25 1 c solution ph was maintained from 7 0 9 0 by 20 mm borate buffer the oxidation reaction was initiated by simultaneously adding h2o2 and 50 ml fe vi solution into a ph buffered solution containing the desired concentration 1 15 μm of target contaminant an aliquot of 1 5 ml sample was collected at predetermined time intervals filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and quenched with 20 μl of 1 g l 1 hydroxylamine sulfate all the degradation experiments were carried out in triplicate and the average results and standard deviations were shown more specific experimental procedures are described in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pollutants e g smx 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp atrazine atz bisphenol a bpa carbamazepine cbz p nitrophenol pnp methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was monitored by a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus agilent 1260 usa equipped with an eclipse xdb c 18 5 μm 4 6 250 mm column for details summarized in table s1 and text s3 besides detailed experimental procedures for measuring residual fe vi and h2o2 and verifying the generation of fe ⅳ were presented in text s4 6 dft calculation processes were depicted in text s7 the degradation products of smx were analyzed by an ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms ms agilent 6500 and the details were provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ and ex situ h2o2 accelerated fe vi towards oxidation of smx to evaluate the role of h2o2 in fe vi self decay process the h2o2 concentration in the fe vi system was measured fig 1 a suggests the decomposition rate of fe vi with an initial dosage of 100 μm is higher than 50 μm which is generally ascribed by the autocatalytic role of in situ induced iron oxide solids in previous studies huang et al 2018 however the catalytic effect of h2o2 seems to be also important according to sharma et al reported one molecule of fe vi can assault two water to stimulate fe vi self decay and eventually convert into a molecule of h2o2 at near neutral situation r1 in table 1 zhu et al 2020 that is based on the fe vi consumption 73 μm fe vi was decomposed at an initial dosage of 100 μm after reaction 20 min the solution can theoretically contain approximate 73 μm h2o2 while merely about 5 μm h2o2 was detected no h2o2 was examined at an initial fe vi dosage of 50 μm which is likely to present the participation of in situ h2o2 in promoting fe vi self decay meanwhile more rapid oxidation of smx was observed at higher dosage of fe vi fig s1a the phenomenon might indicate that apart from the promotion role of magnetic nanocrystalline iron oxide h2o2 possibly contributed to activating fe vi decomposition thereby improving smx degradation meanwhile the influence of ex situ h2o2 on smx degradation was also determined as depicted in fig 1b ex situ h2o2 significantly promotes fe vi to remove smx and the efficiency increases from 35 to 78 within 300 s at ph 8 0 alone h2o2 was powerless for smx degradation the above dates were well fitted with the pseudo first order rate law and the obtained conversion frequencies of fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are 0 08 and 0 30 min 1 respectively fig s1b moreover fig s2a shows the enhancement caused by h2o2 considerably depends on the additive amount of h2o2 as the initial h2o2 dosage varied from 10 to 70 μm the removal of smx increased dramatically when adding more than 70 μm h2o2 the promotion effect was suppressed this phenomenon may be explained as excessive h2o2 can compete with smx for reactive species thus restraining smx degradation therefore 70 μm h2o2 was considered as the initial dosage for the subsequent experiments besides ex situ h2o2 significantly promoted fe vi to oxidize smx at ph 7 0 9 0 fig s2b for the fe vi system with increasing reaction ph smx degradation was gradually inhibited and the removal rate decreased from 56 0 to 4 4 the oxidation capacity of fe vi is obviously ph dependent because the protonated h2feo4 and hfeo4 have larger spin density to possess higher oxidation potential than the deprotonated feo4 2 luo et al 2020 while in the fe vi h2o2 system the highest removal efficiency was exhibited at ph 8 0 this may be associated with the instability of fe vi in an acid ambient and the competitive consumption of reactive species by h2o2 3 2 negligible contribution of radicals in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems 3 2 1 identification of active oxidants in view of the intricate self decomposition products of fe vi including fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and h2o2 the possible active oxidants e g fe v fe iv oh and o2 in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems were seriatim examined to preliminarily evaluate the role of in situ and ex situ h2o2 epr spectroscopic technique has been frequently employed to monitor radicals zhou et al 2020a the fe vi h2o2 system showed a faint distinctive signal of the dmpo oh adduct αn αh 14 9 g zhou et al 2020b while it was not presented in the fe vi system fig 2 a this seems to suggest the formation of oh with the addition of ex situ h2o2 recently because of the involvement of inverted spin trapping dmpo dmpo dmpo oh or the forrester hepburn mechanism dmpo dmpo oh dmpo oh the detected dmpo oh signal is accounted for the oxidation of dmpo by high valent fe intermediates or and oh jing and chaplin 2017 tert butyl alcohol tba as a typical scavenger of oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was used to further explore the generation of oh lai et al 2020a once oh participated in the degradation of smx smx removal rate would be inhibited by tba fig 2b and 2c suggest that tba cannot affect smx removal no matter in fe vi system or in fe vi h2o2 system it is well known that oh could be trapped by benzoic acid to produce p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba hong et al 2020 no p hba was detected and benzoic acid was not degraded in both systems fig s3a and b further demonstrating that oh is not the active oxidant in brief in situ h2o2 and even adding ex situ h2o2 cannot induce the production of oh for degrading smx in fe vi oxidation process therefore the false epr signal of oh in the fe vi h2o2 system is likely to be deciphered by the forrester hepburn mechanism caused by reactive fe species which agreed well with the higher yields of fe iv and fe v in the fe vi h2o2 system see the discussion in the next section besides since there may be a one electron transfer pathway between fe vi and h2o2 to generate o2 it is imperative to certify the existence of o2 superoxide dismutase sod as a representative scavenger and nitro blue tetrazolium nbt as a characteristic probe were employed to verify the generation of o2 you et al 2020 as depicted in fig s3c there is no characteristic absorption peak at 560 nm which belongs to the characteristic wavelength of formazan the product of the reaction between nbt and o2 li et al 2018 negligible effects of sod on smx degradation were presented in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems fig 2b and c moreover dmpo was adopted to trap o2 and the six characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 were not examined in both systems fig 2a these phenomena collectively indicated no o2 was generated and high valent fe species might go through a two electron transfer step to react with in situ and ex situ h2o2 it has been well demonstrated that methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso can be oxidized by high valent fe species to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 through an oxygen atom transfer step r2 r4 which observably differs from the radicals based oxidation pathway ren et al 2020 wang et al 2020 smx degradation was completely inhibited by 30 μm pmso in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 oxidation processes fig 2b and c on account of the insignificant effect of pmso addition on fe vi consumption fig s4a fe vi is inefficient to react with pmso moreover based on the previous study and our results it can be found that fe vi presents a similar reactivity with smx 34 9 m 1 s 1 fig s1c and pmso 4 05 m 1 s 1 r2 at ph 8 0 indicating that smx degradation could be partly confined by the competition reaction between pmso and smx for fe vi overall fe vi fe v and fe iv may collectively contribute to smx degradation but fe v and or fe iv are the main reactive oxidants for smx removal the consumption of pmso and the generation of pmso2 were also examined fig 3 a and b suggest that ex situ h2o2 can significantly promote fe vi to oxidize pmso specifically the pmso removal rates in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are 24 and 65 respectively meaning that with the addition of ex situ h2o2 more high valent fe intermediates were generated approximate 100 pmso2 yields further illustrate that the role of radicals is ignorable in in situ and ex situ h2o2 activating fe vi it is an indisputable fact that fe iv goes through a two electron transfer step to oxidize pmso and then converts into fe ii r4 to confirm the involvement of fe iv bpy was employed to chelate with fe ii the characteristic absorbance peaks at 522 nm resulted by fe ii bpy complex ε 8650 m 1 cm 1 were presented in both systems fig s4b shao et al 2020 suggesting the existence of fe iv however since of the instability of fe iv and fe v and the inaccessibility of the apparatuses the direct evidence about the formation of fe v and fe iv is hard to obtain to sum up even with the exogenous addition of h2o2 the involvement of radicals is insignificant thereby only high valent fe species contributed to pollutant degradation in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems 3 2 2 selective oxidation in general high valent metal oxo species will present obvious selectivity in removing organic compounds zong et al 2020 2021 to further evaluate the influence of h2o2 on fe vi oxidation process the degradation efficiencies of 2 4 dcp atz bpa cbz pnp and atz were measured fig 3c and d show ex situ h2o2 can accelerate fe vi to remove all of the tested organic contaminants except atz the enhancement effects were obviously different which greatly rested with the chemical structure of organic compounds except for the tailing data the pseudo first order rate method was used to simulate the main parts of each data set and the obtained rate constants were shown in fig s5 the fe vi h2o2 system for oxidizing organic pollutants was 3 75 18 39 fold faster than those examined in fe vi system however negligible degradation of atz was displayed in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems this might be accounted for the weak electron donating capacity of atz although fe iv and fe v are more active than fe vi they are still insensitive to oxidizing electron deficient compounds which agreed well with previous studies shao et al 2019a zong et al 2021 in short the distinct selective oxidation phenomena manifested the obstacle of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in fostering fe vi to oxidize electron deficient pollutants and the few contribution of radicals 3 2 3 degradation intermediates of smx taking into account the difference in oxidative activity between radicals and high valent fe species smx degradation products were also confirmed to further determine the contribution of reactive oxidants a total of eleven products in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems were examined and were listed in table s2 with the corresponding ms ms spectrums were exhibited in figs s6 s16 noteworthily the total ion chromatograms depict the inapparent difference in product peaks in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 oxidation processes fig s17 and almost identical oxidation intermediates were detected in both systems table s2 the results exactly coincide the identical reactive species in the two oxidation processes since the degradation pathway of smx in the coupling process of fe vi and h2o2 has not been reported yet we minutely analyzed the smx conversion pathways which were shown in fig 4 smx degradation was initiated with hydrogen replacement reaction resulting in the generation of tp1 and tp2 then tp2 was further oxidized via the oxygen transfer step to produce tp3 given the abundant h atoms of aromatic amines hydrogen abstraction step was considered thus there will be a lot of n centered radicals involved in the reaction thus forming tp4 and tp5 the two products were also detected in the caso3 fe vi system where fe iv and fe v were considered as the main reactive species shao et al 2019a due to the electrophilic addition of the hydroxyl group the hydroxylated product tp6 of smx would be introduced furthermore sharma et al have revealed that fe vi is inclined to nucleophilic attack of isoxazole moiety rather than electrophilic attack sharma et al 2015 therefore the ring opening reaction of isoxazole moiety was likely to be involved to generate tp7 in pathway e tp8 tp9 and tp10 were derived from successive oxygen atom transfer steps overall the degradation products determined in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems are highly similar to other high valent metal oxo species oxidation processes zong et al 2020 and greatly coincide with the oxidation characteristics of high valent fe species e g inner sphere substitution or electrophilic addition via one or two electron transfer pathway rush et al 1995 besides radicals e g oh and o2 were revealed to primitively oxidize the methyl group on the isoxzaole ring of smx to produce corresponding hydroxylation products e g m z 288 m h and 256 m h du et al 2018 song et al 2021 these products were not checked no matter in the fe vi system or in the fe vi h2o2 system further indicating their similar reactive oxidants and the negligible contribution of oh and o2 3 3 mechanistic insights 3 3 1 h2o2 reduced high valent fe species via a two electron transfer pathway on the basis of the above experimental findings the participation of o2 and oh in pollutant degradation are excluded in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems suggesting h2o2 performed as a reductant to intensify fe vi oxidation reactivity via forming more fe iv and fe v therefore in the absence of smx fe vi consumption was monitored to testify the reducing property of h2o2 fig s18a indicates only a small amount of fe vi was decomposed without adding h2o2 9 2 μm with increasing the initial dosage of ex situ h2o2 fe vi consumption became higher furthermore the low detection rate of in situ h2o2 in the fe vi system also proves the crucial reducibility of h2o2 fig 1a moreover no evidence regarding the generation of o2 illustrates the two electron transfer peculiarity of in situ as well as ex situ h2o2 this is because once h2o2 only transfers one electron to fe vi the one electron transfer product o2 will participate in degrading smx in order to further confirm the above mechanism density functional theory dft calculation was applied since the oxidation of h2o2 demands preferential complexation with the hydrogen atom of metal ions to stimulate the inner sphere oxidation mechanism unprotonated feo4 2 could not achieve such coordination and cut no ice with h2o2 rush et al 1996 hence in our experimental condition ph 8 0 protonated hfeo4 was employed as the representative component for calculation fig 5 a and b show that the energy barriers for o2 and o2 formation are 16 690 and 43 537 kcal mol 1 severally a general rule of thumb suggested reactions with a barrier of 21 kcal mol 1 or less will proceed readily at room temperature young 2001 that is although the reaction of fe vi and h2o2 to form fe iv and o2 presented a positive gibbs free energy change the reaction can also proceed the results powerfully verify the favorable thermodynamics situation to oxidize h2o2 by fe vi via a two electron step at room temperature while o2 cannot be produced through the reaction between fe vi and h2o2 specifically the oxidation process is started with the polymerization pathway that two hydrogen atoms of h2o2 integrate with the hydrogen atom of hfeo4 and its adjacent oxygen atom and eventually releases o2 r5 the dissolved oxygen do content of reaction solution was monitored to demonstrate the generation of o2 fig 5c shows the do value in the fe vi h2o2 system increases as the reaction proceeds for single fe vi solution the do value did not changed which is possibly deciphered that in the process of fe vi self decay in situ produced h2o2 is too few to affect the do content 3 3 2 proposed reaction pathways for the generation of fe iv and fe v since reactive fe species i e fe vi fe v and fe iv generally oxidize contaminant via a direct one or two electron transfer process such as transforming pmso to the correlative sulfone pmso2 luo et al 2020 wu et al 2020a it is sensible to be analogous to the similar mechanism with fe vi regarding the oxidation of h2o2 by fe iv and fe v r6 and r7 therefore fe ii and fe iii can be generated through the reductive reactions of fe v and fe iv by h2o2 a previous work stated uncomplexed fe iii can reinforce fe vi decomposition and improve pollutant degradation jiang et al considered fe oh 3 can catalyze fe vi reduction by h2o2 thus contributing to the enhancement jiang et al 2016 while a cutting edge study revealed that fe oh 3 can make fe iv at a higher content through the oxidation process between fe vi and fe iii r8 zhang et al 2021 moreover fe vi presents a flexible reactivity with fe ii to form fe v r9 lee et al 2014 that is apart from in situ h2o2 fe ii and fe iii induced by chain reactions can also make a partial contribution to accelerating the generation of fe iv and fe v therefore the effects of exogenic fe ii and fe iii on smx degradation were examined fig s18b and c show both the two low valent fe species can accelerate fe vi to remove smx above results illustrate that even adding ex situ h2o2 similar reactive oxidants were formed in fe vi oxidation process indicating that in fe vi and fe vi h2o2 systems h2o2 showed similar contribution for activating fe vi incorporating our conclusion with the previous literature the schematic diagram of in situ and ex situ h2o2 activating fe vi is depicted in fig 6 initially ex situ h2o2 reduces fe vi via a two electron transfer step to produce fe iv 21 18 m 1 s 1 r5 which is faster than fe vi self coupling reaction 4 05 m 1 s 1 r1 lee et al 2014 thus accelerating the formation of fe iv intermediate then fe iv is put forward to be reduced by h2o2 to yield fe ii or go through self decay leading to the generation of fe iii r7 and r10 although the catalytic mechanism of fe iii is indistinct our results show fe iii definitely facilitates fe vi to degrade smx in addition newly formed fe ii can react with fe vi to form fe v r9 thus competing with fe vi self decay as well as h2o2 to expend fe vi fe v makes a similar contribution with fe iv referring to going through self decay or being reduced by h2o2 r6 and r11 meanwhile fe vi fe v and fe iv continually decompose to release in situ h2o2 which performs an identical effect with ex situ h2o2 resulting in quickly generating fe iv and fe v to elevate target contaminant removal 3 4 proposed reaction characteristics of peroxide activation of fe vi reductive agents play non negligible roles in accelerating the oxidation of organic contaminants by fe vi feng et al 2018 in this work we elaborate that h2o2 as a reductant contributes to promoting fe vi decomposition via a two electron redox pathway whether pms and peroxydisulfate pds which are derivatives of h2o2 can also strengthen fe vi through such a two electron reduction mechanism remains unclear therefore we carried out related experiments to reveal the oxidation performance and mechanism of fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems noteworthily if there is a one electron transfer pathway radicals e g so4 and oh will be generated and participate in contaminant removal as shown in fig s19a pms and pds slightly accelerate smx degradation in contrast with the fe vi oxidation process and the promotion effects are inferior to h2o2 the results are exactly corresponding with the standard redox potential of the three kinds of oxidant e0 1 76 v h2o2 e0 1 82 v pms and e0 2 01 v pds georgi and kopinke 2005 govindan et al 2014 h2o2 provides the optimal reducibility thus more likely to reduce fe vi however it has been well documented that pms is easier to be activated than h2o2 and pds since of its asymmetric molecular structure geogre and dionysios 2004 that is the promotion phenomenon caused by peroxide is inconsistent with the radicals based activation process to verify whether radicals are involved in smx oxidation pmso degradation and methanol meoh scavenging experiments were carried out fig s19b and c show that pms and pds can promote fe vi to convert pmso moreover the yields of pmso2 in both fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems are about 100 indicating that only high valent fe species contribute to smx oxidation generally meoh is regarded as a scavenger of both so4 k1 so4 meoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k1 oh meoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020b and was employed to certify the contributions of so4 and oh as expected the removal rate of smx was not affected fig s19d all the results verified that no radicals are generated in fe vi pms and fe vi pds systems however wu et al illuminated there is a synergistic effect on degradation of atrazine by coupling fe vi with pms where so4 is the major active species wu et al 2018 it is exactly contradictory with our results and the reason why resulted in the consequence may be accounted for the disparity in reaction ph and dosage actually in most radicals based fe vi oxidation processes high dosages of fe vi were added to catalyze pms or other oxidants which mainly utilized the catalytic reactivity of fe vi self decay product fe iii particles thereby underutilizing fe vi and increasing the cost of water treatment given the negligible effect of radicals in the fe vi peroxide oxidation process the conclusion that oxidant with peroxo o o bond is inclined to react with fe vi via a two electron transfer pathway can be concluded moreover the conclusion might provide an unique insight into the fe vi h2o2 system overall it is promising to further explore the reactive relationship between fe vi and o o bond 3 5 practical application of the fe vi h2o2 system the above results suggest the fe vi h2o2 system is a feasible alternative to remove pollutants as its stronger oxidation property than fe vi alone and harmless reductive product o2 the background components e g dissolved organic matter and different kinds of ions ubiquitously present in water environment which may significantly affect chemical oxidation process wu et al 2020b to investigate the applicability of the fe vi h2o2 system the effects of representative inorganic ions in water including four kinds of anions no3 hco3 cl so4 2 and two kinds of cations ca2 and mg2 on smx degradation were researched furthermore humic acid ha is a primary ingredient of dissolved organic matter and its influence was also revealed correlative results are shown in figs s20 and s21 when 10 mm coexisting ions were added except for hco3 negligible restriction effects on smx degradation were presented these results are different from the oxidation process with radicals e g oh o2 and so4 as the principal reactive species take oh as an example li et al have reported that in the process of hydroxylamine promoted fe3o4 pms for degradation of atz the removal efficiency of atz decreased from 94 to 82 in the presence of 10 mm cl where oh was the main reactive oxidant li et al 2019b this is because cl2 with lower redox potential will be produced through the chemical reaction between oh and cl lai et al 2020b in this work high concentration hco3 slightly inhibited smx degradation due to the increasing reaction ph data not shown which could change the protonated state of fe vi thus deteriorating smx removal rate besides fig s21c suggests that the inhibitory effect of smx degradation becomes more evident with increasing the dosage of ha the results could be ascribed as that i reductive constituents in ha may reduce fe iv and fe v to fe ii or and fe iii ii ha can compete with target pollutant to react with high valent fe species moreover a series of degradation experiments in surrounding water were implemented as presented in fig s22 the maximum smx degradation efficiency was achieved in deionized water and a similar result was observed in tap water this may be because there were few natural organics to compete with smx in deionized water and tap water in contrast the residual rates of smx in river water and lake water were 40 1 and 50 0 respectively merely after reaction 5 min the results could be explained by the relatively high dissolved organic constituents in real water table s3 these consequences attempt to show the fe vi h2o2 system is an efficient technology for removing contaminants in practical application 4 conclusion in this work we systematically demonstrated the activation mechanism of in situ and ex situ h2o2 in fe vi oxidation process active oxidants identification selective oxidation characteristic degradation product analysis and dft calculations collectively suggested that even exogenous addition of h2o2 did not induce the generation of radicals high valent fe species were proposed to oxidize in situ and ex situ h2o2 via a two electron transfer step thus directly or indirectly accelerating the generation of fe iv and fe v to boost fe vi reactivity in addition fe vi h2o2 system was put forward to be a feasible strategy for water pollutant remediation due to its strong oxidizing property and good resistance to natural water substances compared with other homogeneous reducing additives e g s iv fe iii no2 and i to activate fe vi h2o2 seems to be more environmentally friendly because of its harmless product o2 more interestingly our work utilized the degradation intermediates of target compound to determine the contribution of reactive oxidants which might be a good paradigm for the identification of active species in fe vi based oxidation process besides pds and pms were manifested to perform a similar role as h2o2 in activating fe vi it would be necessary to further evaluate the characteristics environmental risk and economic benefits of the fe vi peroxide system in contrast with other fe vi reductant systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

efficiency due to their recalcitrant characteristics the humic acid like fulvic acid like substances and building blocks were revealed as the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate 51 5 53 8 toc which likely contributed to the recalcitrant nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia were the major aob and anammox bacteria in the pn and anammox reactors respectively with the increased thp ad centrate proportion in the feed the abundance of both population declined interestingly denitratisoma being the major denitrifying bacteria in anammox reactor had relatively stable abundance 7 0 7 9 when thp ad centrate was improved from 3 and 100 suggesting the inhibition on anammox bacteria was not due to the overgrowth of denitrifying microorganism despite the high organics loading rate overall this study provides a guide to develop the energy saving pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment by pointing out potential challenges and mitigating strategies keywords thp ad centrate partial nitritation pn ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob anammox recalcitrant organics denitrification 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a promising technology for sludge management as it can recover energy while reducing the solids volume however this process is generally limited by the low efficiency of solid hydrolysis gonzalez et al 2018 the thermal hydrolysis process thp for sludge pretreatment which is operated at 160 190 c and 480 1260 kpa 4 8 12 6 bar recently draws much attention due to its significant advantages such as the improved sludge biodegradability with higher biogas production higher solid loading rate with minimized footprint effective removal of the pathogens and reduction of odor barber 2016 the thp ad process currently is an established and commercially available technology and there are many full scale thp ad processes in operation or in designing stages across the world zhang et al 2020 barber 2016 nevertheless one of the challenges in employing this technology is the higher amounts of ammonium and organic matter in the centrate compared to conventional ad for example the nh4 n and cod in thp ad centrate were reported to be as high 1781 mg l and 4242 mg l respectively while they were 1068 mg l and 369 mg l in conventional ad centrate zhang et al 2016a the high concentration of organics in thp ad centrate are mainly the maillard reaction products generated in thp process zhang et al 2020 and most of these organics are recalcitrant and may exert an adverse effect on microorganisms zhang et al 2020 2018 thus the treatment of thp ad centrate by a biological system would be challenging the partial nitritation anammox pn a process is a cost effective process for nitrogen removal which had been successfully developed for conventional ad centrate treatment sheng et al 2020 nsenga et al 2019 van der star et al 2007 recently some studies explored the feasibility of pn a process in thp ad centrate treatment zhang et al 2018 operated two one stage pn a reactors for conventional ad centrate and thp ad centrate treatment and the inhibitory effects of thp ad centrate on ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria were reported it calculated that the contribution of the anammox pathway on total nitrogen removal was reduced from 97 to 72 for thp ad centrate treatment an unstable performance was observed by xu et al 2020 performing a two step pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment the instability was also found by figdore et al 2012 who recommended a 1 1 dilution of the thp ad centrate to maintain a stable operation based on the above reported studies how to mitigate the inhibition needs to be considered when pn a process is employed to treat thp ad centrate it seems that the dilution of the influent is an effective way to achieve a stable and efficient pn a performance the characteristics of thp ad centrate differ with thp operation conditions ad performance and the efficiency of the dewatering process as such the optimum dilution ratio would be different for batches and continuous processed the information on pn a performance under various dilution ratios is limited currently furthermore the thp ad centrate is rich in organics such as high molecular weight proteins and humic substances zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2018 those compounds are recalcitrant to anaerobic conversion which lead to high cod concentration in the centrate it is not clear if the recalcitrant organic compounds can be removed and transformed under the aerobic and or anoxic circumstances in a pn a process in this study a two stage pn a process that was used to treat conventional ad centrate was developed into a thp ad centrate treatment system the feed to the system was a mixture of thp ad centrate and conventional ad centrate with progressive introduction of thp ad centrate from 10 to 100 the performance of the system was closely monitored in order to understand the stability of the system the dynamics of the microbial community especially the functional microorganisms responsible for pn and anammox in response to the increasing thp ad centrate loading were analyzed to understand the recalcitrant organics degradation in the pn a process the organics transformation and evolution were monitored by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra and size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detect inorganic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond analysis the results of this study are expected to provide a guide in developing the cost effective pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment by switching the conventional ad centrate treatment system to new operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 system set up and operation of pn a process the pn a process was carried out in two lab scale reactors a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 5 l was employed as pn reactor and an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a working volume of 0 5 l was adopted for anammox process the sbr was operated with a cycle length of 6 8 h including 6 min feeding 30 min anoxic mixing 270 360 min aeration 30 60 min setting and 24 min discharging in order to ensure a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio for the following anammox process the duration of aerobic period was thus varied in response to the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate details are indicated in fig 2 the sbr was mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm and the aeration was controlled by a rotary flow meter in each cycle 0 6 l wastewater was fed to the sbr resulting in a volume exchange ratio of 40 with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 h 20 h the effluent from the pn sbr was stored in a tank and then transferred to the uasb reactor continuously for ammonium and nitrite removal the seeding sludge for the pn and anammox reactors was collected from a full scale sidestream pn a process for conventional ad centrate treatment located in changi water reclamation plant wrp singapore during the operation the sludge retention time srt of sbr was controlled at around 20 d to avoid potential inhibition of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria thp ad centrate was introduced step wise and mixed with conventional ad centrate the long term operation was performed for 273 days divided with five phases based on the different thp ad centrate feed proportions vthp vthp vad namely 0 10 30 60 and 100 the influent ammonium was always maintained at around 600 mg n l despite of the increased feed proportions of thp ad centrate due to the high ammonium concentration in thp ad centrate a certain amount of final effluent was thus recycled to the influent to dilute the ammonium concentration the detailed characteristics of the mixed feed thp ad ad pn a across different phases were displayed in si 2 2 thp ad centrate a lab scale thp ad reactor with a working volume of 14 l was established to produce the thp ad centrate the digester was fed with the mixed thp sludge 165 c 30 min and concentrated wasted activated sludge was that was collected from jurong wrp singapore initially a small proportion of thp sludge 25 in volume was mixed with was to avoid any potential inhibition on ad and the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 28 d in order to avoid the accumulation of any volatile fatty acids vfas after around 30 days operation the proportion of thp sludge was increased to 50 and the srt was shortened to 20 d the thp ad reactor was operated at 37 the ts and vs for the thp sludge were 107 1 and 66 1 g l on average and 19 3 and 12 2 g l for concentrated was after 3 month operation stable performance was obtained the discharged sludge from thp ad reactor was dewatered and the liquid portion was collected as centrate the characteristics of the generated thp ad centrate and the conventional ad centrate collected from jurong wrp are shown in table 1 2 3 aob and anammox bacteria activity assays the aob activity tests were performed in the batch reactor 250 ml using a highly enriched aob culture which was cultivated for more than 2 years with an influent ammonium concentration of 600 mg n l chua et al 2019 the aob activity with different proportions of thp ad centrate in total volume 10 20 40 and 60 was investigated and then compared with a control test to evaluate the inhibition effect the temperature was around 25 c and the ph and do were controlled at 7 5 0 3 and 2 3 mg l respectively the enriched anammox biomass was collected from a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the nitrogen loading rate of 2 24 kg n m3 d was adopted and the nitrogen removal rate was around 1 9 kg n m3 d obtained before the sampling for the tests the anammox batch tests were carried out in a sealed batch reactor 250 ml with initial nitrite concentration of 50 mg n l the nitrogen gas was purged into the reactor and headspace to ensure anaerobic conditions prior to the reaction it should be noted that in order to avoid the potential adverse effect caused by high ammonium the ammonium in the raw thp ad centrate for the batch tests was mostly removed by zeolite adsorption and struvite precipitation lin et al 2013 escudero et al 2015 all the batch tests had the initial ammonium around 220 mg n l six samples were taken in each test and the variations of ammonium and nitrite were monitored aob and anammox bacteria activities were evaluated based on the aerobic and anoxic ammonium removal rates mg nh4 n g mlvss h 2 4 analytical methods the influent pn effluent and anammox effluent were regularly collected and immediately filtered by a 0 45 μm filters the nh4 n no2 n no3 n were measured according to the standard method apha 1998 chemical oxygen demand cod and alkalinity were determined using hach test kits protein and polysaccharide were measured by the lowry folin and phenol sulfuric acid methods according to the previously reported study cao et al 2019a ph was monitored with an on line ph meter mettler toledo three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem and the size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detect inorganic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond analysis were performed to characterize the soluble organics the details of analytical methods were described in our previous study cao et al 2019a liu et al 2019 the microbial communities in pn and anammox reactor were revealed by high throughput sequencing analysis with 338f 806r primers that amplifies the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene cao et al 2019b du et al 2017 the detailed analysis procedure can be found online https cloud majorbio com 3 results 3 1 effect of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria activities in the pn a process aob and anammox bacteria are the major functional microorganisms that play important roles in efficient nitrogen removal in order to rapidly start up the pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment a series of batch tests was carried out to determine the effect of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria activities prior to long term operation as shown in fig 1 aob lost its activity by 34 1 when exposed to 10 thp ad centrate and the inhibition effect aggravated with the increasing thp ad centrate proportions more than 60 activity was reduced at 60 thp ad centrate serious inhibition was also observed for anammox bacteria though only 11 6 anammox activity was lost with 10 thp ad centrate significantly higher inhibition was found when it exposed to 20 60 thp ad centrate compared to aob and the anammox bacteria was completely suppressed at 60 thp ad centrate similar results were reported by zhang et al 2018 which indicated the organic compounds derived from thp were the main inhibitors the above results clearly suggest that thp ad centrate cannot be directly treated by the pn a process or else serious inhibition would occur resulting in the deteriorated removal performance since the autotrophic aob and anammox bacteria have a relatively long cell doubling times and low biomass yields cao et al 2020 dilution of thp ad centrate is necessary to alleviate the inhibition effect when establishing a pn a process 3 2 overall nitrogen removal performance of pn a process during long term operation the pn a process was initiated with a low proportion of thp ad centrate mixed with conventional ad centrate step wise increase of the proportion of thp ad centrate was adopted to explore whether the aob and anammox bacteria could be acclimated in response to the inhibition the nitrogen removal performance of pn a process during the long term operation is displayed in fig 2 initially the sbr was fed with 100 conventional ad centrate after around 20 days operation with adjusting the aeration flowrate and aerobic duration an acceptable no2 n nh4 n ratio was obtained in the pn reactor effluent at 0 25 l min and 255 min the anammox uasb reactor was then started up with pn effluent as feed an ideal nitrogen removal was rapidly achieved in the anammox uasb reactor from day 63 the influent was prepared with 10 thp ad centrate and 90 conventional ad centrate the ammonium in pn effluent was found slightly increased resulting in excess ammonium in anammox reactor effluent fig 2c d this suggests aob activity may be affected by the introduction of thp ad centrate as revealed by the batch tests fig 1 in order to increase aob activity the aeration flowrate was increased slightly from 0 25 to 0 3 l min the do was still maintained at below 0 1 mg l fig 2a after this a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio was realized for the downstream anammox process when thp ad centrate proportion in the feed was further increased to 30 in phase 3 98 137 d and 60 in phase 4 138 195 d similar disturbance on the performance was observed therefore the aeration flowrate was gradually adjusted to 0 6 l min and 0 8 l min in phases 3 and 4 respectively fig 2a the effluent ammonium was found to be still excess the aerobic duration was then increased to 270 min on day 113 for producing appropriate no2 n nh4 n at the stable period the do in phases 3 and 4 were all maintained at around 0 2 mg l it should be noted that a relatively high effluent ammonium concentration appeared from day 157 this was probably caused by the accidental sludge washout from pn reactor during a lab lock down period in singapore on day 181 the lost sludge was added back to the pn reactor and the performance of pn reactor gradually recovered in phase 5 196 273 d with 100 thp ad centrate the aeration flowrate was raised to 1 0 l min the do in pn sbr was increased to 0 6 mg l nitrate was accumulated possibly due to the relatively high oxygen supply on day 225 the aeration flowrate was then reduced to 0 4 l min do was reduced to below 0 1 mg l with the aerobic duration improved to 360 min followed by free nitrous acid fna treatment on day 223 500 mg no2 n ph 5 5 12 h to rapidly suppress the nob growth and recover pn duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 an obvious decrease of nitrate was observed in the initial several days however it gradually accumulated again over 10 days suggesting the high aeration flowrate was not the major reason for nob growth a low ph around 6 5 was observed during this period which was likely resulted from the shortage of alkalinity nahco3 was then added in the raw thp ad centrate 2 g l from day 248 with the alkalinity to ammonium ratios g caco3 g nh4 n increased from 4 9 to 5 5 it was found that nitrite in pn effluent gradually increased with the decrease of nitrate on day 255 the aeration flowrate was improved to 0 6 l min to further improve nitrite to ammonium ratio and the nitrate concentration in pn effluent was reduced this clearly demonstrates insufficient inorganic carbon was the primary reason for the deteriorated performance of pn in phase 5 the variation of the nitrogen removal rate nrr during the long term operation is displayed in fig 2e the nrr was closely related to the pn performance 0 55 kg n m3 d was maintained during the stable period when thp ad centrate feed proportions were 10 60 a reduction to 0 35 kg n m3 d occurred in phase 5 with 100 thp ad centrate it was calculated that the contribution of the pn reactor for the total nitrogen removal was 10 9 on average fig 2f which mainly resulted from the denitrification using biodegradable organics in centrate with the increasing thp ad centrate in influent the organic matter loading rate improved in pn reactor however no obvious improvement of denitrification was observed in pn sbr this suggests that easily biodegradable organics presented in the thp ad centrate were limited the detailed analysis will be discussed in section 4 2 the majority of nitrogen was removed in the anammox uasb reactor accounting for 89 1 on average while its contribution was reduced in phase 5 due to the aggravated inhibition on anammox 3 3 performance of cod removal in pn a process fig 3 shows the evolution of organic compounds during the long term operation of the pn a process due to the high amount of organics present in thp ad centrate the cod in the effluent of pn and anammox gradually increased with the increased proportions of thp ad centratein the feed in phase 1 the effluent cod of pn was 175 9 mg l on average and it largely increased to 2386 4 mg l in phase 5 meanwhile the cod concentration varied from 192 0 to 2375 7 mg l in anammox reactor effluent the protein and polysaccharide were the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate and they also increased step wise in the effluent of both reactors fig 3a b the cod removal efficiency was 33 6 in phase 1 while it showed a decreasing trend with the increasing feed proportion of thp ad centrate this clearly demonstrates that the recalcitrant organics from thp ad centrate accumulated in the system moreover cod removal was mainly carried out in pn reactor the accumulation of organics was observed in the anammox reactor instead detailed reasons for this will be discussed in section 4 2 in order to better understand the organics evolution in the two stage pn a process eem and lc ocd analysis were conducted 3 3 1 fluorescent organic compounds there were three peaks identified in the conventional ad centrate fig 4 a they are related to fulvic acid like substances for peak a ex em of 230 398 nm humic acid like organics for peak b ex em of 330 412 nm and tyrosine tryptophan like and smp like species for peak c ex em of 280 368 nm chen et al 2019 only peaks a and b were detected in thp ad centrate fig 4g and their fluorescence intensities were much higher than those of conventional ad centrate indicating that highly recalcitrant organics were present in thp ad centrate the fluorescence intensities of these peaks were weakened in the pn reactor fig 4 suggesting part of fulvic acid like substances peak a and humic acid like organics peak b were removed and or transformed during the aerobic process however fulvic acid like substances was not further reduced in the subsequent anoxic anaerobic process some organics transformation occurred in the anammox reactor leading to the recalcitrant organic accumulation the removal of humic acid like organics in the anammox reactor was also very limited the quantitative reduction and accumulation values can be found in table s2 these results are in line with the cod changes fig 3 3 3 2 sub fractions of the organic compounds with different molecular weight mw as shown in fig 5 the building blocks that relate to the fraction of humic like substances were the primary organic compounds in the influent pn effluent and anammox effluent it accounted for more than 40 of total organic carbon followed by the lmw neutrals hmw pn and hmw ps the proportions of building blocks hmw pn and hmw ps were all higher in thp ad centrate fed phases compared to the conventional ad centrate as feed this further confirmed the presence of recalcitrant organics in thp ad centrate similarly the removal of the above organics mainly took place in the pn reactor and limited organic matter was reduced in anammox reactor fig 5a c to be specific in phase 1 without thp ad centrate almost all the sub fractions of the organic compounds were reduced in pn reactor the organics removed in the pn reactor were mainly attributed to the building blocks and lmw neutrals which decreased from 33 4 mg c l to 24 0 mg c l and 25 3 mg c l to 13 0 mg c l respectively the lmw organics were further reduced in anammox reactor while the building blocks and hmw pn were found to increase which was likely responsible for the increase of effluent cod for the system fed with thp ad centrate the removal of organics was also mainly performed in the pn reactor the major compounds removed were building blocks and lmw neutrals as well 3 4 microbial community dynamics in response to thp ad centrate in the pn reactor there were nine major bacterial phyla fig 6 a of which bacteroidota proteobacteria and chloroflexi werepredominant proteobacteria that contains nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying microorganisms are widely distributed in wastewater biological nutrient removal system ji et al 2020 du et al 2019a yang et al 2020 the proportion slightly decreased with increasing thp ad centrate feeding proportion varying from 33 9 to 29 8 bacteroidota and chloroflexi may be responsible for degradation of hmw organic compounds fernandez gomez et al 2013 kindaichi et al 2012 the relative abundance of chloroflexi reduced from 17 7 to 4 9 with the increase of thp ad centrate feeding proportion this is in line with the cod removal efficiency which declined at the higher feeding proportion of thp ad centrate bacteroidota initially increased to 39 8 when the feeding proportion of thp ad centrate was 30 but reduced to 31 2 in phase 5 the taxonomic classification at genus level reports nitrosomonas was the major aob that were responsible for the nitrite production in the pn reactor its relative abundance decreased from 14 6 to 5 3 with the increased feeding proportion of thp ad centrate since an anoxic phase was included before the aerobic phase in the pn sbr denitrifying microorganisms were also detected they showed increasing trend at the higher thp ad centrate feeding proportion for example thauera a widely reported denitrifying species in biological nitrogen removal systems liu et al 2013 increased from 4 8 to 13 6 10 to 60 thp ad centrate feeding proportion this was probably due to the improved organic loading rate which facilitated the growth of denitrifying microorganisms in the anammox reactor chloroflexi bacteroidota and proteobacteria were again dominant chloroflexi was the most predominant phyla and its relative abundance showed a decreasing trend with the increased thp ad centrate feeding proportion reduced from 35 5 to 22 9 in comparison bacteroidota displayed an opposite tendency improved from 15 3 to 22 5 proteobacteria also increased from 15 3 to 25 5 and stabilized from thp ad centrate feeding proportion of 30 onwards however planctomycetota containing the anammox bacteria van teeseling et al 2015 reduced from 14 1 to 5 9 with the increased thp ad centrate feeding proportion at genus level candidatus brocadia was the major anammox bacteria which accounted for 7 9 at 10 thp ad centrate feeding proportion however its relative abundance gradually declined to 3 2 in phase 5 due to the abundant organics in pn effluent the denitrifying bacteria was also detected in anammox reactor denitratisoma that belongs to phylum proteobacteria was predominant it increased substantially from 3 9 to 7 8 when thp ad centrate feeding proportion increased to 30 and its relative abundance maintained at 7 0 7 9 during the following phases this was not observed in previous studies cao et al 2020 which concluded that the more the organics in the feed the higher the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganism in the anammox reactor in this study the organics fed to anammox reactor were mostly recalcitrant which were difficult to be utilized by the denitrifying bacteria thus limiting its growth it is noteworthy that nitrosomonas was also identified in anammox reactor which was likely carried over from the pn effluent that contained solids the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was 1 6 in phase 5 4 discussion 4 1 system performance in response to increased thp ad centrate this study clearly demonstrated that the thp ad centrate would cause serious inhibition on aob and anammox activity and the inhibitory effects aggravated with the improving thp ad centrate proportions it is believed that the soluble inert organics in the thp ad centrate are the major inhibitory compounds figdore et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the humic like and fulvic acid like substances as well as hmw biopolymers i e hmw protein are known as recalcitrant organics and accounted for a high proportion in thp ad centrate which are likely the major inhibitors during thp the recalcitrant maillard reaction products including lmws such as aldehydes acrylamides dicarbonyls ketones and polymeric compounds with hmws such as advanced glycation end products could be largely produced these compounds were reported to have averse biological effects figdore et al 2012 in our previous study the organics like pyrrolidines benzenoids pyridines and their derivatives were identified in the thp ad centrate they were also reported to be inhibitory to bacteria growth with the increase of the thp ad centrate proportion the amount of inhibitors increased thus the inhibitory effects were aggravated nevertheless the decrease of their activities were reduce with the operation fig s2 clearly suggesting the long term acclimation to step wise increased loading would mitigate such inhibition an ideal nitrogen removal performance was maintained when thp ad centrate feeding proportion was below 60 a mean nrr of 0 55 kg n m3 d was obtained in phase 4 with 60 thp ad centrate which was close to the previously reported nrr in pn a process for conventional ad centrate treatment however when 100 thp ad centrate was applied the average nrr reduced to 0 37 kg n m3 d in the later period of phase 5 in the two stage pn a process stable pn is of supreme importance for the following anammox process a highly efficient nitrogen removal would be achieved when pn is controlled with a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio and limited nitrate production in this study aob activity was gradually inhibited with the increasing thp ad centrate feeding proportion leading to the reduction of the relative abundance of aob to optimize the performance the aeration flowrate was adjusted to enhance the oxygen transfer in addition to the soluble organics the thp ad centrate also contained a high amount of particulate and colloidal organics as well as polymer coagulants used for thickening these would all affect the oxygen transfer to biomass increasing the aeration flowrate was thus necessary to relieve the obstacle with higher organic loading meanwhile the improvement of the aeration flowrate would not cause intensive nitrate production suggesting the activity of nob was not enhanced by the increased oxygen supply this was also confirmed by the result of the high throughput sequencing analysis that nob was not detected during the whole operation period apart from the relatively high free ammonia and free nitrous acid in the pn reactor that suppressed the nob activity the increased inhibition effect from thp ad centrate may also have negative impact on nob in phase 5 nitrate was gradually accumulated due to the deficit of alkalinity it is known that a high alkalinity to ammonium ratio g caco3 g nh4 n would favor nitrite accumulation yun et al 2020 hou et al 2014 the mean alkalinity to ammonium ratio in conventional ad centrate was 6 2 while it was 4 9 in thp ad centrate the ratio was reduced with the increase of thp ad centrate feeding proportion furthermore the loss of alkalinity is a common phenomenon during the aeration a greater loss would occur when higher aeration flowrate is applied the pn performance recovered after alkalinity being supplemented in the influent it should be pointed out that a relatively high nitrate concentration remained in pn effluent in the later stage of phase 5 the accumulated nitrate from previous deteriorated pn was difficult to reduce by pre denitrification due to the limited biodegradable organics in thp ad centrate in addition it was found that the settleability of pn sludge was deteriorated when feeding 100 thp ad centrate no obvious biomass washout was observed in the initial operation during phase 1 3 while the effluent svi30 30 min sludge volume index and solid content in phase 5 100 thp ad centrate were as high as 209 4 ml g mlss and 1320 1 mg mlss l respectively fig s3 this issue was probably caused by excessive polymer and solid particulate and colloidal organics fed into pn reactor it has been reported that the sludge settleability would be worsened with the addition of polymeric substrate starch and synthetic polymer martins et al 2011 juang 2005 in this study to prepare thp ad centrate the polymer polyacrylamide dose of 10 g kg ts was applied to improve the dewaterability of the sludge though a good solid liquid separation was obtained the solids content in the thp ad centrate was still as high as 1 8 g ts l the residual polymer and solids in the thp ad centrate probably deteriorated the sludge settleability in pn reactor in addition a serious foaming was observed in pn reactor with 100 thp ad centrate which was attributed to the high concentration of polymer present in influent in order to maintain the pn performance and avoid the high solid content introduced to anammox reactor the washout biomass was collected and fed into sbr again every day the anammox reactor seemed to be less affected by the inhibition and disturbance in the long term operation the nrr was reduced by 32 7 with 100 thp ad centrate one possible reason was that the inhibitor in thp ad centrate was partially removed in the pn reactor and the anammox can be acclimated in response to the attenuated inhibition secondly the anammox bacteria were embedded in aggregates which have a higher resilience than the floc sludge sheng et al 2010 adav et al 2008 the detailed mechanism needs to be further explored in order to better understand the acclimation process 4 2 organics degradation and effluent cod in pn a process in the two stage pn a process the ad centrate experienced an anoxic oxic period in pn reactor and an anoxic anaerobic period in the subsequent anammox reactor the organics in the centrate were expected to be degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms the result reports the refractory fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like organics as well as all the sub fractions of the organic compounds were reduced in pn reactor nevertheless these organics were stable in the anammox reactor it is likely that the remaining organics discharged from pn reactor were more recalcitrant since they had been subjected to degradation under anoxic and aerobic conditions in pn reactor those organics cannot further stimulate the growth of denitrifying bacteria any more as evidenced by the low contribution of denitrification on nitrogen removal and the relatively stable denitrification population despite the higher organics loading rates in the anammox reactor on the other hand the relatively low cod removal may be also attributed to the release of organics that were derived from the soluble microbial products smp and particulate colloidal organics transformation as clearly indicated in phase 1 fig 3 the cod in anammox reactor effluent was even higher than that in pn effluent leading to a negative cod removal efficiency the smp that released from cell decay mainly are the organic compounds with the molecular weights mws in the range from 0 5 to 50 kda ni et al 2011 these organics are generally remaining in the effluent of biological treatment system due to their refractory nature xie et al 2016 soh et al 2020 in anammox reactor an extreme long sludge retention time srt is usually adopted to facilitate the growth of anammox bacteria due to its long double time and low biomass yield cao et al 2020 the production of smp is thus common ni et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a in a study conducted by zhang et al 2016a the smp in the range of 10 5 100 mg c l was detected in a reactor fed with synthetic organics free wastewater besides it was also reported that smp production would be increased when the microorganisms suffered from adverse environmental conditions wang and zhang 2010 in this study the inhibition effect of organics on anammox bacteria was revealed so an increasing amount of smp was expected moreover the thp ad centrate generally contains large amounts of particulate and colloidal organic compounds these organics would be trapped and accumulated in the anammox uasb reactor due to the fact that the sludge was not discharged during the operation the organic transformation from the particulate and colloidal form to the soluble form would occur under the anoxic anaerobic conditions with extreme long srt with the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate more particulate and colloidal organics were fed into uasb reactor so that higher soluble organics would be produced the easily biodegradable organics may be utilized by denitrification bacteria with the refractory compounds accumulated in effluent such as fulvic acid like substances and hmw ps figs 4 and 5 4 3 practical implications currently an increasing number of thp facilities are in operation or construction world widely barber 2016 leading to the generation of a large quantity of thp ad centrate characterized by high ammonium and organics content this study demonstrated that thp ad centrate can be treated by the cost effective pn a process while a step wise acclimation by gradual introduction of thp ad centrate is recommended for stable operation according to the results in this study the maximum thp ad feeding proportion is suggested not to exceed 60 it should be pointed out that the optimal feeding proportion of thp ad centrate needs to be explored for each individual plant due to the different characteristics of thp ad centrate i e soluble particulate and colloidal organics and coagulation polymer dosage as well as ammonium concentration furthermore the alkalinity concentration in the influent and pn reactor should be carefully monitored this is mainly dependent on the characteristic of thp ad centrate and aeration rate and a pre evaluation is necessary when the system influent is changed in the pn a process the residual nitrate in the final effluent is inevitable du et al 2019b in this study although the nob was suppressed in pn reactor nitrate still appeared in the final effluent due to the production by the anammox process the organics present in thp ad centrate may reduce nitrate via denitrification however such contribution is limited due to their recalcitrant nature the average effluent nitrate was still as high as 33 1 mg n l in phase 4 with 60 thp ad centrate which requires further treatment the effluent can be transferred back to the mainstream process alternatively a small portion of municipal wastewater can be diverted to the pn a process to increase easily degradable organics to enhance denitrification during the anoxic phase in pn reactor or in anammox reactor the mixing ratio between these two wastewater streams needs to be carefully explored to avoid the overgrowth of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria it is noteworthy that large quantity of recalcitrant organics was still present in the treated effluent the exploration of the link between these organics and the inhibition effects is an interesting research further studies can focus on this point to bring a better understanding of the inhibitory effects thus provide a guide for system operation with stable and efficient removal performance the coagulation and advanced oxidation process can be employed as post treatment to further reduce these recalcitrant organics these processes have been widely applied in industrial wastewater for advanced treatment e g landfill leachate chen et al 2019 coking wastewater wang et al 2019 on the other hand the above mentioned physicochemical process can also be employed as a pre treatment step to improve the biodegradability of the organics in the influent thus the potential organic inhibitors are expected to be reduced or removed and the suppression of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria shall be relieved future studies are suggested to focus on this post pre treatment and evaluate its effectiveness efficiency and economy 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn in this study 1 the inhibition of thp ad centrare on aob and anammox bacteria can be overcome in a two stage pn a process by gradual acclimation 100 thp ad centrate may deteriorate the pn a performance due to the sludge washout in pn reactor 1320 mg ss l caused by excessive polymer and solids as well as the shortage of alkalinity 2 the humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances as well as the building blocks were the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate cod removal 33 6 10 8 decreased with increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate mainly occurred in pn reactor and it was very limited in anammox reactor 3 nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia were identified as the major aob and anammox bacteria in the two stage pn a system their relative abundance decreased with the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate denitratisoma was detected as the major denitrifying bacteria in anammox reactor its relative abundance was not affected by thp ad centrate

16734,the centrate produced from a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment coupled anaerobic digestion thp ad system is generally characterized by high concentrations of ammonium and recalcitrant organics in this study a cost effective partial nitritation anammox pn a process was developed to evaluate the potential challenges in thp ad centrate treatment the results show ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria were seriously inhibited by thp ad centrate while long term acclimation together with aeration optimization can mitigate such inhibition a nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 55 kg n m3 d was obtained and maintained with 60 thp ad centrate as feed however 100 thp ad centrate caused sludge wash out from pn reactor due to excessive polymer and high solids in influent the alkalinity deficit also reduced the aob activity moreover anammox activity and overall nrr also declined to 0 37 kg n m3 d the organics transformation mainly occurred in pn reactor with very low removal efficiency due to their recalcitrant characteristics the humic acid like fulvic acid like substances and building blocks were revealed as the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate 51 5 53 8 toc which likely contributed to the recalcitrant nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia were the major aob and anammox bacteria in the pn and anammox reactors respectively with the increased thp ad centrate proportion in the feed the abundance of both population declined interestingly denitratisoma being the major denitrifying bacteria in anammox reactor had relatively stable abundance 7 0 7 9 when thp ad centrate was improved from 3 and 100 suggesting the inhibition on anammox bacteria was not due to the overgrowth of denitrifying microorganism despite the high organics loading rate overall this study provides a guide to develop the energy saving pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment by pointing out potential challenges and mitigating strategies keywords thp ad centrate partial nitritation pn ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob anammox recalcitrant organics denitrification 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a promising technology for sludge management as it can recover energy while reducing the solids volume however this process is generally limited by the low efficiency of solid hydrolysis gonzalez et al 2018 the thermal hydrolysis process thp for sludge pretreatment which is operated at 160 190 c and 480 1260 kpa 4 8 12 6 bar recently draws much attention due to its significant advantages such as the improved sludge biodegradability with higher biogas production higher solid loading rate with minimized footprint effective removal of the pathogens and reduction of odor barber 2016 the thp ad process currently is an established and commercially available technology and there are many full scale thp ad processes in operation or in designing stages across the world zhang et al 2020 barber 2016 nevertheless one of the challenges in employing this technology is the higher amounts of ammonium and organic matter in the centrate compared to conventional ad for example the nh4 n and cod in thp ad centrate were reported to be as high 1781 mg l and 4242 mg l respectively while they were 1068 mg l and 369 mg l in conventional ad centrate zhang et al 2016a the high concentration of organics in thp ad centrate are mainly the maillard reaction products generated in thp process zhang et al 2020 and most of these organics are recalcitrant and may exert an adverse effect on microorganisms zhang et al 2020 2018 thus the treatment of thp ad centrate by a biological system would be challenging the partial nitritation anammox pn a process is a cost effective process for nitrogen removal which had been successfully developed for conventional ad centrate treatment sheng et al 2020 nsenga et al 2019 van der star et al 2007 recently some studies explored the feasibility of pn a process in thp ad centrate treatment zhang et al 2018 operated two one stage pn a reactors for conventional ad centrate and thp ad centrate treatment and the inhibitory effects of thp ad centrate on ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria were reported it calculated that the contribution of the anammox pathway on total nitrogen removal was reduced from 97 to 72 for thp ad centrate treatment an unstable performance was observed by xu et al 2020 performing a two step pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment the instability was also found by figdore et al 2012 who recommended a 1 1 dilution of the thp ad centrate to maintain a stable operation based on the above reported studies how to mitigate the inhibition needs to be considered when pn a process is employed to treat thp ad centrate it seems that the dilution of the influent is an effective way to achieve a stable and efficient pn a performance the characteristics of thp ad centrate differ with thp operation conditions ad performance and the efficiency of the dewatering process as such the optimum dilution ratio would be different for batches and continuous processed the information on pn a performance under various dilution ratios is limited currently furthermore the thp ad centrate is rich in organics such as high molecular weight proteins and humic substances zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2018 those compounds are recalcitrant to anaerobic conversion which lead to high cod concentration in the centrate it is not clear if the recalcitrant organic compounds can be removed and transformed under the aerobic and or anoxic circumstances in a pn a process in this study a two stage pn a process that was used to treat conventional ad centrate was developed into a thp ad centrate treatment system the feed to the system was a mixture of thp ad centrate and conventional ad centrate with progressive introduction of thp ad centrate from 10 to 100 the performance of the system was closely monitored in order to understand the stability of the system the dynamics of the microbial community especially the functional microorganisms responsible for pn and anammox in response to the increasing thp ad centrate loading were analyzed to understand the recalcitrant organics degradation in the pn a process the organics transformation and evolution were monitored by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra and size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detect inorganic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond analysis the results of this study are expected to provide a guide in developing the cost effective pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment by switching the conventional ad centrate treatment system to new operating conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 system set up and operation of pn a process the pn a process was carried out in two lab scale reactors a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 5 l was employed as pn reactor and an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with a working volume of 0 5 l was adopted for anammox process the sbr was operated with a cycle length of 6 8 h including 6 min feeding 30 min anoxic mixing 270 360 min aeration 30 60 min setting and 24 min discharging in order to ensure a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio for the following anammox process the duration of aerobic period was thus varied in response to the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate details are indicated in fig 2 the sbr was mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm and the aeration was controlled by a rotary flow meter in each cycle 0 6 l wastewater was fed to the sbr resulting in a volume exchange ratio of 40 with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 h 20 h the effluent from the pn sbr was stored in a tank and then transferred to the uasb reactor continuously for ammonium and nitrite removal the seeding sludge for the pn and anammox reactors was collected from a full scale sidestream pn a process for conventional ad centrate treatment located in changi water reclamation plant wrp singapore during the operation the sludge retention time srt of sbr was controlled at around 20 d to avoid potential inhibition of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria thp ad centrate was introduced step wise and mixed with conventional ad centrate the long term operation was performed for 273 days divided with five phases based on the different thp ad centrate feed proportions vthp vthp vad namely 0 10 30 60 and 100 the influent ammonium was always maintained at around 600 mg n l despite of the increased feed proportions of thp ad centrate due to the high ammonium concentration in thp ad centrate a certain amount of final effluent was thus recycled to the influent to dilute the ammonium concentration the detailed characteristics of the mixed feed thp ad ad pn a across different phases were displayed in si 2 2 thp ad centrate a lab scale thp ad reactor with a working volume of 14 l was established to produce the thp ad centrate the digester was fed with the mixed thp sludge 165 c 30 min and concentrated wasted activated sludge was that was collected from jurong wrp singapore initially a small proportion of thp sludge 25 in volume was mixed with was to avoid any potential inhibition on ad and the sludge retention time srt was maintained at 28 d in order to avoid the accumulation of any volatile fatty acids vfas after around 30 days operation the proportion of thp sludge was increased to 50 and the srt was shortened to 20 d the thp ad reactor was operated at 37 the ts and vs for the thp sludge were 107 1 and 66 1 g l on average and 19 3 and 12 2 g l for concentrated was after 3 month operation stable performance was obtained the discharged sludge from thp ad reactor was dewatered and the liquid portion was collected as centrate the characteristics of the generated thp ad centrate and the conventional ad centrate collected from jurong wrp are shown in table 1 2 3 aob and anammox bacteria activity assays the aob activity tests were performed in the batch reactor 250 ml using a highly enriched aob culture which was cultivated for more than 2 years with an influent ammonium concentration of 600 mg n l chua et al 2019 the aob activity with different proportions of thp ad centrate in total volume 10 20 40 and 60 was investigated and then compared with a control test to evaluate the inhibition effect the temperature was around 25 c and the ph and do were controlled at 7 5 0 3 and 2 3 mg l respectively the enriched anammox biomass was collected from a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the nitrogen loading rate of 2 24 kg n m3 d was adopted and the nitrogen removal rate was around 1 9 kg n m3 d obtained before the sampling for the tests the anammox batch tests were carried out in a sealed batch reactor 250 ml with initial nitrite concentration of 50 mg n l the nitrogen gas was purged into the reactor and headspace to ensure anaerobic conditions prior to the reaction it should be noted that in order to avoid the potential adverse effect caused by high ammonium the ammonium in the raw thp ad centrate for the batch tests was mostly removed by zeolite adsorption and struvite precipitation lin et al 2013 escudero et al 2015 all the batch tests had the initial ammonium around 220 mg n l six samples were taken in each test and the variations of ammonium and nitrite were monitored aob and anammox bacteria activities were evaluated based on the aerobic and anoxic ammonium removal rates mg nh4 n g mlvss h 2 4 analytical methods the influent pn effluent and anammox effluent were regularly collected and immediately filtered by a 0 45 μm filters the nh4 n no2 n no3 n were measured according to the standard method apha 1998 chemical oxygen demand cod and alkalinity were determined using hach test kits protein and polysaccharide were measured by the lowry folin and phenol sulfuric acid methods according to the previously reported study cao et al 2019a ph was monitored with an on line ph meter mettler toledo three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem and the size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detect inorganic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond analysis were performed to characterize the soluble organics the details of analytical methods were described in our previous study cao et al 2019a liu et al 2019 the microbial communities in pn and anammox reactor were revealed by high throughput sequencing analysis with 338f 806r primers that amplifies the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene cao et al 2019b du et al 2017 the detailed analysis procedure can be found online https cloud majorbio com 3 results 3 1 effect of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria activities in the pn a process aob and anammox bacteria are the major functional microorganisms that play important roles in efficient nitrogen removal in order to rapidly start up the pn a process for thp ad centrate treatment a series of batch tests was carried out to determine the effect of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria activities prior to long term operation as shown in fig 1 aob lost its activity by 34 1 when exposed to 10 thp ad centrate and the inhibition effect aggravated with the increasing thp ad centrate proportions more than 60 activity was reduced at 60 thp ad centrate serious inhibition was also observed for anammox bacteria though only 11 6 anammox activity was lost with 10 thp ad centrate significantly higher inhibition was found when it exposed to 20 60 thp ad centrate compared to aob and the anammox bacteria was completely suppressed at 60 thp ad centrate similar results were reported by zhang et al 2018 which indicated the organic compounds derived from thp were the main inhibitors the above results clearly suggest that thp ad centrate cannot be directly treated by the pn a process or else serious inhibition would occur resulting in the deteriorated removal performance since the autotrophic aob and anammox bacteria have a relatively long cell doubling times and low biomass yields cao et al 2020 dilution of thp ad centrate is necessary to alleviate the inhibition effect when establishing a pn a process 3 2 overall nitrogen removal performance of pn a process during long term operation the pn a process was initiated with a low proportion of thp ad centrate mixed with conventional ad centrate step wise increase of the proportion of thp ad centrate was adopted to explore whether the aob and anammox bacteria could be acclimated in response to the inhibition the nitrogen removal performance of pn a process during the long term operation is displayed in fig 2 initially the sbr was fed with 100 conventional ad centrate after around 20 days operation with adjusting the aeration flowrate and aerobic duration an acceptable no2 n nh4 n ratio was obtained in the pn reactor effluent at 0 25 l min and 255 min the anammox uasb reactor was then started up with pn effluent as feed an ideal nitrogen removal was rapidly achieved in the anammox uasb reactor from day 63 the influent was prepared with 10 thp ad centrate and 90 conventional ad centrate the ammonium in pn effluent was found slightly increased resulting in excess ammonium in anammox reactor effluent fig 2c d this suggests aob activity may be affected by the introduction of thp ad centrate as revealed by the batch tests fig 1 in order to increase aob activity the aeration flowrate was increased slightly from 0 25 to 0 3 l min the do was still maintained at below 0 1 mg l fig 2a after this a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio was realized for the downstream anammox process when thp ad centrate proportion in the feed was further increased to 30 in phase 3 98 137 d and 60 in phase 4 138 195 d similar disturbance on the performance was observed therefore the aeration flowrate was gradually adjusted to 0 6 l min and 0 8 l min in phases 3 and 4 respectively fig 2a the effluent ammonium was found to be still excess the aerobic duration was then increased to 270 min on day 113 for producing appropriate no2 n nh4 n at the stable period the do in phases 3 and 4 were all maintained at around 0 2 mg l it should be noted that a relatively high effluent ammonium concentration appeared from day 157 this was probably caused by the accidental sludge washout from pn reactor during a lab lock down period in singapore on day 181 the lost sludge was added back to the pn reactor and the performance of pn reactor gradually recovered in phase 5 196 273 d with 100 thp ad centrate the aeration flowrate was raised to 1 0 l min the do in pn sbr was increased to 0 6 mg l nitrate was accumulated possibly due to the relatively high oxygen supply on day 225 the aeration flowrate was then reduced to 0 4 l min do was reduced to below 0 1 mg l with the aerobic duration improved to 360 min followed by free nitrous acid fna treatment on day 223 500 mg no2 n ph 5 5 12 h to rapidly suppress the nob growth and recover pn duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 an obvious decrease of nitrate was observed in the initial several days however it gradually accumulated again over 10 days suggesting the high aeration flowrate was not the major reason for nob growth a low ph around 6 5 was observed during this period which was likely resulted from the shortage of alkalinity nahco3 was then added in the raw thp ad centrate 2 g l from day 248 with the alkalinity to ammonium ratios g caco3 g nh4 n increased from 4 9 to 5 5 it was found that nitrite in pn effluent gradually increased with the decrease of nitrate on day 255 the aeration flowrate was improved to 0 6 l min to further improve nitrite to ammonium ratio and the nitrate concentration in pn effluent was reduced this clearly demonstrates insufficient inorganic carbon was the primary reason for the deteriorated performance of pn in phase 5 the variation of the nitrogen removal rate nrr during the long term operation is displayed in fig 2e the nrr was closely related to the pn performance 0 55 kg n m3 d was maintained during the stable period when thp ad centrate feed proportions were 10 60 a reduction to 0 35 kg n m3 d occurred in phase 5 with 100 thp ad centrate it was calculated that the contribution of the pn reactor for the total nitrogen removal was 10 9 on average fig 2f which mainly resulted from the denitrification using biodegradable organics in centrate with the increasing thp ad centrate in influent the organic matter loading rate improved in pn reactor however no obvious improvement of denitrification was observed in pn sbr this suggests that easily biodegradable organics presented in the thp ad centrate were limited the detailed analysis will be discussed in section 4 2 the majority of nitrogen was removed in the anammox uasb reactor accounting for 89 1 on average while its contribution was reduced in phase 5 due to the aggravated inhibition on anammox 3 3 performance of cod removal in pn a process fig 3 shows the evolution of organic compounds during the long term operation of the pn a process due to the high amount of organics present in thp ad centrate the cod in the effluent of pn and anammox gradually increased with the increased proportions of thp ad centratein the feed in phase 1 the effluent cod of pn was 175 9 mg l on average and it largely increased to 2386 4 mg l in phase 5 meanwhile the cod concentration varied from 192 0 to 2375 7 mg l in anammox reactor effluent the protein and polysaccharide were the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate and they also increased step wise in the effluent of both reactors fig 3a b the cod removal efficiency was 33 6 in phase 1 while it showed a decreasing trend with the increasing feed proportion of thp ad centrate this clearly demonstrates that the recalcitrant organics from thp ad centrate accumulated in the system moreover cod removal was mainly carried out in pn reactor the accumulation of organics was observed in the anammox reactor instead detailed reasons for this will be discussed in section 4 2 in order to better understand the organics evolution in the two stage pn a process eem and lc ocd analysis were conducted 3 3 1 fluorescent organic compounds there were three peaks identified in the conventional ad centrate fig 4 a they are related to fulvic acid like substances for peak a ex em of 230 398 nm humic acid like organics for peak b ex em of 330 412 nm and tyrosine tryptophan like and smp like species for peak c ex em of 280 368 nm chen et al 2019 only peaks a and b were detected in thp ad centrate fig 4g and their fluorescence intensities were much higher than those of conventional ad centrate indicating that highly recalcitrant organics were present in thp ad centrate the fluorescence intensities of these peaks were weakened in the pn reactor fig 4 suggesting part of fulvic acid like substances peak a and humic acid like organics peak b were removed and or transformed during the aerobic process however fulvic acid like substances was not further reduced in the subsequent anoxic anaerobic process some organics transformation occurred in the anammox reactor leading to the recalcitrant organic accumulation the removal of humic acid like organics in the anammox reactor was also very limited the quantitative reduction and accumulation values can be found in table s2 these results are in line with the cod changes fig 3 3 3 2 sub fractions of the organic compounds with different molecular weight mw as shown in fig 5 the building blocks that relate to the fraction of humic like substances were the primary organic compounds in the influent pn effluent and anammox effluent it accounted for more than 40 of total organic carbon followed by the lmw neutrals hmw pn and hmw ps the proportions of building blocks hmw pn and hmw ps were all higher in thp ad centrate fed phases compared to the conventional ad centrate as feed this further confirmed the presence of recalcitrant organics in thp ad centrate similarly the removal of the above organics mainly took place in the pn reactor and limited organic matter was reduced in anammox reactor fig 5a c to be specific in phase 1 without thp ad centrate almost all the sub fractions of the organic compounds were reduced in pn reactor the organics removed in the pn reactor were mainly attributed to the building blocks and lmw neutrals which decreased from 33 4 mg c l to 24 0 mg c l and 25 3 mg c l to 13 0 mg c l respectively the lmw organics were further reduced in anammox reactor while the building blocks and hmw pn were found to increase which was likely responsible for the increase of effluent cod for the system fed with thp ad centrate the removal of organics was also mainly performed in the pn reactor the major compounds removed were building blocks and lmw neutrals as well 3 4 microbial community dynamics in response to thp ad centrate in the pn reactor there were nine major bacterial phyla fig 6 a of which bacteroidota proteobacteria and chloroflexi werepredominant proteobacteria that contains nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying microorganisms are widely distributed in wastewater biological nutrient removal system ji et al 2020 du et al 2019a yang et al 2020 the proportion slightly decreased with increasing thp ad centrate feeding proportion varying from 33 9 to 29 8 bacteroidota and chloroflexi may be responsible for degradation of hmw organic compounds fernandez gomez et al 2013 kindaichi et al 2012 the relative abundance of chloroflexi reduced from 17 7 to 4 9 with the increase of thp ad centrate feeding proportion this is in line with the cod removal efficiency which declined at the higher feeding proportion of thp ad centrate bacteroidota initially increased to 39 8 when the feeding proportion of thp ad centrate was 30 but reduced to 31 2 in phase 5 the taxonomic classification at genus level reports nitrosomonas was the major aob that were responsible for the nitrite production in the pn reactor its relative abundance decreased from 14 6 to 5 3 with the increased feeding proportion of thp ad centrate since an anoxic phase was included before the aerobic phase in the pn sbr denitrifying microorganisms were also detected they showed increasing trend at the higher thp ad centrate feeding proportion for example thauera a widely reported denitrifying species in biological nitrogen removal systems liu et al 2013 increased from 4 8 to 13 6 10 to 60 thp ad centrate feeding proportion this was probably due to the improved organic loading rate which facilitated the growth of denitrifying microorganisms in the anammox reactor chloroflexi bacteroidota and proteobacteria were again dominant chloroflexi was the most predominant phyla and its relative abundance showed a decreasing trend with the increased thp ad centrate feeding proportion reduced from 35 5 to 22 9 in comparison bacteroidota displayed an opposite tendency improved from 15 3 to 22 5 proteobacteria also increased from 15 3 to 25 5 and stabilized from thp ad centrate feeding proportion of 30 onwards however planctomycetota containing the anammox bacteria van teeseling et al 2015 reduced from 14 1 to 5 9 with the increased thp ad centrate feeding proportion at genus level candidatus brocadia was the major anammox bacteria which accounted for 7 9 at 10 thp ad centrate feeding proportion however its relative abundance gradually declined to 3 2 in phase 5 due to the abundant organics in pn effluent the denitrifying bacteria was also detected in anammox reactor denitratisoma that belongs to phylum proteobacteria was predominant it increased substantially from 3 9 to 7 8 when thp ad centrate feeding proportion increased to 30 and its relative abundance maintained at 7 0 7 9 during the following phases this was not observed in previous studies cao et al 2020 which concluded that the more the organics in the feed the higher the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganism in the anammox reactor in this study the organics fed to anammox reactor were mostly recalcitrant which were difficult to be utilized by the denitrifying bacteria thus limiting its growth it is noteworthy that nitrosomonas was also identified in anammox reactor which was likely carried over from the pn effluent that contained solids the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was 1 6 in phase 5 4 discussion 4 1 system performance in response to increased thp ad centrate this study clearly demonstrated that the thp ad centrate would cause serious inhibition on aob and anammox activity and the inhibitory effects aggravated with the improving thp ad centrate proportions it is believed that the soluble inert organics in the thp ad centrate are the major inhibitory compounds figdore et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the humic like and fulvic acid like substances as well as hmw biopolymers i e hmw protein are known as recalcitrant organics and accounted for a high proportion in thp ad centrate which are likely the major inhibitors during thp the recalcitrant maillard reaction products including lmws such as aldehydes acrylamides dicarbonyls ketones and polymeric compounds with hmws such as advanced glycation end products could be largely produced these compounds were reported to have averse biological effects figdore et al 2012 in our previous study the organics like pyrrolidines benzenoids pyridines and their derivatives were identified in the thp ad centrate they were also reported to be inhibitory to bacteria growth with the increase of the thp ad centrate proportion the amount of inhibitors increased thus the inhibitory effects were aggravated nevertheless the decrease of their activities were reduce with the operation fig s2 clearly suggesting the long term acclimation to step wise increased loading would mitigate such inhibition an ideal nitrogen removal performance was maintained when thp ad centrate feeding proportion was below 60 a mean nrr of 0 55 kg n m3 d was obtained in phase 4 with 60 thp ad centrate which was close to the previously reported nrr in pn a process for conventional ad centrate treatment however when 100 thp ad centrate was applied the average nrr reduced to 0 37 kg n m3 d in the later period of phase 5 in the two stage pn a process stable pn is of supreme importance for the following anammox process a highly efficient nitrogen removal would be achieved when pn is controlled with a suitable no2 n nh4 n ratio and limited nitrate production in this study aob activity was gradually inhibited with the increasing thp ad centrate feeding proportion leading to the reduction of the relative abundance of aob to optimize the performance the aeration flowrate was adjusted to enhance the oxygen transfer in addition to the soluble organics the thp ad centrate also contained a high amount of particulate and colloidal organics as well as polymer coagulants used for thickening these would all affect the oxygen transfer to biomass increasing the aeration flowrate was thus necessary to relieve the obstacle with higher organic loading meanwhile the improvement of the aeration flowrate would not cause intensive nitrate production suggesting the activity of nob was not enhanced by the increased oxygen supply this was also confirmed by the result of the high throughput sequencing analysis that nob was not detected during the whole operation period apart from the relatively high free ammonia and free nitrous acid in the pn reactor that suppressed the nob activity the increased inhibition effect from thp ad centrate may also have negative impact on nob in phase 5 nitrate was gradually accumulated due to the deficit of alkalinity it is known that a high alkalinity to ammonium ratio g caco3 g nh4 n would favor nitrite accumulation yun et al 2020 hou et al 2014 the mean alkalinity to ammonium ratio in conventional ad centrate was 6 2 while it was 4 9 in thp ad centrate the ratio was reduced with the increase of thp ad centrate feeding proportion furthermore the loss of alkalinity is a common phenomenon during the aeration a greater loss would occur when higher aeration flowrate is applied the pn performance recovered after alkalinity being supplemented in the influent it should be pointed out that a relatively high nitrate concentration remained in pn effluent in the later stage of phase 5 the accumulated nitrate from previous deteriorated pn was difficult to reduce by pre denitrification due to the limited biodegradable organics in thp ad centrate in addition it was found that the settleability of pn sludge was deteriorated when feeding 100 thp ad centrate no obvious biomass washout was observed in the initial operation during phase 1 3 while the effluent svi30 30 min sludge volume index and solid content in phase 5 100 thp ad centrate were as high as 209 4 ml g mlss and 1320 1 mg mlss l respectively fig s3 this issue was probably caused by excessive polymer and solid particulate and colloidal organics fed into pn reactor it has been reported that the sludge settleability would be worsened with the addition of polymeric substrate starch and synthetic polymer martins et al 2011 juang 2005 in this study to prepare thp ad centrate the polymer polyacrylamide dose of 10 g kg ts was applied to improve the dewaterability of the sludge though a good solid liquid separation was obtained the solids content in the thp ad centrate was still as high as 1 8 g ts l the residual polymer and solids in the thp ad centrate probably deteriorated the sludge settleability in pn reactor in addition a serious foaming was observed in pn reactor with 100 thp ad centrate which was attributed to the high concentration of polymer present in influent in order to maintain the pn performance and avoid the high solid content introduced to anammox reactor the washout biomass was collected and fed into sbr again every day the anammox reactor seemed to be less affected by the inhibition and disturbance in the long term operation the nrr was reduced by 32 7 with 100 thp ad centrate one possible reason was that the inhibitor in thp ad centrate was partially removed in the pn reactor and the anammox can be acclimated in response to the attenuated inhibition secondly the anammox bacteria were embedded in aggregates which have a higher resilience than the floc sludge sheng et al 2010 adav et al 2008 the detailed mechanism needs to be further explored in order to better understand the acclimation process 4 2 organics degradation and effluent cod in pn a process in the two stage pn a process the ad centrate experienced an anoxic oxic period in pn reactor and an anoxic anaerobic period in the subsequent anammox reactor the organics in the centrate were expected to be degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms the result reports the refractory fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like organics as well as all the sub fractions of the organic compounds were reduced in pn reactor nevertheless these organics were stable in the anammox reactor it is likely that the remaining organics discharged from pn reactor were more recalcitrant since they had been subjected to degradation under anoxic and aerobic conditions in pn reactor those organics cannot further stimulate the growth of denitrifying bacteria any more as evidenced by the low contribution of denitrification on nitrogen removal and the relatively stable denitrification population despite the higher organics loading rates in the anammox reactor on the other hand the relatively low cod removal may be also attributed to the release of organics that were derived from the soluble microbial products smp and particulate colloidal organics transformation as clearly indicated in phase 1 fig 3 the cod in anammox reactor effluent was even higher than that in pn effluent leading to a negative cod removal efficiency the smp that released from cell decay mainly are the organic compounds with the molecular weights mws in the range from 0 5 to 50 kda ni et al 2011 these organics are generally remaining in the effluent of biological treatment system due to their refractory nature xie et al 2016 soh et al 2020 in anammox reactor an extreme long sludge retention time srt is usually adopted to facilitate the growth of anammox bacteria due to its long double time and low biomass yield cao et al 2020 the production of smp is thus common ni et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a in a study conducted by zhang et al 2016a the smp in the range of 10 5 100 mg c l was detected in a reactor fed with synthetic organics free wastewater besides it was also reported that smp production would be increased when the microorganisms suffered from adverse environmental conditions wang and zhang 2010 in this study the inhibition effect of organics on anammox bacteria was revealed so an increasing amount of smp was expected moreover the thp ad centrate generally contains large amounts of particulate and colloidal organic compounds these organics would be trapped and accumulated in the anammox uasb reactor due to the fact that the sludge was not discharged during the operation the organic transformation from the particulate and colloidal form to the soluble form would occur under the anoxic anaerobic conditions with extreme long srt with the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate more particulate and colloidal organics were fed into uasb reactor so that higher soluble organics would be produced the easily biodegradable organics may be utilized by denitrification bacteria with the refractory compounds accumulated in effluent such as fulvic acid like substances and hmw ps figs 4 and 5 4 3 practical implications currently an increasing number of thp facilities are in operation or construction world widely barber 2016 leading to the generation of a large quantity of thp ad centrate characterized by high ammonium and organics content this study demonstrated that thp ad centrate can be treated by the cost effective pn a process while a step wise acclimation by gradual introduction of thp ad centrate is recommended for stable operation according to the results in this study the maximum thp ad feeding proportion is suggested not to exceed 60 it should be pointed out that the optimal feeding proportion of thp ad centrate needs to be explored for each individual plant due to the different characteristics of thp ad centrate i e soluble particulate and colloidal organics and coagulation polymer dosage as well as ammonium concentration furthermore the alkalinity concentration in the influent and pn reactor should be carefully monitored this is mainly dependent on the characteristic of thp ad centrate and aeration rate and a pre evaluation is necessary when the system influent is changed in the pn a process the residual nitrate in the final effluent is inevitable du et al 2019b in this study although the nob was suppressed in pn reactor nitrate still appeared in the final effluent due to the production by the anammox process the organics present in thp ad centrate may reduce nitrate via denitrification however such contribution is limited due to their recalcitrant nature the average effluent nitrate was still as high as 33 1 mg n l in phase 4 with 60 thp ad centrate which requires further treatment the effluent can be transferred back to the mainstream process alternatively a small portion of municipal wastewater can be diverted to the pn a process to increase easily degradable organics to enhance denitrification during the anoxic phase in pn reactor or in anammox reactor the mixing ratio between these two wastewater streams needs to be carefully explored to avoid the overgrowth of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria it is noteworthy that large quantity of recalcitrant organics was still present in the treated effluent the exploration of the link between these organics and the inhibition effects is an interesting research further studies can focus on this point to bring a better understanding of the inhibitory effects thus provide a guide for system operation with stable and efficient removal performance the coagulation and advanced oxidation process can be employed as post treatment to further reduce these recalcitrant organics these processes have been widely applied in industrial wastewater for advanced treatment e g landfill leachate chen et al 2019 coking wastewater wang et al 2019 on the other hand the above mentioned physicochemical process can also be employed as a pre treatment step to improve the biodegradability of the organics in the influent thus the potential organic inhibitors are expected to be reduced or removed and the suppression of thp ad centrate on aob and anammox bacteria shall be relieved future studies are suggested to focus on this post pre treatment and evaluate its effectiveness efficiency and economy 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn in this study 1 the inhibition of thp ad centrare on aob and anammox bacteria can be overcome in a two stage pn a process by gradual acclimation 100 thp ad centrate may deteriorate the pn a performance due to the sludge washout in pn reactor 1320 mg ss l caused by excessive polymer and solids as well as the shortage of alkalinity 2 the humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances as well as the building blocks were the major organic compounds in thp ad centrate cod removal 33 6 10 8 decreased with increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate mainly occurred in pn reactor and it was very limited in anammox reactor 3 nitrosomonas and candidatus brocadia were identified as the major aob and anammox bacteria in the two stage pn a system their relative abundance decreased with the increasing feeding proportions of thp ad centrate denitratisoma was detected as the major denitrifying bacteria in anammox reactor its relative abundance was not affected by thp ad centrate proportions suggesting the inhibition of anammox bacteria was not due to the overgrowth of denitrifying microorganism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
