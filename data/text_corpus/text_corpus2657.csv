13285,this study applied waste steelmaking slags including basic oxygen furnace slag and electric arc furnace slag in a multi soil layering system for phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater in the multi soil layering system the slags were replaced in the soil mixture block layers in brick like patterns or the permeable layers for water feed containing approximately 20 mg l of total phosphorus and 12 mg l of ammonia nitrogen the best phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen removal efficiencies of 93 and 84 respectively were achieved within 5 h of reaction mixing 25 basic oxygen furnace slag in the system provided a 85 phosphorus removal efficiency especially in the soil mixture block layers the phosphorus precipitation activated by released iron ions was the dominant mechanism rather than phosphorus adsorption onto zeolite soil an iron content of approximately 10 in the soil mixture block layers and permeable layers contributed to phosphorus removal efficiencies of 43 and 86 respectively zeolite in the permeable layers was more helpful than gravel for reducing pollutants this study shows that using steel slags is suggested with the inherent characteristics of the media in the soil based low impact systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calcium domestic iron filters wastewater 1 introduction reclaiming waste materials from industries and transforming them into useful materials is becoming increasingly attractive in a resource limited world four hundred kg steel slag t is produced in iron and steel plants 1 and steel slag is a waste byproduct from steel production that is classified into basic oxygen furnace bof slag electric arc furnace eaf slag blast furnace slag and others approximately 15 7 mt of steel slag are produced in europe annually of which 11 5 million t are recycled 2 steel slag is mainly utilized in internal recycling 7 5 20 8 road construction 2 6 49 7 and cement production 3 4 9 3 in japan europe the u s a and china 3 the first application of recycled steel slag was as phosphate po4 fertilizer in china in the 1960s 4 in addition steel slag has been proven to remove metals and phosphorus p from wastewater in 2018 a filter was designed by claveau mallet 2018 for the decentralized removal of p from contaminated wastewater with a single material of steel slag 5 filters fabricated with steel slag were also successfully removed 52 to 71 of p from textile industrial effluent 6 the longevity of steel slag filter system was estimated to be over 14 y when avoiding excess sodium bicarbonate nahco3 5 phosphorus removal by steel slag depends on both the ph and calcium ca concentration in water 7 iron is derived from the raw minerals used to produce steel whereas ca is derived from the use of fluxing agents mainly lime during the steelmaking process 8 the adsorption mechanism occurs in neutral to slightly acidic water ph 5 7 however the precipitation mechanism occurs when a high ca concentration is present in the steel slag in highly alkaline water ph 9 12 6 higher ph values were sufficiently to provide favorable conditions for precipitation to occur vu et al 2021 identified the key p removal mechanism was adsorption at the early stage whereas chemical precipitation occurs when the release of ca into the water is sufficient to form cap precipitates 7 the release of ca can be inferred from the increase in the water ph the high surface area of steel slag also makes it an effective adsorbent for the removal of divalent cationic metals such as cd cu pb ni and zn a significant improvement in p removal was obtained by high powered ball ground steel slag with a higher specific surface area and activation 9 the high p binding affinities are due to the presence of high metal oxide concentrations in steel slag 10 a potential market for steel slag to treat polluted water was expected to be popular 11 this study reports the first use of bof and eaf steel slags in a low impact development lid system with multiple natural materials and aims to demonstrate its feasibility and media optimization decentralized wastewater treatment systems such as lid systems have small scale hydrologic controls that promote the infiltration filtration storage and retention of runoff close to the source 12 the multi soil layering msl system is an emerging lid technology used in sewage and wastewater treatment with natural materials the presence of iron fe in the msl system plays a key role in p removal via precipitation 13 chen et al 2009 found that 19 kg of p was removed from the msl system per 11 kg of fe consumption for 10 years y of msl system operation in matsue city japan 14 the effective lifespan of the msl system was conservatively estimated as approximately 20 y for wastewater treatment 14 the msl system has been used since 1993 in japan and they have also been applied in thailand the u s a china and taiwan the five msl designed to treat 10 to 300 m3 d wastewater were constructed nearby eutrophic reservoirs in taiwan the two of them were constructed on the offshore islands with limited water resources and treatment facilities specially the biggest msl system in the world with 300 m3 d capacities will be operated at the end of 2021 since p is the main growth limiting nutrient for algal blooms this study novelty discovered that natural composition of the lid system was helpful for improving the steel slag s ability to remove pollutants from wastewater the results were feasible to modify the in situ msl systems since the use of steel slags in public constructions is encouraged by taiwanese government 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and materials the schematic diagram of the msl system is shown in fig 1 a the laboratory scale msl system was made of acrylic plastic with dimensions of 31 0 l 22 5 w 20 0 h cm an inlet distribution pipe 6 4 mm inner diameter with a spray nozzle was installed on top of each msl system and a hole at the bottom of the msl system was created for an outlet pipe 6 4 mm inner diameter the system had a water tank almost equal to the volume of the system and a pump hf 9050 headon co ltd with a flow rate of 100 ml min the hydraulic load of the msl system was ca 2000 l m2 d suggested by previous studies 15 different from our published studies 16 discontinuous flow controlled by valves was applied to fit the in situ condition of the msl systems in taiwan the msl system included both smb layers and pls fig 1 b shows the side of view of the msl system the smb layers were surrounded by the pls in brick like pattern the smbs were packed in brick like dimensions of 10 l 10 w 5 h cm arrangements the materials were packed with fe particles sawdust charcoal and silica sand with a ratio of 2 1 2 15 dry weight according to previous msl studies 17 the pls were filled with 2 5 mm homogeneous zeolites nitto funka kogyo k k japan or gravel with a diameter of 3 5 mm the infiltration rates were 6 52 10 3 m s and 7 03 10 3 m s in the smbs and pls respectively found in our published study 16 the bof and eaf slags were obtained from private company which is the biggest company devoted to heightening by products from ironmaking and steelmaking processes calcium was also obtained from oyster shells acquired from restaurant food waste sawdust charcoal and oyster shells were shattered into small pieces within a diameter of 5 mm before application measurement of particle diameter and porosity of the materials can be referred to our published studies 16 as shown in table 1 the slag replaced the fe particles in the smbs or acted as a source of ca in the pls in nine different systems labeled a to i these materials were prepared in units of 5 by weight 2 2 water quality analysis analysis conducted were the ph and dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total p tp concentrations in the water tank the do 2 mg l and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 25 mg l were below the regulatory requirements and are not specifically discussed in this study water feed was acquired from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant and contained approximately 20 mg l of tp 12 mg l of nh3 n and 140 mg l of cod with a ph of 6 35 water feed was collected from the effluent water at 0 1 2 3 5 8 and 24 h using sterile bottles with a volume of 50 ml the ph was measured by meters pro 2030 ysi inc u s a certified by the taiwan epa niea w424 53a and niea w455 52c the nh3 n concentration was determined by a hach sension 3 m u s a the nh3 n concentration was obtained after the water feed was mixed with mineral stabilizer and nessler s reagent niea w448 51b the tp concentration was determined as po4 p after potassium peroxodisulfate digestion niea w427 53b 18 and analysis by a smart 3 colorimeter lamotte all chemicals used in the test were of pure analytical grade this study used the same reactor to conduct three experiments with the same condition the data presented are averaged values with standard deviation and the relative errors between repetitions were less than 5 2 3 material characterization the materials were powdered by hand grinding using a mortar and pestle before characterization the percentages of fe and ca remaining in the materials were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf using a portable xrf analyzer x met5100 oxford instruments the samples approaching 1 μm grain sizes were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd empyrean panalytical using cu kα radiation operated at 45 kv and 40 ma over an arc of 10 2θ 80 the powdered materials were further mounted on a stub of metal with adhesive coated with 40 60 nm of gold and then observed in a scanning electron microscope sem regulus8100 hitachi japan the specific surface area and particle size distribution of the steel slag were analyzed using a brunauer emmett teller bet instrument gemini v micromeritics and lb550 horiba japan respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 tp removal from water fig 2 shows that the p removal from different msl systems reached a steady state within 5 h although we conducted 24 h reactions also the residence time of the in situ msl systems in taiwan is less than 5 h the flow through sorption experiments suggested 10 min retention time is sufficient to produce satisfactory 0 2 mg l p removal by steel slags 19 our previous research demonstrated that removal of pollutants was occurred in the beginning of the reaction and no clogging occurred during 500 h reactions 16 zeolites in the pls prevent clogging in a 10 year of msl system operation in matsue city japan 14 increasing the residence time increased p removal by steel slags 20 but not needed in the msl system of this study replacement of zeolite by 25 bof slags system c provided a 93 p removal efficiency which was better than that obtained by 10 bof slags 59 removal efficiency system d in the pls fig 2 a the 93 p removal efficiency of system c was greater than that of the original msl system which had a p removal efficiency of greater than 80 in our previous study 16 according to the xrf results the bof slag had 43 1 fe and 42 9 ca contents table 2 therefore it was speculated that the inclusion of approximately 10 ca in the pls i e system a was helpful for p removal however system a 10 ca and system b 25 ca had p removal efficiencies of 43 and 71 respectively therefore in addition to fe from the bof slag in the pls also enabled p removal the oyster shells had a 92 5 ca content as shown in table 2 due to the exitance of soluble ca the ph value of the effluent water was increased to 12 8 with an 15 increase in bof in the pls fig s2 using oyster shells in the msl systems did not affect the ph value of the effluent water piatak et al 2019 observed a positive linear correlation between the ca content and p removal capacity of steel slag 21 ho and wang 2015 found no significant difference in tp removal between msl systems using activated carbon zeolite clay and oyster shells in pls owing to the over replacement of zeolite in the pls 15 the comparison of system c and system e showed that zeolite had a better p removal efficiency than gravel 90 in the pls however the p adsorption capacity of zeolite was lower than its nh3 n adsorption capacity 22 literatures found that zeolite is an excellent adsorbent for p removal from wastewater 13 irons and zeolite are expensive materials comparing to other natural materials in the msl system the smbs were filled with steel slag to replace the original 10 fe content whereas the pls were filled with gravel to replace zeolite in this study as shown in table 2 the bof and eaf slags had an fe content of 17 1 43 1 and a ca content of 41 3 42 9 analyzed by the xrf instrument several studies confirmed that a ca content of 36 9 is typical of bof slag 23 25 in system f and system g the 10 fe weight content in the smbs was replaced by silica sand with bof slag in the pls or bof slag respectively both systems had excellent p removal efficiencies of 86 and 90 respectively fig 2 b at least 4 3 ca content in the bof slag in the anaerobic smbs helped to increase the p removal efficiency by 5 an fe content of approximately 10 in the smbs and the pls contributed to p removal efficiencies of 43 and 86 in system a and system f respectively the steel slags filling the smbs had 5 greater p removal efficiencies than those in the pls also the ph value of the effluent water was kept neutral when steel slags were embedded in the smbs fig s2 however the ph values ph 12 was increased in the system e and f when embedding bof in the pls fig s2 overall mixing 25 bof slag in the msl system obtained a p removal efficiency of 85 however the use of eaf slag yielded a lower p removal efficiency 26 49 in systems h and i an eaf column scale filter established by weber et al 2007 and drizo et al 2008 achieved an average dissolved reactive p reduction of 70 over a 400 d period 26 27 the p removal may be achieved by eaf with longer reacting time a 10 ca content in the pls and 4 10 fe content in the smbs were suggested for p removal in the msl system suggested in this study 3 2 nh3 n removal from water the msl systems in this study had nh3 n removal efficiencies ranging from 7 to 84 as shown in fig 3 mixing 10 to 25 oyster shells in pls provided nh3 n removal efficiencies of 23 56 fig 3 a the highest nh3 n removal efficiency was 84 in system c ph 12 in which the embedded 25 bof slag in the pls contributed contents of 10 8 fe and 10 7 ca in the pls the nh3 n removal efficiency was reduced to 19 when the bof slag in the pls was reduced to 10 in system d however the ph value of the effluent water was neutral in the system d compared to system c with alkaline water fig s2 zeolite has been shown to have a high cec for nh3 n removal in pls 28 the cec mechanism enables the nitrification of nh3 n to ferric nitrate fe no3 3 and calcium nitrate ca no3 2 when fe and ca are present in aqueous solutions but this has rarely been discussed in the literature therefore both fe and ca had important contribution to improve nh3 n in the msl system the present finding that zeolite in the pls was more helpful than gravel for reducing nh3 n and p pollutants when comparing system c and system e fig 3 b the soil and zeolite in the msl system presumably contributed to the adsorption of nh4 n 29 30 calcium in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal at a content of 10 0 but this contribution decreased at a content of 23 1 system b the fe content in the smbs positively contributed to nh3 n removal when comparing system e and system f fig 3 when all of the fe and ca was embedded in the smbs system g or pls system f the nh3 n removal efficiencies were only 3 and 19 respectively fig 3 b the fe and ca contents in the anaerobic smbs enabled a maximum nh3 n removal efficiency of 44 in systems i with neutral ph environment nh3 n removal mainly occurred via nitrification in the aerobic pls the co existence of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the msl system induced the nitrification denitrification process 31 the higher porosities of the zeolite and gravel 60 pls provided an aerobic environment compared to the smbs table 1 therefore the ca in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal when the fe content in the pls did not exceed 5 comparing system f and system h the limited amount of bof eaf was helpful for keeping ph between 6 5 and 7 0 which is suitable to maintain the efficiency of the msl system in treating wastewater 14 the best nh3 n removal performance of 84 occurred when 25 bof slag was present in the pls in system c the removal efficiency was higher than those of previous studies which ranged from 58 3 to 73 7 17 3 3 characteristics of the materials fig 4 shows the xrd diffractograms of the oyster shells bof slag and eaf slag the oyster shells contained ca c and o fig 4 a whereas ca fe si al and o were abundant on the surface of the steel slag fig 4 b and c the ca contents of the bof and eaf slags were 42 9 and 41 3 before reactions they were reduced to 33 08 and 12 43 after reactions table s1 as shown in fig 4 c the peak at 68o angle represents ca oxides was significantly reduced after reaction the needle like crystals were speculated as the morphology of hydroxyapatite hap 7 the hap is a type of p minerals that potentially form on or around the slag 32 the coarse surface of the crystals was clearly shown on the surfaces of the bof slag fig 5 d and the eaf slag fig 5 f slag is more angular and has a coarse surface structure which increases the bet surface area therefore the surface areas of the bof slag and eaf slag were increased to 10 21 m2 g 10 increase and 47 91 m2 g 30 increase after the reactions respectively fig s1 materials with a greater specific surface area available for calcium oxide dissolution show improved p removal performance 33 3 4 reaction mechanisms of steel slag in the msl system fig 6 shows the reaction mechanisms of steel slag in the msl system speculated from the results of this study with the higher porosity of the pls the retardation capacity of the smbs was stronger and the permeability of the pls was higher latrach et al 2018 demonstrated the priority water movement in the pls of the msl system using a tracer test 31 steel slag primarily consists of sio2 cao and ferric oxide fe2o3 which was consistent with our xrd results shown in fig 4 the ferrous ions fe2 were transported from inside the smbs to the aerobic pls in the form of ferric ions fe3 29 fe3 chemically precipitated with p as ferric phosphate fepo4 whereas other ions were converted into fe hydroxides which facilitates adsorb p onto zeolite or soil 30 this study found that the transformation of fe2 to fe3 was faster when bof slag was embedded in the pls system f than in the smbs system g thereby leading to 4 greater p removal efficiencies the p precipitation activated by released fe2 was the dominant mechanism rather than p adsorption onto zeolite soil however a maximum fe content of 5 in the pls is recommended according to our aforementioned results calcium is rapidly released from steel slag into the aqueous phase in the form of small particles with a high surface area 7 when steel slag is in contact with water reactive ca species such as free cao calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and wollastonite casio3 release ca2 thereby producing basicity via eqs 1 3 34 35 1 cao s h 2 o l ca oh 2 s 2 ca oh 2 s ca aq 2 2 oh aq 3 casio 3 s 2 h aq ca aq 2 sio 2 s h 2 o l in the smbs the presence of p in the msl system inhibited the increase in the ca2 concentration shown in systems a vs b in the pls and systems g vs i both comparisons showed that p and ca2 formed cap precipitates via eq 4 4 5 ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 drizo et al 2006 suggested that p precipitation with ca oxides is the principal p removal mechanism in a basic environment 27 the ph of the systems with bof slag was increased from neutrality to basic within the first hour of the reaction whereas the ph of the system with eaf slag increased to 8 fig s2 amount of ca2 would increase the attachment of bacteria to smbs and promote the adsorption of bacteria onto porous materials 31 overall the water ph of the reactive slags is divided into neutral fe adsorption based removal and alkaline ca precipitation based mechanisms with different reacting mechanisms the aerobic environment and higher cec of the pls enabled the transformation and physicochemical removal of nh3 n in contrast the transformation of nh3 n is known to be restrained under anaerobic conditions i e in smbs 36 37 the transformation process via nitrification was mainly dependent on nitrifying bacteria such as nitrospirales sphingobacteriia rhizobiales and rhodospirillales 38 complete nitrification transforms nh3 n into nitrate as shown in eq 5 5 5 nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 2 h h 2 o zeolite and gravel form the microscale environment for growing bacteria and these bacteria affect the water treatment performance 17 comparing systems c and f the embedded bof slag in the smbs or the pls did not assist nh3 n removal therefore nh3 n removal was dominated by adsorption onto zeolite the fe content in the smbs and pls was also not helpful for nh3 n removal indeed the effective removal of nh3 n using steel slag has not been demonstrated there or in any previous study 4 conclusions this study applied bof and eaf slags in the msl system consisted of smb layers and pls the steel slag used in this study primarily consisted of 41 3 42 9 ca and 17 1 43 1 fe as measured by xrf the slags were replaced in the smbs or in the pls to create nine different systems a to i for domestic wastewater containing approximately 20 mg l of tp and 12 mg l of nh3 n the best p and nh3 n removal efficiencies of 93 and 84 respectively were achieved within 5 h of reaction which is quicker than achieved in previous studies embedding 10 and 25 oyster shells in the pls obtained p removal efficiencies of 43 and 71 respectively the systems with bof slag in the pls system f and the smbs system g had excellent p removal efficiencies of 86 and 90 respectively it was speculated that in addition to precipitating with ca the p pollutants precipitated with fe from the bof slag in the pls compared with the bof slag the eaf slag had a lower p removal efficiency 26 49 in systems h and i the highest nh3 n removal efficiency was 84 in system c which embedded 25 0 bof slag in the pls and contributed contents of 10 fe and 10 ca in the msl system calcium in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal at a content of approximately 10 a maximum fe content of 5 in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal when comparing system f and system h zeolite had better p and nh3 n removal efficiencies than gravel in the pls the ca content was significantly reduced after dissolution from slag the surface areas of bof slag and eaf slag had an 10 30 increase after the adsorption reactions respectively this study found that the transformation of fe to fe2 was faster when bof slag was embedded in the pls system g than in the smbs system f thereby leading to a 4 greater p removal efficiency comparing systems c and f bof slag embedded in the smbs or pls did not assist nh3 n removal therefore nh3 n removal was dominated by adsorption onto zeolite measurement of the real time do ph and cec capacities is suggested to provide evidence of the reacting mechanisms of the msl system future works may therefore

table 2 therefore it was speculated that the inclusion of approximately 10 ca in the pls i e system a was helpful for p removal however system a 10 ca and system b 25 ca had p removal efficiencies of 43 and 71 respectively therefore in addition to fe from the bof slag in the pls also enabled p removal the oyster shells had a 92 5 ca content as shown in table 2 due to the exitance of soluble ca the ph value of the effluent water was increased to 12 8 with an 15 increase in bof in the pls fig s2 using oyster shells in the msl systems did not affect the ph value of the effluent water piatak et al 2019 observed a positive linear correlation between the ca content and p removal capacity of steel slag 21 ho and wang 2015 found no significant difference in tp removal between msl systems using activated carbon zeolite clay and oyster shells in pls owing to the over replacement of zeolite in the pls 15 the comparison of system c and system e showed that zeolite had a better p removal efficiency than gravel 90 in the pls however the p adsorption capacity of zeolite was lower than its nh3 n adsorption capacity 22 literatures found that zeolite is an excellent adsorbent for p removal from wastewater 13 irons and zeolite are expensive materials comparing to other natural materials in the msl system the smbs were filled with steel slag to replace the original 10 fe content whereas the pls were filled with gravel to replace zeolite in this study as shown in table 2 the bof and eaf slags had an fe content of 17 1 43 1 and a ca content of 41 3 42 9 analyzed by the xrf instrument several studies confirmed that a ca content of 36 9 is typical of bof slag 23 25 in system f and system g the 10 fe weight content in the smbs was replaced by silica sand with bof slag in the pls or bof slag respectively both systems had excellent p removal efficiencies of 86 and 90 respectively fig 2 b at least 4 3 ca content in the bof slag in the anaerobic smbs helped to increase the p removal efficiency by 5 an fe content of approximately 10 in the smbs and the pls contributed to p removal efficiencies of 43 and 86 in system a and system f respectively the steel slags filling the smbs had 5 greater p removal efficiencies than those in the pls also the ph value of the effluent water was kept neutral when steel slags were embedded in the smbs fig s2 however the ph values ph 12 was increased in the system e and f when embedding bof in the pls fig s2 overall mixing 25 bof slag in the msl system obtained a p removal efficiency of 85 however the use of eaf slag yielded a lower p removal efficiency 26 49 in systems h and i an eaf column scale filter established by weber et al 2007 and drizo et al 2008 achieved an average dissolved reactive p reduction of 70 over a 400 d period 26 27 the p removal may be achieved by eaf with longer reacting time a 10 ca content in the pls and 4 10 fe content in the smbs were suggested for p removal in the msl system suggested in this study 3 2 nh3 n removal from water the msl systems in this study had nh3 n removal efficiencies ranging from 7 to 84 as shown in fig 3 mixing 10 to 25 oyster shells in pls provided nh3 n removal efficiencies of 23 56 fig 3 a the highest nh3 n removal efficiency was 84 in system c ph 12 in which the embedded 25 bof slag in the pls contributed contents of 10 8 fe and 10 7 ca in the pls the nh3 n removal efficiency was reduced to 19 when the bof slag in the pls was reduced to 10 in system d however the ph value of the effluent water was neutral in the system d compared to system c with alkaline water fig s2 zeolite has been shown to have a high cec for nh3 n removal in pls 28 the cec mechanism enables the nitrification of nh3 n to ferric nitrate fe no3 3 and calcium nitrate ca no3 2 when fe and ca are present in aqueous solutions but this has rarely been discussed in the literature therefore both fe and ca had important contribution to improve nh3 n in the msl system the present finding that zeolite in the pls was more helpful than gravel for reducing nh3 n and p pollutants when comparing system c and system e fig 3 b the soil and zeolite in the msl system presumably contributed to the adsorption of nh4 n 29 30 calcium in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal at a content of 10 0 but this contribution decreased at a content of 23 1 system b the fe content in the smbs positively contributed to nh3 n removal when comparing system e and system f fig 3 when all of the fe and ca was embedded in the smbs system g or pls system f the nh3 n removal efficiencies were only 3 and 19 respectively fig 3 b the fe and ca contents in the anaerobic smbs enabled a maximum nh3 n removal efficiency of 44 in systems i with neutral ph environment nh3 n removal mainly occurred via nitrification in the aerobic pls the co existence of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the msl system induced the nitrification denitrification process 31 the higher porosities of the zeolite and gravel 60 pls provided an aerobic environment compared to the smbs table 1 therefore the ca in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal when the fe content in the pls did not exceed 5 comparing system f and system h the limited amount of bof eaf was helpful for keeping ph between 6 5 and 7 0 which is suitable to maintain the efficiency of the msl system in treating wastewater 14 the best nh3 n removal performance of 84 occurred when 25 bof slag was present in the pls in system c the removal efficiency was higher than those of previous studies which ranged from 58 3 to 73 7 17 3 3 characteristics of the materials fig 4 shows the xrd diffractograms of the oyster shells bof slag and eaf slag the oyster shells contained ca c and o fig 4 a whereas ca fe si al and o were abundant on the surface of the steel slag fig 4 b and c the ca contents of the bof and eaf slags were 42 9 and 41 3 before reactions they were reduced to 33 08 and 12 43 after reactions table s1 as shown in fig 4 c the peak at 68o angle represents ca oxides was significantly reduced after reaction the needle like crystals were speculated as the morphology of hydroxyapatite hap 7 the hap is a type of p minerals that potentially form on or around the slag 32 the coarse surface of the crystals was clearly shown on the surfaces of the bof slag fig 5 d and the eaf slag fig 5 f slag is more angular and has a coarse surface structure which increases the bet surface area therefore the surface areas of the bof slag and eaf slag were increased to 10 21 m2 g 10 increase and 47 91 m2 g 30 increase after the reactions respectively fig s1 materials with a greater specific surface area available for calcium oxide dissolution show improved p removal performance 33 3 4 reaction mechanisms of steel slag in the msl system fig 6 shows the reaction mechanisms of steel slag in the msl system speculated from the results of this study with the higher porosity of the pls the retardation capacity of the smbs was stronger and the permeability of the pls was higher latrach et al 2018 demonstrated the priority water movement in the pls of the msl system using a tracer test 31 steel slag primarily consists of sio2 cao and ferric oxide fe2o3 which was consistent with our xrd results shown in fig 4 the ferrous ions fe2 were transported from inside the smbs to the aerobic pls in the form of ferric ions fe3 29 fe3 chemically precipitated with p as ferric phosphate fepo4 whereas other ions were converted into fe hydroxides which facilitates adsorb p onto zeolite or soil 30 this study found that the transformation of fe2 to fe3 was faster when bof slag was embedded in the pls system f than in the smbs system g thereby leading to 4 greater p removal efficiencies the p precipitation activated by released fe2 was the dominant mechanism rather than p adsorption onto zeolite soil however a maximum fe content of 5 in the pls is recommended according to our aforementioned results calcium is rapidly released from steel slag into the aqueous phase in the form of small particles with a high surface area 7 when steel slag is in contact with water reactive ca species such as free cao calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and wollastonite casio3 release ca2 thereby producing basicity via eqs 1 3 34 35 1 cao s h 2 o l ca oh 2 s 2 ca oh 2 s ca aq 2 2 oh aq 3 casio 3 s 2 h aq ca aq 2 sio 2 s h 2 o l in the smbs the presence of p in the msl system inhibited the increase in the ca2 concentration shown in systems a vs b in the pls and systems g vs i both comparisons showed that p and ca2 formed cap precipitates via eq 4 4 5 ca 2 3 po 4 3 oh ca 5 po 4 3 drizo et al 2006 suggested that p precipitation with ca oxides is the principal p removal mechanism in a basic environment 27 the ph of the systems with bof slag was increased from neutrality to basic within the first hour of the reaction whereas the ph of the system with eaf slag increased to 8 fig s2 amount of ca2 would increase the attachment of bacteria to smbs and promote the adsorption of bacteria onto porous materials 31 overall the water ph of the reactive slags is divided into neutral fe adsorption based removal and alkaline ca precipitation based mechanisms with different reacting mechanisms the aerobic environment and higher cec of the pls enabled the transformation and physicochemical removal of nh3 n in contrast the transformation of nh3 n is known to be restrained under anaerobic conditions i e in smbs 36 37 the transformation process via nitrification was mainly dependent on nitrifying bacteria such as nitrospirales sphingobacteriia rhizobiales and rhodospirillales 38 complete nitrification transforms nh3 n into nitrate as shown in eq 5 5 5 nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 2 h h 2 o zeolite and gravel form the microscale environment for growing bacteria and these bacteria affect the water treatment performance 17 comparing systems c and f the embedded bof slag in the smbs or the pls did not assist nh3 n removal therefore nh3 n removal was dominated by adsorption onto zeolite the fe content in the smbs and pls was also not helpful for nh3 n removal indeed the effective removal of nh3 n using steel slag has not been demonstrated there or in any previous study 4 conclusions this study applied bof and eaf slags in the msl system consisted of smb layers and pls the steel slag used in this study primarily consisted of 41 3 42 9 ca and 17 1 43 1 fe as measured by xrf the slags were replaced in the smbs or in the pls to create nine different systems a to i for domestic wastewater containing approximately 20 mg l of tp and 12 mg l of nh3 n the best p and nh3 n removal efficiencies of 93 and 84 respectively were achieved within 5 h of reaction which is quicker than achieved in previous studies embedding 10 and 25 oyster shells in the pls obtained p removal efficiencies of 43 and 71 respectively the systems with bof slag in the pls system f and the smbs system g had excellent p removal efficiencies of 86 and 90 respectively it was speculated that in addition to precipitating with ca the p pollutants precipitated with fe from the bof slag in the pls compared with the bof slag the eaf slag had a lower p removal efficiency 26 49 in systems h and i the highest nh3 n removal efficiency was 84 in system c which embedded 25 0 bof slag in the pls and contributed contents of 10 fe and 10 ca in the msl system calcium in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal at a content of approximately 10 a maximum fe content of 5 in the pls positively contributed to nh3 n removal when comparing system f and system h zeolite had better p and nh3 n removal efficiencies than gravel in the pls the ca content was significantly reduced after dissolution from slag the surface areas of bof slag and eaf slag had an 10 30 increase after the adsorption reactions respectively this study found that the transformation of fe to fe2 was faster when bof slag was embedded in the pls system g than in the smbs system f thereby leading to a 4 greater p removal efficiency comparing systems c and f bof slag embedded in the smbs or pls did not assist nh3 n removal therefore nh3 n removal was dominated by adsorption onto zeolite measurement of the real time do ph and cec capacities is suggested to provide evidence of the reacting mechanisms of the msl system future works may therefore

13286,metal organic frameworks mofs are new porous materials that attract wide attention due to their environmentally friendly photocatalytic characteristics however poor charge separation in most mofs largely limits their photocatalytic activity in this study a novel fe based bi mofs heterojunctions material namely nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was prepared by internal extended growth of mil 100 fe on spindle like nh2 mil 88b fe compared with pure nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe the synthesized fe based bi mofs structure catalyst displayed excellent photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline tc with optimal removal of 99 9 achieved in 90 min under neutral conditions this result is attributed to the sufficient visible light absorption and the enhanced separation and transfer of h and e by the bi mofs structure in particular o2 h and oh showed synergistic effects in the photodegradation process and fe based bi mofs displayed high stability after five cycles the inhibition ratio of luminescent bacteria of the degraded solution was lower than 24 indicating the high efficiency and safety of this fe based bi mofs for the treatment of antibiotic contaminated water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe based bi mofs photocatalysis degradation pathway toxicity 1 introduction antibiotics are natural synthetic or semi synthetic compounds that are designed as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of bacterial infections in both animals and people 1 unfortunately due to their incomplete metabolism a fraction of antibiotics is excreted in the form of feces or urine and these antibiotics cannot be completely removed in wastewater treatment plants 2 and thus eventually enter surface waters sediments or groundwater 3 4 the high content of antibiotics in water can cause severe toxic effects for example tetracycline tc belong to broad spectrum antibiotics that exhibits strong hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity 5 and has been detected in the environment with the highest detected levels of up to 15 μg l found in northern portugal 6 the wide occurrence of antibiotics in the environments leads to the induction and spread of antibiotic resistance genes and has led to the proliferation of bacterial drug resistance threatening ecosystem security and human health 7 additionally some intermediates oxidized from antibiotics are more toxic than the parent compounds 8 therefore antibiotics should be removed as much as possible prior to the discharge of wastewater into ecosystems to date a variety of methods have been applied for the purification of water polluted by antibiotics such as biological processes 9 adsorption 10 and advanced oxidation technology 11 among these semiconductor photocatalysis is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for antibiotics removal because of its advantages of low cost high efficiency and environmental friendliness 12 due to their large specific surface area ssa high degree of crystallinity and adjustable pore size fe based mofs fe mofs have been rapidly developed for the photodegradation of contaminants in the environment 13 14 fe mofs show the unique feature of strong feo coordination bonds formed through o atoms in the organic ligand connected to the unsaturated metal centers fe iii that contributes to their superior stability in solution in particular fe mofs can facilitate the access of guest molecules through the control of the pore size and the internal pore environment 15 as a classic mof material mil 100 fe has attracted much attention due to its the abundant iron oxo clusters 16 however iron contamination and the rapid recombination of electrons and holes produced by light during the photocatalytic activity of mil 100 fe have limited its application to solve this problem researchers have tried various methods including elemental doping modification of metal nanoparticles and preparation of composite photocatalysts with low bandgap semiconductors 17 21 recently two types of mofs bi mofs have been constructed as hybrid photocatalysts such as the three dimensional dendritic uio 66 nh2 mil 101 fe heterojunction photocatalyst and mil 100 mil 53 fe hybrid photocatalyst 22 23 the strategy based on bi mofs can improve the photocatalytic efficiency without relying on additional semiconductors moreover the fe based bi mofs are highly stable and can limit iron contamination 24 it was reported that nh2 mil 88b fe has a strong visible light absorption capability due to its oxygen centered fe3o trimer and the presence of the nh2 group in the organic spacer group 25 to date there have been few studies on fe based bi mofs materials comprised by nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe both of which are highly compatible due to their similar crystal parameters the coupling of these two kinds of fe mofs may lead to improved catalytic activity and stability that can be exploited for highly efficient degradation of organic pollutants herein to promote the photodegradation of tc under visible light a novel fe based bi mofs namely nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was first obtained through the in situ hydrothermal method by the internal expansion growth technique the reaction mechanism was elucidated and the likely degradation pathways were derived through the identification of the degraded intermediates by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms finally the safety of the degraded solution was evaluated based on the bioluminescence inhibition effect and the toxicity of the degradation products was predicted using the toxicity estimation

aladdin reagent china characterization methods are described in text s1 2 2 synthesis of photocatalysts 2 2 1 nh2 mil 88b fe the photocatalyst of nh2 mil 88b fe was prepared based on a previous method 26 with modifications in short fecl3 6h2o 2 0 mmol and nh2 bdc 2 0 mmol were mixed with dmf 42 ml the above solution was mixed for 1 h and moved to the reaction kettle lined with polytetrafluoroethylene 100 ml and the solvent thermal reaction was performed at 110 c for 12 h after centrifuging and washing a brown powder was obtained finally the obtained nh2 mil 88b fe was dried overnight at 70 c 2 2 2 mil 100 fe the preparation of mil 100 fe was conducted based on our reported method 27 using feso4 7h2o as the iron source and h3btc as the organic ligand a mixed liquor including fe h3btc naoh and h2o with a molar ratio of 1 5 1 0 3 0 880 was obtained which was magnetically stirred for 12 h at room temperature mil 100 fe was obtained as brown yellow powder by filtration washing and drying 2 2 3 preparation of nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe photocatalyst nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was prepared by the internal expansion growth method certain amounts 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 mmol of fecl3 6h2o and nh2 bdc in 1 1 m ratio were dispersed into a dmf solution 42 ml and mixed for 35 min then the above solution was mixed with the prepared mil 100 fe powder that was transferred to a reaction kettle with polytetrafluoroethylene 100 ml and reacted thermally at 110 c under vigorous stirring for 12 h as the solution cooled the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for approximately 8 min and washed three times alternately with dmf and etoh the obtained photocatalytic materials were dried at 70 c for 12 h and were denoted as 0 25 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 25 bi mofs 0 5 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 5 bi mofs 0 75 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 75 bi mofs and 1 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 1 bi mofs respectively the process of the composite material synthesis is shown in the scheme s1 2 3 photocatalytic degradation analysis of tc the prepared fe based bi mofs were used in the experiment of photocatalytic degradation of tc with a 350 w xenon lamp λ 420 nm the photocatalytic material was mixed with the tc solution 50 ml in a quartz glass tube prior to the photoreaction the mixed liquid was mixed in the dark for 20 min to confirm the adsorption desorption balance of tc then samples 3 ml were obtained every 30 min and filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane tc and its degradation products were detected by lc ms thermo fisher tsq vantage according to a previous study 28 the photocatalytic degradation rate was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 d 1 c t c 0 100 where d is the removal rate c0 is the original level mg l and ct is the level mg l at time t during adsorption equilibrium and photocatalytic reaction 2 4 toxicity assessment the inhibition ratio of the bioluminescence of v fischeri was used to assess the toxicities of tc and the degradation product based on our previously reported method 29 the inhibition ratio was obtained according to eq 2 2 inhibition ratio l 0 l t l 0 100 where l0 is the bioluminescence signals of the control sample and lt is the bioluminescence signals of the test samples after exposure for 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of the nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe 0 25 bi mofs 0 5 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs and 1 bi mofs materials are shown in fig 1 a the xrd peaks of mil 100 fe are similar to those reported previously for the ultrasonication prepared mil 100 fe 30 the peaks of the composite at 9 2 10 3 13 1 16 6 18 4 19 0 20 6 26 3 and 29 3 are consistent with the simulated 002 101 102 103 200 201 202 204 and 302 diffraction peaks of nh2 mil 88b fe in the cambridge crystal data center ccdc647646 25 respectively meaning the presence of nh2 mil 88b fe in composite material simultaneously the diffraction peaks of the substrate mil 100 fe in the composite catalyst were well preserved indicating that the composition and crystal structure were not affected by the doping of nh2 mil 88b fe these results displayed the successful preparation of bi mofs to further determine the structural features of the obtained composite material ft ir spectroscopy was applied with the results displayed in fig 1 b the broad peak of nh2 mil 88b fe at 485 cm 1 is related to the feo bond stretching vibration 31 the peaks at 765 cm 1 and 711 cm 1 correspond to the ch bonding vibrations of the benzene ring and the formation of an feo bond between the carboxylic group and fe iii ions respectively the peaks at 1257 cm 1 and 1335 cm 1 in the nh2 mil 88b fe photocatalyst can be assigned to the cn bond stretching vibrations indicating the existence of the amine functional group the peaks at 1384 cm 1 and 1584 cm 1 are typical carboxyl group vibration peaks revealing the existence of dicarboxylate ligand groups in the obtained skeleton structure and the band at 1637 cm 1 matches the bending vibration of the nh bonds providing additional evidence for the existence of amino groups in the composite materials 32 the peak at in 1431 cm 1 corresponds to the oh bending vibration in addition compared to the wide band near 3445 cm 1 in mil 100 fe the corresponding peak of the composite material is broadened which may be attributed to the nh2 mil 88b fe peaks of symmetrical and asymmetrical vibrations of the amino group near this frequency overlapping with the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl oh corresponding to mil 100 fe 26 33 these peaks are also observed in the bi mofs photocatalysts hence the ft ir spectra verify the successful formation of bi mofs photocatalysts the morphology of different photocatalysts was characterized by sem with the results shown in fig 2 the nh2 mil 88b fe catalyst was clearly spindle shaped with a relatively smooth surface a length of approximately 1 0 1 5 μm and a width of approximately 250 400 nm as demonstrated in fig 2 a in fig 2 b the sem image of 0 5 bi mofs showed that mil 100 fe with a side length of 200 400 nm was partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe demonstrating the typical mof on mof heterostructure crystal morphology as shown in in fig 2 c the tem image of 0 5 bi mofs also showed that mil 100 fe was partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe which demonstrated that the catalyst has typical mof on mof heterostructure crystal morphology especially fig 2 d h showed the elemental maps of the 0 5 bi mofs composite material that demonstrated the uniform existence of fe c o and n elements indicating the good uniformity of the materials the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms are displayed in fig s1 and bet analysis results including the ssa and pore characteristics of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe and 0 5 bi mofs are displayed in table s1 due to the small ssa of nh2 mil 88b fe 10 82 m2 l the total pore volume and ssa of the 0 5 bi mofs composite decreased significantly relative to the single mil 100 fe catalyst implying the successful growth of nh2 mil 88b fe in the mil 100 fe matrix the elemental composition and electronic structure of 0 5 bi mofs were characterized by xps as shown in fig 3 clearly the carbon iron and oxygen element peaks were consistent with the eds results fig 3 a fig 3 b displayed the xps spectrum of c1s it is clear that the peak split into two prominent peaks at 288 7 ev and 284 8 ev corresponding to the carboxyl group o c o and sp2 hybridized carbon in the benzene ring of the organic ligand respectively 13 fig 3 c showed the fe 2p spectrum the peak at 711 6 ev corresponds to fe 2p3 2 and the peak at 725 1 ev corresponds to fe 2p1 2 in particular the peak at 717 1 ev can be related to the satellite peak of fe3 indicating the existence of fe in the form of fe iii in the material 34 fig 3 d showed the n 1 s spectrum that is spilt into three peaks at 399 1 399 5 and 400 4 ev corresponding to the fen c n c and amino nh2 nitrogen atoms respectively 35 in fig 3 e the occurrence of the peak at 531 9 ev can be attributed to h3btc and carboxyl oxygen atoms of nh2 bdc in the photocatalyst 13 the results of the xps analysis were in agreement with the ft ir results and also demonstrated the successful preparation of the composite fe based mofs catalyst the optical characteristics of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe and bi mofs were determined using uv vis drs and are shown in fig s2 a mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe both showed visible light absorption capability in particular nh2 mil 88b fe exhibited strong absorption capability in the uv and visible light range the absorption in the uv range can be attributed to the π π transition of the organic ligands while feo clusters and the amine groups promote strong absorption in the visible region 36 compared to the original mil 100 fe bi mofs photocatalysts showed a more intense and wider absorption spectrum the optical properties of mil 100 fe were improved by nh2 mil 88b fe loading the band gaps eg of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe 0 25 bi mofs 0 50 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs and 1 bi mofs were 2 42 2 03 2 18 2 11 2 15 and 2 07 ev respectively as displayed in fig s2 b these values were obtained by using the kubelka munk method according to a previous report 37 3 2 photocatalytic reduction of tc by bi mofs 3 2 1 influence of nh2 mil 88b fe load on photo degradation of tc the photocatalytic performance characteristics were assessed through different nh2 mil 88b fe loading using aqueous phase degradation of tc with the level of 10 mg l all of the photocatalysts reached adsorption equilibrium within 30 min fig s3 the results of the visible light degradation reaction process are shown in fig 4 a obviously no reduction of tc was obtained in the absence of either light or photocatalysts and the mechanical mixture of nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe showed slightly more efficient reduction than mil 100 fe because of its intense light absorption in the visible range moreover the composite photocatalysts showed better degradation performance than monomer mof alone and mechanical mixture which can be attributed to the enhanced photoelectron hole separation the rate of reactions followed the order of 0 5 bi mofs 0 25 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs 1 bi mofs nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe as displayed in fig 4 b 0 5 bi mofs achieved a reduction rate of approximately 99 after 90 min and the kinetic rate constant was 0 0514 min 1 this value is 16 4 and 6 4 times higher than the those for mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe respectively as shown in table 1 the photocatalytic performance of mil 100 fe was enhanced by the strong absorption ability of nh2 mil 88b fe in the visible range in particular the removal of toc by 0 5 bi mofs was 41 4 implying the mineralization of some tc fig s4 thus bi mofs showed a synergistic effect bet characterization analysis displayed the small ssa of nh2 mil 88b fe and the clearly decreasing ssa of the heterogeneous junction due to excess nh2 mil 88b fe or mil 100 fe the active sites also play an essential role in the photodegradation process 38 due to the reduction in the amounts of active sites the photodegradation rate decreased with increasing load of nh2 mil 88b fe compared to other reported photocatalysts table s2 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst exhibited remarkable degradation of tc with 99 9 removal in particular 0 5 bi mofs showed a higher degradation rate constant for the removal of tc than the other listed catalysts the heterostructure of fe based bi mofs showed a stable visible light absorption rate and accelerated the separation of h and e thus promoting the photo degradation of tc under neutral conditions to summarize 0 5 bi mofs exhibited good potential for application in water purification 3 2 2 effect of the operating parameters on tc degradation by 0 5 bi mofs catalyst a variety of operational conditions including catalyst dosage initial ph and tc level may impact the photocatalysis of tc in practical application the comparison of the tc degradation results obtained for different dosages of 0 5 bi mofs was displayed in fig 5 a it is clear that tc was completely degraded within 90 min for the catalyst doses of 25 and 35 mg in particular the reaction rate constant k 0 05291 min 1 for the dose of 25 mg was greater than the k 0 0449 min 1 for the dose of 35 mg table s3 based on this result and considering the catalyst cost the dosage of 25 mg 0 5 g l was determined to be the most appropriate when the dosage was increased to 50 mg the degradation rate of tc decreased slightly to approximately 95 within 120 min possibly due to the decreased transmittance of the catalyst agglomeration solution with higher turbidity 39 the photodegradation decreased with the increase in the tc concentration as demonstrated in fig 5 b with the initial tc concentration increased the number of tc molecules also increased while the total number of the active catalyst surface remained constant which produced only limited active radical species furthermore the viscosity of the solution also increased as the concentration of tc increases which inhibited the interaction of the photons with the surface of composite 40 thus the rate of tc degradation decreased with the increase in its initial concentration in the solution to verify the influence of ph on tc photodegradation the experiment was carried out at different ph 3 5 7 9 with the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst dosage of 25 mg at the initial tc level of 10 mg l fig 5 c the degradation efficiency in the order of ph 3 ph 5 ph 11 ph 9 ph 7 thus tc reduction was inhibited under acidic conditions in particular for ph 3 the degradation was only 50 6 while neutral conditions were conducive to tc degradation so that a removal rate of 100 was obtained fig 5 d showed that the zero charge point of 0 5 bi mofs namely phpzc was approximately 7 5 therefore the surface of bi mofs was positively charged at ph 7 5 conversely the bi mofs were negatively charged at ph 7 5 under acidic conditions the positively charged oxygen groups on the surface of the catalyst and tc found in the form of cations tch3 from the dimethyl ammonium group give rise to electrostatic repulsion hindering the adsorption of tc by the catalyst and affecting tc photodegradation 41 in neutral conditions tc exists in the form of amphoteric ions tc0 and tc while the catalyst was still positively charged which was conducive to electrostatic attraction moreover the h generated by light excitation can also attract tc and decompose it by oxidation so that neutral ph was identified to be optimal for photocatalytic tc degradation under alkaline conditions the catalyst is negatively charged and repels the anion form of tc tc tc2 meanwhile the internal electrostatic changes in the tricarbonyl and phenolic diketone groups of dimethyl ammonium of tc may also affect the degradation efficiency 42 to summarize neutral ph was most favorable for the photodegradation of tc by 0 5 bi mofs under visible light 3 3 stability and reusability of photocatalysts stability is a crucial indicator of the suitability of the photocatalyst for practical use in pollutant removal in order to study the stability and reusability of the prepared composite material the photocatalytic activity of the 0 5 bi mofs material 25 mg cycled 5 times was evaluated as follows the photocatalytic material was mixed with the tc solution 50 ml in a quartz glass tube prior to the photoreaction the mixed liquid was mixed in the dark for 20 min to confirm the adsorption desorption balance of tc then samples 3 ml were obtained every 30 min and filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane after the end of the experiment filter the remaining tc solution in the quartz glass tube collect the photocatalytic material filtered by the filter paper and the hydrophilic membrane soak the collected material in absolute ethanol for 30 min and take it out after washing with distilled water the material is dried and circulated the above steps four times results showed that the degradation effect of 0 5 bi mofs did not change significantly after 4 degradation cycles as displayed in fig 6 a especially the xrd pattern and tem image of fe based bi mofs before and after the reaction were shown in fig 6 b c obviously there was no significant change and shift before and after the degradation cycle in the xrd patterns of 0 5 bi mofs heterojunctions and the peaks of each component were still identifiable without significant shift fig 6 b meanwhile after reaction the tem image of 0 5 bi mofs also showed that mil 100 fe was still partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe fig 6 c above characterization analysis collectively illustrated that the prepared catalysts had stable photocatalytic activity and could maintain a stable structure during the catalytic process in addition leaching of the iron ion from fe mofs is the main reason for the problematic metal contamination during the photocatalytic oxidation process 43 the coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry results presented in fig 6 d show that the leaching of fe was only 0 201 mg l meeting the drinking water standard therefore 0 5 bi mofs is a recyclable photocatalyst 3 4 possible mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of tc by the bi mofs catalyst was explored by free radical scavenging experiments bq edta 2na and tba were used as o2 h and oh quenching agents respectively the addition of bq edta 2na and tba led to the inhibited photodegradation performance of tc by 46 4 42 7 and 34 5 respectively as shown in fig 7 a this result evidenced the direct contribution of o2 and h the in the photocatalytic removal of tc under visible light meanwhile tba addition caused significantly smaller reduction around 35 of photodegradation efficiency indicating that participation of oh in the reaction is less important besides the existence of o2 and oh was verified through electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy as shown in fig 7 b c confirming the results of the scavenging experiments this result indicated that o2 h and oh displayed a synergistic effect in the photocatalytic process in addition photoelectron hole recombination was analyzed by photoluminescence pl spectroscopy and the characteristic peak of the photocatalyst appeared at 450 nm at the excitation wavelength of 340 nm and the fluorescence scanning range was 300 600 nm as shown in fig 7 d it is clear that the pl strength of the bi mof composites is weaker than that of the single mil 100 fe or nh2 mil 88b fe 0 5 bi mofs has the lowest pl strength indicating the longer photogenerated carrier life and the lowest photogenerated electron hole binding rate thus it is demonstrated that the electron transfer between mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe effectively inhibits electron hole binding inside the individual components of the composite the effects of bi mofs on the photocatalytic performance were further tested by transient photocurrent response tpr and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis here a higher photocurrent intensity indicates a higher electron hole separation rate 44 the photocurrent intensity of 0 5 bi mofs as demonstrated in fig 7 e is greater than that of pure mil 100 fe signifying the prolonged efficient reaction time of photoelectrons induced by the double mof heterojunction this smaller arc radius observed in eis represents a lower charge transfer resistance 45 the arc radius of 0 5 bi mofs is less than pure mil 100 fe as exhibited in fig 7 f indicating that the former had a higher charge transfer efficiency which was in accordance with the results of the pl and tpr analyses moreover the band edges of the material were calculated according to the previously reported method 46 the calculated valence band potential evb and conduction band potential ecb of bi mofs are shown in table s4 based on the above results the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of tc by 0 5 bi mofs is schematically illustrated in scheme 1 under visible light radiation the electron transfer pathway of nh2 bdc ligand can also be stimulated by light aside from the direct excitation of the feo cluster and photo induced electrons can be passed on to the fe center this synergistic effect of the two excitation pathways enhances the photocatalytic activity 47 based on the positions of vb cb and the active species trapping experiments the ecb value of nh2 mil 88b fe is 0 35 ev which is more positive than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe thus the material cannot interact with o2 to generate more o2 so that traditional type ii heterojunction mechanism cannot explain the obtained results 36 considering the formation of bi mofs heterojunction the photo induced electrons in the conduction band of nh2 mil 88b fe may migrate to the valence band of mil 100 fe and the photogenerated holes are consumed thereby effectively shortening the electron transfer distance and improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes the ecb value of mil 100 fe is 0 61 ev which is more negative than o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe hence the e in the conduction band can react with o2 to generate o2 the evb value of nh2 mil 88b fe is 2 38 ev which is equal to the potential of oh h2o 2 38 ev vs nhe 48 so that h in the valence band of nh2 mil 88b fe can not only directly oxidize tc but also react with h2o to generate oh to participate in the degradation reaction therefore the z scheme heterojunction mechanism provided a good explanation of the excellent photocatalytic performance of the fe based bi mofs heterostructure the reaction process can be described by the following formulas 3 nh 2 mil 88 b fe mil 100 fe hν e h 4 mil 100 fe e o 2 o 2 5 nh 2 mil 88 b fe h h 2 o oh h 6 h o 2 oh tc degradation products co 2 h 2 o 3 5 identification of intermediate products and toxicity assessment 3 5 1 identification of intermediate products an examination of the uv vis spectrum fig s5 a found that the peak intensity of tc at 357 nm decreased with increasing degradation time confirming that tc was gradually degraded to further understand the degradation products of tc the intermediate products were detected by lc ms fig s5 b f showed the mass spectra obtained at different times during the degradation process based on the results of lc ms detection the likely degradation pathways of tc by the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst were identified as exhibited in fig 8 a the process of 0 5 bi mofs photocatalysis mainly involved two mechanisms first the generation of the main anions at m z 431 and m z 416 can be attributed to the loss of the n methyl group with the low nc bond energy 49 this was followed by the loss of amino and amide groups to form the intermediate with m z 358 second the tc molecule was attacked by o2 and oh breaking two cc bonds and the hydroxylation reaction occurs producing the intermediate with m z of 464 the active free group further attacks the amino and amide group to produce the intermediate with m z 392 then oxidation decomposition and ring opening reaction occurred in the photodegradation reaction process and the m z 358 and m z 392 intermediates were cleaved to produce the m z 306 intermediated that then lost two methyl groups to produce the m z 278 intermediate the further ring opening decomposition yielded the intermediate with m z 249 and aromatic compounds with m z 106 28 the interaction of oh and the aromatic group resulted in the damage of the ring so that co2 h2o and inorganic ions were formed via the oxidation process 3 5 2 toxicity assessment to evaluate the safety of the degraded solution the toxicity changes caused by the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst were assessed by detecting the inhibition ratio of bioluminescence of v fischeri as shown in fig 8 b it is clear that the inhibition ratio of luminescent bacteria induced by initial solution was initially 13 5 and then increased to over 41 5 during the photocatalytic process 1 30 min finally the toxicity of the degraded solution was stabilized with inhibition ratio of approximately 30 the weak toxic effect of the initial solution could be ascribed to the low concentration compared with the ec50 value of 104 μm 50 while the significant increase in the toxicity suggested the production of more toxic substances moreover the predicted toxicity of tc and the intermediate products were given fig 8 c four transformation products m z 430 416 464 358 and 249 showed significantly higher acute toxicity for daphnia and fish and the products with m z 392 306 and 106 exhibited lower toxicity than tc explaining the higher toxicity to v fischeri observed during degradation for 30 min with the presence of the above low toxicity substances the toxicity of the whole degradation solution was notably reduced a previous study also pointed out that the degradation solution of tc displayed strong toxicity with a luminescence inhibition rate of 55 after electrochemical oxidation over a ti ti4o7 anode in 10 min that was also ascribed to the formation of the more toxic degradation products with m z 461 and 432 51 finally the obtained degraded solution was safe for the aquatic environment ensuring the safety of the discharge of the degraded solution into the receiving water 4 conclusions a novel fe based bi mofs photocatalyst was prepared by embedding the rhombic polyhedral mil 100 fe into the spindle shaped nh2 mil 88b fe surface by the internal extended growth method the examination of the resulting photocatalyst showed that the prepared fe based bi mofs structure had the optimal effect for tc degradation of up to 99 under neutral conditions for the substrate amount of mil 100 fe of 0 1 g and the nh2 mil 88b fe amount set to 0 5 mmol the observed enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the broadening of the visible light adsorption region and extension of the lifetime of h and e of fe based bi mofs the z scheme heterojunction mechanism was identified during the photocatalytic process in which h o2 and oh have synergistic effects for the photocatalytic degradation of tc moreover the discharge of the obtained degraded solution was safe for the aquatic ecosystem compared to the traditional semiconductor materials the use of two compatible fe mof conjugation provided an excellent strategy for the design and preparation of new mof based photocatalysts that could extend the utilization of mof based materials in water treatment credit authorship contribution

13286,metal organic frameworks mofs are new porous materials that attract wide attention due to their environmentally friendly photocatalytic characteristics however poor charge separation in most mofs largely limits their photocatalytic activity in this study a novel fe based bi mofs heterojunctions material namely nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was prepared by internal extended growth of mil 100 fe on spindle like nh2 mil 88b fe compared with pure nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe the synthesized fe based bi mofs structure catalyst displayed excellent photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline tc with optimal removal of 99 9 achieved in 90 min under neutral conditions this result is attributed to the sufficient visible light absorption and the enhanced separation and transfer of h and e by the bi mofs structure in particular o2 h and oh showed synergistic effects in the photodegradation process and fe based bi mofs displayed high stability after five cycles the inhibition ratio of luminescent bacteria of the degraded solution was lower than 24 indicating the high efficiency and safety of this fe based bi mofs for the treatment of antibiotic contaminated water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fe based bi mofs photocatalysis degradation pathway toxicity 1 introduction antibiotics are natural synthetic or semi synthetic compounds that are designed as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of bacterial infections in both animals and people 1 unfortunately due to their incomplete metabolism a fraction of antibiotics is excreted in the form of feces or urine and these antibiotics cannot be completely removed in wastewater treatment plants 2 and thus eventually enter surface waters sediments or groundwater 3 4 the high content of antibiotics in water can cause severe toxic effects for example tetracycline tc belong to broad spectrum antibiotics that exhibits strong hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity 5 and has been detected in the environment with the highest detected levels of up to 15 μg l found in northern portugal 6 the wide occurrence of antibiotics in the environments leads to the induction and spread of antibiotic resistance genes and has led to the proliferation of bacterial drug resistance threatening ecosystem security and human health 7 additionally some intermediates oxidized from antibiotics are more toxic than the parent compounds 8 therefore antibiotics should be removed as much as possible prior to the discharge of wastewater into ecosystems to date a variety of methods have been applied for the purification of water polluted by antibiotics such as biological processes 9 adsorption 10 and advanced oxidation technology 11 among these semiconductor photocatalysis is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for antibiotics removal because of its advantages of low cost high efficiency and environmental friendliness 12 due to their large specific surface area ssa high degree of crystallinity and adjustable pore size fe based mofs fe mofs have been rapidly developed for the photodegradation of contaminants in the environment 13 14 fe mofs show the unique feature of strong feo coordination bonds formed through o atoms in the organic ligand connected to the unsaturated metal centers fe iii that contributes to their superior stability in solution in particular fe mofs can facilitate the access of guest molecules through the control of the pore size and the internal pore environment 15 as a classic mof material mil 100 fe has attracted much attention due to its the abundant iron oxo clusters 16 however iron contamination and the rapid recombination of electrons and holes produced by light during the photocatalytic activity of mil 100 fe have limited its application to solve this problem researchers have tried various methods including elemental doping modification of metal nanoparticles and preparation of composite photocatalysts with low bandgap semiconductors 17 21 recently two types of mofs bi mofs have been constructed as hybrid photocatalysts such as the three dimensional dendritic uio 66 nh2 mil 101 fe heterojunction photocatalyst and mil 100 mil 53 fe hybrid photocatalyst 22 23 the strategy based on bi mofs can improve the photocatalytic efficiency without relying on additional semiconductors moreover the fe based bi mofs are highly stable and can limit iron contamination 24 it was reported that nh2 mil 88b fe has a strong visible light absorption capability due to its oxygen centered fe3o trimer and the presence of the nh2 group in the organic spacer group 25 to date there have been few studies on fe based bi mofs materials comprised by nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe both of which are highly compatible due to their similar crystal parameters the coupling of these two kinds of fe mofs may lead to improved catalytic activity and stability that can be exploited for highly efficient degradation of organic pollutants herein to promote the photodegradation of tc under visible light a novel fe based bi mofs namely nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was first obtained through the in situ hydrothermal method by the internal expansion growth technique the reaction mechanism was elucidated and the likely degradation pathways were derived through the identification of the degraded intermediates by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms finally the safety of the degraded solution was evaluated based on the bioluminescence inhibition effect and the toxicity of the degradation products was predicted using the toxicity estimation

aladdin reagent china characterization methods are described in text s1 2 2 synthesis of photocatalysts 2 2 1 nh2 mil 88b fe the photocatalyst of nh2 mil 88b fe was prepared based on a previous method 26 with modifications in short fecl3 6h2o 2 0 mmol and nh2 bdc 2 0 mmol were mixed with dmf 42 ml the above solution was mixed for 1 h and moved to the reaction kettle lined with polytetrafluoroethylene 100 ml and the solvent thermal reaction was performed at 110 c for 12 h after centrifuging and washing a brown powder was obtained finally the obtained nh2 mil 88b fe was dried overnight at 70 c 2 2 2 mil 100 fe the preparation of mil 100 fe was conducted based on our reported method 27 using feso4 7h2o as the iron source and h3btc as the organic ligand a mixed liquor including fe h3btc naoh and h2o with a molar ratio of 1 5 1 0 3 0 880 was obtained which was magnetically stirred for 12 h at room temperature mil 100 fe was obtained as brown yellow powder by filtration washing and drying 2 2 3 preparation of nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe photocatalyst nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe was prepared by the internal expansion growth method certain amounts 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 mmol of fecl3 6h2o and nh2 bdc in 1 1 m ratio were dispersed into a dmf solution 42 ml and mixed for 35 min then the above solution was mixed with the prepared mil 100 fe powder that was transferred to a reaction kettle with polytetrafluoroethylene 100 ml and reacted thermally at 110 c under vigorous stirring for 12 h as the solution cooled the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for approximately 8 min and washed three times alternately with dmf and etoh the obtained photocatalytic materials were dried at 70 c for 12 h and were denoted as 0 25 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 25 bi mofs 0 5 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 5 bi mofs 0 75 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 0 75 bi mofs and 1 nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe namely 1 bi mofs respectively the process of the composite material synthesis is shown in the scheme s1 2 3 photocatalytic degradation analysis of tc the prepared fe based bi mofs were used in the experiment of photocatalytic degradation of tc with a 350 w xenon lamp λ 420 nm the photocatalytic material was mixed with the tc solution 50 ml in a quartz glass tube prior to the photoreaction the mixed liquid was mixed in the dark for 20 min to confirm the adsorption desorption balance of tc then samples 3 ml were obtained every 30 min and filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane tc and its degradation products were detected by lc ms thermo fisher tsq vantage according to a previous study 28 the photocatalytic degradation rate was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 d 1 c t c 0 100 where d is the removal rate c0 is the original level mg l and ct is the level mg l at time t during adsorption equilibrium and photocatalytic reaction 2 4 toxicity assessment the inhibition ratio of the bioluminescence of v fischeri was used to assess the toxicities of tc and the degradation product based on our previously reported method 29 the inhibition ratio was obtained according to eq 2 2 inhibition ratio l 0 l t l 0 100 where l0 is the bioluminescence signals of the control sample and lt is the bioluminescence signals of the test samples after exposure for 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of the nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe 0 25 bi mofs 0 5 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs and 1 bi mofs materials are shown in fig 1 a the xrd peaks of mil 100 fe are similar to those reported previously for the ultrasonication prepared mil 100 fe 30 the peaks of the composite at 9 2 10 3 13 1 16 6 18 4 19 0 20 6 26 3 and 29 3 are consistent with the simulated 002 101 102 103 200 201 202 204 and 302 diffraction peaks of nh2 mil 88b fe in the cambridge crystal data center ccdc647646 25 respectively meaning the presence of nh2 mil 88b fe in composite material simultaneously the diffraction peaks of the substrate mil 100 fe in the composite catalyst were well preserved indicating that the composition and crystal structure were not affected by the doping of nh2 mil 88b fe these results displayed the successful preparation of bi mofs to further determine the structural features of the obtained composite material ft ir spectroscopy was applied with the results displayed in fig 1 b the broad peak of nh2 mil 88b fe at 485 cm 1 is related to the feo bond stretching vibration 31 the peaks at 765 cm 1 and 711 cm 1 correspond to the ch bonding vibrations of the benzene ring and the formation of an feo bond between the carboxylic group and fe iii ions respectively the peaks at 1257 cm 1 and 1335 cm 1 in the nh2 mil 88b fe photocatalyst can be assigned to the cn bond stretching vibrations indicating the existence of the amine functional group the peaks at 1384 cm 1 and 1584 cm 1 are typical carboxyl group vibration peaks revealing the existence of dicarboxylate ligand groups in the obtained skeleton structure and the band at 1637 cm 1 matches the bending vibration of the nh bonds providing additional evidence for the existence of amino groups in the composite materials 32 the peak at in 1431 cm 1 corresponds to the oh bending vibration in addition compared to the wide band near 3445 cm 1 in mil 100 fe the corresponding peak of the composite material is broadened which may be attributed to the nh2 mil 88b fe peaks of symmetrical and asymmetrical vibrations of the amino group near this frequency overlapping with the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl oh corresponding to mil 100 fe 26 33 these peaks are also observed in the bi mofs photocatalysts hence the ft ir spectra verify the successful formation of bi mofs photocatalysts the morphology of different photocatalysts was characterized by sem with the results shown in fig 2 the nh2 mil 88b fe catalyst was clearly spindle shaped with a relatively smooth surface a length of approximately 1 0 1 5 μm and a width of approximately 250 400 nm as demonstrated in fig 2 a in fig 2 b the sem image of 0 5 bi mofs showed that mil 100 fe with a side length of 200 400 nm was partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe demonstrating the typical mof on mof heterostructure crystal morphology as shown in in fig 2 c the tem image of 0 5 bi mofs also showed that mil 100 fe was partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe which demonstrated that the catalyst has typical mof on mof heterostructure crystal morphology especially fig 2 d h showed the elemental maps of the 0 5 bi mofs composite material that demonstrated the uniform existence of fe c o and n elements indicating the good uniformity of the materials the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms are displayed in fig s1 and bet analysis results including the ssa and pore characteristics of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe and 0 5 bi mofs are displayed in table s1 due to the small ssa of nh2 mil 88b fe 10 82 m2 l the total pore volume and ssa of the 0 5 bi mofs composite decreased significantly relative to the single mil 100 fe catalyst implying the successful growth of nh2 mil 88b fe in the mil 100 fe matrix the elemental composition and electronic structure of 0 5 bi mofs were characterized by xps as shown in fig 3 clearly the carbon iron and oxygen element peaks were consistent with the eds results fig 3 a fig 3 b displayed the xps spectrum of c1s it is clear that the peak split into two prominent peaks at 288 7 ev and 284 8 ev corresponding to the carboxyl group o c o and sp2 hybridized carbon in the benzene ring of the organic ligand respectively 13 fig 3 c showed the fe 2p spectrum the peak at 711 6 ev corresponds to fe 2p3 2 and the peak at 725 1 ev corresponds to fe 2p1 2 in particular the peak at 717 1 ev can be related to the satellite peak of fe3 indicating the existence of fe in the form of fe iii in the material 34 fig 3 d showed the n 1 s spectrum that is spilt into three peaks at 399 1 399 5 and 400 4 ev corresponding to the fen c n c and amino nh2 nitrogen atoms respectively 35 in fig 3 e the occurrence of the peak at 531 9 ev can be attributed to h3btc and carboxyl oxygen atoms of nh2 bdc in the photocatalyst 13 the results of the xps analysis were in agreement with the ft ir results and also demonstrated the successful preparation of the composite fe based mofs catalyst the optical characteristics of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe and bi mofs were determined using uv vis drs and are shown in fig s2 a mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe both showed visible light absorption capability in particular nh2 mil 88b fe exhibited strong absorption capability in the uv and visible light range the absorption in the uv range can be attributed to the π π transition of the organic ligands while feo clusters and the amine groups promote strong absorption in the visible region 36 compared to the original mil 100 fe bi mofs photocatalysts showed a more intense and wider absorption spectrum the optical properties of mil 100 fe were improved by nh2 mil 88b fe loading the band gaps eg of mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe 0 25 bi mofs 0 50 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs and 1 bi mofs were 2 42 2 03 2 18 2 11 2 15 and 2 07 ev respectively as displayed in fig s2 b these values were obtained by using the kubelka munk method according to a previous report 37 3 2 photocatalytic reduction of tc by bi mofs 3 2 1 influence of nh2 mil 88b fe load on photo degradation of tc the photocatalytic performance characteristics were assessed through different nh2 mil 88b fe loading using aqueous phase degradation of tc with the level of 10 mg l all of the photocatalysts reached adsorption equilibrium within 30 min fig s3 the results of the visible light degradation reaction process are shown in fig 4 a obviously no reduction of tc was obtained in the absence of either light or photocatalysts and the mechanical mixture of nh2 mil 88b fe and mil 100 fe nh2 mil 88b fe showed slightly more efficient reduction than mil 100 fe because of its intense light absorption in the visible range moreover the composite photocatalysts showed better degradation performance than monomer mof alone and mechanical mixture which can be attributed to the enhanced photoelectron hole separation the rate of reactions followed the order of 0 5 bi mofs 0 25 bi mofs 0 75 bi mofs 1 bi mofs nh2 mil 88b fe mil 100 fe as displayed in fig 4 b 0 5 bi mofs achieved a reduction rate of approximately 99 after 90 min and the kinetic rate constant was 0 0514 min 1 this value is 16 4 and 6 4 times higher than the those for mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe respectively as shown in table 1 the photocatalytic performance of mil 100 fe was enhanced by the strong absorption ability of nh2 mil 88b fe in the visible range in particular the removal of toc by 0 5 bi mofs was 41 4 implying the mineralization of some tc fig s4 thus bi mofs showed a synergistic effect bet characterization analysis displayed the small ssa of nh2 mil 88b fe and the clearly decreasing ssa of the heterogeneous junction due to excess nh2 mil 88b fe or mil 100 fe the active sites also play an essential role in the photodegradation process 38 due to the reduction in the amounts of active sites the photodegradation rate decreased with increasing load of nh2 mil 88b fe compared to other reported photocatalysts table s2 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst exhibited remarkable degradation of tc with 99 9 removal in particular 0 5 bi mofs showed a higher degradation rate constant for the removal of tc than the other listed catalysts the heterostructure of fe based bi mofs showed a stable visible light absorption rate and accelerated the separation of h and e thus promoting the photo degradation of tc under neutral conditions to summarize 0 5 bi mofs exhibited good potential for application in water purification 3 2 2 effect of the operating parameters on tc degradation by 0 5 bi mofs catalyst a variety of operational conditions including catalyst dosage initial ph and tc level may impact the photocatalysis of tc in practical application the comparison of the tc degradation results obtained for different dosages of 0 5 bi mofs was displayed in fig 5 a it is clear that tc was completely degraded within 90 min for the catalyst doses of 25 and 35 mg in particular the reaction rate constant k 0 05291 min 1 for the dose of 25 mg was greater than the k 0 0449 min 1 for the dose of 35 mg table s3 based on this result and considering the catalyst cost the dosage of 25 mg 0 5 g l was determined to be the most appropriate when the dosage was increased to 50 mg the degradation rate of tc decreased slightly to approximately 95 within 120 min possibly due to the decreased transmittance of the catalyst agglomeration solution with higher turbidity 39 the photodegradation decreased with the increase in the tc concentration as demonstrated in fig 5 b with the initial tc concentration increased the number of tc molecules also increased while the total number of the active catalyst surface remained constant which produced only limited active radical species furthermore the viscosity of the solution also increased as the concentration of tc increases which inhibited the interaction of the photons with the surface of composite 40 thus the rate of tc degradation decreased with the increase in its initial concentration in the solution to verify the influence of ph on tc photodegradation the experiment was carried out at different ph 3 5 7 9 with the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst dosage of 25 mg at the initial tc level of 10 mg l fig 5 c the degradation efficiency in the order of ph 3 ph 5 ph 11 ph 9 ph 7 thus tc reduction was inhibited under acidic conditions in particular for ph 3 the degradation was only 50 6 while neutral conditions were conducive to tc degradation so that a removal rate of 100 was obtained fig 5 d showed that the zero charge point of 0 5 bi mofs namely phpzc was approximately 7 5 therefore the surface of bi mofs was positively charged at ph 7 5 conversely the bi mofs were negatively charged at ph 7 5 under acidic conditions the positively charged oxygen groups on the surface of the catalyst and tc found in the form of cations tch3 from the dimethyl ammonium group give rise to electrostatic repulsion hindering the adsorption of tc by the catalyst and affecting tc photodegradation 41 in neutral conditions tc exists in the form of amphoteric ions tc0 and tc while the catalyst was still positively charged which was conducive to electrostatic attraction moreover the h generated by light excitation can also attract tc and decompose it by oxidation so that neutral ph was identified to be optimal for photocatalytic tc degradation under alkaline conditions the catalyst is negatively charged and repels the anion form of tc tc tc2 meanwhile the internal electrostatic changes in the tricarbonyl and phenolic diketone groups of dimethyl ammonium of tc may also affect the degradation efficiency 42 to summarize neutral ph was most favorable for the photodegradation of tc by 0 5 bi mofs under visible light 3 3 stability and reusability of photocatalysts stability is a crucial indicator of the suitability of the photocatalyst for practical use in pollutant removal in order to study the stability and reusability of the prepared composite material the photocatalytic activity of the 0 5 bi mofs material 25 mg cycled 5 times was evaluated as follows the photocatalytic material was mixed with the tc solution 50 ml in a quartz glass tube prior to the photoreaction the mixed liquid was mixed in the dark for 20 min to confirm the adsorption desorption balance of tc then samples 3 ml were obtained every 30 min and filtered using a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane after the end of the experiment filter the remaining tc solution in the quartz glass tube collect the photocatalytic material filtered by the filter paper and the hydrophilic membrane soak the collected material in absolute ethanol for 30 min and take it out after washing with distilled water the material is dried and circulated the above steps four times results showed that the degradation effect of 0 5 bi mofs did not change significantly after 4 degradation cycles as displayed in fig 6 a especially the xrd pattern and tem image of fe based bi mofs before and after the reaction were shown in fig 6 b c obviously there was no significant change and shift before and after the degradation cycle in the xrd patterns of 0 5 bi mofs heterojunctions and the peaks of each component were still identifiable without significant shift fig 6 b meanwhile after reaction the tem image of 0 5 bi mofs also showed that mil 100 fe was still partially embedded into the crystal surface of nh2 mil 88b fe fig 6 c above characterization analysis collectively illustrated that the prepared catalysts had stable photocatalytic activity and could maintain a stable structure during the catalytic process in addition leaching of the iron ion from fe mofs is the main reason for the problematic metal contamination during the photocatalytic oxidation process 43 the coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry results presented in fig 6 d show that the leaching of fe was only 0 201 mg l meeting the drinking water standard therefore 0 5 bi mofs is a recyclable photocatalyst 3 4 possible mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of tc by the bi mofs catalyst was explored by free radical scavenging experiments bq edta 2na and tba were used as o2 h and oh quenching agents respectively the addition of bq edta 2na and tba led to the inhibited photodegradation performance of tc by 46 4 42 7 and 34 5 respectively as shown in fig 7 a this result evidenced the direct contribution of o2 and h the in the photocatalytic removal of tc under visible light meanwhile tba addition caused significantly smaller reduction around 35 of photodegradation efficiency indicating that participation of oh in the reaction is less important besides the existence of o2 and oh was verified through electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy as shown in fig 7 b c confirming the results of the scavenging experiments this result indicated that o2 h and oh displayed a synergistic effect in the photocatalytic process in addition photoelectron hole recombination was analyzed by photoluminescence pl spectroscopy and the characteristic peak of the photocatalyst appeared at 450 nm at the excitation wavelength of 340 nm and the fluorescence scanning range was 300 600 nm as shown in fig 7 d it is clear that the pl strength of the bi mof composites is weaker than that of the single mil 100 fe or nh2 mil 88b fe 0 5 bi mofs has the lowest pl strength indicating the longer photogenerated carrier life and the lowest photogenerated electron hole binding rate thus it is demonstrated that the electron transfer between mil 100 fe and nh2 mil 88b fe effectively inhibits electron hole binding inside the individual components of the composite the effects of bi mofs on the photocatalytic performance were further tested by transient photocurrent response tpr and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis here a higher photocurrent intensity indicates a higher electron hole separation rate 44 the photocurrent intensity of 0 5 bi mofs as demonstrated in fig 7 e is greater than that of pure mil 100 fe signifying the prolonged efficient reaction time of photoelectrons induced by the double mof heterojunction this smaller arc radius observed in eis represents a lower charge transfer resistance 45 the arc radius of 0 5 bi mofs is less than pure mil 100 fe as exhibited in fig 7 f indicating that the former had a higher charge transfer efficiency which was in accordance with the results of the pl and tpr analyses moreover the band edges of the material were calculated according to the previously reported method 46 the calculated valence band potential evb and conduction band potential ecb of bi mofs are shown in table s4 based on the above results the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of tc by 0 5 bi mofs is schematically illustrated in scheme 1 under visible light radiation the electron transfer pathway of nh2 bdc ligand can also be stimulated by light aside from the direct excitation of the feo cluster and photo induced electrons can be passed on to the fe center this synergistic effect of the two excitation pathways enhances the photocatalytic activity 47 based on the positions of vb cb and the active species trapping experiments the ecb value of nh2 mil 88b fe is 0 35 ev which is more positive than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe thus the material cannot interact with o2 to generate more o2 so that traditional type ii heterojunction mechanism cannot explain the obtained results 36 considering the formation of bi mofs heterojunction the photo induced electrons in the conduction band of nh2 mil 88b fe may migrate to the valence band of mil 100 fe and the photogenerated holes are consumed thereby effectively shortening the electron transfer distance and improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes the ecb value of mil 100 fe is 0 61 ev which is more negative than o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe hence the e in the conduction band can react with o2 to generate o2 the evb value of nh2 mil 88b fe is 2 38 ev which is equal to the potential of oh h2o 2 38 ev vs nhe 48 so that h in the valence band of nh2 mil 88b fe can not only directly oxidize tc but also react with h2o to generate oh to participate in the degradation reaction therefore the z scheme heterojunction mechanism provided a good explanation of the excellent photocatalytic performance of the fe based bi mofs heterostructure the reaction process can be described by the following formulas 3 nh 2 mil 88 b fe mil 100 fe hν e h 4 mil 100 fe e o 2 o 2 5 nh 2 mil 88 b fe h h 2 o oh h 6 h o 2 oh tc degradation products co 2 h 2 o 3 5 identification of intermediate products and toxicity assessment 3 5 1 identification of intermediate products an examination of the uv vis spectrum fig s5 a found that the peak intensity of tc at 357 nm decreased with increasing degradation time confirming that tc was gradually degraded to further understand the degradation products of tc the intermediate products were detected by lc ms fig s5 b f showed the mass spectra obtained at different times during the degradation process based on the results of lc ms detection the likely degradation pathways of tc by the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst were identified as exhibited in fig 8 a the process of 0 5 bi mofs photocatalysis mainly involved two mechanisms first the generation of the main anions at m z 431 and m z 416 can be attributed to the loss of the n methyl group with the low nc bond energy 49 this was followed by the loss of amino and amide groups to form the intermediate with m z 358 second the tc molecule was attacked by o2 and oh breaking two cc bonds and the hydroxylation reaction occurs producing the intermediate with m z of 464 the active free group further attacks the amino and amide group to produce the intermediate with m z 392 then oxidation decomposition and ring opening reaction occurred in the photodegradation reaction process and the m z 358 and m z 392 intermediates were cleaved to produce the m z 306 intermediated that then lost two methyl groups to produce the m z 278 intermediate the further ring opening decomposition yielded the intermediate with m z 249 and aromatic compounds with m z 106 28 the interaction of oh and the aromatic group resulted in the damage of the ring so that co2 h2o and inorganic ions were formed via the oxidation process 3 5 2 toxicity assessment to evaluate the safety of the degraded solution the toxicity changes caused by the 0 5 bi mofs photocatalyst were assessed by detecting the inhibition ratio of bioluminescence of v fischeri as shown in fig 8 b it is clear that the inhibition ratio of luminescent bacteria induced by initial solution was initially 13 5 and then increased to over 41 5 during the photocatalytic process 1 30 min finally the toxicity of the degraded solution was stabilized with inhibition ratio of approximately 30 the weak toxic effect of the initial solution could be ascribed to the low concentration compared with the ec50 value of 104 μm 50 while the significant increase in the toxicity suggested the production of more toxic substances moreover the predicted toxicity of tc and the intermediate products were given fig 8 c four transformation products m z 430 416 464 358 and 249 showed significantly higher acute toxicity for daphnia and fish and the products with m z 392 306 and 106 exhibited lower toxicity than tc explaining the higher toxicity to v fischeri observed during degradation for 30 min with the presence of the above low toxicity substances the toxicity of the whole degradation solution was notably reduced a previous study also pointed out that the degradation solution of tc displayed strong toxicity with a luminescence inhibition rate of 55 after electrochemical oxidation over a ti ti4o7 anode in 10 min that was also ascribed to the formation of the more toxic degradation products with m z 461 and 432 51 finally the obtained degraded solution was safe for the aquatic environment ensuring the safety of the discharge of the degraded solution into the receiving water 4 conclusions a novel fe based bi mofs photocatalyst was prepared by embedding the rhombic polyhedral mil 100 fe into the spindle shaped nh2 mil 88b fe surface by the internal extended growth method the examination of the resulting photocatalyst showed that the prepared fe based bi mofs structure had the optimal effect for tc degradation of up to 99 under neutral conditions for the substrate amount of mil 100 fe of 0 1 g and the nh2 mil 88b fe amount set to 0 5 mmol the observed enhancement in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the broadening of the visible light adsorption region and extension of the lifetime of h and e of fe based bi mofs the z scheme heterojunction mechanism was identified during the photocatalytic process in which h o2 and oh have synergistic effects for the photocatalytic degradation of tc moreover the discharge of the obtained degraded solution was safe for the aquatic ecosystem compared to the traditional semiconductor materials the use of two compatible fe mof conjugation provided an excellent strategy for the design and preparation of new mof based photocatalysts that could extend the utilization of mof based materials in water treatment credit authorship contribution

13287,dysprosium is a critical rare earth metal used in high tech industry its recovery from secondary sources is fundamental in the context of circular economy the use of polymer based biosorbents is promising for this purpose in this work we employ a biocomposite produced from waste protein from silk yarns processing sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol for dysprosium recovery by batch biosorption in aqueous medium the ph range between 4 5 and 5 0 for dysprosium biosorption and calcium release by biosorbent beads was defined by chemical equilibrium diagrams kinetics assays indicated that the equilibrium times and dysprosium biosorbed amounts at equilibrium were 120 to 390 min and 0 048 to 0 139 mmol g respectively kinetic data followed the pseudo first order model and were governed by external diffusion resistance the kinetics profiles also indicated that the cationic exchange between dysprosium and calcium was stoichiometric additionally calcium nitrate nitric acid 0 1 mol l was selected for the reuse cyclic assays due to the higher elution efficiency of dysprosium achieved beads reusability and dysprosium recovery were performed for up to four reuse cycles and achieved biosorption and desorption efficiencies above 94 and 98 respectively the characterizations of beads loaded with dy iii indicated that biosorbent maintained its macroporous structure low porosity and specific surface area lower thermal resistance and amorphous structure finally cationic exchange mechanism was confirmed by techniques of energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy therefore the use of crosslinked sericin alginate beads is the first step towards achieving a sustainable valorization of sericin and recovery of high added value metals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords discontinuous biosorption dysprosium sericin and alginate polyvinyl alcohol cationic exchange mechanism 1 introduction dysprosium dy is a critical rare earth re which has different applications in the high tech industry 1 2 among the most common applications the production of magnets corresponds to about 1 5 of the total consumption of res being on the other hand the activity that most adds value to res 37 of total consumption in terms of value 2 3 res magnets include the permanent magnets smco smco5 or sm2co17 and nd fe b nd2fe14b which may contain different amounts of dy tb and pr and the latter has the highest specific magnetic field known 3 5 these magnets are used in engines hard drives dynamos speakers and turbines for wind power generation 6 8 thus the recovery of res as dy in secondary sources e g industrial effluents and end of life electronic products is of social economic and environmental interest 9 10 the recovery of high value added metals such as dy in waste contributes to the circular economy of this resource 11 12 the content of dy in secondary sources is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the primary sources 13 14 therefore biosorption is a promising unit operation for the recovery of res as dy in dilute aqueous media 14 15 this operation has advantages over traditional operations e g leaching 16 precipitation 17 solvent extraction 18 and ion exchange 19 due to its flexibility and design simplicity no by product generation and efficiency for recovery of res at low loads 20 the choice of the bio adsorbent matrix to be evaluated is also important as it directly influences the efficiency and feasibility of the operation 21 despite its high production cost and difficult reuse activated carbon is the most commonly used commercial adsorbent material for effluent decontamination 22 23 however the use of matrices based on seaweeds 24 plant materials 25 cellulose 26 chitosan 27 30 calcium alginate 31 32 metal organic frameworks 33 graphene oxide 34 pyrolytic carbon materials 35 and silica composites 5 36 42 for bio adsorption and recovery of dy from aqueous media have been extensively investigated in the scientific literature among the agro industrial wastes sericin a globular protein extracted from the silkworm cocoons has been discarded as a residual by product by the silk spinning industry 43 44 however this hydrophilic protein has physicochemical characteristics that make its use in the preparation of biocomposites attractive 45 46 its combination with macromolecules such as sodium alginate leads to the formation of biocomposite materials with improved physicochemical characteristics 23 47 additionally sericin sodium alginate blend can be covalently crosslinked with synthetic polymers e g polyvinyl alcohol pvoh in order to minimize the solubility of sericin sodium alginate polyvinyl alcohol beads sapvoh and allowing its use in practical applications 48 indeed among the various reagents investigated as covalent crosslinking agents for sericin sodium alginate blend e g pvoh polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and proanthocyanidins the addition of pvoh to the blend promoted greater metallic affinity for res 49 therefore this work goal to investigate the use of sapvoh beads for the biosorption and recovery of dy iii in aqueous medium aiming at a sustainable application for waste protein from the silk yarns processing this study involved the investigation of dy iii biosorption kinetics as well as the main mechanisms involved in dy iii capture by sapvoh beads the selection of the most suitable eluent for regeneration of biosorbent particles and recovery of dy iii in reusability cycles was also performed finally sapvoh beads loaded with dy iii were characterized according to morphological and surface properties composition functional groups thermal behavior and crystalline structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

biocomposite preparation and metallic samples silkworm cocoons were donated by bratac silk spinning londrina br biocomposite preparation was performed according to methodologies adapted from silva et

for 24 h sericin was physically extracted from the cocoons using an autoclave phoenix av 18 br under the following conditions 1 0 kgf cm2 and 120 c for 40 min after extraction the sericin solution was frozen and thawed for the fractionation of high molar weight sericin 20 to 400 kda according to silva et al 50 the sericin alginate biocomposite was prepared by the addition of high molar weight sericin 25 0 g l commercial sodium alginate 20 0 g l and commercial pvoh 5 0 g l the sapvoh blend produced was dripped in a ca ii solution to form the biosorbent beads biocomposite beads were washed oven dried at 40 c for 24 h and thermally crosslinked at 100 c for 24 h metallic samples were prepared from the dissolution of dy no3 3 6h2o in deionized water the concentrations of dy iii and ca ii in solution in the biosorption tests were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas shimadzu aa 7000 japan 2 3 chemical speciation diagrams chemical speciation diagrams for dysprosium and calcium were obtained from the visual minteq 3 1 software with dy no3 3 concentration of 1 50 mmol l and ca no3 2 concentration of 2 25 mmol l 2 4 kinetics assays and modeling dy iii biosorption kinetics in a single component system were performed in batch at room temperature 25 c with about 6 0 g of sapvoh added to 600 ml of metallic solution the kinetics assays were performed under constant magnetic stirring about 200 rpm in different initial concentrations 0 514 to 1 460 mmol l dy iii 10 12 51 defined from metallic speciation see section 3 1 the ph of the solutions was kept around 5 0 and controlled with hno3 0 1 mol l samples were collected at different times 0 630 min dy iii concentration at time t was determined by aas the concentration of dy iii captured on the sapvoh beads q t

the evidence of a possible involvement of the cationic exchange mechanism in the biosorption of res by sapvoh beads 10 12 the kinetic profile of ca ii released and dy iii captured by sapvoh beads was investigated to deepen the conclusions regarding the mechanism for this purpose cationic exchange profiles were obtained for ca ii and dy iii ions under two different conditions 1 deionized water at neutral ph 7 0 and 2 metallic solution of dy iii 1 460 mmol l at ph 5 0 deionized water was used in all tests and ph adjustment and control was performed using an acidic solution hno3 0 1 mol l as in the biosorption kinetics assays a dosage of 10 0 g l of sapvoh beads was used ca ii and dy iii concentrations at time t were determined by aas 2 6 desorption and reuse assays desorption is a crucial step for the effective recovery of res and reuse of biosorbent particles 4 to define the best eluent different elution agents based on ca ii were investigated under neutral and acidic conditions assays were performed from particles contaminated with dy iii at kinetics of 1 460 mmol l using 50 ml of each eluent and 0 5 g of loaded sapvoh beads for 390 min at 200 rpm the desorption performance was determined by the concentration of dy iii released by sapvoh beads on the eluents solutions q el mmol g eq 12 and elution efficiency d eq 13 12 q el c el m v el 13 e q el q e 100 wherein c el is the dy iii load on the eluents solutions mmol l and v el is the volume of eluents solution l in addition reuse cycles were carried out using the most effective eluent among those evaluated in batch system 2 7 biocomposite characterizations the virgin sapvoh beads were already characterized in other studies 12 52 in this study sapvoh dy beads were characterized to describe details of the

metallic speciation of dy and ca chemical speciation diagrams were obtained from the visual minteq 3 1 software to determine the best ph value to be adopted for the biosorptive assays fig 1 this simulation was carried out taking into account besides to dysprosium also calcium which is released by the sapvoh beads during biosorptive assays according to fig 1 dy iii and ca ii are the dominant chemical species up to ph close to 6 and 10 respectively above these ph values the soluble ionic species trivalent dy iii and divalent ca ii are hydrolyzed forming the chemical species dyoh ii and caoh i besides to influencing the metallic speciation ph also governs the dissociation of active functional groups from biosorbent beads 43 the ph value at which the surface charge of the sapvoh beads is zero phzpc was previously determined by costa et al 12 as 4 4 thus when the ph of the metallic solution is greater than the phzpc value the sapvoh beads have a negative charge therefore the ph range adopted in the biosorption assays was ph 4 5 5 0 in this ph range it is possible to guarantee that any dysprosium removal reported was exclusively due to biosorption 3 2 kinetics study fig 2 shows the biosorption kinetics curves of dy iii by sapvoh beads at initial loads of 0 514 to 1 460 mmol l as well as the adjustments of the pseudo first order pfor 53 pseudo second order psor 54 intraparticle diffusion id 55 boyd 56 and external diffusion resistance edr 57 models the adjustable and quality parameters are shown in table 2 from fig 2 a the equilibrium times and dy iii biosorbed amounts at equilibrium were 120 min and 0 048mmol g 210 min and 0 097 mmol g 390 min and 0 139mmol g at dy iii initial loads of 0 514 1 024 and 1 460 mmol l respectively the increase in time to reach equilibrium in the sapvoh dy system may be related to the fact that in higher loads of dy iii the availability of active sites for the capture of dy iii decreases rapidly which slows down the biosorption process costa et al 12 found a similar equilibrium times for the removal of yb iii using the same sapvoh beads at equilibrium yb iii biosorbed amounts in the sapvoh beads were 0 044 to 0 142 mmol g for the yb iii initial loads of 0 5 to 1 5 mmol l respectively in addition dy iii biosorption amount at equilibrium in our sapvoh beads was higher than that other adsorbents reported in literature zheng et al 5 evaluated the dy iii ions capture by imprinted mesoporous silica materials and reached adsorption capacity of 0 137 mmol g koochaki mohammadpour et al 58 found an adsorption capacity of 0 135 mmol g using oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes kegl et al 38 investigated the dy iii ions uptake by γ fe2o3 nh4oh sio2 aptms nanoparticles and found adsorption capacity of 0 143 mmol g emam et al 59 achieved an adsorption capacity of 0 031 mmol g using cy 572 impregnated on kieselguhr on the other hand melnyk et al 60 observed an adsorption capacity of 0 300 mmol g by mesoporous silicas functionalized with phosphonic acid groups biosorption of dy iii by sapvoh beads showed a better fit of pfor model with higher r 2 values and lower aicc values compared to the psor model the smallest gap between the experimental and predicted biosorption amount values corroborates the statement pfor model is based on the hypothesis that the sorption process occurs quickly in the first few minutes and slowly until equilibrium time is reached 53 better fits for the pfor model in bio sorption kinetics of res were also observed by tolba et al 61 with poly carboxymethyl cellulose iftekhar et al 62 with xanthan gum anchored by metal ion and iftekhar et al 63 with gum arabic grafted polyacrylamide based silica additionally early studies of costa et al 12 and costa et al 10 involving the capture of yb iii and la iii by sapvoh beads showed that there was a better fit of pfor and psor models for the sapvoh yb and sapvoh la systems respectively this result suggests the pfor kinetics may be better fit for heavy res e g dy and yb and the psor kinetics for light res e g la according to fig 2 b the id model has three linear regions 64 the external surface adsorption occurs in the first step the second step is the intraparticle diffusion with gradual adsorption inside the adsorbent sites the third step is the final equilibrium stage multilinearity indicates that the three stages are involved in the dy iii biosorption by sapvoh beads the linear fit of the second step was found which implies that the macropore diffusion must contribute to the mass transfer mechanism however as the linear plot did not pass through origin internal diffusion is not considered the process limiting step boyd model fig 2 c confirms the result found by id model the linear plot b t vs t did not pass through the origin which confirms the multilinearity of the dy iii biosorption by sapvoh beads where internal diffusion does not act as the only controlling step according to singh et al 65 for values of the effective diffusion coefficient d i in the range of 10 6 to 10 8 the mass transfer is controlled by external diffusion while values for d i in the range of 10 11 to 10 13 the dominant step in the process is internal diffusion in this study all the d i values obtained are in the order of 10 6 which suggests the diffusion in external film as being the dominant stage in the biosorptive process edr model fig 2 d described adequately the dy iii biosorption achieving highest r 2 0 994 and lowest aicc 269 898 which indicates that the internal diffusion can be neglected and the diffusion in the external film is the process limiting step 3 3 cationic exchange study between dy and ca the profiles of cationic exchange between dy iii and ca ii were investigated as a function of time in a kinetics of 1 460 mmol l dy iii to deepen the conclusions regarding the mechanism fig 3 shown the control experiment kinetic profiles and theoretical cationic exchange obtained for dy iii captured and ca ii released by sapvoh beads the cationic exchange profiles between dy iii and ca ii fig 3 b found are very similar to the profiles described by costa et al 12 and costa et al 10 in these profiles the loads of yb iii and la iii in the metallic solution reduced while there was an increase in the load of the exchangeable metallic ion ca ii released in the solution additionally to investigate whether electroneutrality was satisfied during the cationic exchange the ca ii ion load released in relation to the theoretical was calculated at equilibrium fig 3 c theoretical stoichiometric ratio between dy iii and ca ii is presents by eq 14 as shown in fig 3 c the experimental and theoretical release of ca ii by the sapvoh beads followed the stoichiometric relation in which for each three ca ii displaced two dy iii were biosorbed by sapvoh beads therefore the biosorbent particles presented a natural polymeric cationic exchanger character where the cation exchange plays a fundamental role as a mechanism that governs the biosorption process 14 3 ca ii ads 2 dy iii sol 3 ca ii sol 2 dy iii ads 3 4 desorption and regeneration cycles to investigate the best eluent to desorb dy iii from sapvoh beads six eluents were evaluated in fig 4 a the following elution agents at concentration of 0 1 mol l were selected and compared cacl2 ca no3 2 hcl hno3 cacl2 hcl and ca no3 2 hno3 the highest elution efficiency was achieved using ca no3 2 hno3 98 68 0 45 solution followed by cacl2 hcl 92 34 0 22 hno3 81 54 5 27 hcl 70 01 6 03 ca no3 2 29 47 2 45 and cacl2 24 30 4 35 solutions from the results obtained for the eluent selection assays it was evidenced that using eluent solutions under acidic conditions the elution efficiency was increased in fact acid based eluents showed high recovery of dy iii from different bio adsorbent matrices reported in the literature 28 30 31 36 41 42 59 despite this the mixtures of different calcium sources and acidic media promoted a higher elution efficiency compared to media only under acidic conditions this behavior was also evidenced by costa et al 10 which verified elution efficiency close to 96 of la iii using ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l as eluent under these conditions the calcium based eluent under acidic conditions becomes less aggressive to the biosorbent matrix resulting in less mass loss compared to solutions under solely acidic conditions 66 in fact less mass loss was achieved by eluents based on ca no3 2 hno3 10 24 0 13 and cacl2 hcl 9 98 0 04 compared to acidic means of hno3 14 49 0 04 and hcl 12 97 0 12 therefore the solution of ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l was considered the most suitable for the recovery of dy iii from sapvoh beads and selected for cyclic assays in batch mode the recovery of dy iii and reusability of sapvoh beads were evaluated for four biosorption desorption cycles under magnetic stirring in batch mode fig 4 b there was an increase in dy iii biosorption efficiency from about 94 to about 98 after the first reusability cycle this increase in the capture of dy iii by the regenerated biosorbent beads may have occurred due to the mass loss of sapvoh beads 10 after the first reusability cycle the mass loss of sapvoh beads may have promoted greater availability of previously unavailable active sites for the capture of dy iii by the regenerated biosorbent beads similar behavior was found for the capture of nd iii by composite materials based on alginate silica by wang et al 67 and alginate poly glutamic acid beads by wang et al 68 additionally desorption efficiencies were above 98 in all investigated cycles which confirms that the solution of ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l was also highly efficient for the recovery of dy iii in cyclic assays 3 5 biocomposite characterizations fig 5 a to d show the micrographs obtained for the surface of the sapvoh dy beads with magnification of 35 150 1500 and 5000 times the virgin sapvoh beads had a homogeneous morphological structure and low roughness 12 according to fig 5 a to c the beads loaded with dy iii also showed a homogeneous morphological structure however there was an increase in the roughness of sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii furthermore there was also an increase in the porosity 6 25 and decrease in the specific surface area 0 009 m2 g of the sapvoh dy beads relative to the virgin sapvoh beads table 3 the increase in porosity and roughness of beads loaded with dy iii is in agreement with the low specific surface area found which may have occurred due to the occupation of the beads active sites by dy iii ions additionally fig 5 e shown the elemental composition of sapvoh dy beads compared to virgin sapvoh beads 12 there was a decrease in the composition of ca 10 15 to 5 68 as well as the presence of dy 2 82 in the sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii the compositions of c 31 13 to 34 05 and o 58 72 to 57 45 showed low variation in both particles thus the decrease in ca composition and the presence of dy in the sapvoh dy beads indicate that the biosorption may be related to the cationic exchange mechanism this result confirms the kinetics profiles of cationic exchange between dy iii and ca ii finally x ray mapping in fig 5 f shows that the dy iii ions presented a uniform distribution on the surface of sapvoh dy beads fig 6 a presents the pore distribution by mercury porosimetry for the sapvoh dy beads compared to virgin sapvoh beads 52 the pores distribution profile found for the sapvoh dy beads showed a greater volume of mercury intrusion in regions with pore diameter 50 nm according to sing 69 pore diameters 50 nm are characteristic of macroporous materials this result is also in agreement with the low specific surface area 0 009 m2 g and porosity 6 25 found for the sapvoh dy beads which confirms their typically macroporous structure ft ir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups present in the biocomposite structure besides to the modifications that occurred in the sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii fig 6 b the ft ir spectrum of virgin sapvoh beads was previously described by costa et al 12 in both ft ir spectra a wide band is observed close to 3350 cm 1 amide a due to the overlap of the nh and oh bands santos et al 2019 these stretching vibrations were already identified in the biocomposite components 12 the bands close to 1710 1590 cm 1 amide i 1570 1480 cm 1 amide ii and 1270 1200cm 1 amide iii were also found in the spectra 51 the occurrence of bands related to amides i co and cn ii nh and iii cn are characteristic of bicomposites based on proteins such as sericin 70 additionally the bands close to 1620 and 3436 cm 1 are characteristic of the stretching vibration of the coo sodium alginate and oh sodium alginate and pvoh bands respectively 68 71 comparing the ft ir spectra of virgin sapvoh beads 12 and sapvoh dy beads fig 6 b there is a shift in the bands close to 3429 to 3403 cm 1 oh and 1645 to 1655 cm 1 amide i and coo this behavior indicates the participation of these functional groups in the capture of dy iii and release of ca ii by sapvoh beads from the cationic exchange mechanism between hydroxyl carboxyl groups and dy iii as shown in eqs 15 and 16 2 72 15 3 ro 2 ca ads 2 dy iii sol 2 ro 3 dy ads 3 ca ii sol 16 3 rcoo 2 ca ads 2 dy iii sol 2 rcoo 3 dy ads 3 ca ii sol the thermal behavior of the sapvoh dy beads was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis tg dtg and dta fig 6 c the thermal behavior of virgin sapvoh beads was already inspected by costa et al 52 according to fig 6 c the mass loss between 30 and 100 c is related to dehydration 45 in the range of 200 to 600 c different mass losses are noted which are associated to the thermal decomposition of sericin alginate and pva 52 in sericin there is the degradation of its the amine groups and cleavage of peptide bonds 73 in alginate there is the carbon chains decomposition in sodium carbonate and other products 74 in pva there is the degradation of the main chain 75 at higher temperatures 800 c the behavior of the curves can be related to the pyrolysis sapvoh dy beads showed lower thermal stability as compared with virgin sapvoh beads in fact the mass loss efficiency of 90 78 was found for sapvoh dy beads therefore there was a decrease in the thermal resistance of the particles after dy iii biosorption fig 6 d shows the xrd spectrum for sapvoh dy beads for crystalline structure evaluation the xrd spectrum for virgin sapvoh beads was already characterized by costa et al 52 comparing the xrd spectra it is verified the presence of two peaks the peak near to 19 2 is associated with secondary β sheet structures present in the sericin 76 77 the presence of this secondary structure is characteristic of materials with low water solubility such as sapvoh beads 23 on the other hand the peak near to 43 is associated with polymanuronate and polygururonate present in the alginate 78 furthermore it is noteworthy that there was no change in the crystalline structure of the beads even after capture of dy iii which presented a mostly amorphous character 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that sapoh beads can be successfully used for the uptake of dy iii from aqueous media metallic speciation diagrams showed that the most suitable ph was 4 5 5 0 dy iii biosorption kinetics by sapvoh beads was fast 120 to 390 min described by the pfor model and controlled by external mass transfer the profiles of ca ii release and dy

investigated regeneration cycles achieved biosorption desorption efficiencies around 98 during 4 cycles furthermore characterization analyzes confirmed cationic exchange as the main mechanism involved in dy iii biosorption by sapvoh beads future studies may be performed to evaluate the biosorption isotherms and thermodynamics parameters of dy iii and other res by sapvoh beads in batch biosorption

13287,dysprosium is a critical rare earth metal used in high tech industry its recovery from secondary sources is fundamental in the context of circular economy the use of polymer based biosorbents is promising for this purpose in this work we employ a biocomposite produced from waste protein from silk yarns processing sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol for dysprosium recovery by batch biosorption in aqueous medium the ph range between 4 5 and 5 0 for dysprosium biosorption and calcium release by biosorbent beads was defined by chemical equilibrium diagrams kinetics assays indicated that the equilibrium times and dysprosium biosorbed amounts at equilibrium were 120 to 390 min and 0 048 to 0 139 mmol g respectively kinetic data followed the pseudo first order model and were governed by external diffusion resistance the kinetics profiles also indicated that the cationic exchange between dysprosium and calcium was stoichiometric additionally calcium nitrate nitric acid 0 1 mol l was selected for the reuse cyclic assays due to the higher elution efficiency of dysprosium achieved beads reusability and dysprosium recovery were performed for up to four reuse cycles and achieved biosorption and desorption efficiencies above 94 and 98 respectively the characterizations of beads loaded with dy iii indicated that biosorbent maintained its macroporous structure low porosity and specific surface area lower thermal resistance and amorphous structure finally cationic exchange mechanism was confirmed by techniques of energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy therefore the use of crosslinked sericin alginate beads is the first step towards achieving a sustainable valorization of sericin and recovery of high added value metals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords discontinuous biosorption dysprosium sericin and alginate polyvinyl alcohol cationic exchange mechanism 1 introduction dysprosium dy is a critical rare earth re which has different applications in the high tech industry 1 2 among the most common applications the production of magnets corresponds to about 1 5 of the total consumption of res being on the other hand the activity that most adds value to res 37 of total consumption in terms of value 2 3 res magnets include the permanent magnets smco smco5 or sm2co17 and nd fe b nd2fe14b which may contain different amounts of dy tb and pr and the latter has the highest specific magnetic field known 3 5 these magnets are used in engines hard drives dynamos speakers and turbines for wind power generation 6 8 thus the recovery of res as dy in secondary sources e g industrial effluents and end of life electronic products is of social economic and environmental interest 9 10 the recovery of high value added metals such as dy in waste contributes to the circular economy of this resource 11 12 the content of dy in secondary sources is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the primary sources 13 14 therefore biosorption is a promising unit operation for the recovery of res as dy in dilute aqueous media 14 15 this operation has advantages over traditional operations e g leaching 16 precipitation 17 solvent extraction 18 and ion exchange 19 due to its flexibility and design simplicity no by product generation and efficiency for recovery of res at low loads 20 the choice of the bio adsorbent matrix to be evaluated is also important as it directly influences the efficiency and feasibility of the operation 21 despite its high production cost and difficult reuse activated carbon is the most commonly used commercial adsorbent material for effluent decontamination 22 23 however the use of matrices based on seaweeds 24 plant materials 25 cellulose 26 chitosan 27 30 calcium alginate 31 32 metal organic frameworks 33 graphene oxide 34 pyrolytic carbon materials 35 and silica composites 5 36 42 for bio adsorption and recovery of dy from aqueous media have been extensively investigated in the scientific literature among the agro industrial wastes sericin a globular protein extracted from the silkworm cocoons has been discarded as a residual by product by the silk spinning industry 43 44 however this hydrophilic protein has physicochemical characteristics that make its use in the preparation of biocomposites attractive 45 46 its combination with macromolecules such as sodium alginate leads to the formation of biocomposite materials with improved physicochemical characteristics 23 47 additionally sericin sodium alginate blend can be covalently crosslinked with synthetic polymers e g polyvinyl alcohol pvoh in order to minimize the solubility of sericin sodium alginate polyvinyl alcohol beads sapvoh and allowing its use in practical applications 48 indeed among the various reagents investigated as covalent crosslinking agents for sericin sodium alginate blend e g pvoh polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and proanthocyanidins the addition of pvoh to the blend promoted greater metallic affinity for res 49 therefore this work goal to investigate the use of sapvoh beads for the biosorption and recovery of dy iii in aqueous medium aiming at a sustainable application for waste protein from the silk yarns processing this study involved the investigation of dy iii biosorption kinetics as well as the main mechanisms involved in dy iii capture by sapvoh beads the selection of the most suitable eluent for regeneration of biosorbent particles and recovery of dy iii in reusability cycles was also performed finally sapvoh beads loaded with dy iii were characterized according to morphological and surface properties composition functional groups thermal behavior and crystalline structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

for 24 h sericin was physically extracted from the cocoons using an autoclave phoenix av 18 br under the following conditions 1 0 kgf cm2 and 120 c for 40 min after extraction the sericin solution was frozen and thawed for the fractionation of high molar weight sericin 20 to 400 kda according to silva et al 50 the sericin alginate biocomposite was prepared by the addition of high molar weight sericin 25 0 g l commercial sodium alginate 20 0 g l and commercial pvoh 5 0 g l the sapvoh blend produced was dripped in a ca ii solution to form the biosorbent beads biocomposite beads were washed oven dried at 40 c for 24 h and thermally crosslinked at 100 c for 24 h metallic samples were prepared from the dissolution of dy no3 3 6h2o in deionized water the concentrations of dy iii and ca ii in solution in the biosorption tests were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas shimadzu aa 7000 japan 2 3 chemical speciation diagrams chemical speciation diagrams for dysprosium and calcium were obtained from the visual minteq 3 1 software with dy no3 3 concentration of 1 50 mmol l and ca no3 2 concentration of 2 25 mmol l 2 4 kinetics assays and modeling dy iii biosorption kinetics in a single component system were performed in batch at room temperature 25 c with about 6 0 g of sapvoh added to 600 ml of metallic solution the kinetics assays were performed under constant magnetic stirring about 200 rpm in different initial concentrations 0 514 to 1 460 mmol l dy iii 10 12 51 defined from metallic speciation see section 3 1 the ph of the solutions was kept around 5 0 and controlled with hno3 0 1 mol l samples were collected at different times 0 630 min dy iii concentration at time t was determined by aas the concentration of dy iii captured on the sapvoh beads q t

the evidence of a possible involvement of the cationic exchange mechanism in the biosorption of res by sapvoh beads 10 12 the kinetic profile of ca ii released and dy iii captured by sapvoh beads was investigated to deepen the conclusions regarding the mechanism for this purpose cationic exchange profiles were obtained for ca ii and dy iii ions under two different conditions 1 deionized water at neutral ph 7 0 and 2 metallic solution of dy iii 1 460 mmol l at ph 5 0 deionized water was used in all tests and ph adjustment and control was performed using an acidic solution hno3 0 1 mol l as in the biosorption kinetics assays a dosage of 10 0 g l of sapvoh beads was used ca ii and dy iii concentrations at time t were determined by aas 2 6 desorption and reuse assays desorption is a crucial step for the effective recovery of res and reuse of biosorbent particles 4 to define the best eluent different elution agents based on ca ii were investigated under neutral and acidic conditions assays were performed from particles contaminated with dy iii at kinetics of 1 460 mmol l using 50 ml of each eluent and 0 5 g of loaded sapvoh beads for 390 min at 200 rpm the desorption performance was determined by the concentration of dy iii released by sapvoh beads on the eluents solutions q el mmol g eq 12 and elution efficiency d eq 13 12 q el c el m v el 13 e q el q e 100 wherein c el is the dy iii load on the eluents solutions mmol l and v el is the volume of eluents solution l in addition reuse cycles were carried out using the most effective eluent among those evaluated in batch system 2 7 biocomposite characterizations the virgin sapvoh beads were already characterized in other studies 12 52 in this study sapvoh dy beads were characterized to describe details of the

metallic speciation of dy and ca chemical speciation diagrams were obtained from the visual minteq 3 1 software to determine the best ph value to be adopted for the biosorptive assays fig 1 this simulation was carried out taking into account besides to dysprosium also calcium which is released by the sapvoh beads during biosorptive assays according to fig 1 dy iii and ca ii are the dominant chemical species up to ph close to 6 and 10 respectively above these ph values the soluble ionic species trivalent dy iii and divalent ca ii are hydrolyzed forming the chemical species dyoh ii and caoh i besides to influencing the metallic speciation ph also governs the dissociation of active functional groups from biosorbent beads 43 the ph value at which the surface charge of the sapvoh beads is zero phzpc was previously determined by costa et al 12 as 4 4 thus when the ph of the metallic solution is greater than the phzpc value the sapvoh beads have a negative charge therefore the ph range adopted in the biosorption assays was ph 4 5 5 0 in this ph range it is possible to guarantee that any dysprosium removal reported was exclusively due to biosorption 3 2 kinetics study fig 2 shows the biosorption kinetics curves of dy iii by sapvoh beads at initial loads of 0 514 to 1 460 mmol l as well as the adjustments of the pseudo first order pfor 53 pseudo second order psor 54 intraparticle diffusion id 55 boyd 56 and external diffusion resistance edr 57 models the adjustable and quality parameters are shown in table 2 from fig 2 a the equilibrium times and dy iii biosorbed amounts at equilibrium were 120 min and 0 048mmol g 210 min and 0 097 mmol g 390 min and 0 139mmol g at dy iii initial loads of 0 514 1 024 and 1 460 mmol l respectively the increase in time to reach equilibrium in the sapvoh dy system may be related to the fact that in higher loads of dy iii the availability of active sites for the capture of dy iii decreases rapidly which slows down the biosorption process costa et al 12 found a similar equilibrium times for the removal of yb iii using the same sapvoh beads at equilibrium yb iii biosorbed amounts in the sapvoh beads were 0 044 to 0 142 mmol g for the yb iii initial loads of 0 5 to 1 5 mmol l respectively in addition dy iii biosorption amount at equilibrium in our sapvoh beads was higher than that other adsorbents reported in literature zheng et al 5 evaluated the dy iii ions capture by imprinted mesoporous silica materials and reached adsorption capacity of 0 137 mmol g koochaki mohammadpour et al 58 found an adsorption capacity of 0 135 mmol g using oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes kegl et al 38 investigated the dy iii ions uptake by γ fe2o3 nh4oh sio2 aptms nanoparticles and found adsorption capacity of 0 143 mmol g emam et al 59 achieved an adsorption capacity of 0 031 mmol g using cy 572 impregnated on kieselguhr on the other hand melnyk et al 60 observed an adsorption capacity of 0 300 mmol g by mesoporous silicas functionalized with phosphonic acid groups biosorption of dy iii by sapvoh beads showed a better fit of pfor model with higher r 2 values and lower aicc values compared to the psor model the smallest gap between the experimental and predicted biosorption amount values corroborates the statement pfor model is based on the hypothesis that the sorption process occurs quickly in the first few minutes and slowly until equilibrium time is reached 53 better fits for the pfor model in bio sorption kinetics of res were also observed by tolba et al 61 with poly carboxymethyl cellulose iftekhar et al 62 with xanthan gum anchored by metal ion and iftekhar et al 63 with gum arabic grafted polyacrylamide based silica additionally early studies of costa et al 12 and costa et al 10 involving the capture of yb iii and la iii by sapvoh beads showed that there was a better fit of pfor and psor models for the sapvoh yb and sapvoh la systems respectively this result suggests the pfor kinetics may be better fit for heavy res e g dy and yb and the psor kinetics for light res e g la according to fig 2 b the id model has three linear regions 64 the external surface adsorption occurs in the first step the second step is the intraparticle diffusion with gradual adsorption inside the adsorbent sites the third step is the final equilibrium stage multilinearity indicates that the three stages are involved in the dy iii biosorption by sapvoh beads the linear fit of the second step was found which implies that the macropore diffusion must contribute to the mass transfer mechanism however as the linear plot did not pass through origin internal diffusion is not considered the process limiting step boyd model fig 2 c confirms the result found by id model the linear plot b t vs t did not pass through the origin which confirms the multilinearity of the dy iii biosorption by sapvoh beads where internal diffusion does not act as the only controlling step according to singh et al 65 for values of the effective diffusion coefficient d i in the range of 10 6 to 10 8 the mass transfer is controlled by external diffusion while values for d i in the range of 10 11 to 10 13 the dominant step in the process is internal diffusion in this study all the d i values obtained are in the order of 10 6 which suggests the diffusion in external film as being the dominant stage in the biosorptive process edr model fig 2 d described adequately the dy iii biosorption achieving highest r 2 0 994 and lowest aicc 269 898 which indicates that the internal diffusion can be neglected and the diffusion in the external film is the process limiting step 3 3 cationic exchange study between dy and ca the profiles of cationic exchange between dy iii and ca ii were investigated as a function of time in a kinetics of 1 460 mmol l dy iii to deepen the conclusions regarding the mechanism fig 3 shown the control experiment kinetic profiles and theoretical cationic exchange obtained for dy iii captured and ca ii released by sapvoh beads the cationic exchange profiles between dy iii and ca ii fig 3 b found are very similar to the profiles described by costa et al 12 and costa et al 10 in these profiles the loads of yb iii and la iii in the metallic solution reduced while there was an increase in the load of the exchangeable metallic ion ca ii released in the solution additionally to investigate whether electroneutrality was satisfied during the cationic exchange the ca ii ion load released in relation to the theoretical was calculated at equilibrium fig 3 c theoretical stoichiometric ratio between dy iii and ca ii is presents by eq 14 as shown in fig 3 c the experimental and theoretical release of ca ii by the sapvoh beads followed the stoichiometric relation in which for each three ca ii displaced two dy iii were biosorbed by sapvoh beads therefore the biosorbent particles presented a natural polymeric cationic exchanger character where the cation exchange plays a fundamental role as a mechanism that governs the biosorption process 14 3 ca ii ads 2 dy iii sol 3 ca ii sol 2 dy iii ads 3 4 desorption and regeneration cycles to investigate the best eluent to desorb dy iii from sapvoh beads six eluents were evaluated in fig 4 a the following elution agents at concentration of 0 1 mol l were selected and compared cacl2 ca no3 2 hcl hno3 cacl2 hcl and ca no3 2 hno3 the highest elution efficiency was achieved using ca no3 2 hno3 98 68 0 45 solution followed by cacl2 hcl 92 34 0 22 hno3 81 54 5 27 hcl 70 01 6 03 ca no3 2 29 47 2 45 and cacl2 24 30 4 35 solutions from the results obtained for the eluent selection assays it was evidenced that using eluent solutions under acidic conditions the elution efficiency was increased in fact acid based eluents showed high recovery of dy iii from different bio adsorbent matrices reported in the literature 28 30 31 36 41 42 59 despite this the mixtures of different calcium sources and acidic media promoted a higher elution efficiency compared to media only under acidic conditions this behavior was also evidenced by costa et al 10 which verified elution efficiency close to 96 of la iii using ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l as eluent under these conditions the calcium based eluent under acidic conditions becomes less aggressive to the biosorbent matrix resulting in less mass loss compared to solutions under solely acidic conditions 66 in fact less mass loss was achieved by eluents based on ca no3 2 hno3 10 24 0 13 and cacl2 hcl 9 98 0 04 compared to acidic means of hno3 14 49 0 04 and hcl 12 97 0 12 therefore the solution of ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l was considered the most suitable for the recovery of dy iii from sapvoh beads and selected for cyclic assays in batch mode the recovery of dy iii and reusability of sapvoh beads were evaluated for four biosorption desorption cycles under magnetic stirring in batch mode fig 4 b there was an increase in dy iii biosorption efficiency from about 94 to about 98 after the first reusability cycle this increase in the capture of dy iii by the regenerated biosorbent beads may have occurred due to the mass loss of sapvoh beads 10 after the first reusability cycle the mass loss of sapvoh beads may have promoted greater availability of previously unavailable active sites for the capture of dy iii by the regenerated biosorbent beads similar behavior was found for the capture of nd iii by composite materials based on alginate silica by wang et al 67 and alginate poly glutamic acid beads by wang et al 68 additionally desorption efficiencies were above 98 in all investigated cycles which confirms that the solution of ca no3 2 hno3 0 1 mol l was also highly efficient for the recovery of dy iii in cyclic assays 3 5 biocomposite characterizations fig 5 a to d show the micrographs obtained for the surface of the sapvoh dy beads with magnification of 35 150 1500 and 5000 times the virgin sapvoh beads had a homogeneous morphological structure and low roughness 12 according to fig 5 a to c the beads loaded with dy iii also showed a homogeneous morphological structure however there was an increase in the roughness of sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii furthermore there was also an increase in the porosity 6 25 and decrease in the specific surface area 0 009 m2 g of the sapvoh dy beads relative to the virgin sapvoh beads table 3 the increase in porosity and roughness of beads loaded with dy iii is in agreement with the low specific surface area found which may have occurred due to the occupation of the beads active sites by dy iii ions additionally fig 5 e shown the elemental composition of sapvoh dy beads compared to virgin sapvoh beads 12 there was a decrease in the composition of ca 10 15 to 5 68 as well as the presence of dy 2 82 in the sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii the compositions of c 31 13 to 34 05 and o 58 72 to 57 45 showed low variation in both particles thus the decrease in ca composition and the presence of dy in the sapvoh dy beads indicate that the biosorption may be related to the cationic exchange mechanism this result confirms the kinetics profiles of cationic exchange between dy iii and ca ii finally x ray mapping in fig 5 f shows that the dy iii ions presented a uniform distribution on the surface of sapvoh dy beads fig 6 a presents the pore distribution by mercury porosimetry for the sapvoh dy beads compared to virgin sapvoh beads 52 the pores distribution profile found for the sapvoh dy beads showed a greater volume of mercury intrusion in regions with pore diameter 50 nm according to sing 69 pore diameters 50 nm are characteristic of macroporous materials this result is also in agreement with the low specific surface area 0 009 m2 g and porosity 6 25 found for the sapvoh dy beads which confirms their typically macroporous structure ft ir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups present in the biocomposite structure besides to the modifications that occurred in the sapvoh beads after the capture of dy iii fig 6 b the ft ir spectrum of virgin sapvoh beads was previously described by costa et al 12 in both ft ir spectra a wide band is observed close to 3350 cm 1 amide a due to the overlap of the nh and oh bands santos et al 2019 these stretching vibrations were already identified in the biocomposite components 12 the bands close to 1710 1590 cm 1 amide i 1570 1480 cm 1 amide ii and 1270 1200cm 1 amide iii were also found in the spectra 51 the occurrence of bands related to amides i co and cn ii nh and iii cn are characteristic of bicomposites based on proteins such as sericin 70 additionally the bands close to 1620 and 3436 cm 1 are characteristic of the stretching vibration of the coo sodium alginate and oh sodium alginate and pvoh bands respectively 68 71 comparing the ft ir spectra of virgin sapvoh beads 12 and sapvoh dy beads fig 6 b there is a shift in the bands close to 3429 to 3403 cm 1 oh and 1645 to 1655 cm 1 amide i and coo this behavior indicates the participation of these functional groups in the capture of dy iii and release of ca ii by sapvoh beads from the cationic exchange mechanism between hydroxyl carboxyl groups and dy iii as shown in eqs 15 and 16 2 72 15 3 ro 2 ca ads 2 dy iii sol 2 ro 3 dy ads 3 ca ii sol 16 3 rcoo 2 ca ads 2 dy iii sol 2 rcoo 3 dy ads 3 ca ii sol the thermal behavior of the sapvoh dy beads was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis tg dtg and dta fig 6 c the thermal behavior of virgin sapvoh beads was already inspected by costa et al 52 according to fig 6 c the mass loss between 30 and 100 c is related to dehydration 45 in the range of 200 to 600 c different mass losses are noted which are associated to the thermal decomposition of sericin alginate and pva 52 in sericin there is the degradation of its the amine groups and cleavage of peptide bonds 73 in alginate there is the carbon chains decomposition in sodium carbonate and other products 74 in pva there is the degradation of the main chain 75 at higher temperatures 800 c the behavior of the curves can be related to the pyrolysis sapvoh dy beads showed lower thermal stability as compared with virgin sapvoh beads in fact the mass loss efficiency of 90 78 was found for sapvoh dy beads therefore there was a decrease in the thermal resistance of the particles after dy iii biosorption fig 6 d shows the xrd spectrum for sapvoh dy beads for crystalline structure evaluation the xrd spectrum for virgin sapvoh beads was already characterized by costa et al 52 comparing the xrd spectra it is verified the presence of two peaks the peak near to 19 2 is associated with secondary β sheet structures present in the sericin 76 77 the presence of this secondary structure is characteristic of materials with low water solubility such as sapvoh beads 23 on the other hand the peak near to 43 is associated with polymanuronate and polygururonate present in the alginate 78 furthermore it is noteworthy that there was no change in the crystalline structure of the beads even after capture of dy iii which presented a mostly amorphous character 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that sapoh beads can be successfully used for the uptake of dy iii from aqueous media metallic speciation diagrams showed that the most suitable ph was 4 5 5 0 dy iii biosorption kinetics by sapvoh beads was fast 120 to 390 min described by the pfor model and controlled by external mass transfer the profiles of ca ii release and dy

13288,cotton pulp black liquor cpbl is high alkaline wastewater generated in the production of cotton pulp dreg the recovery of resource and water is of great practical significance for sustainable development of viscose fiber industry in this work precipitation of color biopolymer such as lignin in cpbl was investigated using cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 as precipitants the main influencing factors solid liquid separation performances the characteristics of precipitates and interactions between metal ions and organic compounds were studied the removal of lignin was found in the order fecl3 89 73 alcl3 83 96 cacl2 49 39 mgcl2 42 15 removals of organic matter with molecular weight greater than 100 kda by fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 and mgcl2 precipitation were 94 27 93 77 74 54 and 76 02 respectively the mechanism of biopolymer removal by precipitation was identified as the complexation between high valence metal cations and negatively charged hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in addition metal hydroxides or carbonates would form in situ in the native ph condition and may participate in the removal of lignin by adsorption or enmeshment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cotton pulp black liquor precipitation biopolymer lignin wastewater treatment 1 introduction in chemical fiber plant soda pulping process is widely used in the manufacture of cotton pulp dreg which is the main raw material of viscose fiber during the process a large quantity of cotton pulp black liquor cpbl with high chemical oxygen demand cod 9000 20 000 mg l 1 color ph 12 14 and toxicity is produced which contains lignin hemicellulose cellulose and residual pulping chemicals such as sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 1 2 typically lignin accounts for 40 55 of the total organic matter in cotton pulp black liquor 3 the high molecular weight lignin 10 kda is considered to be responsible for cod and color of cpbl 4 6 therefore it is of great practical significance to investigate a treatment measure that is capable of removing lignin in cpbl lignin is a highly irregular cross linked color biopolymer formed by the copolymerization of three phenylpropane units namely syringyl s guaiacol g and p hydroxyphenyl h through ether bonds and or carbon carbon bonds it contains a variety of functional groups such as methoxy hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups 5 due to the low biodegradability of lignin conventional biochemical treatment is not effective for cpbl purification 4 it has been reported that lignin can be removed by activated carbon adsorption however the larger size of lignin could block the pore structure and the regeneration of saturated activated carbon is a serious problem 7 in alkaline condition phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of lignin are negatively charged and lignin is stable in cpbl due to electrostatic interaction when the ph value of cpbl was adjusted to 3 h neutralizes the negative charge on the surface of lignin which leads to the precipitation of lignin 8 acid precipitation has been widely employed in the separation of lignin from black liquor however this process consumes a large amount of acid and formation of salts impairs the following biological treatment of wastewater besides separation of solid water is very difficult due to the small size and low density of the resulted precipitate sludge 7 consequently it is impossible to recover alkali in cpbl and reuse in the pulping process alternatively lignin can be directly precipitated from cpbl using high valence metal cations in the native ph condition 9 in alkaline condition the functional groups of lignin are deprotonated to produce binding sites which are highly reactive to metal ions 10 precipitation with metal chlorides is expected to be an economic and simple industrial alternative for cpbl purification according to our preliminary study its effectiveness was far greater than that of acid precipitation 11 in addition the potential added value of lignin precipitated by metal cations may make it more economical feasible 9 the choice of metal salt is a crucial factor in the precipitation process nowadays calcium salts have been studied for alkaline precipitation due to its effective lignin removal and low cost 9 11 12 inorganic salts of aluminum and iron are also used in the coagulation of pulping wastewater to remove lignin 2 13 magnesium salts have been used in removal of organic pollutants such as dyes and surfactant from wastewater in alkaline condition 14 15 however to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of systematic study to compare the performance of precipitation of biopolymer with aluminum iron calcium and magnesium chlorides it should be noted that the separation characteristics of the flocs sludge from water are important to implementing the precipitation process which would affect the overall cost and efficiency of the treatment however there is still a dearth of literature concerning the feasibility of precipitate water separation it is well known that high molecular weight organic substances are generally considered to be more easily removed than the low molecular weight compounds 16 however lignin would break down into fragments through the breakage of aryl ether bonds in the pulping process which is separated from the cotton linter and dissolved in cpbl 17 in other words in addition to lignin there are still a large number of small molecule carboxylic acids in cpbl resulting from the oxidation of aliphatic hydroxyl groups 18 compositions and properties of organic matters affect the performance of precipitation 19 20 the functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and phenolic groups in organics may combine with metal ions and result in formation of precipitates the removal behavior analyses of organic matters with different molecular weights are helpful to further understand the precipitation process 21 in this study calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride mgcl2 aluminum chloride alcl3 and ferric chloride fecl3 were explored as precipitants to remove color biopolymer such as lignin from cpbl the precipitation efficiency and precipitate water separation characteristics were investigated performances of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 for cpbl treatment were compared and the interaction mechanism between metal salts and lignin was discussed the removed organic pollutants were identified and the remove behavior of organic pollutants of various molecular weight ranges was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cpbl was collected from a chemical fiber plant in shandong province china the characteristics of cpbl are presented in table 1 all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent ar grade and were used as received 2 2 precipitation experiments the precipitation experiments were performed in 150 ml glass beakers with 100 ml of cpbl under different dosages of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 for comparison initial ph was adjusted by concentrated h2so4 or 0 1 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh solution the mixture was stirred by magnetic force continuously for 5 min at room temperature after stirring a certain amount of the mixture was withdrawn to measure zeta potential and particle size the precipitate was separated from the water by centrifugation and precipitates were analyzed by ftir and thermogravimetry tg after drying the supernatant was taken for determination of cod toc and uv vis light absorbance 2 3 analytical methods the color uv254 and lignin removals were expressed as the decay of absorbance determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 465 nm 254 nm and 280 nm respectively uv254 was used to represent the concentration of macromolecules containing aromatic rings 22 cod was determined by the potassium dichromate oxidation method and toc was measured by toc analyzer analytik jena multi 3100 zeta potential and particle size analysis of mixture were measured using a nanoparticle size and zeta analyzer brook haven 90 pals the sludge volume was recorded in a 100 ml measuring cylinder after settlement the relative molecular weight distribution of biopolymer was determined by membrane filtration method the samples were filtered by membranes with nominal molecular weight cutoff values of 100 kda 10 kda and 600 800 da in sequence the organic compounds in each relative molecular weight range were determined according to the variation of cod before and after filtration for ftir examinations oven dried precipitate was mixed with potassium bromide kbr to prepare the pellet and analyzed with a bruker tensor 27 ftir spectrometer in the wave number range of 400 4000 cm 1 the curves of tg and dsc were recorded by tg and dsc analyzer of mettler toledo the dried precipitate was heated up at the rate of 10 c min 1 from 30 c to 900 c and nitrogen was supplied inside the crumble at a rate of 20 ml min 1 dsc analyzer was applied from 30 c to 500 c dtg curves were obtained by the first derivative calculation of tg curves gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was performed to determine the variation of organics in cpbl before and after the precipitation the samples were extracted with dichloromethane and repeated three times under acidic conditions the extraction liquid was concentrated to 2 ml and anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used to remove residual metal ions and water after silylation derivatization the extraction liquid was analyzed by gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent the chromatography column was an hp 5 capillary column the gc temperature program was as follows 40 c held for 3 min 200 c 5 c min 1 held for 3 min 280 c 10 c min 1 held for 10 min the sample of 1 μm was injected with 1 ml min 1 helium the mass was matched by the nist11 l mass spectrum library 2 4 modeling the species distributions of calcium magnesium aluminum and iron were obtained by analog computation using visual minteq the concentrations of metal ions 0 1 m and corresponding chloride ions were introduced into the modeling program at 25 c the sweep option can run a series of almost identical problems which differ only in the value of one parameter ph was the selected sweep component and the number of problems start value and increment between values were supplied accordingly by calculating the model output the obtained data was used to plot the chart of metal species distribution at different ph values 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation efficacy of metal chloride 3 1 1 effect of chloride dosage the effect of salt dosage was investigated on removals of color uv254 and cod from cpbl with initial ph 13 as shown in fig 1 with the addition of 13 g l 1 cacl2 removals of color uv254 and cod were 65 21 40 69 and 30 83 note that removals of color uv254 and cod remained unchanged even in the higher dosage with mgcl2 removals increased with the increasing mgcl2 dosage and reached the maximum values at the dosage of 20 g l 1 where removals of cod uv254 and color were 27 02 36 71 and 61 4 for alcl3 removals of color uv254 and cod increased with the increasing alcl3 dosage when the dosage was less than 25 g l 1 but decreased with the further increase of alcl3 dosage when alcl3 dosage was 25 g l 1 removals of cod uv254 and color were 58 98 73 22 and 97 29 with the addition of fecl3 residual iron ions affected color of the treated effluent however as shown in fig 1a fecl3 can achieve better cod removal of 63 27 when fecl3 dosage was 20 g l 1 the removal of pollutants did not increase at over dosage of metal chlorides which indicated that the adsorption of biopolymer on metal hydroxides or carbonates was insignificant although metal hydroxides or carbonates would form in situ in native ph condition and may participate in the removal of lignin by adsorption the photographs of cpbl before and after precipitation are shown in fig 1e after the precipitation of alcl3 the color of cpbl was almost completely removed it is worth noting that fecl3 can achieve better decolorization performance if the treated cpbl was adjusted to alkaline condition ph 8 9 to remove residual iron ions and the color removal was 99 05 there was no change in color for the treated cpbl with other metal chlorides if it was adjusted to alkaline condition the uv vis spectra scanned at wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm were applied to further analyze raw cpbl and the treated effluent after 125 folds dilution in order to shield the effect of residual iron in the treated effluent by fecl3 the sample was adjusted to ph 8 9 as shown in fig s1 the uv vis spectra of cpbl exhibited an absorption peak at 263 nm caused by aromatic rings in organic matter structure 4 the intensity of the characteristic absorption peak was decreased after treatment indicating that all metal salts were able to effectively remove aromatic compounds in cpbl and the removal efficiency followed the order of fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 mgcl2 the comparison of cpbl precipitation at the optimal dosage of metal chlorides is shown in table 2 removals of toc and lignin were also used to compare efficacies of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 and results are shown in fig 1d the removal variation trends of toc and lignin were consistent with cod removals and uv vis spectra analyses with addition of 20 g l 1 fecl3 removals of toc and lignin were 64 2 and 89 73 respectively removals of toc and lignin were 50 61 and 83 96 with alcl3 25 g l 1 precipitation the efficacies of cacl2 13 g l 1 and mgcl2 20 g l 1 were relatively close removals of toc and lignin with cacl2 were 22 11 and 49 39 while removals of toc and lignin with mgcl2 were 17 89 and 42 15 the characteristics of cpbl after precipitation at the optimal dosage of metal chlorides are shown in table 1 according to the removal of organic pollutants the treatment efficacy of fecl3 was the best compared to other precipitants 3 1 2 effect of initial ph the ph value of wastewater is expected to have a significant impact on the removal of pollutants which directly affects the existing form of hydrolysate of metal chlorides and pollutants in aqueous solution the optimum ph value of precipitation with cacl2 was 13 12 and the optimum treatment with mgcl2 can be achieved at ph 12 15 however according to the study conducted by mcyotto et al 23 the optimum ph values of alcl3 and fecl3 were about 6 5 in order to compare the effect of ph cpbl was adjusted to ph 6 5 removals of cod and final ph values with alcl3 and fecl3 are presented in fig 2 a it can be seen that ph exhibited a significant impact on the precipitation of cpbl and cod removal by alcl3 and fecl3 all decreased at initial ph 6 5 for alcl3 cod removal dropped from 58 98 to 25 41 when the initial ph value was adjusted from 13 to 6 5 compared with 63 27 of cod removal at ph 13 with fecl3 it was observed cod removal dropped by about 10 at ph 6 5 with the further decrease of ph cod removal by fecl3 decreased to 31 68 ph 4 27 7 ph 3 and 20 58 ph 2 as shown in fig 2b zeta potential of cpbl sludge by acid precipitation at different ph was measured and the results are shown in fig s2 the zeta potential became less negative gradually on the overall trend as the ph value decreased the solid particles were destabilized and reached the isoelectric point at ph 1 5 under acidic conditions h neutralized the negatively charged groups on lignin according to our previous research 11 the optimal uv254 lignin color and cod removals were 17 98 30 71 56 4 and 22 37 at ph 2 with acid precipitation the combined h was not likely to dissociate from lignin at acidic ph which would affect the binding of positively charged hydrolysates of metal ions with lignin at ph 6 5 negatively charged groups of lignin occupied by h may be main binding sites of aluminum so cod removal decreased with alcl3 as the ph value was further reduced more h combined with negatively charged groups of lignin and the active sites that can be combined with the hydrolysate of iron were reduced which led to the reduction of cod removal by fecl3 when the ph was reduced to 2 cod removal with fecl3 was close to that with acid precipitation around 20 which indicated that all the negative charged groups that can be bound to iron ion have been occupied by h and the removal of lignin was resulted from acid precipitation it should be noted that amounts of alcl3 and fecl3 required for treatment decreased at ph 6 5 the dosage of metal chlorides to achieve the optimum removal of pollutants at high alkalinity was much higher at high ph lignin was more negatively charged due to the deprotonation which required more metal salts to neutralize 8 moreover the hydrolysis of metal cations was enhanced at high ph and the positively charged hydrolysates were decreased fig 3 shows effects of salts dosage on the zeta potential the final ph value of cpbl after precipitation and the metal species distribution at different ph values calculated by visual minteq experimental results and modeling were exactly consistent as mentioned earlier for cpbl at ph 13 functional groups of lignin were deprotonated which were highly negatively charged and can adsorb the positively charged metal hydrolysates to neutralize the negative charge of the particles 8 the zeta potential measurement can be used to define the electrostatic interaction of precipitates 24 as shown in fig 3a the zeta potentials became less negative gradually with the increase of salts dosage when the dosage of alcl3 and fecl3 were 25 and 20 g l 1 their zeta potentials were the closest to the isoelectric point and the best removal efficiencies were also achieved the solubility product constants pksp of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 are 32 89 and 37 40 respectively assuming that the metal chlorides were completely dissociated into free ions in cpbl theoretical ph values of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 to form precipitates are about 3 42 and 1 5 respectively based on the corresponding metal salt dosage it is clear that the precipitation of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 could occur in addition to metal ion complexation with biopolymer the positive charge became more dominant after further increasing the salt dosage and pollutant removals may decrease due to the electrostatic repulsion between particles if over dose salts were added these results indicated that charge neutralization played a role in the precipitation of cpbl by alcl3 and fecl3 in the cases of cacl2 and mgcl2 charge neutralization was however not the dominant precipitation mechanism because the zeta potentials remained negative over the whole dosage range the high removal efficiencies by cacl2 and mgcl2 were achieved at the optimal dosage of 13 g l 1 and 20 g l 1 when zeta potentials were about 30 mv which indicated that the negative functional groups may only be partially neutralized although the zeta potential can be reduced to about 10 mv when the dosage of cacl2 was increased to 20 g l 1 it had no impact on the removal efficiency the solubility product constants pksp of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 are 5 26 and 10 74 and theoretical ph values of precipitates formation are about 11 82 and 8 91 respectively it could be believed that the adsorption on precipitated metal hydroxides might play an insignificant role in the pollutant removal process with cacl2 and mgcl2 as removals of pollutants did not increase with the formation of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 on the basis of kinetic point of view the hydrolysis of metal ions would occur immediately with the addition of metal salt 25 the reaction species with organics were actually the hydrolysate of metal cations which were related to ph values as shown in fig 3b the final ph of cpbl remained above 12 with the addition of cacl2 and the dissolved calcium in black liquor existed in the form of ca2 fig 3c which could participate in the complexation with organic matters the final ph of cpbl with the addition of mgcl2 was between 11 and 9 7 and the dissolved magnesium mainly existed in the form of mg2 when the ph was below 11 fig 3d for alcl3 and fecl3 the final ph decreased to acid indicating that more hydrolysates participated in the precipitation process when the dosage of alcl3 was less than 20 g l 1 the dissolved aluminum in cpbl was in the form of al oh 4 and al3 gradually became the dominant species in cpbl with the increase of the dosage with the addition of 10 g l 1 fecl3 the final ph was decreased to 7 1 and the dissolved iron in cpbl was in the form of fe oh 2 when the dosage was further increased to 20 g l 1 the dissolved iron in cpbl was in the form of fe3 and fecl2 it was observed that metal cations were dominant at their optimal dosage indicating that the precipitation could be attributed to the complexation of metal ions with negative charged oxygen containing groups of biopolymers 3 2 characterization of precipitates 3 2 1 particle size of precipitate and solid liquid separation performance in the process of precipitation the difficulty of flocs separation from water determines the feasibility and application prospect in order to evaluate the performance of solid liquid separation the particle size distribution of precipitates the feasibility of centrifugal separation and settling were studied the size distribution of flocs formed is important since it determines the minimum pore size of the filter required usually larger flocs would have better filtration performance according to the fluctuation of light intensity caused by brownian motion of particles in suspension the particle size distribution of precipitates produced by various metal chlorides was compared as shown in fig 4 the particle size in the suspension with cacl2 was larger than that with other salts the particle size of floc was 13 86 μm by cacl2 followed by mgcl2 with 10 05 μm of the particle size by contrast particle sizes precipitated by alcl3 and fecl3 were quite smaller the particle sizes were 1 67 μm and 0 64 μm respectively the separation results of the suspension after a period of settlement time are shown in table 1 all the suspensions showed little settling in 6 h and even after 48 h of settlement which may be due to the small particle size and the increased viscosity of black liquor with the addition of metal salts the flocs produced were difficult to separate from water by sedimentation compared with other suspensions the settling speed of the flocs produced with addition of cacl2 was relatively fast due to the larger particles the particles formed by fecl3 precipitation were the smallest and the separation of precipitate from water was the most difficult as shown in fig 5 flocs produced by cacl2 and mgcl2 exhibited the better centrifugal separation performance when the rotational speed was 2000 r min the solid liquid separation can be realized which was relatively easy to achieve in industry however flocs produced by alcl3 and fecl3 were relatively difficult to be centrifugally separated from water which required at least 3000 4000 r min 3 2 2 ftir spectra of precipitates ftir analyses of precipitates with cacl2 ca precipitate mgcl2 mg precipitate alcl3 al precipitate and fecl3 fe precipitate are shown in fig 6 the precipitates were obtained with optimal dosages of salts at initial ph of 13 since acid precipitation can obtain relatively high purity lignin the spectra of precipitate produced by acid precipitation h precipitate ph 2 were compared with those of metal precipitates aiming to understand the combination of metal and lignin all spectra exhibited a broad and strong absorption peak at the 3396 or 3447 cm 1 which was assigned to h bonded hydroxyl groups including cooh groups 26 the peaks in the range of 2820 2930 cm 1 were for aliphatic ch stretching vibrations suggesting the existence of ch3 and ch2 groups 27 the absorptions of 1631 and 1516 cm 1 reflected the contribution of the cc stretching of aromatic rings 28 29 the absorptions observed at 1465 cm 1 in the spectra could be due to the ch stretching of methylene methyl groups of aliphatic chains the peak at 1400 cm 1 noted in the spectra may correspond to the oh deformation and stretching vibrations of phenolic hydroxyl or the ch deformation of ch3 and ch2 groups 26 the added h in acidic precipitation combined with coo which caused the existence of the characteristic peak at 1710 cm 1 the peak of h precipitate at 1710 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of carbonyl groups which was absent in the spectra of metal precipitates 30 in the spectra of metal precipitates two co bonds showed symmetric stretching vibrations around 1400 cm 1 and antisymmetric stretching vibrations in the region of 1550 1650 cm 1 the lone electron pair of anionic binding sites combined with the empty orbital of metal cations to form stable coo metal complex 31 the spectra corresponding to h sludge displayed a distinct characteristic lignin band at 1128 cm 1 which was caused by co stretching of phenol and ether bonds between lignin monomers 29 as for the spectra of metal precipitates the band at 1128 cm 1 was not found since the presence of metal atom hindered the stretching of co indicating that phenolate ions could be the binding site for the complexation of metal cations in the spectra of ca sludge and mg sludge the bands at 870 cm 1 and 860 cm 1 were found which were probably attributed to the presence of co3 2 32 3 2 3 thermal analyses of precipitates the weight of precipitate was measured after drying and results are shown in table 3 the precipitate was composed of organic matter and compounds formed by precipitant due to over dosage the weight of precipitate was in the order fe precipitate al precipitate ca precipitate mg precipitate h precipitate tg dgt dsc curves of precipitates in n2 atmosphere at heating rate of 10 c min 1 were recorded tg curves of precipitates are shown in fig 7 and dtg dsc curves of precipitates are shown in fig s3 table 3 summarizes the weight loss of samples and corresponding temperature ranges all samples exhibited thermal mass loss 1 66 14 51 from initial temperature to 150 c due to the evaporation of water which was related to the existence of hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 33 34 in comparison much more significant mass loss of ca precipitate occurred at this stage which could correspond to more hydrophilic groups contained in ca precipitate the mass loss at 150 200 c was probably due to the decomposition of small molecular organic compounds such as fatty acids and carbohydrates it can be seen from the dtg curve of h precipitate that there were two peaks for lignin which were around 250 c and 350 c respectively the first mass loss peak can be attributed to dehydration of hydroxyl groups and the breakage of ether bond between aromatic monomers from 300 c the aliphatic side chain began to break from the aromatic ring followed by methyl aryl ether bond and carbon carbon cleavage 300 400 c 33 similar characteristic peak was also observed in curves of metal precipitates in the temperature range of 150 650 c mass loses were 19 17 43 48 42 38 and 34 47 for precipitates generated by cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 respectively the precipitate was a kind of waste with complicated components whose main ingredients included inorganic salts hydroxides lignin and its degradation products the pyrolysis of lignin between 300 and 400 c is an exothermic reaction 35 but the dsc curve of mg precipitate showed that the peak at 380 c was a strong endothermic peak which indicated the mass loss of mg precipitate at this stage may not be caused by the pyrolysis of lignin it could be attributed to the decomposition of mgco3 and mg oh 2 the reaction temperature range of the last stage was above 650 c which was regarded as condensation of char and decomposition of inorganic salt such as caco3 36 the ultimate residue mass percentages of metal precipitates at 900 c were 41 66 43 96 of their original samples in comparison the ultimate residue mass percentage of the precipitate obtained by acid precipitation was relatively low about 27 62 based on thermal analyses of precipitates ca oh 2 caco3 mg oh 2 and mgco3 may exist in precipitates the hydroxide and carbonate precipitate would be produced in situ with the addition of cacl2 and mgcl2 the impurity could be absorbed by surface complexation and enmeshed in the precipitate 3 3 pollutant removal behavior gc ms was exploited to identify the removed pollutant in the precipitation process and variations of peak intensity of compounds in cpbl before and after treatment were compared as shown in fig 8 the precipitation can effectively remove organic compounds in cpbl it was observed that peak intensities of butanoic acid and its derivatives hexanoic acid benzoic acid and some long chain organic acids including hexadecanoic acid and octadecadienoic acid were greatly reduced or even disappeared after the precipitation in addition 3 methoxy 4 hydroxybenzoic acid was also effectively removed during the precipitation which is the structural unit of guaiacyl lignin to further explore the remove behavior of pollutants before and after precipitation process the molecular weight distribution of cpbl samples before and after the precipitation was analyzed the molecular weight distribution of cpbl before and after treatment with salts is shown in fig 9 a it can be seen that organic molecules 600 800 da accounted for 68 04 of the total organics content in cpbl after the precipitation this proportion in all samples increased significantly indicating that the remove of macromolecular organic matter was more effective cod removal with different molecular weight of organic pollutants during the precipitation is shown in fig 9b all samples showed higher cod removals for macromolecular organics with molecular weight 100 kda compared with other molecular weight ranges the removal of cod decreased with the decrease of molecular weight of organics mgcl2 behaved like cacl2 but had relatively lower removal efficiency in the range of 10 k 100 kda which was 45 22 the removal efficiency of alcl3 and fecl3 for various molecular weight ranges was obviously higher than that of cacl2 and mgcl2 especially for organic matter with molecular weight 10 kda the highest cod removal 90 was obtained by fecl3 in all molecular weight ranges especially for organic matter with molecular weight 10 kda alcl3 and fecl3 had similar cod removal in the range of 100 kda and 600 800 da but alcl3 was less effective than fecl3 in the range of 10 100 kda and 600 800 da 10 kda which were 60 99 and 45 2 respectively in accordance with the literature the complexation of metal cations with organics can be affected by several factors such as molecular weight functional groups of organic matters and properties of metal cations 37 the most important functional groups that can potentially be complexed by metal ions are the carboxyl and phenolic groups in lignin 9 the bonding occurs by supplying electron pairs from an electron donor oxygen bearing functional group to an electron pair acceptor metal ion 31 37 note that the high affinity of these two groups for cations was highly dependent on the ph value at ph 4 4 the carboxyl group which is more acidic than the phenolic group begins to dissociate while at higher ph 9 5 the phenolic group is involved in more complexation 37 for the same kind of organics high molecular weight organics possess more ligand groups to combine with metal ions showing a higher affinity with metal ions over smaller molecular weight organics at the same solution conditions 38 40 a few studies have previously indicated that high molecular weight organics showed a higher affinity with metal ions than smaller molecular weight compounds 38 41 lakshman et al provided evidence about the effect of molecular weight of organic matter on binding affinity to metal ion by comparing the conditional stability constant log k 38 their study showed that the log k increased as molecular weight increased suggesting that high molecular weight fractions had stronger binding affinity than small molecular weight fractions similar trend had also been documented by chen et al who suggested that the susceptibility of macromolecules to strong metal binding may be attributed to their higher aromaticity or diversity of functional groups 41 compared with trivalent cations bivalent metal ion such as ca2 and mg2 exhibited relatively weak bonding with biopolymer such as lignin 37 40 so their efficacies were poorer than those of fe3 and al3 al3 predominantly combined with carboxylic sites rather than phenolic sites while fe3 exhibited the similar affinity with carboxylic and phenolic sites 37 so alcl3 was less effective than fecl3 possibly as there were phenols with molecular weight range of approximately 600 da to 100 kda in cpbl which cannot complex with al3 but can complex with fe3 precipitation mechanism of lignin by metal chlorides can be summarized based on above investigations for dissolved ca2 and mg2 in alkaline condition and high hydrophilic groups of lignin can be combined with metal cations by complexation in the cases of alcl3 and fecl3 the cations of iron and aluminum reacted with oh preferentially which caused the ph value of cpbl was greatly reduced with the increase of alcl3 and fecl3 dosage more al3 and fe3 could neutralize the negative charge on lignin and the complexes formed would precipitate out of the solution by charge neutralization correspondingly there was a gradual decline in the zeta potential reaching isoelectric point as the best removal was achieved which strongly supported complexation between the anion binding sites on lignin and metal cations as mentioned above most of the dosed salts existed in the form of metal cations as the optimum removals were reached although h produced by the hydrolysis competed with metal cations for anion binding sites on lignin it is clear that al3 and fe3 were more reactive the pollutant removals with alcl3 and fecl3 were much higher than those by acid precipitation when the dosage of metal salt was higher than the optimal dosage the complexes had a charge reversal which had a negative impact on pollutant removal as well known when metal salt dissolves into the aqueous solution a series of hydrolysates would be produced the freshly formed hydroxide has high surface free energy with large specific surface area which can absorb the negatively charged lignin in aqueous solution 42 due to the limited solubility of metal hydroxide higher dosage is conducive to the generation of amorphous hydroxide precipitation in which the impurity can be enmeshed and absorbed in cationic metal hydroxides 43 therefore the removal of lignin may also involve a combination of charge neutralization as well as adsorption and enmeshment of metal hydroxides and carbonates the possible binding sites of complexation could be carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of biopolymers 9 12 as mentioned earlier the adsorption of biopolymer on metal hydroxides or carbonates was insignificant conclusions the precipitation was used to remove color biopolymers such as lignin in cpbl and performances of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 as precipitants were systematically compared the results exhibited that precipitation could effectively remove lignin and the removal efficiency showed a trend of fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 mgcl2 analyses of removed pollutants showed that macromolecular organics were more easily removed by the precipitation the removal mechanism of biopolymers was mainly attributed to the complexation of metal cations with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13288,cotton pulp black liquor cpbl is high alkaline wastewater generated in the production of cotton pulp dreg the recovery of resource and water is of great practical significance for sustainable development of viscose fiber industry in this work precipitation of color biopolymer such as lignin in cpbl was investigated using cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 as precipitants the main influencing factors solid liquid separation performances the characteristics of precipitates and interactions between metal ions and organic compounds were studied the removal of lignin was found in the order fecl3 89 73 alcl3 83 96 cacl2 49 39 mgcl2 42 15 removals of organic matter with molecular weight greater than 100 kda by fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 and mgcl2 precipitation were 94 27 93 77 74 54 and 76 02 respectively the mechanism of biopolymer removal by precipitation was identified as the complexation between high valence metal cations and negatively charged hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in addition metal hydroxides or carbonates would form in situ in the native ph condition and may participate in the removal of lignin by adsorption or enmeshment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cotton pulp black liquor precipitation biopolymer lignin wastewater treatment 1 introduction in chemical fiber plant soda pulping process is widely used in the manufacture of cotton pulp dreg which is the main raw material of viscose fiber during the process a large quantity of cotton pulp black liquor cpbl with high chemical oxygen demand cod 9000 20 000 mg l 1 color ph 12 14 and toxicity is produced which contains lignin hemicellulose cellulose and residual pulping chemicals such as sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium carbonate na2co3 1 2 typically lignin accounts for 40 55 of the total organic matter in cotton pulp black liquor 3 the high molecular weight lignin 10 kda is considered to be responsible for cod and color of cpbl 4 6 therefore it is of great practical significance to investigate a treatment measure that is capable of removing lignin in cpbl lignin is a highly irregular cross linked color biopolymer formed by the copolymerization of three phenylpropane units namely syringyl s guaiacol g and p hydroxyphenyl h through ether bonds and or carbon carbon bonds it contains a variety of functional groups such as methoxy hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups 5 due to the low biodegradability of lignin conventional biochemical treatment is not effective for cpbl purification 4 it has been reported that lignin can be removed by activated carbon adsorption however the larger size of lignin could block the pore structure and the regeneration of saturated activated carbon is a serious problem 7 in alkaline condition phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of lignin are negatively charged and lignin is stable in cpbl due to electrostatic interaction when the ph value of cpbl was adjusted to 3 h neutralizes the negative charge on the surface of lignin which leads to the precipitation of lignin 8 acid precipitation has been widely employed in the separation of lignin from black liquor however this process consumes a large amount of acid and formation of salts impairs the following biological treatment of wastewater besides separation of solid water is very difficult due to the small size and low density of the resulted precipitate sludge 7 consequently it is impossible to recover alkali in cpbl and reuse in the pulping process alternatively lignin can be directly precipitated from cpbl using high valence metal cations in the native ph condition 9 in alkaline condition the functional groups of lignin are deprotonated to produce binding sites which are highly reactive to metal ions 10 precipitation with metal chlorides is expected to be an economic and simple industrial alternative for cpbl purification according to our preliminary study its effectiveness was far greater than that of acid precipitation 11 in addition the potential added value of lignin precipitated by metal cations may make it more economical feasible 9 the choice of metal salt is a crucial factor in the precipitation process nowadays calcium salts have been studied for alkaline precipitation due to its effective lignin removal and low cost 9 11 12 inorganic salts of aluminum and iron are also used in the coagulation of pulping wastewater to remove lignin 2 13 magnesium salts have been used in removal of organic pollutants such as dyes and surfactant from wastewater in alkaline condition 14 15 however to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of systematic study to compare the performance of precipitation of biopolymer with aluminum iron calcium and magnesium chlorides it should be noted that the separation characteristics of the flocs sludge from water are important to implementing the precipitation process which would affect the overall cost and efficiency of the treatment however there is still a dearth of literature concerning the feasibility of precipitate water separation it is well known that high molecular weight organic substances are generally considered to be more easily removed than the low molecular weight compounds 16 however lignin would break down into fragments through the breakage of aryl ether bonds in the pulping process which is separated from the cotton linter and dissolved in cpbl 17 in other words in addition to lignin there are still a large number of small molecule carboxylic acids in cpbl resulting from the oxidation of aliphatic hydroxyl groups 18 compositions and properties of organic matters affect the performance of precipitation 19 20 the functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl and phenolic groups in organics may combine with metal ions and result in formation of precipitates the removal behavior analyses of organic matters with different molecular weights are helpful to further understand the precipitation process 21 in this study calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride mgcl2 aluminum chloride alcl3 and ferric chloride fecl3 were explored as precipitants to remove color biopolymer such as lignin from cpbl the precipitation efficiency and precipitate water separation characteristics were investigated performances of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 for cpbl treatment were compared and the interaction mechanism between metal salts and lignin was discussed the removed organic pollutants were identified and the remove behavior of organic pollutants of various molecular weight ranges was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cpbl was collected from a chemical fiber plant in shandong province china the characteristics of cpbl are presented in table 1 all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent ar grade and were used as received 2 2 precipitation experiments the precipitation experiments were performed in 150 ml glass beakers with 100 ml of cpbl under different dosages of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 for comparison initial ph was adjusted by concentrated h2so4 or 0 1 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh solution the mixture was stirred by magnetic force continuously for 5 min at room temperature after stirring a certain amount of the mixture was withdrawn to measure zeta potential and particle size the precipitate was separated from the water by centrifugation and precipitates were analyzed by ftir and thermogravimetry tg after drying the supernatant was taken for determination of cod toc and uv vis light absorbance 2 3 analytical methods the color uv254 and lignin removals were expressed as the decay of absorbance determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 465 nm 254 nm and 280 nm respectively uv254 was used to represent the concentration of macromolecules containing aromatic rings 22 cod was determined by the potassium dichromate oxidation method and toc was measured by toc analyzer analytik jena multi 3100 zeta potential and particle size analysis of mixture were measured using a nanoparticle size and zeta analyzer brook haven 90 pals the sludge volume was recorded in a 100 ml measuring cylinder after settlement the relative molecular weight distribution of biopolymer was determined by membrane filtration method the samples were filtered by membranes with nominal molecular weight cutoff values of 100 kda 10 kda and 600 800 da in sequence the organic compounds in each relative molecular weight range were determined according to the variation of cod before and after filtration for ftir examinations oven dried precipitate was mixed with potassium bromide kbr to prepare the pellet and analyzed with a bruker tensor 27 ftir spectrometer in the wave number range of 400 4000 cm 1 the curves of tg and dsc were recorded by tg and dsc analyzer of mettler toledo the dried precipitate was heated up at the rate of 10 c min 1 from 30 c to 900 c and nitrogen was supplied inside the crumble at a rate of 20 ml min 1 dsc analyzer was applied from 30 c to 500 c dtg curves were obtained by the first derivative calculation of tg curves gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was performed to determine the variation of organics in cpbl before and after the precipitation the samples were extracted with dichloromethane and repeated three times under acidic conditions the extraction liquid was concentrated to 2 ml and anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used to remove residual metal ions and water after silylation derivatization the extraction liquid was analyzed by gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent the chromatography column was an hp 5 capillary column the gc temperature program was as follows 40 c held for 3 min 200 c 5 c min 1 held for 3 min 280 c 10 c min 1 held for 10 min the sample of 1 μm was injected with 1 ml min 1 helium the mass was matched by the nist11 l mass spectrum library 2 4 modeling the species distributions of calcium magnesium aluminum and iron were obtained by analog computation using visual minteq the concentrations of metal ions 0 1 m and corresponding chloride ions were introduced into the modeling program at 25 c the sweep option can run a series of almost identical problems which differ only in the value of one parameter ph was the selected sweep component and the number of problems start value and increment between values were supplied accordingly by calculating the model output the obtained data was used to plot the chart of metal species distribution at different ph values 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation efficacy of metal chloride 3 1 1 effect of chloride dosage the effect of salt dosage was investigated on removals of color uv254 and cod from cpbl with initial ph 13 as shown in fig 1 with the addition of 13 g l 1 cacl2 removals of color uv254 and cod were 65 21 40 69 and 30 83 note that removals of color uv254 and cod remained unchanged even in the higher dosage with mgcl2 removals increased with the increasing mgcl2 dosage and reached the maximum values at the dosage of 20 g l 1 where removals of cod uv254 and color were 27 02 36 71 and 61 4 for alcl3 removals of color uv254 and cod increased with the increasing alcl3 dosage when the dosage was less than 25 g l 1 but decreased with the further increase of alcl3 dosage when alcl3 dosage was 25 g l 1 removals of cod uv254 and color were 58 98 73 22 and 97 29 with the addition of fecl3 residual iron ions affected color of the treated effluent however as shown in fig 1a fecl3 can achieve better cod removal of 63 27 when fecl3 dosage was 20 g l 1 the removal of pollutants did not increase at over dosage of metal chlorides which indicated that the adsorption of biopolymer on metal hydroxides or carbonates was insignificant although metal hydroxides or carbonates would form in situ in native ph condition and may participate in the removal of lignin by adsorption the photographs of cpbl before and after precipitation are shown in fig 1e after the precipitation of alcl3 the color of cpbl was almost completely removed it is worth noting that fecl3 can achieve better decolorization performance if the treated cpbl was adjusted to alkaline condition ph 8 9 to remove residual iron ions and the color removal was 99 05 there was no change in color for the treated cpbl with other metal chlorides if it was adjusted to alkaline condition the uv vis spectra scanned at wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm were applied to further analyze raw cpbl and the treated effluent after 125 folds dilution in order to shield the effect of residual iron in the treated effluent by fecl3 the sample was adjusted to ph 8 9 as shown in fig s1 the uv vis spectra of cpbl exhibited an absorption peak at 263 nm caused by aromatic rings in organic matter structure 4 the intensity of the characteristic absorption peak was decreased after treatment indicating that all metal salts were able to effectively remove aromatic compounds in cpbl and the removal efficiency followed the order of fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 mgcl2 the comparison of cpbl precipitation at the optimal dosage of metal chlorides is shown in table 2 removals of toc and lignin were also used to compare efficacies of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 and results are shown in fig 1d the removal variation trends of toc and lignin were consistent with cod removals and uv vis spectra analyses with addition of 20 g l 1 fecl3 removals of toc and lignin were 64 2 and 89 73 respectively removals of toc and lignin were 50 61 and 83 96 with alcl3 25 g l 1 precipitation the efficacies of cacl2 13 g l 1 and mgcl2 20 g l 1 were relatively close removals of toc and lignin with cacl2 were 22 11 and 49 39 while removals of toc and lignin with mgcl2 were 17 89 and 42 15 the characteristics of cpbl after precipitation at the optimal dosage of metal chlorides are shown in table 1 according to the removal of organic pollutants the treatment efficacy of fecl3 was the best compared to other precipitants 3 1 2 effect of initial ph the ph value of wastewater is expected to have a significant impact on the removal of pollutants which directly affects the existing form of hydrolysate of metal chlorides and pollutants in aqueous solution the optimum ph value of precipitation with cacl2 was 13 12 and the optimum treatment with mgcl2 can be achieved at ph 12 15 however according to the study conducted by mcyotto et al 23 the optimum ph values of alcl3 and fecl3 were about 6 5 in order to compare the effect of ph cpbl was adjusted to ph 6 5 removals of cod and final ph values with alcl3 and fecl3 are presented in fig 2 a it can be seen that ph exhibited a significant impact on the precipitation of cpbl and cod removal by alcl3 and fecl3 all decreased at initial ph 6 5 for alcl3 cod removal dropped from 58 98 to 25 41 when the initial ph value was adjusted from 13 to 6 5 compared with 63 27 of cod removal at ph 13 with fecl3 it was observed cod removal dropped by about 10 at ph 6 5 with the further decrease of ph cod removal by fecl3 decreased to 31 68 ph 4 27 7 ph 3 and 20 58 ph 2 as shown in fig 2b zeta potential of cpbl sludge by acid precipitation at different ph was measured and the results are shown in fig s2 the zeta potential became less negative gradually on the overall trend as the ph value decreased the solid particles were destabilized and reached the isoelectric point at ph 1 5 under acidic conditions h neutralized the negatively charged groups on lignin according to our previous research 11 the optimal uv254 lignin color and cod removals were 17 98 30 71 56 4 and 22 37 at ph 2 with acid precipitation the combined h was not likely to dissociate from lignin at acidic ph which would affect the binding of positively charged hydrolysates of metal ions with lignin at ph 6 5 negatively charged groups of lignin occupied by h may be main binding sites of aluminum so cod removal decreased with alcl3 as the ph value was further reduced more h combined with negatively charged groups of lignin and the active sites that can be combined with the hydrolysate of iron were reduced which led to the reduction of cod removal by fecl3 when the ph was reduced to 2 cod removal with fecl3 was close to that with acid precipitation around 20 which indicated that all the negative charged groups that can be bound to iron ion have been occupied by h and the removal of lignin was resulted from acid precipitation it should be noted that amounts of alcl3 and fecl3 required for treatment decreased at ph 6 5 the dosage of metal chlorides to achieve the optimum removal of pollutants at high alkalinity was much higher at high ph lignin was more negatively charged due to the deprotonation which required more metal salts to neutralize 8 moreover the hydrolysis of metal cations was enhanced at high ph and the positively charged hydrolysates were decreased fig 3 shows effects of salts dosage on the zeta potential the final ph value of cpbl after precipitation and the metal species distribution at different ph values calculated by visual minteq experimental results and modeling were exactly consistent as mentioned earlier for cpbl at ph 13 functional groups of lignin were deprotonated which were highly negatively charged and can adsorb the positively charged metal hydrolysates to neutralize the negative charge of the particles 8 the zeta potential measurement can be used to define the electrostatic interaction of precipitates 24 as shown in fig 3a the zeta potentials became less negative gradually with the increase of salts dosage when the dosage of alcl3 and fecl3 were 25 and 20 g l 1 their zeta potentials were the closest to the isoelectric point and the best removal efficiencies were also achieved the solubility product constants pksp of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 are 32 89 and 37 40 respectively assuming that the metal chlorides were completely dissociated into free ions in cpbl theoretical ph values of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 to form precipitates are about 3 42 and 1 5 respectively based on the corresponding metal salt dosage it is clear that the precipitation of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 could occur in addition to metal ion complexation with biopolymer the positive charge became more dominant after further increasing the salt dosage and pollutant removals may decrease due to the electrostatic repulsion between particles if over dose salts were added these results indicated that charge neutralization played a role in the precipitation of cpbl by alcl3 and fecl3 in the cases of cacl2 and mgcl2 charge neutralization was however not the dominant precipitation mechanism because the zeta potentials remained negative over the whole dosage range the high removal efficiencies by cacl2 and mgcl2 were achieved at the optimal dosage of 13 g l 1 and 20 g l 1 when zeta potentials were about 30 mv which indicated that the negative functional groups may only be partially neutralized although the zeta potential can be reduced to about 10 mv when the dosage of cacl2 was increased to 20 g l 1 it had no impact on the removal efficiency the solubility product constants pksp of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 are 5 26 and 10 74 and theoretical ph values of precipitates formation are about 11 82 and 8 91 respectively it could be believed that the adsorption on precipitated metal hydroxides might play an insignificant role in the pollutant removal process with cacl2 and mgcl2 as removals of pollutants did not increase with the formation of ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 on the basis of kinetic point of view the hydrolysis of metal ions would occur immediately with the addition of metal salt 25 the reaction species with organics were actually the hydrolysate of metal cations which were related to ph values as shown in fig 3b the final ph of cpbl remained above 12 with the addition of cacl2 and the dissolved calcium in black liquor existed in the form of ca2 fig 3c which could participate in the complexation with organic matters the final ph of cpbl with the addition of mgcl2 was between 11 and 9 7 and the dissolved magnesium mainly existed in the form of mg2 when the ph was below 11 fig 3d for alcl3 and fecl3 the final ph decreased to acid indicating that more hydrolysates participated in the precipitation process when the dosage of alcl3 was less than 20 g l 1 the dissolved aluminum in cpbl was in the form of al oh 4 and al3 gradually became the dominant species in cpbl with the increase of the dosage with the addition of 10 g l 1 fecl3 the final ph was decreased to 7 1 and the dissolved iron in cpbl was in the form of fe oh 2 when the dosage was further increased to 20 g l 1 the dissolved iron in cpbl was in the form of fe3 and fecl2 it was observed that metal cations were dominant at their optimal dosage indicating that the precipitation could be attributed to the complexation of metal ions with negative charged oxygen containing groups of biopolymers 3 2 characterization of precipitates 3 2 1 particle size of precipitate and solid liquid separation performance in the process of precipitation the difficulty of flocs separation from water determines the feasibility and application prospect in order to evaluate the performance of solid liquid separation the particle size distribution of precipitates the feasibility of centrifugal separation and settling were studied the size distribution of flocs formed is important since it determines the minimum pore size of the filter required usually larger flocs would have better filtration performance according to the fluctuation of light intensity caused by brownian motion of particles in suspension the particle size distribution of precipitates produced by various metal chlorides was compared as shown in fig 4 the particle size in the suspension with cacl2 was larger than that with other salts the particle size of floc was 13 86 μm by cacl2 followed by mgcl2 with 10 05 μm of the particle size by contrast particle sizes precipitated by alcl3 and fecl3 were quite smaller the particle sizes were 1 67 μm and 0 64 μm respectively the separation results of the suspension after a period of settlement time are shown in table 1 all the suspensions showed little settling in 6 h and even after 48 h of settlement which may be due to the small particle size and the increased viscosity of black liquor with the addition of metal salts the flocs produced were difficult to separate from water by sedimentation compared with other suspensions the settling speed of the flocs produced with addition of cacl2 was relatively fast due to the larger particles the particles formed by fecl3 precipitation were the smallest and the separation of precipitate from water was the most difficult as shown in fig 5 flocs produced by cacl2 and mgcl2 exhibited the better centrifugal separation performance when the rotational speed was 2000 r min the solid liquid separation can be realized which was relatively easy to achieve in industry however flocs produced by alcl3 and fecl3 were relatively difficult to be centrifugally separated from water which required at least 3000 4000 r min 3 2 2 ftir spectra of precipitates ftir analyses of precipitates with cacl2 ca precipitate mgcl2 mg precipitate alcl3 al precipitate and fecl3 fe precipitate are shown in fig 6 the precipitates were obtained with optimal dosages of salts at initial ph of 13 since acid precipitation can obtain relatively high purity lignin the spectra of precipitate produced by acid precipitation h precipitate ph 2 were compared with those of metal precipitates aiming to understand the combination of metal and lignin all spectra exhibited a broad and strong absorption peak at the 3396 or 3447 cm 1 which was assigned to h bonded hydroxyl groups including cooh groups 26 the peaks in the range of 2820 2930 cm 1 were for aliphatic ch stretching vibrations suggesting the existence of ch3 and ch2 groups 27 the absorptions of 1631 and 1516 cm 1 reflected the contribution of the cc stretching of aromatic rings 28 29 the absorptions observed at 1465 cm 1 in the spectra could be due to the ch stretching of methylene methyl groups of aliphatic chains the peak at 1400 cm 1 noted in the spectra may correspond to the oh deformation and stretching vibrations of phenolic hydroxyl or the ch deformation of ch3 and ch2 groups 26 the added h in acidic precipitation combined with coo which caused the existence of the characteristic peak at 1710 cm 1 the peak of h precipitate at 1710 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of carbonyl groups which was absent in the spectra of metal precipitates 30 in the spectra of metal precipitates two co bonds showed symmetric stretching vibrations around 1400 cm 1 and antisymmetric stretching vibrations in the region of 1550 1650 cm 1 the lone electron pair of anionic binding sites combined with the empty orbital of metal cations to form stable coo metal complex 31 the spectra corresponding to h sludge displayed a distinct characteristic lignin band at 1128 cm 1 which was caused by co stretching of phenol and ether bonds between lignin monomers 29 as for the spectra of metal precipitates the band at 1128 cm 1 was not found since the presence of metal atom hindered the stretching of co indicating that phenolate ions could be the binding site for the complexation of metal cations in the spectra of ca sludge and mg sludge the bands at 870 cm 1 and 860 cm 1 were found which were probably attributed to the presence of co3 2 32 3 2 3 thermal analyses of precipitates the weight of precipitate was measured after drying and results are shown in table 3 the precipitate was composed of organic matter and compounds formed by precipitant due to over dosage the weight of precipitate was in the order fe precipitate al precipitate ca precipitate mg precipitate h precipitate tg dgt dsc curves of precipitates in n2 atmosphere at heating rate of 10 c min 1 were recorded tg curves of precipitates are shown in fig 7 and dtg dsc curves of precipitates are shown in fig s3 table 3 summarizes the weight loss of samples and corresponding temperature ranges all samples exhibited thermal mass loss 1 66 14 51 from initial temperature to 150 c due to the evaporation of water which was related to the existence of hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 33 34 in comparison much more significant mass loss of ca precipitate occurred at this stage which could correspond to more hydrophilic groups contained in ca precipitate the mass loss at 150 200 c was probably due to the decomposition of small molecular organic compounds such as fatty acids and carbohydrates it can be seen from the dtg curve of h precipitate that there were two peaks for lignin which were around 250 c and 350 c respectively the first mass loss peak can be attributed to dehydration of hydroxyl groups and the breakage of ether bond between aromatic monomers from 300 c the aliphatic side chain began to break from the aromatic ring followed by methyl aryl ether bond and carbon carbon cleavage 300 400 c 33 similar characteristic peak was also observed in curves of metal precipitates in the temperature range of 150 650 c mass loses were 19 17 43 48 42 38 and 34 47 for precipitates generated by cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 respectively the precipitate was a kind of waste with complicated components whose main ingredients included inorganic salts hydroxides lignin and its degradation products the pyrolysis of lignin between 300 and 400 c is an exothermic reaction 35 but the dsc curve of mg precipitate showed that the peak at 380 c was a strong endothermic peak which indicated the mass loss of mg precipitate at this stage may not be caused by the pyrolysis of lignin it could be attributed to the decomposition of mgco3 and mg oh 2 the reaction temperature range of the last stage was above 650 c which was regarded as condensation of char and decomposition of inorganic salt such as caco3 36 the ultimate residue mass percentages of metal precipitates at 900 c were 41 66 43 96 of their original samples in comparison the ultimate residue mass percentage of the precipitate obtained by acid precipitation was relatively low about 27 62 based on thermal analyses of precipitates ca oh 2 caco3 mg oh 2 and mgco3 may exist in precipitates the hydroxide and carbonate precipitate would be produced in situ with the addition of cacl2 and mgcl2 the impurity could be absorbed by surface complexation and enmeshed in the precipitate 3 3 pollutant removal behavior gc ms was exploited to identify the removed pollutant in the precipitation process and variations of peak intensity of compounds in cpbl before and after treatment were compared as shown in fig 8 the precipitation can effectively remove organic compounds in cpbl it was observed that peak intensities of butanoic acid and its derivatives hexanoic acid benzoic acid and some long chain organic acids including hexadecanoic acid and octadecadienoic acid were greatly reduced or even disappeared after the precipitation in addition 3 methoxy 4 hydroxybenzoic acid was also effectively removed during the precipitation which is the structural unit of guaiacyl lignin to further explore the remove behavior of pollutants before and after precipitation process the molecular weight distribution of cpbl samples before and after the precipitation was analyzed the molecular weight distribution of cpbl before and after treatment with salts is shown in fig 9 a it can be seen that organic molecules 600 800 da accounted for 68 04 of the total organics content in cpbl after the precipitation this proportion in all samples increased significantly indicating that the remove of macromolecular organic matter was more effective cod removal with different molecular weight of organic pollutants during the precipitation is shown in fig 9b all samples showed higher cod removals for macromolecular organics with molecular weight 100 kda compared with other molecular weight ranges the removal of cod decreased with the decrease of molecular weight of organics mgcl2 behaved like cacl2 but had relatively lower removal efficiency in the range of 10 k 100 kda which was 45 22 the removal efficiency of alcl3 and fecl3 for various molecular weight ranges was obviously higher than that of cacl2 and mgcl2 especially for organic matter with molecular weight 10 kda the highest cod removal 90 was obtained by fecl3 in all molecular weight ranges especially for organic matter with molecular weight 10 kda alcl3 and fecl3 had similar cod removal in the range of 100 kda and 600 800 da but alcl3 was less effective than fecl3 in the range of 10 100 kda and 600 800 da 10 kda which were 60 99 and 45 2 respectively in accordance with the literature the complexation of metal cations with organics can be affected by several factors such as molecular weight functional groups of organic matters and properties of metal cations 37 the most important functional groups that can potentially be complexed by metal ions are the carboxyl and phenolic groups in lignin 9 the bonding occurs by supplying electron pairs from an electron donor oxygen bearing functional group to an electron pair acceptor metal ion 31 37 note that the high affinity of these two groups for cations was highly dependent on the ph value at ph 4 4 the carboxyl group which is more acidic than the phenolic group begins to dissociate while at higher ph 9 5 the phenolic group is involved in more complexation 37 for the same kind of organics high molecular weight organics possess more ligand groups to combine with metal ions showing a higher affinity with metal ions over smaller molecular weight organics at the same solution conditions 38 40 a few studies have previously indicated that high molecular weight organics showed a higher affinity with metal ions than smaller molecular weight compounds 38 41 lakshman et al provided evidence about the effect of molecular weight of organic matter on binding affinity to metal ion by comparing the conditional stability constant log k 38 their study showed that the log k increased as molecular weight increased suggesting that high molecular weight fractions had stronger binding affinity than small molecular weight fractions similar trend had also been documented by chen et al who suggested that the susceptibility of macromolecules to strong metal binding may be attributed to their higher aromaticity or diversity of functional groups 41 compared with trivalent cations bivalent metal ion such as ca2 and mg2 exhibited relatively weak bonding with biopolymer such as lignin 37 40 so their efficacies were poorer than those of fe3 and al3 al3 predominantly combined with carboxylic sites rather than phenolic sites while fe3 exhibited the similar affinity with carboxylic and phenolic sites 37 so alcl3 was less effective than fecl3 possibly as there were phenols with molecular weight range of approximately 600 da to 100 kda in cpbl which cannot complex with al3 but can complex with fe3 precipitation mechanism of lignin by metal chlorides can be summarized based on above investigations for dissolved ca2 and mg2 in alkaline condition and high hydrophilic groups of lignin can be combined with metal cations by complexation in the cases of alcl3 and fecl3 the cations of iron and aluminum reacted with oh preferentially which caused the ph value of cpbl was greatly reduced with the increase of alcl3 and fecl3 dosage more al3 and fe3 could neutralize the negative charge on lignin and the complexes formed would precipitate out of the solution by charge neutralization correspondingly there was a gradual decline in the zeta potential reaching isoelectric point as the best removal was achieved which strongly supported complexation between the anion binding sites on lignin and metal cations as mentioned above most of the dosed salts existed in the form of metal cations as the optimum removals were reached although h produced by the hydrolysis competed with metal cations for anion binding sites on lignin it is clear that al3 and fe3 were more reactive the pollutant removals with alcl3 and fecl3 were much higher than those by acid precipitation when the dosage of metal salt was higher than the optimal dosage the complexes had a charge reversal which had a negative impact on pollutant removal as well known when metal salt dissolves into the aqueous solution a series of hydrolysates would be produced the freshly formed hydroxide has high surface free energy with large specific surface area which can absorb the negatively charged lignin in aqueous solution 42 due to the limited solubility of metal hydroxide higher dosage is conducive to the generation of amorphous hydroxide precipitation in which the impurity can be enmeshed and absorbed in cationic metal hydroxides 43 therefore the removal of lignin may also involve a combination of charge neutralization as well as adsorption and enmeshment of metal hydroxides and carbonates the possible binding sites of complexation could be carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of biopolymers 9 12 as mentioned earlier the adsorption of biopolymer on metal hydroxides or carbonates was insignificant conclusions the precipitation was used to remove color biopolymers such as lignin in cpbl and performances of cacl2 mgcl2 alcl3 and fecl3 as precipitants were systematically compared the results exhibited that precipitation could effectively remove lignin and the removal efficiency showed a trend of fecl3 alcl3 cacl2 mgcl2 analyses of removed pollutants showed that macromolecular organics were more easily removed by the precipitation the removal mechanism of biopolymers was mainly attributed to the complexation of metal cations with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13289,the multi soil layering msl bioreactor has been considered in the latest research as an innovative bioreactor for reducing the level of pollutants in wastewater the efficiency of the msl bioreactor towards nitrogen pollution is due to the mineralization of organic nitrogen in aerobic layers to ammonia and reactivity of ammonia nitrogen with soil and gravel by its adsorption into soil layers followed by nitrification and denitrification processes when the alternating phases of oxygenated anoxic conditions occurs in the filter in this study we have examined the performance of the msl bioreactor at different hydraulic loading rates hlrs and predicted the removal rate of nitrogen to improve the prediction accuracy of the models the feature selection technique was performed before conducting the neural network model the results showed a significant removal p 0 05 efficiency for five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 86 ammonium nh4 83 nitrates no3 81 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 84 total nitrogen tn 84 orthophosphates po 4 3 91 and total coliforms tc 1 62 log units however no significant change was observed in the nitrite no2 concentration as it s an intermediate nitrogen form the msl treatment efficiency demonstrated a good capacity even when hlr increased from 250 to 4000 l m2 day respectively e g between 64 and 86 for bod5 the hlr was selected as the most significant p 0 05 input variable that contribute to predict the removal rates of nitrogen the developed models predict accurately the output variables r2 0 93 and could help to investigate the msl behavior graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords multi soil layering hydraulic loading rate nitrogen feature selection neural network 1 introduction poor effluent quality is often unacceptable for direct discharge 1 and can cause soil degradation 2 and increasing treatment costs of water 3 nitrogen is a strong agent of environmental change and controlling its level has become a priority 4 in addition excess nitrogen can cause eutrophication in estuaries and coastal waters 5 pollute fresh and groundwater and improve emission of nitrous oxide 6 thus the removing of nitrogen from wastewater before its discharge is often mandatory to ovoid large scale contamination of water bodies we can emphasize to the fact that high efficiency and low cost are the best criteria of choosing a wastewater treatment plant currently optimal use of the multi soil layering msl bioreactor attracts large interest over the world 7 11 12 the msl has been tested in many countries china 7 9 morocco 10 and thailand 11 one of the leading superiority of this bioreactor is that it removes organic matter with high efficiency low cost and requires simple maintenance 12 msl bioreactor is defined as a stratified layer system which consists of gravel layers and soil mixture layers smls typically the component materials of soil mixture are soil charcoal iron granules and sawdust surrounded by gravel particles the removal of pollutants from wastewater by the msl bioreactor involves many physical and biochemical mechanisms for instance an et al 12 and zhou et al 13 have reported that alternation of aerobic permeable layers and anaerobic soil mixture layers phases is the key factor to remove nitrogen in the msl bioreactor mainly by nitrification denitrification processes regarding organic matter its removal has been shown to be provided by physical and chemical adsorption processes 14 while decomposition and metabolism of heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms promotes organic matter removal especially with continuous aeration 13 as for tp removal xiao et al 15 have reported that the combination of adsorption and co precipitation could assure excellent tp removal in the same context zhou et al 13 concluded that microbial community composition and intensity of metabolism within the msl bioreactor performed important roles in pollutant removal the need to treat large quantities of wastewater is sometimes unavoidable however the lack of estimating the possible amount that can be treated may lead to the clogging of the msl bioreactor in the case of overloading in order to examine the effect of this factor in the operation of the investigated bioreactor a comparison of different hydraulic loading rates hlrs was carried out according to masunaga et al 16 the hlr is a key factor in better operating the msl bioreactor it s directly linked to the hydraulic retention time hrt which characterizes how long the wastewater is treated in the bioreactor in addition the msl plant can support a high hlr 4000 l m2 day 17 however sato et al 18 have reported that the increased of hlr shortens wastewater retention time and negatively affects the removal efficiency of the msl bioreactor hlr act indirectly on the oxygenation of the filter high hlr is related to high organic load and by the way to the accumulation of organic matter that request more oxygen to be biodegraded inside the filter this could enhance the anaerobic condition even in permeable layers and reduce the aerobic biodegradation simulating the performances of this bioreactor is probably the greatest approach to understand its behavior and removal mechanisms moreover despite the latest research a few studies have targeted the simulation of the msl performance 12 20 21 unlike previous studies 12 21 the present study will investigate the nonlinear relationship between nitrogen removal including ammonium nh4 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total nitrogen tn with physicochemical parameters as well as fecal indicator bacteria through neural network technique nn furthermore before conducting the nn model this study will identify between 11 water quality indicators the most significant predictors that influence the removal of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor through a stepwise forward stepwise selection on the other hand this study will simulate the removal of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor using only the concentration of water quality indicators in the influent compared to the mentioned studies 12 21 that used the concentration in the msl effluents as well in machine learning nn is a black box method that takes inspiration from the functioning process of the living brain and can be used as a predictive modeling tool 21 in addition with the emergence of feedforward nn 22 this algorithm has become powerful and accurate in various areas such as water retention groundwater level and water quality 23 thus using this universal tool 24 for predicting nitrogen removal in the msl bioreactor will not only aid in monitoring the msl performance but it may also help in addressing multivariate nonlinear relationships in nitrogen removal 10 improving removal efficiency 25 and predicting nitrogen level in the msl effluent for potential reuse in agricultural fields 19 26 in the present study modeling benefits of nitrogen include more understanding the behavior of the msl bioreactor reducing the analysis costs protecting groundwater from a high excess of nitrogen pollution and reusing the treated water safely for irrigation nonetheless given the large number of parameters monitored in this experiment we have identified the input variables that have higher influence on the output using the akaike information criterion aic thus this research aims to i investigate the pollutant removal by the msl bioreactor under various hlrs in a semi arid rural area ii determine the relevant input variables that have higher influence on the nitrogen removal using the forward stepwise selection technique and iii predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor using the nn model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was performed in a rural village named talat marghen latitude 31 3351 longitude 7 94636 which belongs to the territory of the rural commune of aghouatim province of al haouz in central morocco the village is located in a semi arid area the coldest month is january with an average temperature of 12 c while the hottest month is july with an average temperature of 29 c warmest month the temperature reached its greatest extreme value 48 6 c in july while its lowest value 7 c was recorded in january in the last decade the winters are characterized by a relatively mild climate with an average annual precipitation of around 258 mm in general the climate indicates a dry tendency with an important change in temperature and a decrease in precipitation 27 in addition wells and boreholes are the main means of supplying drinking water to rural population in this semi arid area 2 2 pilot plant description in order to examine the relationship between the hlr and the purification efficiency of sewage in the msl bioreactor five msl pilot plants were operated with different flow rates 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day respectively each msl bioreactor was designed with a total volume of 26 l a storage tank with 1000 lof volume was installed to feed continuously the five pilot plants fig 1 mixed in blocks like pattern the soil mixture is the main factor of the treatment bioreactor it comprises four essential elements sandy soil granular iron metal charcoal and sawdust mixed and arranged in blocks with a ratio of 70 10 10 and 10 respectively the permeable layers that facilitate infiltration and percolation processes are filled with gravel particles 3 5 mm the pilot plant s description is shown schematically in fig 1 2 3 water quality data the msl pilot plants are designed and operated for treating domestic wastewater of eight households wastewater samples have been collected both at the inlet and at the outlet of the msl bioreactors once every 2 weeks over a one year period physicochemical and bacteriological analyzes fig 2 were performed at the same time according to the standard methods 28 29 30 30 furthermore all the laboratory analyses were repeated twice to ensure the values obtained and to increase the size of the database 246 data points regarding total nitrogen tn it was the summation of ammonium nh4 nitrites no2 nitrates no3 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn while the disinfection efficiency of total coliforms tc was expressed using the log colony forming units log cfu 100 ml 2 4 statistical test r programming is a language and an open source environment it provides a wide variety of statistical tests in this study anova and tukey were used as appropriate tests to identify the significant effect of the hlrs at the significance of p 0 05 along the same lines when researchers are interpreting their findings they consider a number of hypotheses as a likely explanation typically each hypothesis or treatment mechanism of wastewater can be illustrated by a model with mathematical expression in this paper we focus on predicting the removal rate of nh4 tkn and tn and examine the relationship between this removal and the influencing variables however considering the large number of indicators monitored in this study 11 water quality indicators a feature selection procedure will be required according to faraway 32 prediction performance improves by removing variables that contribute less or nothing to the model thus the aic based predictor selection can provide a decent choice for this purpose the popular aic usually results in a more parsimonious model according to kuhn and johnson 33 and burnhamet al 34 the loss function 1 provided by aic is minimized to provide an optimum model that matches the experimental data in other words increasing the number of parameters in a model improves the log probability but it also increases the danger of overfitting the aic penalizes for the increase in the number of parameters thus the selection with the lowest aic score is chosen as the most parsimonious 34 1 aic 2 ln l 2 q where q is the number of variables in the model and l is the maximum of the likelihood 2 5 neural network to better interpret the msl behavior towards contaminants and removal mechanisms the modeling tool is the best approach to establish assumptions about the interactions between input variables and output and make future predictions in this research the nn models were implemented using the neuralnet r package version 3 5 2 to predict the removal of nitrogen in a semi arid rural area the relevant input variables will be determined after using the forward stepwise selection technique each model was calibrated by varying its tuning parameters number of hidden layers and number of hidden neurons to reach the highest accuracy however the remaining parameters have been kept by default the error metrics criteria root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and the r2 were employed to measure the performances of the nn models mathematical equations of these metrics are given as follows 2 rmse o p o r 2 n 3 mse o p o r n 4 r 2 1 o p o r 2 o r 2 where n o r and o p are the number of samples real value and predicted value respectively the more the metrics mae and rmse tend to zero and r2 to one better the model is 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydraulic loading rate hlr the influent and the effluents averaged concentrations of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters are shown in table1 while fig 3 illustrates the distribution of these parameters using box and whisker plots the purification efficiencies of the msl bioreactor show satisfactory removal rates table 1 the variation in the hlr affects significantly p 0 05 the concentration of pollutants in the msl effluents fig 3 the more the hlr increases the more the treatment yields decrease these finding are in accordance with the experiment result conducted by sato et al 18 for in situ measurements the mean influent ph was 8 17 0 35 and significant effect p 0 05 was revealed between the variation of the hlr and the ph value fig 3 thus as indicated in table1 the rise in the hlr increases the ph value at the outlet of the msl bioreactors similarly the percolation of the raw wastewater through the five msl bioreactors has reduced the influent ec concentration table 1 it has passed from 2015 μs cm to 1693 1787 1850 1936 and 1957 μs cm respectively for the hlr 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day thus the variation in the hlr significantly p 0 05 influences the level of ec unlike ph and ec parameters significant p 0 05 improvement of do content was noticed in the treated water under a low hlr fig 3 in addition the do concentration was ranged between 3 87 0 52 and 1 72 0 34 mg l for the hlr of 250 and 4000 l m2 day respectively table 1 the msl bioreactor appears to be also effective in reducing organic matter content and nutrients under different hlrs table 1 the average concentrations in mg l for bod5 are respectively 43 20 msl1 52 24 msl2 70 24 msl3 95 17 msl4 and 110 79 msl5 thus a rise in the hlr value increases significantly p 0 05 the level of organic matter pollution at the msl bioreactors outlet fig 3 indeed increasing the hlr promotes anaerobic conditions within the msl bioreactor according to masunaga et al 16 furthermore the oxygenation of the investigated wastewater treatment plants affects the growth of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria which are responsible for biodegradation of organic matter these results are consistent with the experiments carried out by ho and wang 35 however masunaga et al 16 found that changes in the hlr had no effect on the removal of organic matter in the msl bioreactor the capacity of the msl bioreactor to reduce the nitrogen pollution is mainly related to the coexistence of oxygenated anoxic conditions 36 in this study these conditions are perfectly optimal under the hlr of 250 l m2 day fig 3 the average concentrations of nh4 no3 and tkn in the influent are between 20 47 and 33 01 mg l respectively table 1 fig 3 shows significant decreases p 0 05 in the concentrations of these pollutants under all the examined hlrs in addition as illustrated fig 3 a low hlr promotes high purification efficiency of the msl bioreactor however the hlr does not have a significant p 0 05 effect on the no2 concentrations in the treated water by the msl bioreactors fig 3 this result was consistent with the findings of many studies for instance latrach et al 37 examining a two stage system composed of an msl bioreactor and sand filters concluded that the hlr had no significant p 0 05 effect on the no2 effluent levels sindilariu et al 38 have reported that no significant increase of no2 was observed in the wetland effluent under different hlr lin et al 39 also reported that there were also no significant p 0 05 differences in no2 levels between the fws free water surface constructed wetland influent and fws effluent under different hlrs yang et al 40 while operating an aquaponic system also found that the hlr had no correlation with no2 this result suggests that the hlr did not play a significant role for no2 accumulation or removal in the msl bioreactor which appear to be stable towards this parameter 41 regarding tn the average concentration are respectively 12 92 19 58 25 97 32 33 and 40 01 mg l for the hlrs 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day table 1 these results show that increasing the hlr significantly p 0 05 decreases nitrogen removal efficiency by the msl bioreactor fig 3 these obtained results were in accordance with previous studies which found that the average removal of nitrogen will increase with the decrease of the hlr 16 thus increasing the hlr shortens the residence time of sewage inside the msl bioreactor and consequently decreases their contact with the soil mixture which negatively influences the purification efficiency of the msl bioreactor 18 additionally under a higher hlr the oxygenation conditions of the filter could limit nitrification and lower the denitrification process and subsequently nitrogen losses in the bioreactor 42 the msl bioreactor was significantly p 0 05 efficient in po4 3 removal under the hlr of 250 l m2 day compared to the hlrs of 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day fig 3 sato et al 18 have reported that decreasing the hlr increase the hrt of wastewater with the adsorbents inside the msl bioreactor which improves the removal of po4 3 also under the hlr of 250 l m2 day the removal rate of po4 3 in this study was very close to the results reported by chen et al 43 within the same context latrach et al 44 showed that the removal of po4 3 was achieved by adsorption on ferrous hydroxides in fact the iron in the smls is transformed into fe2 and then transported to the aerobic zone gravel layers to be oxidized later into fe3 12 thus the chemical reaction between po4 3 and fe3 during the percolation process is the main way for phosphorus removal the sanitary efficiency of the msl decreases significantly p 0 05 with increasing the hlr fig 3 the high reduction of tc bacteria is recorded in the case of the low hlr 250 l m2 day with an average removal of 1 62 log units table 1 however beyond this hlr the removal of tc is around 1 log units overall these results show an improvement in the quality of the treated water by the msl bioreactor subjected to the hlr of 250 l m2 day table 1 in fact increasing the hlr value reduces automatically the hrt in the msl bioreactor which has led to a decrease in the pollutant removal rate in terms of removal rates fig 4 indicates that the msl bioreactor was efficient in decreasing pollutant levels in wastewater at various hlrs thus for the hlr of 250 l m2 day the average removal of bod5 nh4 no3 tkn tn and po4 3 are of the order of 86 83 81 84 83 91 respectively whereas the removal of tc was 1 62 log units furthermore the findings reveal a significant p 0 05 negative correlation between pollutant removal and the applied hlrs fig 4 indeed decreasing the hlr enhances the hydraulic retention time of water within the msl bioreactor which will increase the contact time of pollutants with the msl media and consequently increase its removal efficiencies likewise yidong et al 42 and masunaga et al 16 reported that decreasing the hlr positively affects the performances of the msl bioreactor 3 2 forward stepwise selection forward selection was attempted for the purpose of finding the relevant input variables that may predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor the aic argument was used for this purpose fig 5 the forward selection was done using the olsrr r package furthermore with the exception of no2 which was not significant p 0 05 between the msl bioreactor s influent and effluents the candidate models were based on the variables hlr ph do ec bod5 nh4 no3 tkn tn po4 3 and tc fig 5 reveals the best selected input variables listing them in descending order the selection was done in such a way as to reduce the aic value based on the lowest aic score a model including the input variables hlr nh4 do bod5 and ec is considered as parsimonious for predicting the removal of nh4 fig 5 a1 thus the hlr is ranked as the most significant p 0 05 predictor followed by the level of nh4 in the influent for kjeldahl nitrogen a selection including the hlr tkn tc do and nh4 was considered as sufficiently informative to predict its removal rate fig 5 b1 while the input variables hlr tn tc bod5 and do found to be relevant for predicting the removal of tn fig 5 c1 likewise the hlr was ranked as the most significant p 0 05 input variable in predicting tkn and tn removal rates respectively in the same sense pearson s correlation coefficient is often used to quantify the degree of linear relationship between two continuous variables 45 in this study this metric was used to illustrate the relative importance of each selected variable we can see clearly that the selected input variables were all important including tc for both tkn and tn in addition as illustrated in fig 5 a2 b2 and c2 the hlr was the best informative one and the linear relationship confirmed that it was negatively correlated with the removal of nh4 tkn r pearson 0 64 and tn r pearson 0 79 respectively fig 5 a3 b3 and c3 similar results were found by masunaga et al 16 indeed the forward stepwise selection result highlighted the importance of the hlr variable also the removal of nitrogen pollution from this study and other comparative studies 17 33 is found to be significantly p 0 05 correlated with the hlr kadlec 46 reported that the estimated removal rates of nitrogen have been shown to depend strongly on hlrs in wetland systems in addition many researchers have reported that the hlr significantly influences the processes of nitrogen transformation and removal in trickling filter 47 according to a detailed study led by sato et al 18 the hlr is directly related to the residence time of the sewage within the msl bioreactor the greater the hlr the shorter the retention time thus the duration of the contact time with the gravel layer and the soil mixture layer will be reduced and this can negatively influence the removal of nitrogen pollution previous studies have investigated the relationship between nitrogen and electrical conductivity le bonté et al 48 have demonstrated that sodium ammonium and orthophosphate contribute to about 32 of the total wastewater conductivity dumont et al 49 have predicted the nitrogen concentration by measuring the ec in a biotrickling filter sánchez monedero et al 50 have found significant relationships at a high probability level between nitrogen and ec concentration confirming that nitrification was responsible for the increase of ec kløve 51 has developed a regression equation that explains the variation in nh4 based on rainfall water conductivity and water temperature theoretically the nitrates no3 and nitrites no2 are ions present in wastewater the nh4 is transformed to no2 and to no3 through nitrification process in the aerobic zone fig 1 then under the effect of gravity no3 percolate to the anaerobic zone sml where it will be reduced to nitrogen gas n2 no n2o this latter process denitrification is ensured by denitrifying bacteria and reinforced by sawdust as a carbon source the ec mainly depends on these free ions obtained from nh4 to conduct the electric current moreover rasool et al 52 reported that the reduction of ec was related to the transformation of no2 and no3 into molecular nitrogen n2 for this reason the ec indicates significant importance for predicting the removal rate of nh4 by the msl bioreactor the do is a required factor for the complete oxidation of nh4 thus its level inside the msl bioreactor controls the kinetics of nitrification and denitrification processes responsible for the removal of nitrogen numerous papers 34 46 have indicated that denitrification mechanism is the limiting factor for nitrogen removal by the msl bioreactor in fact the removal of this pollutant depends mostly on the oxic and anoxic conditions in the msl bioreactor furthermore as cited previously under anaerobic conditions the nh4 is transformed to nitrogen gas through denitrifying bacteria 44 sriwiriyarat et al 54 have reported that nitrogen removal was affected by the variation of do concentrations in activated sludge reactor also the model structure developed by sarioglu et al 55 highlight the major role of do concentration to model the nitrogen removal by a membrane bioreactor hosseini et al 56 found that the do was critical to simulate the removal of nitrogen in a granular sludge bioreactor coskuner and jassim 57 by modeling the removal of nitrogen in a wwtp found that influent bod5 concentration was among the most influential water quality factors on nitrification efficiency tchobanoglous et al 58 reported that high bod5 concentration accelerates the growth of heterotrophic species which then compete with nitrifying bacteria for do and consequently decrease the nitrification performance gajewska et al 59 indicated that the availability of easily degradable source of carbon bod5 in wastewater becomes important for efficient nitrogen removal chan et al 60 also declared that bod5 contributes to the elimination of nitrogen thus they have used bod5 as input variable to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the effluent of constructed wetland systems similarly regarding the forward selection and linear correlation results it seems that the candidate predictor tc was also necessary for predicting the removal of tkn and tn in the msl bioreactor which suggests that its level impacts the concentration of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor for instance sbahi et al 10 found a strong nonlinear relationship between nitrogen and coliform bacteria in the msl wąsik and chmielowski 61 noted that the removal of nitrogen was correlated with the concentration of coliform bacteria from domestic wastewater in a vertical flow filter seo et al 62 have found a significant p 0 05 negative correlation between tc and nitrogen in the nakdong river south korea these results appear reasonable because it has been reported that the alkaline environment was harmful for coliform survival 44 thus the abundance of nitrogen in large quantities increases the release of hydroxide through denitrification 53 which consequently improves the removal of tc bacteria therefore the removal of nitrogen helps tc bacteria to survive for this reason tc can be considered as a relevant indicator to predict the removal of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor overall the analysis of the forward stepwise selection result indicated that the selected input variables are statistically relevant for predicting the output variables in addition all the studied variables were centered and scaled before making prediction with the nn model 3 3 results of neural network in this study the use of nn as a predictive tool was not chosen at random it has outperformed other types of algorithms e g cubist and multiple linear regression in predicting contaminant removal in the msl bioreactor 10 19 thus after identifying and scaling the input variables 80 of the available dataset were randomly selected to calibrate nn models the remaining part 20 was used to assess the accuracy of the developed models several nn structures were trained and tested to select the optimal nn architectures using the neuralnet function while compute function was used to predict the output variables the process of determining the number of hidden layers and their neuron numbers is challenging and still a complex issue 63 64 in this study trial and error strategy is employed to determine the optimal neural architecture for each output variable 65 this was accomplished by changing the number of hidden layers from one to three and neurons from one to thirteen until the overall training and testing performance was improved according to nguyen et al 66 a nn model with two or three hidden layers gives the best results similarly the current study found that two hidden layers were also sufficient and give the best accuracy for each output variable for predicting the removal of nh4 the nn structure consists of one input layer with 5 units two hidden layers each one with 10 units and the output layer with a single unit similarly the optimal nn structure for predicting the removal of tkn 5 7 4 1 and tn 5 9 6 1 has two hidden layers fig 6 similarly bagherzadeh et al 67 have employed two hidden layers to predict nitrogen in a wastewater treatment plant however although using the same approach by gong et al 68 they have found that only one hidden layer was required to predict nitrogen removal in aerobic granulation technology kumar et al 69 when predicting river nitrogen also found that the lowest error is reached at two hidden layers after which the network appears to have become overcomplicated as the error increased for three hidden layers fig 7 illustrates the nn input data regression for calibration and validation sets obtained results indicate that there is a small difference between the predicted and the real values for each output variable as cited before the metrics rmse r2 and mae were used to measure the models accuracy in calibration the mae values are ranging between 2 and 4 while the rmse values vary between 3 and 5 for the three output variables thus the r2 values are also very good and exceed up 0 930 in validation the mae and rmse for nh4 removal prediction are 4 942 and 6 105 respectively for the removal of tkn the predictions are 3 542 and 4 651 respectively and for the removal of tn the predictions are 3 506 and 4 721 respectively also the performances of nn shows a good fit between the predicted and the real values for nh4 removal r2 0 933 tkn removal r2 0 959 and tn removal r2 0 937 respectively after the calibration and the validation of the nn models and calculating the prediction error we have also examined the variation in the accuracy of the developed models using the cross validation technique according to brownlee 70 kuhn and johnson 71 cross validation is as a gold standard approach to evaluate nn models accuracy and to detect overfitting often with 10 folds thus the calibration and validation processes were repeated 10 times with random selection each time the final validation output for the nn model used equal to the average of the 10 validation scores calculated fig 7 shows the results of cross validation error cv error via box and whisker plot the average rmse and mae values obtained from the cv error technique for the removal of nh4 rmse 6 293 mae 4 333 tkn rmse 4 789 mae 3 574 and tn rmse 4 707 mae 3 307 were close to the error values of validation results the measured error amount is very low therefore the fitted nn models were accurate efficient and can be used to predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor within the same context song et al 20 have also developed another machine learning model stepwise cluster analysis to simulate the removal of nitrogen from domestic sewage in the msl bioreactor the model input variables were derived from the removal of bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 no3 tn total phosphorus tp and time the r2 values for the test sets of tn and nh4 were 0 981 and 0 951 respectively using the same treatment technology hong et al 8 have also used a sca model to predict the removal of tn using oxidation reduction potential orp do ph and the removal of nitrogen nh4 and no3 as inputs data their predictions resulted in high r2 r2 0 940 and the sca model was also accurate however the novelty of the present study was the first to predict nitrogen removal using only the concentrations of the selected variables in the influent in addition this study aims to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between nitrogen removal and relevant input variables including coliform bacteria and to highlight their order of importance 3 4 variable importance in this study the nn method has successfully addressed the nonlinear complexities of nitrogen removal processes in the msl bioreactor 20 furthermore for a precise reflection of nitrogen removal mechanisms using this method 72 the variable importance analysis was carried out by using the olden equation 73 as can be seen in fig 8 the hlr appears to be negatively influencing nitrogen removal this finding is consistent with the feature selection results fig 5 indeed nitrogen removal efficiency decreases when increasing the hlr from 250 l m2 day to 4000 l m2 day table1 therefore higher hlrs shorten the residence time of nitrogen within the msl media and in turn reduce the efficiency of nitrification and denitrification processes however the result of variable importance reveals that biodegradable organic matter bod5 is the most important parameter influencing tn removal in the msl bioreactor this result is in agreement with the conclusions reported by latarch et al 44 who indicated that organic carbon in the msl increases the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying communities which intensifies nitrification and denitrification mechanisms as for tc level sbahi et al 10 have reported that this parameter is in nonlinear relationship with nitrification and denitrification mechanisms within msl bioreactor indeed tc are considered as a competitor to nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria around organic matter which will indirectly contribute to the decrease of nitrogen removal processes and in turn reducing tn removal rate thus decreasing their level will promote nitrogen removal mechanisms in the msl bioreactor regarding do level this input variable is classified as the less important in terms of contribution in removing tn this implies that the msl bioreactor s anaerobic environment mainly enhances the denitrification process and as a result boosts tn removal rate overall the suggested nn models can reliably be used to consistently optimize nitrogen removal processes in the msl bioreactor 4 conclusion as a low cost and green technology msl bioreactor with vertical flow regime supports high hlr and it is an emerging solution for wastewater treatment in rural areas this is the first study to try to estimate nitrogen removal based on the concentration of water quality indicators in the influent in addition this work looks at the influential factors that affect nitrogen removal in the msl bioreactor the effect of the hlr was significant p 0 05 in pollutant removal the improvement of the purification processes of the nitrogen removal adsorption nitrification and denitrification under a low hlr may be due to the increase of the hydraulic retention time the aic forward stepwise selection has revealed the relevant variables that influence the removal of nh4 tkn and tn using a nn with two hidden layers the models developed have predicted the output variables with high accuracy r2 exceed up 0 93 hence the nn may be used successfully for predicting the performance of the msl bioreactor furthermore investigation of linear and nonlinear relationships between various types of potential bacteria hydraulic retention time hlr and pollutant removal in the msl bioreactor with horizontal flow it s probable that this will happen as soon as possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

13289,the multi soil layering msl bioreactor has been considered in the latest research as an innovative bioreactor for reducing the level of pollutants in wastewater the efficiency of the msl bioreactor towards nitrogen pollution is due to the mineralization of organic nitrogen in aerobic layers to ammonia and reactivity of ammonia nitrogen with soil and gravel by its adsorption into soil layers followed by nitrification and denitrification processes when the alternating phases of oxygenated anoxic conditions occurs in the filter in this study we have examined the performance of the msl bioreactor at different hydraulic loading rates hlrs and predicted the removal rate of nitrogen to improve the prediction accuracy of the models the feature selection technique was performed before conducting the neural network model the results showed a significant removal p 0 05 efficiency for five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 86 ammonium nh4 83 nitrates no3 81 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 84 total nitrogen tn 84 orthophosphates po 4 3 91 and total coliforms tc 1 62 log units however no significant change was observed in the nitrite no2 concentration as it s an intermediate nitrogen form the msl treatment efficiency demonstrated a good capacity even when hlr increased from 250 to 4000 l m2 day respectively e g between 64 and 86 for bod5 the hlr was selected as the most significant p 0 05 input variable that contribute to predict the removal rates of nitrogen the developed models predict accurately the output variables r2 0 93 and could help to investigate the msl behavior graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords multi soil layering hydraulic loading rate nitrogen feature selection neural network 1 introduction poor effluent quality is often unacceptable for direct discharge 1 and can cause soil degradation 2 and increasing treatment costs of water 3 nitrogen is a strong agent of environmental change and controlling its level has become a priority 4 in addition excess nitrogen can cause eutrophication in estuaries and coastal waters 5 pollute fresh and groundwater and improve emission of nitrous oxide 6 thus the removing of nitrogen from wastewater before its discharge is often mandatory to ovoid large scale contamination of water bodies we can emphasize to the fact that high efficiency and low cost are the best criteria of choosing a wastewater treatment plant currently optimal use of the multi soil layering msl bioreactor attracts large interest over the world 7 11 12 the msl has been tested in many countries china 7 9 morocco 10 and thailand 11 one of the leading superiority of this bioreactor is that it removes organic matter with high efficiency low cost and requires simple maintenance 12 msl bioreactor is defined as a stratified layer system which consists of gravel layers and soil mixture layers smls typically the component materials of soil mixture are soil charcoal iron granules and sawdust surrounded by gravel particles the removal of pollutants from wastewater by the msl bioreactor involves many physical and biochemical mechanisms for instance an et al 12 and zhou et al 13 have reported that alternation of aerobic permeable layers and anaerobic soil mixture layers phases is the key factor to remove nitrogen in the msl bioreactor mainly by nitrification denitrification processes regarding organic matter its removal has been shown to be provided by physical and chemical adsorption processes 14 while decomposition and metabolism of heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms promotes organic matter removal especially with continuous aeration 13 as for tp removal xiao et al 15 have reported that the combination of adsorption and co precipitation could assure excellent tp removal in the same context zhou et al 13 concluded that microbial community composition and intensity of metabolism within the msl bioreactor performed important roles in pollutant removal the need to treat large quantities of wastewater is sometimes unavoidable however the lack of estimating the possible amount that can be treated may lead to the clogging of the msl bioreactor in the case of overloading in order to examine the effect of this factor in the operation of the investigated bioreactor a comparison of different hydraulic loading rates hlrs was carried out according to masunaga et al 16 the hlr is a key factor in better operating the msl bioreactor it s directly linked to the hydraulic retention time hrt which characterizes how long the wastewater is treated in the bioreactor in addition the msl plant can support a high hlr 4000 l m2 day 17 however sato et al 18 have reported that the increased of hlr shortens wastewater retention time and negatively affects the removal efficiency of the msl bioreactor hlr act indirectly on the oxygenation of the filter high hlr is related to high organic load and by the way to the accumulation of organic matter that request more oxygen to be biodegraded inside the filter this could enhance the anaerobic condition even in permeable layers and reduce the aerobic biodegradation simulating the performances of this bioreactor is probably the greatest approach to understand its behavior and removal mechanisms moreover despite the latest research a few studies have targeted the simulation of the msl performance 12 20 21 unlike previous studies 12 21 the present study will investigate the nonlinear relationship between nitrogen removal including ammonium nh4 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total nitrogen tn with physicochemical parameters as well as fecal indicator bacteria through neural network technique nn furthermore before conducting the nn model this study will identify between 11 water quality indicators the most significant predictors that influence the removal of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor through a stepwise forward stepwise selection on the other hand this study will simulate the removal of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor using only the concentration of water quality indicators in the influent compared to the mentioned studies 12 21 that used the concentration in the msl effluents as well in machine learning nn is a black box method that takes inspiration from the functioning process of the living brain and can be used as a predictive modeling tool 21 in addition with the emergence of feedforward nn 22 this algorithm has become powerful and accurate in various areas such as water retention groundwater level and water quality 23 thus using this universal tool 24 for predicting nitrogen removal in the msl bioreactor will not only aid in monitoring the msl performance but it may also help in addressing multivariate nonlinear relationships in nitrogen removal 10 improving removal efficiency 25 and predicting nitrogen level in the msl effluent for potential reuse in agricultural fields 19 26 in the present study modeling benefits of nitrogen include more understanding the behavior of the msl bioreactor reducing the analysis costs protecting groundwater from a high excess of nitrogen pollution and reusing the treated water safely for irrigation nonetheless given the large number of parameters monitored in this experiment we have identified the input variables that have higher influence on the output using the akaike information criterion aic thus this research aims to i investigate the pollutant removal by the msl bioreactor under various hlrs in a semi arid rural area ii determine the relevant input variables that have higher influence on the nitrogen removal using the forward stepwise selection technique and iii predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor using the nn model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was performed in a rural village named talat marghen latitude 31 3351 longitude 7 94636 which belongs to the territory of the rural commune of aghouatim province of al haouz in central morocco the village is located in a semi arid area the coldest month is january with an average temperature of 12 c while the hottest month is july with an average temperature of 29 c warmest month the temperature reached its greatest extreme value 48 6 c in july while its lowest value 7 c was recorded in january in the last decade the winters are characterized by a relatively mild climate with an average annual precipitation of around 258 mm in general the climate indicates a dry tendency with an important change in temperature and a decrease in precipitation 27 in addition wells and boreholes are the main means of supplying drinking water to rural population in this semi arid area 2 2 pilot plant description in order to examine the relationship between the hlr and the purification efficiency of sewage in the msl bioreactor five msl pilot plants were operated with different flow rates 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day respectively each msl bioreactor was designed with a total volume of 26 l a storage tank with 1000 lof volume was installed to feed continuously the five pilot plants fig 1 mixed in blocks like pattern the soil mixture is the main factor of the treatment bioreactor it comprises four essential elements sandy soil granular iron metal charcoal and sawdust mixed and arranged in blocks with a ratio of 70 10 10 and 10 respectively the permeable layers that facilitate infiltration and percolation processes are filled with gravel particles 3 5 mm the pilot plant s description is shown schematically in fig 1 2 3 water quality data the msl pilot plants are designed and operated for treating domestic wastewater of eight households wastewater samples have been collected both at the inlet and at the outlet of the msl bioreactors once every 2 weeks over a one year period physicochemical and bacteriological analyzes fig 2 were performed at the same time according to the standard methods 28 29 30 30 furthermore all the laboratory analyses were repeated twice to ensure the values obtained and to increase the size of the database 246 data points regarding total nitrogen tn it was the summation of ammonium nh4 nitrites no2 nitrates no3 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn while the disinfection efficiency of total coliforms tc was expressed using the log colony forming units log cfu 100 ml 2 4 statistical test r programming is a language and an open source environment it provides a wide variety of statistical tests in this study anova and tukey were used as appropriate tests to identify the significant effect of the hlrs at the significance of p 0 05 along the same lines when researchers are interpreting their findings they consider a number of hypotheses as a likely explanation typically each hypothesis or treatment mechanism of wastewater can be illustrated by a model with mathematical expression in this paper we focus on predicting the removal rate of nh4 tkn and tn and examine the relationship between this removal and the influencing variables however considering the large number of indicators monitored in this study 11 water quality indicators a feature selection procedure will be required according to faraway 32 prediction performance improves by removing variables that contribute less or nothing to the model thus the aic based predictor selection can provide a decent choice for this purpose the popular aic usually results in a more parsimonious model according to kuhn and johnson 33 and burnhamet al 34 the loss function 1 provided by aic is minimized to provide an optimum model that matches the experimental data in other words increasing the number of parameters in a model improves the log probability but it also increases the danger of overfitting the aic penalizes for the increase in the number of parameters thus the selection with the lowest aic score is chosen as the most parsimonious 34 1 aic 2 ln l 2 q where q is the number of variables in the model and l is the maximum of the likelihood 2 5 neural network to better interpret the msl behavior towards contaminants and removal mechanisms the modeling tool is the best approach to establish assumptions about the interactions between input variables and output and make future predictions in this research the nn models were implemented using the neuralnet r package version 3 5 2 to predict the removal of nitrogen in a semi arid rural area the relevant input variables will be determined after using the forward stepwise selection technique each model was calibrated by varying its tuning parameters number of hidden layers and number of hidden neurons to reach the highest accuracy however the remaining parameters have been kept by default the error metrics criteria root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and the r2 were employed to measure the performances of the nn models mathematical equations of these metrics are given as follows 2 rmse o p o r 2 n 3 mse o p o r n 4 r 2 1 o p o r 2 o r 2 where n o r and o p are the number of samples real value and predicted value respectively the more the metrics mae and rmse tend to zero and r2 to one better the model is 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydraulic loading rate hlr the influent and the effluents averaged concentrations of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters are shown in table1 while fig 3 illustrates the distribution of these parameters using box and whisker plots the purification efficiencies of the msl bioreactor show satisfactory removal rates table 1 the variation in the hlr affects significantly p 0 05 the concentration of pollutants in the msl effluents fig 3 the more the hlr increases the more the treatment yields decrease these finding are in accordance with the experiment result conducted by sato et al 18 for in situ measurements the mean influent ph was 8 17 0 35 and significant effect p 0 05 was revealed between the variation of the hlr and the ph value fig 3 thus as indicated in table1 the rise in the hlr increases the ph value at the outlet of the msl bioreactors similarly the percolation of the raw wastewater through the five msl bioreactors has reduced the influent ec concentration table 1 it has passed from 2015 μs cm to 1693 1787 1850 1936 and 1957 μs cm respectively for the hlr 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day thus the variation in the hlr significantly p 0 05 influences the level of ec unlike ph and ec parameters significant p 0 05 improvement of do content was noticed in the treated water under a low hlr fig 3 in addition the do concentration was ranged between 3 87 0 52 and 1 72 0 34 mg l for the hlr of 250 and 4000 l m2 day respectively table 1 the msl bioreactor appears to be also effective in reducing organic matter content and nutrients under different hlrs table 1 the average concentrations in mg l for bod5 are respectively 43 20 msl1 52 24 msl2 70 24 msl3 95 17 msl4 and 110 79 msl5 thus a rise in the hlr value increases significantly p 0 05 the level of organic matter pollution at the msl bioreactors outlet fig 3 indeed increasing the hlr promotes anaerobic conditions within the msl bioreactor according to masunaga et al 16 furthermore the oxygenation of the investigated wastewater treatment plants affects the growth of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria which are responsible for biodegradation of organic matter these results are consistent with the experiments carried out by ho and wang 35 however masunaga et al 16 found that changes in the hlr had no effect on the removal of organic matter in the msl bioreactor the capacity of the msl bioreactor to reduce the nitrogen pollution is mainly related to the coexistence of oxygenated anoxic conditions 36 in this study these conditions are perfectly optimal under the hlr of 250 l m2 day fig 3 the average concentrations of nh4 no3 and tkn in the influent are between 20 47 and 33 01 mg l respectively table 1 fig 3 shows significant decreases p 0 05 in the concentrations of these pollutants under all the examined hlrs in addition as illustrated fig 3 a low hlr promotes high purification efficiency of the msl bioreactor however the hlr does not have a significant p 0 05 effect on the no2 concentrations in the treated water by the msl bioreactors fig 3 this result was consistent with the findings of many studies for instance latrach et al 37 examining a two stage system composed of an msl bioreactor and sand filters concluded that the hlr had no significant p 0 05 effect on the no2 effluent levels sindilariu et al 38 have reported that no significant increase of no2 was observed in the wetland effluent under different hlr lin et al 39 also reported that there were also no significant p 0 05 differences in no2 levels between the fws free water surface constructed wetland influent and fws effluent under different hlrs yang et al 40 while operating an aquaponic system also found that the hlr had no correlation with no2 this result suggests that the hlr did not play a significant role for no2 accumulation or removal in the msl bioreactor which appear to be stable towards this parameter 41 regarding tn the average concentration are respectively 12 92 19 58 25 97 32 33 and 40 01 mg l for the hlrs 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day table 1 these results show that increasing the hlr significantly p 0 05 decreases nitrogen removal efficiency by the msl bioreactor fig 3 these obtained results were in accordance with previous studies which found that the average removal of nitrogen will increase with the decrease of the hlr 16 thus increasing the hlr shortens the residence time of sewage inside the msl bioreactor and consequently decreases their contact with the soil mixture which negatively influences the purification efficiency of the msl bioreactor 18 additionally under a higher hlr the oxygenation conditions of the filter could limit nitrification and lower the denitrification process and subsequently nitrogen losses in the bioreactor 42 the msl bioreactor was significantly p 0 05 efficient in po4 3 removal under the hlr of 250 l m2 day compared to the hlrs of 500 1000 2000 and 4000 l m2 day fig 3 sato et al 18 have reported that decreasing the hlr increase the hrt of wastewater with the adsorbents inside the msl bioreactor which improves the removal of po4 3 also under the hlr of 250 l m2 day the removal rate of po4 3 in this study was very close to the results reported by chen et al 43 within the same context latrach et al 44 showed that the removal of po4 3 was achieved by adsorption on ferrous hydroxides in fact the iron in the smls is transformed into fe2 and then transported to the aerobic zone gravel layers to be oxidized later into fe3 12 thus the chemical reaction between po4 3 and fe3 during the percolation process is the main way for phosphorus removal the sanitary efficiency of the msl decreases significantly p 0 05 with increasing the hlr fig 3 the high reduction of tc bacteria is recorded in the case of the low hlr 250 l m2 day with an average removal of 1 62 log units table 1 however beyond this hlr the removal of tc is around 1 log units overall these results show an improvement in the quality of the treated water by the msl bioreactor subjected to the hlr of 250 l m2 day table 1 in fact increasing the hlr value reduces automatically the hrt in the msl bioreactor which has led to a decrease in the pollutant removal rate in terms of removal rates fig 4 indicates that the msl bioreactor was efficient in decreasing pollutant levels in wastewater at various hlrs thus for the hlr of 250 l m2 day the average removal of bod5 nh4 no3 tkn tn and po4 3 are of the order of 86 83 81 84 83 91 respectively whereas the removal of tc was 1 62 log units furthermore the findings reveal a significant p 0 05 negative correlation between pollutant removal and the applied hlrs fig 4 indeed decreasing the hlr enhances the hydraulic retention time of water within the msl bioreactor which will increase the contact time of pollutants with the msl media and consequently increase its removal efficiencies likewise yidong et al 42 and masunaga et al 16 reported that decreasing the hlr positively affects the performances of the msl bioreactor 3 2 forward stepwise selection forward selection was attempted for the purpose of finding the relevant input variables that may predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor the aic argument was used for this purpose fig 5 the forward selection was done using the olsrr r package furthermore with the exception of no2 which was not significant p 0 05 between the msl bioreactor s influent and effluents the candidate models were based on the variables hlr ph do ec bod5 nh4 no3 tkn tn po4 3 and tc fig 5 reveals the best selected input variables listing them in descending order the selection was done in such a way as to reduce the aic value based on the lowest aic score a model including the input variables hlr nh4 do bod5 and ec is considered as parsimonious for predicting the removal of nh4 fig 5 a1 thus the hlr is ranked as the most significant p 0 05 predictor followed by the level of nh4 in the influent for kjeldahl nitrogen a selection including the hlr tkn tc do and nh4 was considered as sufficiently informative to predict its removal rate fig 5 b1 while the input variables hlr tn tc bod5 and do found to be relevant for predicting the removal of tn fig 5 c1 likewise the hlr was ranked as the most significant p 0 05 input variable in predicting tkn and tn removal rates respectively in the same sense pearson s correlation coefficient is often used to quantify the degree of linear relationship between two continuous variables 45 in this study this metric was used to illustrate the relative importance of each selected variable we can see clearly that the selected input variables were all important including tc for both tkn and tn in addition as illustrated in fig 5 a2 b2 and c2 the hlr was the best informative one and the linear relationship confirmed that it was negatively correlated with the removal of nh4 tkn r pearson 0 64 and tn r pearson 0 79 respectively fig 5 a3 b3 and c3 similar results were found by masunaga et al 16 indeed the forward stepwise selection result highlighted the importance of the hlr variable also the removal of nitrogen pollution from this study and other comparative studies 17 33 is found to be significantly p 0 05 correlated with the hlr kadlec 46 reported that the estimated removal rates of nitrogen have been shown to depend strongly on hlrs in wetland systems in addition many researchers have reported that the hlr significantly influences the processes of nitrogen transformation and removal in trickling filter 47 according to a detailed study led by sato et al 18 the hlr is directly related to the residence time of the sewage within the msl bioreactor the greater the hlr the shorter the retention time thus the duration of the contact time with the gravel layer and the soil mixture layer will be reduced and this can negatively influence the removal of nitrogen pollution previous studies have investigated the relationship between nitrogen and electrical conductivity le bonté et al 48 have demonstrated that sodium ammonium and orthophosphate contribute to about 32 of the total wastewater conductivity dumont et al 49 have predicted the nitrogen concentration by measuring the ec in a biotrickling filter sánchez monedero et al 50 have found significant relationships at a high probability level between nitrogen and ec concentration confirming that nitrification was responsible for the increase of ec kløve 51 has developed a regression equation that explains the variation in nh4 based on rainfall water conductivity and water temperature theoretically the nitrates no3 and nitrites no2 are ions present in wastewater the nh4 is transformed to no2 and to no3 through nitrification process in the aerobic zone fig 1 then under the effect of gravity no3 percolate to the anaerobic zone sml where it will be reduced to nitrogen gas n2 no n2o this latter process denitrification is ensured by denitrifying bacteria and reinforced by sawdust as a carbon source the ec mainly depends on these free ions obtained from nh4 to conduct the electric current moreover rasool et al 52 reported that the reduction of ec was related to the transformation of no2 and no3 into molecular nitrogen n2 for this reason the ec indicates significant importance for predicting the removal rate of nh4 by the msl bioreactor the do is a required factor for the complete oxidation of nh4 thus its level inside the msl bioreactor controls the kinetics of nitrification and denitrification processes responsible for the removal of nitrogen numerous papers 34 46 have indicated that denitrification mechanism is the limiting factor for nitrogen removal by the msl bioreactor in fact the removal of this pollutant depends mostly on the oxic and anoxic conditions in the msl bioreactor furthermore as cited previously under anaerobic conditions the nh4 is transformed to nitrogen gas through denitrifying bacteria 44 sriwiriyarat et al 54 have reported that nitrogen removal was affected by the variation of do concentrations in activated sludge reactor also the model structure developed by sarioglu et al 55 highlight the major role of do concentration to model the nitrogen removal by a membrane bioreactor hosseini et al 56 found that the do was critical to simulate the removal of nitrogen in a granular sludge bioreactor coskuner and jassim 57 by modeling the removal of nitrogen in a wwtp found that influent bod5 concentration was among the most influential water quality factors on nitrification efficiency tchobanoglous et al 58 reported that high bod5 concentration accelerates the growth of heterotrophic species which then compete with nitrifying bacteria for do and consequently decrease the nitrification performance gajewska et al 59 indicated that the availability of easily degradable source of carbon bod5 in wastewater becomes important for efficient nitrogen removal chan et al 60 also declared that bod5 contributes to the elimination of nitrogen thus they have used bod5 as input variable to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the effluent of constructed wetland systems similarly regarding the forward selection and linear correlation results it seems that the candidate predictor tc was also necessary for predicting the removal of tkn and tn in the msl bioreactor which suggests that its level impacts the concentration of nitrogen in the msl bioreactor for instance sbahi et al 10 found a strong nonlinear relationship between nitrogen and coliform bacteria in the msl wąsik and chmielowski 61 noted that the removal of nitrogen was correlated with the concentration of coliform bacteria from domestic wastewater in a vertical flow filter seo et al 62 have found a significant p 0 05 negative correlation between tc and nitrogen in the nakdong river south korea these results appear reasonable because it has been reported that the alkaline environment was harmful for coliform survival 44 thus the abundance of nitrogen in large quantities increases the release of hydroxide through denitrification 53 which consequently improves the removal of tc bacteria therefore the removal of nitrogen helps tc bacteria to survive for this reason tc can be considered as a relevant indicator to predict the removal of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor overall the analysis of the forward stepwise selection result indicated that the selected input variables are statistically relevant for predicting the output variables in addition all the studied variables were centered and scaled before making prediction with the nn model 3 3 results of neural network in this study the use of nn as a predictive tool was not chosen at random it has outperformed other types of algorithms e g cubist and multiple linear regression in predicting contaminant removal in the msl bioreactor 10 19 thus after identifying and scaling the input variables 80 of the available dataset were randomly selected to calibrate nn models the remaining part 20 was used to assess the accuracy of the developed models several nn structures were trained and tested to select the optimal nn architectures using the neuralnet function while compute function was used to predict the output variables the process of determining the number of hidden layers and their neuron numbers is challenging and still a complex issue 63 64 in this study trial and error strategy is employed to determine the optimal neural architecture for each output variable 65 this was accomplished by changing the number of hidden layers from one to three and neurons from one to thirteen until the overall training and testing performance was improved according to nguyen et al 66 a nn model with two or three hidden layers gives the best results similarly the current study found that two hidden layers were also sufficient and give the best accuracy for each output variable for predicting the removal of nh4 the nn structure consists of one input layer with 5 units two hidden layers each one with 10 units and the output layer with a single unit similarly the optimal nn structure for predicting the removal of tkn 5 7 4 1 and tn 5 9 6 1 has two hidden layers fig 6 similarly bagherzadeh et al 67 have employed two hidden layers to predict nitrogen in a wastewater treatment plant however although using the same approach by gong et al 68 they have found that only one hidden layer was required to predict nitrogen removal in aerobic granulation technology kumar et al 69 when predicting river nitrogen also found that the lowest error is reached at two hidden layers after which the network appears to have become overcomplicated as the error increased for three hidden layers fig 7 illustrates the nn input data regression for calibration and validation sets obtained results indicate that there is a small difference between the predicted and the real values for each output variable as cited before the metrics rmse r2 and mae were used to measure the models accuracy in calibration the mae values are ranging between 2 and 4 while the rmse values vary between 3 and 5 for the three output variables thus the r2 values are also very good and exceed up 0 930 in validation the mae and rmse for nh4 removal prediction are 4 942 and 6 105 respectively for the removal of tkn the predictions are 3 542 and 4 651 respectively and for the removal of tn the predictions are 3 506 and 4 721 respectively also the performances of nn shows a good fit between the predicted and the real values for nh4 removal r2 0 933 tkn removal r2 0 959 and tn removal r2 0 937 respectively after the calibration and the validation of the nn models and calculating the prediction error we have also examined the variation in the accuracy of the developed models using the cross validation technique according to brownlee 70 kuhn and johnson 71 cross validation is as a gold standard approach to evaluate nn models accuracy and to detect overfitting often with 10 folds thus the calibration and validation processes were repeated 10 times with random selection each time the final validation output for the nn model used equal to the average of the 10 validation scores calculated fig 7 shows the results of cross validation error cv error via box and whisker plot the average rmse and mae values obtained from the cv error technique for the removal of nh4 rmse 6 293 mae 4 333 tkn rmse 4 789 mae 3 574 and tn rmse 4 707 mae 3 307 were close to the error values of validation results the measured error amount is very low therefore the fitted nn models were accurate efficient and can be used to predict the removal rate of nitrogen by the msl bioreactor within the same context song et al 20 have also developed another machine learning model stepwise cluster analysis to simulate the removal of nitrogen from domestic sewage in the msl bioreactor the model input variables were derived from the removal of bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 no3 tn total phosphorus tp and time the r2 values for the test sets of tn and nh4 were 0 981 and 0 951 respectively using the same treatment technology hong et al 8 have also used a sca model to predict the removal of tn using oxidation reduction potential orp do ph and the removal of nitrogen nh4 and no3 as inputs data their predictions resulted in high r2 r2 0 940 and the sca model was also accurate however the novelty of the present study was the first to predict nitrogen removal using only the concentrations of the selected variables in the influent in addition this study aims to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between nitrogen removal and relevant input variables including coliform bacteria and to highlight their order of importance 3 4 variable importance in this study the nn method has successfully addressed the nonlinear complexities of nitrogen removal processes in the msl bioreactor 20 furthermore for a precise reflection of nitrogen removal mechanisms using this method 72 the variable importance analysis was carried out by using the olden equation 73 as can be seen in fig 8 the hlr appears to be negatively influencing nitrogen removal this finding is consistent with the feature selection results fig 5 indeed nitrogen removal efficiency decreases when increasing the hlr from 250 l m2 day to 4000 l m2 day table1 therefore higher hlrs shorten the residence time of nitrogen within the msl media and in turn reduce the efficiency of nitrification and denitrification processes however the result of variable importance reveals that biodegradable organic matter bod5 is the most important parameter influencing tn removal in the msl bioreactor this result is in agreement with the conclusions reported by latarch et al 44 who indicated that organic carbon in the msl increases the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying communities which intensifies nitrification and denitrification mechanisms as for tc level sbahi et al 10 have reported that this parameter is in nonlinear relationship with nitrification and denitrification mechanisms within msl bioreactor indeed tc are considered as a competitor to nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria around organic matter which will indirectly contribute to the decrease of nitrogen removal processes and in turn reducing tn removal rate thus decreasing their level will promote nitrogen removal mechanisms in the msl bioreactor regarding do level this input variable is classified as the less important in terms of contribution in removing tn this implies that the msl bioreactor s anaerobic environment mainly enhances the denitrification process and as a result boosts tn removal rate overall the suggested nn models can reliably be used to consistently optimize nitrogen removal processes in the msl bioreactor 4 conclusion as a low cost and green technology msl bioreactor with vertical flow regime supports high hlr and it is an emerging solution for wastewater treatment in rural areas this is the first study to try to estimate nitrogen removal based on the concentration of water quality indicators in the influent in addition this work looks at the influential factors that affect nitrogen removal in the msl bioreactor the effect of the hlr was significant p 0 05 in pollutant removal the improvement of the purification processes of the nitrogen removal adsorption nitrification and denitrification under a low hlr may be due to the increase of the hydraulic retention time the aic forward stepwise selection has revealed the relevant variables that influence the removal of nh4 tkn and tn using a nn with two hidden layers the models developed have predicted the output variables with high accuracy r2 exceed up 0 93 hence the nn may be used successfully for predicting the performance of the msl bioreactor furthermore investigation of linear and nonlinear relationships between various types of potential bacteria hydraulic retention time hlr and pollutant removal in the msl bioreactor with horizontal flow it s probable that this will happen as soon as possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare no
