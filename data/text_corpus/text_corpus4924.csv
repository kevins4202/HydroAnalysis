24620,the small pelagic fishery in the southern philippines is one of the largest contributors to fisheries production in the country and is dominated by the bali sardine sardinella lemuru this species is a year round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the northeast monsoon nem months of november to february however there is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species survival during its early life history stages here we attempt to discern the importance of temperature prey density and advection on sardine larvae the larvae were represented as passive particles that were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal the conditions the larvae experienced namely temperature and estimated prey density based on satellite chlorophyll a values were recorded at each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days the temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed that sardines spawned during the nem months experienced higher chlorophyll a lower more optimal sea surface temperature albeit higher advective loss than sardines spawned during other months comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch years sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher retention nearshore our results emphasize that sardine stock management efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently in catches keywords sardinella lemuru biophysical model pre recruitment conditions larval dispersal temporal variability 1 introduction the bali sardine sardinella lemuru dominates the small pelagic fishery in the southern philippines and a large postharvest industry is dependent on this single species willette et al 2011 rola et al 2018 this species is also classified under the near threatened status according to the iucn 2019 in developing effective management strategies that can address threats to the sardine fishery there is a need to understand the high variability in sardine stock population buchary et al 2002 gaol et al 2004 since stock variability can partially be predicted by pre recruitment patterns houde 2009 shelton and mangel 2011 gallego et al 2012 katara 2014 this study aimed to establish estimates on the variability of the main environmental factors that may affect recruitment success of s lemuru larvae rooting back to johan hjort s critical period hypothesis hjort 1914 fisheries oceanography has put forward different theories e g aberrant drift match mismatch stable ocean member vagrant etc to identify the different pre recruitment conditions and processes that could explain stock variability werner and quinlan 2002 houde 2008 katara 2014 although these studies have demonstrated that different environmental variables contribute to varying degrees of predictability for different species and regions it could be deduced that the key concept to recruitment success is that spawning location and timing is an adaptive strategy for larvae to experience the most optimal conditions for growth and survival conversely this should result in lower mortality risks during the critical early life period in which the large variability in mortality determines recruitment variations in year classes miller 2007 three year reproductive biology data of s lemuru particularly in the bohol sea and the southeastern portion of the sulu sea fig 1 show that main spawning occurs during the northeast monsoon months of november to february with the maximum between december and january de guzman et al 2015a and 2015b with a markedly lower secondary spawning event between july to august campos and bagarinao 2019 this is marked by increased gonadosomatic index values fig 1 comparable to the western australian population gaughan and mitchell 2000 and of the similar tropical sardine sardinella longiceps in oman al jufaili 2012 along with an increase in the percentage of stage 4 mature or spawning adults landry and mcquinn 1988 to understand the link between pre recruitment processes and stock variability the first step would be to identify what seasonally varying factors in the sardine environment coincide with the observed peak in spawning activity knowing these factors and how they affect larval populations their interannual variations can then be used to surmise potential changes in the recruited stock for later months following the subsequent maturation of larvae spawned within a particular period the principal factors affecting survival of larvae are predation intra species interactions and environmental factors of food availability temperature and transport houde 2008 kuparinen et al 2014 this study focused on the density independent factors that dominate during the early life stages namely food availability temperature and transport or advection myers 2002 houde 2008 the most influential density independent factors on recruitment variability of larvae are prey abundance and temperature katara 2014 fiechter et al 2015 politikos et al 2018 sanchez garrido et al 2019 density dependent factors are recognized to play an important role in fish population dynamics and can be mediated by food availability hilborn and walters 1992 rose et al 2001 cahuin et al 2009 however specifying and disentangling their impact relative to density independent factors remain controversial and challenging rose et al 2001 density dependent factors may be more significant for the juvenile stage ohlberger et al 2014 but is beyond the scope of this study models on japanese sardines have verified that sardine stock fluctuation is caused by variabilities in mortality during the pre recruitment stages when survival is heavily dependent on larval sardine prey abundance suda and kishida 2003 suda et al 2005 theories on prey abundance and timing e g critical period and match mismatch have been given much attention as these directly affect starvation and growth trends correlating satellite derived products with sardine catch in the southern philippines villanoy et al 2011 and the bali strait gaol et al 2004 sartimbul 2010 have demonstrated that the increase in sardine abundance has a positive relationship with chlorophyll a representing the food supply for the sardine larvae gaol et al 2004 recent studies using more advanced sardine population models designate small zooplankton as larval prey fiechter et al 2015 sanchez garrido et al 2019 high chlorophyll a levels were found to correspond with high phytoplankton camoying 2016 camoying and yñiguez 2016 and zooplankton concentrations acabado et al 2018 within the bohol sea and as such chlorophyll a can be used as a proxy for sardine larval prey in this region temperature is pinpointed to be the most associated factor to recruitment even in the tropics where there is a narrow range of surface ocean temperatures houde 2009 temperature is most influential on the early life stages haslob et al 2012 acting indirectly as a driver for variations in hydrography and as an indicator of optimal conditions e g upwellings and blooms katara 2014 but more importantly as a direct factor affecting metabolism and growth rates houde 2009 egg buoyancy ospina alvarez et al 2012a ospina alvarez et al 2012b and ovarian maturation ganias et al 2014 much of early life mortality is due to transport or advective loss peck and hufnagl 2012 retention of larvae can significantly contribute to recruitment brochier et al 2011 such that spawning grounds have evolved to be in areas that increase the likelihood of stock integrity fogarty and o brien 2009 measuring larval advective loss and retention within the southern philippines should take into account its complex geomorphology consisting of multiple bays islands and relatively deep basins and its dynamic circulation patterns driven by monsoonal and el niño southern oscillation enso related climate variations gordon et al 2011 lermusiaux et al 2011 because of the practical challenges to studying larvae in situ staaterman et al 2012 the emergence of coupled biophysical models cbpms has opened up an opportunity to identify advective losses from natural mortality paris 2009 providing a mechanistic understanding of early life history at spatial and temporal scales that is difficult to capture by conventional field methods werner et al 2007 lett et al 2008 such cbpms have been successfully used to understand the population dynamics of small pelagics in temperate areas using detailed individual based representations of various life history components e g suda and kishida 2003 le fur and simon 2009 okunishi et al 2009 garcía garcía et al 2016 politikos et al 2018 ideally a more complete life cycle model would be used however due to limited information on the necessary biological parameters to construct such models for the tropical sardine s lemuru we opted to use a simpler cbpm with less uncertainty using a cbpm this study investigates the range of early life conditions that sardinella lemuru larvae are exposed to in the southern philippines to give insights to the following questions 1 what are the conditions experienced by larvae spawned at different months and are there distinct conditions characterizing the peak spawning period 2 how does the interannual variability in these conditions affect larval recruitment and potentially account for observed stock population variability 2 methods the cbpm was developed by linking offline daily velocity outputs from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom chassignet et al 2007 dataset with a particle dispersal model using mason which is a simulation toolkit written in java luke et al 2005 as platform the 1 12 global hycom model was shown to sufficiently reproduce pertinent features of the bohol sea hurlburt et al 2011 the purpose of the model is to enable lagrangian tracking of sardine larvae and their experienced environmental conditions the model domain extends from 4 6 n to 9 793 n and 119 6 e to 125 594 e with three independent depth layers representing the top 30 m ocean surface the model space was assumed to be orthogonal with a horizontal resolution of 1 km producing a 578 by 667 arakawa c grid interpolated to this grid are three staggered depth integrated current m s 1 layers consisting of the surface layer 0 10 m depth 10 20 m depth and 20 30 m depth kriging interpolation was used to mask out blank cells due to clouds from monthly composite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data on chlorophyll a mg m 3 and sea surface temperature c these were inputted into cell centers during the start of each simulation month and assumed to be static for each monthly duration and homogeneous across all depth layers representing the mixed layer depth which was measured to be less than 50 m in the bohol sea cabrera et al 2011 villanoy et al 2011 chlorophyll a serves as a proxy for prey availability and sea surface temperature is the assumed ocean temperature across the mixed layer depth hobday and hartog 2014 the model environment is populated by passive particles representing sardine larvae larval transport comprises a deterministic computation of a new position as a function of the ambient horizontal currents at specific depth layers interpolated across space and time using a fourth order runge kutta advection scheme the turbulent diffusion of the larvae particles is computed from the stochastic function based on polovina et al 1999 in which the value of the diffusion rate used is 0 579 m2 s 1 estimated from an assumed diffusion length scale of 1 km okubo 1971 corresponding to the model resolution sardines remain in a specific depth layer for the duration of each simulation and are unable to return to the domain once they traverse the model s open boundary limits when encountering land boundaries particles are modelled to reflect from the coast at the angle of incidence density dependent interactions like competition for space and prey are not considered as each sardine individual moves independently of others initialization of each model simulation involved randomly seeding 3 000 sardine larvae in each of the six bays identified as spawning grounds based on spatially explicit locations of spawning s lemuru from october 2012 to may 2014 de guzman et al 2015a and 2015b preliminary sensitivity analysis on the number of seeded sardines showed that at high values this parameter had no significant effect on model output p 0 005 based on field of unexplained variance fuv analysis simons et al 2013 the model was initialized every 5 days from october 2008 to june 2014 413 simulation dates for each of the three depth layers yielding a total of 1 239 simulations and replicated 10 times this amounted to at least 450 000 larvae simulated from each bay for a single month the model was run at 5 minute time intervals to satisfy the courant friedrich lewy condition that no individual can cross more than one grid cell in one time step lacroix et al 2009 during every time step a new latitude longitude position was computed and the chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature value at this position was recorded for each sardine individual tracking was done for 60 days which fully encompasses the approximately one month development of the sardine larvae from yolk sack to juvenile stage campos et al 2015 a 15 km buffer region from the coast was used as an arbitrary threshold for larval retention representing the area in which sardine fishers have been observed fig 2 sardines in the philippines are generally located in coastal areas up to 200 m depth willette et al 2011 which in the case of the modeled area is well inside the buffer region this 15 km buffer region also represents what is considered municipal waters that are used for sardine fishery management sardines present inside this region by day 60 were assumed to have been recruited to the sardine population brochier et al 2008 the model domain was also constrained to this area since the region contains the two main stocks and known spawning grounds of s lemuru de guzman et al 2015b campos and bagarinao 2019 results from a regional connectivity model for coral reef and associated species also suggests limited larval dispersal from the north or southwest into the modelled domain pata and yñiguez 2019 but connections occurred within as also corroborated by genetic information labrador et al 2021 at the end of the simulation the recorded conditions of all recruited sardines were averaged to represent the mean experienced conditions of the sardine larvae kobayashi and polovina 2006 larval mortality was not considered in the model to maximize the model s ability to capture the range of potential environmental conditions the larvae could experience the model results do not represent the absolute percent retention of larvae and only the relative differences between simulations were analyzed kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance was used to compare model outputs between replicates months and years while pearson s correlation was used to compare between depths significance level used for these tests was p 0 01 the percentage retained within the buffer zone experienced chlorophyll a and temperature conditions were similarly evaluated across the simulation depths monthly averages and peak spawning season per year 3 results between replicate differences in all measured variables retention experienced chlorophyll a and experienced temperature were very minimal with no significant differences but these variables were significantly correlated with depth since chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature were assumed to be homogeneous from surface to 30 m depth the differences in experienced conditions between depths are explained only by variations in horizontal transport per simulated depth layer and not due to variations of the other parameters with depth this is generally due to the decrease of model current magnitudes with depth which retains more larvae within highly productive colder coastal waters regardless of the depth layer considered the consistency and similarity of results across replicates and depths provide confidence in the robustness of the distinct seasonal and interannual patterns that emerge 3 1 seasonal differences in conditions encountered by sardine larvae model simulation dates were binned according to month of spawning and depth significant monthly differences in retention experienced chlorophyll a and temperature were found for all depth layers during the peak spawning months of november to february retention was lower compared to other months figs 3 a 3b 3c with a median range of 32 to 50 of spawned larvae retained within the buffer region regardless of simulation depth highest median retention was experienced by larvae spawned during july while lowest median retention was experienced by larvae spawned during february the median experienced chlorophyll a was highest for larvae spawned from november to february and the magnitude and range drops for the may cohort and remains relatively low until the september cohort figs 3d 3e 3f experienced chlorophyll a has a distinct spike for sardines spawned from december to january with median values ranging from 2 7 3 mg m 3 the lowest experienced chlorophyll a by the august cohort is around 1 5 mg m 3 which can still be considered highly productive compared to oligotrophic conditions smith et al 1999 chavez et al 2011 the median experienced sea surface temperature was lowest for larvae spawned from november to february with values dropping to around 28 c for december and january cohorts figs 3g 3h 3i experienced sea surface temperature peaks for the july cohort with an increase in the median value of around 2 c in summary sardines spawned during the peak spawning months of november to february experienced lower potential for retention higher experienced chlorophyll a and lower temperature 3 2 interannual differences in conditions encountered by sardine larvae interannual comparisons were done by binning all model simulations initiated during the peak spawning months of november to february for each cohort year at each simulation depth significant differences for all three variables at each simulated depth layer were found for the upper 2 layers retention was lowest for the 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 cohorts and highest for the 2011 2012 cohort figs 4 a 4b 4c the first two modeled cohorts experienced around 20 to 30 less retained larvae than the cohort of 2011 2012 retention was relatively higher from 2011 2012 to 2013 2014 with a smaller range in values for the 20 30 m depth layer at this bottom depth layer there was a relative increase in retention for the first two cohort years 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 likely due to the weakening of currents observed at all bays there was relatively less variability in experienced chlorophyll a across years except for a distinct spike and a low experienced chlorophyll a was highest for the 2009 2010 cohort reaching median values of around 6 11 mg m 3 figs 4d 4e 4f for the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 cohorts median values were slightly higher relative to the two previous cohort years but the third quartile ranges of chlorophyll a increased by around 2 4 mg m 3 lowest experienced chlorophyll a at around 1 5 2 mg m 3 was from the 2011 2012 cohort across all depths larvae spawned during the first four cohort years experienced higher temperatures than the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 cohorts with a decrease in median values by around 0 5 c figs 4g 4h 4i the range in experienced temperature starts to increase during the 2011 2012 cohort although the median value was not significantly different compared to previous years 4 discussion the conditions experienced by the recruited sardines demonstrated considerable sensitivity to the circulation patterns determining the larval tracks evidenced by both temporal and depth variability of the results apparent highs and lows in median experienced conditions are observed seasonally fig 3 and interannually fig 4 but occasions of abrupt changes for particular batches of larvae spawned at least 5 days apart are common as marked by wide ranges and numerous outlier values with regard to simulation depth the deepest modeled layer often resulted in higher retention and lower experienced temperature and chlorophyll a this is likely due to weakened horizontal transport at this layer compared to the upper layers however the variability between simulation depths is often less than the temporal variability for the analyzed parameters the high sensitivity to transport and the resulting ambient environmental conditions experienced by the larvae emphasize that the model results are highly dependent on the validity of the hydrodynamic model used hurlburt et al 2011 has shown that the global hycom dataset sufficiently captures the general circulation patterns in the modeled domain thus providing support to the distinct emergent patterns discussed below 4 1 seasonal differences in conditions experienced by sardine larvae and the peak spawning period based on the established theories on larval recruitment houde 2008 katara 2014 high recruitment should be expected when larval retention is high temperature is within the optimal window and prey density is high this study assumes that s lemuru has adapted its spawning timing to maximize recruitment interestingly contrary to those larval recruitment theories outputs from this study show that retention within coastal areas is lower for sardines simulated during the peak spawning months of november to february compared to other months during november to february coinciding with the northeast monsoon mean current patterns tend to result in more offshore transport in dipolog sindangan bay northern zamboanga peninsula ichthyoplankton data from a 2014 survey supports the southward offshore transport of larvae during the nem campos et al 2015 rola et al 2018 for the western portion of the modeled domain zamboanga peninsula this may be due to the monsoonal upwelling conditions occurring around the same period villanoy et al 2011 for the rest of the spawning grounds the seasonal variability of the bohol jet and the iligan eddy fig 2 cabrera et al 2011 may be contributing mechanisms if the sardines were to spawn during periods of favorable transport and retention around june to august they would experience conditions with low prey abundance and possibly less optimal temperature conditions fig 3 peck and hufnagl 2012 the peak in spawning occurring during months of lower potential retention implies that these other factors provide greater benefits for the recruitment of sardine larvae during this period based on the composite chlorophyll a values within the buffer area for every simulated month from modis images concentrations spiked from january to march not shown and these elevated chlorophyll conditions are experienced by sardines spawned from november to february fig 3 larval growth rates calculated from sagittal otoliths of s lemuru juveniles collected from the zamboanga peninsula showed the highest rates for individuals hatched by january for 2011 and 2012 corresponding to peak chlorophyll a levels within the spawning season bagarinao et al 2018 during the peak spawning months spawning areas are highly productive to begin with and observations of model simulations show that much of the cells with low chlorophyll a concentrations are not traversed by the sardines the increase in prey density translates into more optimal growth conditions and less mortality due to starvation however the detailed causal relationship between food density growth and survival for s lemuru has yet to be established it is likely that sardine larvae experience a satiation point beyond which any increase in available prey cannot be exploited mann 1982 and would not result in any improvement in growth conditions the lowest median concentration of experienced chlorophyll a by the august cohort around 1 5 mg m 3 already signifies productive waters in tropical areas smith et al 1999 chavez et al 2011 this may mean that despite observed spikes in experienced chlorophyll a for peak spawning season cohorts prey availability may already be sufficient year round this would suggest that seasonality in prey density may be less of a controlling factor for the timing of sardine spawning in the area the impact of the influence of starvation induced mortality on recruitment has been tempered by the recognition of other key factors like temperature related length and growth dependent mortality gallego et al 2012 as well as how feeding dynamics is modulated by satiation a model by huebert and peck 2014 demonstrated that larval phenotype for faster metabolism is naturally selected when prey is abundant metabolism is a function of ambient temperature thus implying that for productive areas such as the coastal waters of the southern philippines larval behavior may have been more attuned to temperature variability than prey availability the greater than 2 c magnitude of temperature range across months fig 3 may be sufficient for the sardines to have evolved behavioral adaptations towards those most optimal for growth and survival the range of the optimal temperature windows for north pacific sardines have been found to be species specific takasuka et al 2008 and thus the dynamics of the fluctuation of sardine populations must be investigated in the local context experienced temperature is significantly lowest during spawning period months median of 28 c suggesting that the optimal temperatures for s lemuru may be at the lower range of the temperature in the region this coincides with the 27 8 c preferred mean temperature of this species estimated from distribution models froese and pauly 2020 temperature varies seasonally in the southern philippine region in which during the northeast monsoon surface temperatures become colder cabrera et al 2011 villanoy et al 2011 thus sardines may have evolved to spawn at higher levels during this optimal temperature window recruitment success may be viewed as the result of an overall reduction in natural mortality although retention is lowest for sardines spawned during the observed peak spawning months of november to february these larvae are able to experience higher chlorophyll a and lower sea surface temperatures which might be a sufficient trade off to transport loss the observed spawning timing capitalizes on exposing larvae to abundant prey and relatively lower temperatures hypothesized to lead to better growth kühn et al 2008 and survival during the critical pre recruitment period 4 2 interannual differences in conditions experienced by sardine larvae and implications on adult sardine catch the interannual variability of environmental conditions in the northern zamboanga coastal upwelling has been documented for sea surface temperature rainfall and chlorophyll a concentrations villanoy et al 2011 these were linked to the upwelling strength and consequently fish catch in the area which is dominated by s lemuru in this study we highlight the more direct link of environmental factors on s lemuru populations and also include the role of advection sardine larvae can experience distinct interannual differences in these environmental conditions particularly for retention and temperature which can have important implications for sardine catches hydrodynamic processes can play an important role in the interannual supply of small pelagic fish larvae in the central mediterranean seas variability in larval retention due to advection accounted for up to 70 of anchovy stock biomass and catch trends patti et al 2020 periods of strong upwellings resulting in high chlorophyll a but high offshore transport of larvae resulted in low recruitment years for sardine fisheries in california logerwell et al 2001 and portugal santos et al 2005 our results show that ocean circulation can also impact sardine larval recruitment in southern philippines low retention conditions occurred when surface currents were strongly offshore e g from november 2009 to february 2010 fig 5 a due to the intensified upwelling as well as the northwestwardly directed currents exiting the dipolog strait aside from upwelling strength differences in currents associated with the bohol jet may be an important mechanism for transport variability for the first three simulated years the bohol jet carrying larvae from the bohol sea turns to flow strongly northward as it leaves the dipolog strait fig 5 a thus reducing retention during high retention years as exemplified by currents from november 2011 to february 2012 fig 5b the direction of the exiting bohol jet flows directly westward producing a turbulent wake offshore of the dipolog bay which may have caused an increase in local retention and importation to the dipolog dapitan and sindangan bays from the bohol sea spawning areas s lemuru larvae can also experience less ideal temperature conditions across years during the first three years they experienced temperatures above their average preferred temperature of 27 8 c while the latter years transitioned into temperatures closer to their preferred temperature the relationship of temperature with larval growth abundances and recruitment is variable running the gamut from no relationship positive negative and dome shaped lluch belda et al 1991 jacobson and maccall 1995 mcclatchie et al 2010 fernández corredor et al 2020 and references therein spawners in the study area were observed to occur most frequently in waters with temperatures between 27 5 28 c and exhibited a dome shaped relationship with a minimum of 25 5 c and maximum of 30 5 c villanoy et al 2015 apart from being an indicator of upwelling shifts away from these more optimal temperature conditions in the spawning and recruitment areas could have domino effects on recruitment strength out of the three environmental factors investigated the chlorophyll a concentration experienced by sardine larvae did not have a distinct pattern of interannual variability chlorophyll a has been identified to be a good indicator of interannual s lemuru catches in the northern mindanao population villanoy et al 2011 and for the bali population sartimbul et al 2010 higher chlorophyll a conditions and primary productivity are broadly positively related to higher larval abundances and recruitment mann and lazier 2013 fernández corredor et al 2020 and references therein however the interplay of the effects of food availability and physical factors on larval recruitment and hence fish populations are recognized to be important this is embodied in bakun s triad requirements bakun 1998 for high fish productivity 1 nutrient enrichment 2 larval food aggregation and 3 larval retention cury and roy 1989 also surmise through the optimal environmental window hypothesis that the optimum condition for larval survival occurs at moderate upwelling intensities which reduces losses from advection and turbulence yet still provides enough nutrient enrichment and primary production as previously discussed chlorophyll a concentrations experienced by the sardine larvae during the nem season could be sufficient at the levels observed in this study and thus variabilities in larval recruitment could be more strongly impacted by advection and temperature interannual differences the life history of these small pelagic fishes is characterized by early sexual maturity high egg production but low survival rates to adults and relatively short life spans coupled with their mostly passive dispersal during their early life history stages these characteristics lead to high vulnerability to variabilities in environmental forcing which can then impact recruitment success into the sardine stocks the distinct interannual differences in the conditions experienced by sardine larvae could partly explain the variability also observed in sardine catches during these years fisheries data from three different sources generally show a pattern where 2009 to 2011 were low catch years and 2012 to 2014 were high catch years fig 6 these observed interannual patterns in the catch of adult sardines coincide with the interannual differences in the environmental conditions of the sardine larvae spawned during the peak spawning period the low catches during march to july 2009 corresponded to poor modelled environmental conditions for the november 2008 to february 2009 cohort which experienced low retention recruits for this period experienced relatively lower chlorophyll a and higher presumed to be less optimal temperatures the large spike in the experienced chlorophyll a for the 2009 to 2010 cohort did not seem to translate to an increase in the sardine population as catches from march to july 2010 were still relatively low suggesting that prey availability may have been outweighed by the low retention and high sst experienced by this cohort favorable current patterns resulting in larval retention within the coastal areas possibly plays a big role in predicting adult populations particularly within the dipolog dapitan and sindangan bay areas as the observed increase in sardine catch since 2011 coincides with the increase in modelled larval retention as well as more optimal sst and relatively high experienced chlorophyll a overall these general catch patterns can potentially partly be explained by the interannual variabilities in environmental conditions however consideration of lag times in recruitment and other stock fishery dynamics should be considered in further analysis in 2011 an annual sardine fishing closure covering the period december to february of each year was started by the department of agriculture da and the department of interior and local government dilg of the philippines through the issuance of a joint da dilg administrative order jao 2011 this was implemented as a means of protecting adult spawners it should be noted that despite the legislated ban sporadic commercial sardine fishing during the ban period still occurred de guzman et al 2015a nonetheless the increase in sardine catches fig 6 after 2011 has been touted as due to the effectiveness of the ban in reducing fishing mortality and increasing recruitment rola et al 2018 and serves as affirmation of the success of the management measure department of agriculture 2014 fishing effort has been identified to exert considerable pressure on sardine fisheries which are sensitive to environmental controls suda et al 2005 in addition to the reduction of fishing mortality of spawning adults during the closure period resulting in recruitment success the model results suggest that the environmental conditions experienced by sardine larvae also improved during years when the fishing closure was implemented although disentangling and quantifying the relative contributions of larval retention prey availability and temperature conditions to interannual variability of recruitment success and the adult population size is beyond the scope of this study the interplay of these environmental conditions with fishing mortality can have an overall impact on sardine larval recruitment and consequently adult sardine catches within the southern philippines as has also been observed for sardine populations and landed catch around the globe alheit and peck 2019 chavez et al 2003 santos et al 2012 somarakis et al 2019 5 summary and recommendations short lived small pelagics such as s lemuru are highly affected by regional weather patterns houde 2009 which heighten the risk from present and future stressors to recruitment katara 2014 similar to the s lemuru population in indonesia sartimbul et al 2010 sambah et al 2012 the variability in the southern philippines stock is related to productivity in the area the modeled trends in environmental conditions imply that the spawning patterns observed are adaptations to maximize sardine recruitment this study elucidates that not only is recruitment success associated with productive surface waters during the northeast monsoon transport and temperature also significantly modulate the observed spawning seasonality during the peak spawning season the reduced retention of larvae near the coastal waters may be offset by reduced mortalities due to improved prey density and cooler temperatures which are hypothesized to be more optimal analysis of interannual differences in the experienced conditions of larvae in the peak spawning months suggests that years with improved environmental conditions for spawned larvae high retention and experienced chlorophyll a and low experienced temperature can increase recruitment to the stock to quantify the role of fishing mortality and changing environmental conditions in sardine population variability in a more detailed manner would require improving the model to incorporate the full sardine life cycle e g biogenergetic growth models and developmental stage parameters together with realistic natural and fishing mortality rates this is currently not possible with the available information on s lemuru in the philippines the most important data gaps to be supplemented are the identification of the specific thermal niche of s lemuru stock and its reproductive success with regard to variabilities in ambient temperatures studying the temperature recruitment relationship specific to s lemuru is vital in modeling the effects of climate change especially since larvae at the tropics which are presently used to a narrow temperature range will experience greater shifts in temperature llopiz et al 2014 further insight into the diel vertical migration specific for s lemuru is also recommended since larvae are known to regulate their vertical position to take advantage of the vertical stratification of currents kristiansen et al 2009 sponaugle et al 2002 the minimal yet significant effect of the depth occupied by sardines in the simulation highlights the need to collect in situ information regarding the position of sardine larvae and adults with depth to inform future modeling efforts the current model captures key factors known to influence small pelagic fishes such as sardines however incorporating more detailed life history processes as they interact with environmental conditions could fine tune and shift the importance of particular factors contributing to their population dynamics though this model covers the primary spawning grounds and stocks of s lemuru expanding the spatial coverage of the model to cover a larger domain can provide insights into connections to other areas across different life stages it is critical that sardine stock management measures take into account the ranges of environmental parameters that are suitable for sardine recruitment in order to understand the role of the environment in recruitment variability and potential reduction of the sardine population s resilience from fishing pressures kuparinen et al 2014 this is especially needed considering the influence of enso and climate change modeling approaches such as the one we have used if validated with fish stock information

24620,the small pelagic fishery in the southern philippines is one of the largest contributors to fisheries production in the country and is dominated by the bali sardine sardinella lemuru this species is a year round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the northeast monsoon nem months of november to february however there is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species survival during its early life history stages here we attempt to discern the importance of temperature prey density and advection on sardine larvae the larvae were represented as passive particles that were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal the conditions the larvae experienced namely temperature and estimated prey density based on satellite chlorophyll a values were recorded at each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days the temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed that sardines spawned during the nem months experienced higher chlorophyll a lower more optimal sea surface temperature albeit higher advective loss than sardines spawned during other months comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch years sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher retention nearshore our results emphasize that sardine stock management efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently in catches keywords sardinella lemuru biophysical model pre recruitment conditions larval dispersal temporal variability 1 introduction the bali sardine sardinella lemuru dominates the small pelagic fishery in the southern philippines and a large postharvest industry is dependent on this single species willette et al 2011 rola et al 2018 this species is also classified under the near threatened status according to the iucn 2019 in developing effective management strategies that can address threats to the sardine fishery there is a need to understand the high variability in sardine stock population buchary et al 2002 gaol et al 2004 since stock variability can partially be predicted by pre recruitment patterns houde 2009 shelton and mangel 2011 gallego et al 2012 katara 2014 this study aimed to establish estimates on the variability of the main environmental factors that may affect recruitment success of s lemuru larvae rooting back to johan hjort s critical period hypothesis hjort 1914 fisheries oceanography has put forward different theories e g aberrant drift match mismatch stable ocean member vagrant etc to identify the different pre recruitment conditions and processes that could explain stock variability werner and quinlan 2002 houde 2008 katara 2014 although these studies have demonstrated that different environmental variables contribute to varying degrees of predictability for different species and regions it could be deduced that the key concept to recruitment success is that spawning location and timing is an adaptive strategy for larvae to experience the most optimal conditions for growth and survival conversely this should result in lower mortality risks during the critical early life period in which the large variability in mortality determines recruitment variations in year classes miller 2007 three year reproductive biology data of s lemuru particularly in the bohol sea and the southeastern portion of the sulu sea fig 1 show that main spawning occurs during the northeast monsoon months of november to february with the maximum between december and january de guzman et al 2015a and 2015b with a markedly lower secondary spawning event between july to august campos and bagarinao 2019 this is marked by increased gonadosomatic index values fig 1 comparable to the western australian population gaughan and mitchell 2000 and of the similar tropical sardine sardinella longiceps in oman al jufaili 2012 along with an increase in the percentage of stage 4 mature or spawning adults landry and mcquinn 1988 to understand the link between pre recruitment processes and stock variability the first step would be to identify what seasonally varying factors in the sardine environment coincide with the observed peak in spawning activity knowing these factors and how they affect larval populations their interannual variations can then be used to surmise potential changes in the recruited stock for later months following the subsequent maturation of larvae spawned within a particular period the principal factors affecting survival of larvae are predation intra species interactions and environmental factors of food availability temperature and transport houde 2008 kuparinen et al 2014 this study focused on the density independent factors that dominate during the early life stages namely food availability temperature and transport or advection myers 2002 houde 2008 the most influential density independent factors on recruitment variability of larvae are prey abundance and temperature katara 2014 fiechter et al 2015 politikos et al 2018 sanchez garrido et al 2019 density dependent factors are recognized to play an important role in fish population dynamics and can be mediated by food availability hilborn and walters 1992 rose et al 2001 cahuin et al 2009 however specifying and disentangling their impact relative to density independent factors remain controversial and challenging rose et al 2001 density dependent factors may be more significant for the juvenile stage ohlberger et al 2014 but is beyond the scope of this study models on japanese sardines have verified that sardine stock fluctuation is caused by variabilities in mortality during the pre recruitment stages when survival is heavily dependent on larval sardine prey abundance suda and kishida 2003 suda et al 2005 theories on prey abundance and timing e g critical period and match mismatch have been given much attention as these directly affect starvation and growth trends correlating satellite derived products with sardine catch in the southern philippines villanoy et al 2011 and the bali strait gaol et al 2004 sartimbul 2010 have demonstrated that the increase in sardine abundance has a positive relationship with chlorophyll a representing the food supply for the sardine larvae gaol et al 2004 recent studies using more advanced sardine population models designate small zooplankton as larval prey fiechter et al 2015 sanchez garrido et al 2019 high chlorophyll a levels were found to correspond with high phytoplankton camoying 2016 camoying and yñiguez 2016 and zooplankton concentrations acabado et al 2018 within the bohol sea and as such chlorophyll a can be used as a proxy for sardine larval prey in this region temperature is pinpointed to be the most associated factor to recruitment even in the tropics where there is a narrow range of surface ocean temperatures houde 2009 temperature is most influential on the early life stages haslob et al 2012 acting indirectly as a driver for variations in hydrography and as an indicator of optimal conditions e g upwellings and blooms katara 2014 but more importantly as a direct factor affecting metabolism and growth rates houde 2009 egg buoyancy ospina alvarez et al 2012a ospina alvarez et al 2012b and ovarian maturation ganias et al 2014 much of early life mortality is due to transport or advective loss peck and hufnagl 2012 retention of larvae can significantly contribute to recruitment brochier et al 2011 such that spawning grounds have evolved to be in areas that increase the likelihood of stock integrity fogarty and o brien 2009 measuring larval advective loss and retention within the southern philippines should take into account its complex geomorphology consisting of multiple bays islands and relatively deep basins and its dynamic circulation patterns driven by monsoonal and el niño southern oscillation enso related climate variations gordon et al 2011 lermusiaux et al 2011 because of the practical challenges to studying larvae in situ staaterman et al 2012 the emergence of coupled biophysical models cbpms has opened up an opportunity to identify advective losses from natural mortality paris 2009 providing a mechanistic understanding of early life history at spatial and temporal scales that is difficult to capture by conventional field methods werner et al 2007 lett et al 2008 such cbpms have been successfully used to understand the population dynamics of small pelagics in temperate areas using detailed individual based representations of various life history components e g suda and kishida 2003 le fur and simon 2009 okunishi et al 2009 garcía garcía et al 2016 politikos et al 2018 ideally a more complete life cycle model would be used however due to limited information on the necessary biological parameters to construct such models for the tropical sardine s lemuru we opted to use a simpler cbpm with less uncertainty using a cbpm this study investigates the range of early life conditions that sardinella lemuru larvae are exposed to in the southern philippines to give insights to the following questions 1 what are the conditions experienced by larvae spawned at different months and are there distinct conditions characterizing the peak spawning period 2 how does the interannual variability in these conditions affect larval recruitment and potentially account for observed stock population variability 2 methods the cbpm was developed by linking offline daily velocity outputs from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom chassignet et al 2007 dataset with a particle dispersal model using mason which is a simulation toolkit written in java luke et al 2005 as platform the 1 12 global hycom model was shown to sufficiently reproduce pertinent features of the bohol sea hurlburt et al 2011 the purpose of the model is to enable lagrangian tracking of sardine larvae and their experienced environmental conditions the model domain extends from 4 6 n to 9 793 n and 119 6 e to 125 594 e with three independent depth layers representing the top 30 m ocean surface the model space was assumed to be orthogonal with a horizontal resolution of 1 km producing a 578 by 667 arakawa c grid interpolated to this grid are three staggered depth integrated current m s 1 layers consisting of the surface layer 0 10 m depth 10 20 m depth and 20 30 m depth kriging interpolation was used to mask out blank cells due to clouds from monthly composite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data on chlorophyll a mg m 3 and sea surface temperature c these were inputted into cell centers during the start of each simulation month and assumed to be static for each monthly duration and homogeneous across all depth layers representing the mixed layer depth which was measured to be less than 50 m in the bohol sea cabrera et al 2011 villanoy et al 2011 chlorophyll a serves as a proxy for prey availability and sea surface temperature is the assumed ocean temperature across the mixed layer depth hobday and hartog 2014 the model environment is populated by passive particles representing sardine larvae larval transport comprises a deterministic computation of a new position as a function of the ambient horizontal currents at specific depth layers interpolated across space and time using a fourth order runge kutta advection scheme the turbulent diffusion of the larvae particles is computed from the stochastic function based on polovina et al 1999 in which the value of the diffusion rate used is 0 579 m2 s 1 estimated from an assumed diffusion length scale of 1 km okubo 1971 corresponding to the model resolution sardines remain in a specific depth layer for the duration of each simulation and are unable to return to the domain once they traverse the model s open boundary limits when encountering land boundaries particles are modelled to reflect from the coast at the angle of incidence density dependent interactions like competition for space and prey are not considered as each sardine individual moves independently of others initialization of each model simulation involved randomly seeding 3 000 sardine larvae in each of the six bays identified as spawning grounds based on spatially explicit locations of spawning s lemuru from october 2012 to may 2014 de guzman et al 2015a and 2015b preliminary sensitivity analysis on the number of seeded sardines showed that at high values this parameter had no significant effect on model output p 0 005 based on field of unexplained variance fuv analysis simons et al 2013 the model was initialized every 5 days from october 2008 to june 2014 413 simulation dates for each of the three depth layers yielding a total of 1 239 simulations and replicated 10 times this amounted to at least 450 000 larvae simulated from each bay for a single month the model was run at 5 minute time intervals to satisfy the courant friedrich lewy condition that no individual can cross more than one grid cell in one time step lacroix et al 2009 during every time step a new latitude longitude position was computed and the chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature value at this position was recorded for each sardine individual tracking was done for 60 days which fully encompasses the approximately one month development of the sardine larvae from yolk sack to juvenile stage campos et al 2015 a 15 km buffer region from the coast was used as an arbitrary threshold for larval retention representing the area in which sardine fishers have been observed fig 2 sardines in the philippines are generally located in coastal areas up to 200 m depth willette et al 2011 which in the case of the modeled area is well inside the buffer region this 15 km buffer region also represents what is considered municipal waters that are used for sardine fishery management sardines present inside this region by day 60 were assumed to have been recruited to the sardine population brochier et al 2008 the model domain was also constrained to this area since the region contains the two main stocks and known spawning grounds of s lemuru de guzman et al 2015b campos and bagarinao 2019 results from a regional connectivity model for coral reef and associated species also suggests limited larval dispersal from the north or southwest into the modelled domain pata and yñiguez 2019 but connections occurred within as also corroborated by genetic information labrador et al 2021 at the end of the simulation the recorded conditions of all recruited sardines were averaged to represent the mean experienced conditions of the sardine larvae kobayashi and polovina 2006 larval mortality was not considered in the model to maximize the model s ability to capture the range of potential environmental conditions the larvae could experience the model results do not represent the absolute percent retention of larvae and only the relative differences between simulations were analyzed kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance was used to compare model outputs between replicates months and years while pearson s correlation was used to compare between depths significance level used for these tests was p 0 01 the percentage retained within the buffer zone experienced chlorophyll a and temperature conditions were similarly evaluated across the simulation depths monthly averages and peak spawning season per year 3 results between replicate differences in all measured variables retention experienced chlorophyll a and experienced temperature were very minimal with no significant differences but these variables were significantly correlated with depth since chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature were assumed to be homogeneous from surface to 30 m depth the differences in experienced conditions between depths are explained only by variations in horizontal transport per simulated depth layer and not due to variations of the other parameters with depth this is generally due to the decrease of model current magnitudes with depth which retains more larvae within highly productive colder coastal waters regardless of the depth layer considered the consistency and similarity of results across replicates and depths provide confidence in the robustness of the distinct seasonal and interannual patterns that emerge 3 1 seasonal differences in conditions encountered by sardine larvae model simulation dates were binned according to month of spawning and depth significant monthly differences in retention experienced chlorophyll a and temperature were found for all depth layers during the peak spawning months of november to february retention was lower compared to other months figs 3 a 3b 3c with a median range of 32 to 50 of spawned larvae retained within the buffer region regardless of simulation depth highest median retention was experienced by larvae spawned during july while lowest median retention was experienced by larvae spawned during february the median experienced chlorophyll a was highest for larvae spawned from november to february and the magnitude and range drops for the may cohort and remains relatively low until the september cohort figs 3d 3e 3f experienced chlorophyll a has a distinct spike for sardines spawned from december to january with median values ranging from 2 7 3 mg m 3 the lowest experienced chlorophyll a by the august cohort is around 1 5 mg m 3 which can still be considered highly productive compared to oligotrophic conditions smith et al 1999 chavez et al 2011 the median experienced sea surface temperature was lowest for larvae spawned from november to february with values dropping to around 28 c for december and january cohorts figs 3g 3h 3i experienced sea surface temperature peaks for the july cohort with an increase in the median value of around 2 c in summary sardines spawned during the peak spawning months of november to february experienced lower potential for retention higher experienced chlorophyll a and lower temperature 3 2 interannual differences in conditions encountered by sardine larvae interannual comparisons were done by binning all model simulations initiated during the peak spawning months of november to february for each cohort year at each simulation depth significant differences for all three variables at each simulated depth layer were found for the upper 2 layers retention was lowest for the 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 cohorts and highest for the 2011 2012 cohort figs 4 a 4b 4c the first two modeled cohorts experienced around 20 to 30 less retained larvae than the cohort of 2011 2012 retention was relatively higher from 2011 2012 to 2013 2014 with a smaller range in values for the 20 30 m depth layer at this bottom depth layer there was a relative increase in retention for the first two cohort years 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 likely due to the weakening of currents observed at all bays there was relatively less variability in experienced chlorophyll a across years except for a distinct spike and a low experienced chlorophyll a was highest for the 2009 2010 cohort reaching median values of around 6 11 mg m 3 figs 4d 4e 4f for the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 cohorts median values were slightly higher relative to the two previous cohort years but the third quartile ranges of chlorophyll a increased by around 2 4 mg m 3 lowest experienced chlorophyll a at around 1 5 2 mg m 3 was from the 2011 2012 cohort across all depths larvae spawned during the first four cohort years experienced higher temperatures than the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 cohorts with a decrease in median values by around 0 5 c figs 4g 4h 4i the range in experienced temperature starts to increase during the 2011 2012 cohort although the median value was not significantly different compared to previous years 4 discussion the conditions experienced by the recruited sardines demonstrated considerable sensitivity to the circulation patterns determining the larval tracks evidenced by both temporal and depth variability of the results apparent highs and lows in median experienced conditions are observed seasonally fig 3 and interannually fig 4 but occasions of abrupt changes for particular batches of larvae spawned at least 5 days apart are common as marked by wide ranges and numerous outlier values with regard to simulation depth the deepest modeled layer often resulted in higher retention and lower experienced temperature and chlorophyll a this is likely due to weakened horizontal transport at this layer compared to the upper layers however the variability between simulation depths is often less than the temporal variability for the analyzed parameters the high sensitivity to transport and the resulting ambient environmental conditions experienced by the larvae emphasize that the model results are highly dependent on the validity of the hydrodynamic model used hurlburt et al 2011 has shown that the global hycom dataset sufficiently captures the general circulation patterns in the modeled domain thus providing support to the distinct emergent patterns discussed below 4 1 seasonal differences in conditions experienced by sardine larvae and the peak spawning period based on the established theories on larval recruitment houde 2008 katara 2014 high recruitment should be expected when larval retention is high temperature is within the optimal window and prey density is high this study assumes that s lemuru has adapted its spawning timing to maximize recruitment interestingly contrary to those larval recruitment theories outputs from this study show that retention within coastal areas is lower for sardines simulated during the peak spawning months of november to february compared to other months during november to february coinciding with the northeast monsoon mean current patterns tend to result in more offshore transport in dipolog sindangan bay northern zamboanga peninsula ichthyoplankton data from a 2014 survey supports the southward offshore transport of larvae during the nem campos et al 2015 rola et al 2018 for the western portion of the modeled domain zamboanga peninsula this may be due to the monsoonal upwelling conditions occurring around the same period villanoy et al 2011 for the rest of the spawning grounds the seasonal variability of the bohol jet and the iligan eddy fig 2 cabrera et al 2011 may be contributing mechanisms if the sardines were to spawn during periods of favorable transport and retention around june to august they would experience conditions with low prey abundance and possibly less optimal temperature conditions fig 3 peck and hufnagl 2012 the peak in spawning occurring during months of lower potential retention implies that these other factors provide greater benefits for the recruitment of sardine larvae during this period based on the composite chlorophyll a values within the buffer area for every simulated month from modis images concentrations spiked from january to march not shown and these elevated chlorophyll conditions are experienced by sardines spawned from november to february fig 3 larval growth rates calculated from sagittal otoliths of s lemuru juveniles collected from the zamboanga peninsula showed the highest rates for individuals hatched by january for 2011 and 2012 corresponding to peak chlorophyll a levels within the spawning season bagarinao et al 2018 during the peak spawning months spawning areas are highly productive to begin with and observations of model simulations show that much of the cells with low chlorophyll a concentrations are not traversed by the sardines the increase in prey density translates into more optimal growth conditions and less mortality due to starvation however the detailed causal relationship between food density growth and survival for s lemuru has yet to be established it is likely that sardine larvae experience a satiation point beyond which any increase in available prey cannot be exploited mann 1982 and would not result in any improvement in growth conditions the lowest median concentration of experienced chlorophyll a by the august cohort around 1 5 mg m 3 already signifies productive waters in tropical areas smith et al 1999 chavez et al 2011 this may mean that despite observed spikes in experienced chlorophyll a for peak spawning season cohorts prey availability may already be sufficient year round this would suggest that seasonality in prey density may be less of a controlling factor for the timing of sardine spawning in the area the impact of the influence of starvation induced mortality on recruitment has been tempered by the recognition of other key factors like temperature related length and growth dependent mortality gallego et al 2012 as well as how feeding dynamics is modulated by satiation a model by huebert and peck 2014 demonstrated that larval phenotype for faster metabolism is naturally selected when prey is abundant metabolism is a function of ambient temperature thus implying that for productive areas such as the coastal waters of the southern philippines larval behavior may have been more attuned to temperature variability than prey availability the greater than 2 c magnitude of temperature range across months fig 3 may be sufficient for the sardines to have evolved behavioral adaptations towards those most optimal for growth and survival the range of the optimal temperature windows for north pacific sardines have been found to be species specific takasuka et al 2008 and thus the dynamics of the fluctuation of sardine populations must be investigated in the local context experienced temperature is significantly lowest during spawning period months median of 28 c suggesting that the optimal temperatures for s lemuru may be at the lower range of the temperature in the region this coincides with the 27 8 c preferred mean temperature of this species estimated from distribution models froese and pauly 2020 temperature varies seasonally in the southern philippine region in which during the northeast monsoon surface temperatures become colder cabrera et al 2011 villanoy et al 2011 thus sardines may have evolved to spawn at higher levels during this optimal temperature window recruitment success may be viewed as the result of an overall reduction in natural mortality although retention is lowest for sardines spawned during the observed peak spawning months of november to february these larvae are able to experience higher chlorophyll a and lower sea surface temperatures which might be a sufficient trade off to transport loss the observed spawning timing capitalizes on exposing larvae to abundant prey and relatively lower temperatures hypothesized to lead to better growth kühn et al 2008 and survival during the critical pre recruitment period 4 2 interannual differences in conditions experienced by sardine larvae and implications on adult sardine catch the interannual variability of environmental conditions in the northern zamboanga coastal upwelling has been documented for sea surface temperature rainfall and chlorophyll a concentrations villanoy et al 2011 these were linked to the upwelling strength and consequently fish catch in the area which is dominated by s lemuru in this study we highlight the more direct link of environmental factors on s lemuru populations and also include the role of advection sardine larvae can experience distinct interannual differences in these environmental conditions particularly for retention and temperature which can have important implications for sardine catches hydrodynamic processes can play an important role in the interannual supply of small pelagic fish larvae in the central mediterranean seas variability in larval retention due to advection accounted for up to 70 of anchovy stock biomass and catch trends patti et al 2020 periods of strong upwellings resulting in high chlorophyll a but high offshore transport of larvae resulted in low recruitment years for sardine fisheries in california logerwell et al 2001 and portugal santos et al 2005 our results show that ocean circulation can also impact sardine larval recruitment in southern philippines low retention conditions occurred when surface currents were strongly offshore e g from november 2009 to february 2010 fig 5 a due to the intensified upwelling as well as the northwestwardly directed currents exiting the dipolog strait aside from upwelling strength differences in currents associated with the bohol jet may be an important mechanism for transport variability for the first three simulated years the bohol jet carrying larvae from the bohol sea turns to flow strongly northward as it leaves the dipolog strait fig 5 a thus reducing retention during high retention years as exemplified by currents from november 2011 to february 2012 fig 5b the direction of the exiting bohol jet flows directly westward producing a turbulent wake offshore of the dipolog bay which may have caused an increase in local retention and importation to the dipolog dapitan and sindangan bays from the bohol sea spawning areas s lemuru larvae can also experience less ideal temperature conditions across years during the first three years they experienced temperatures above their average preferred temperature of 27 8 c while the latter years transitioned into temperatures closer to their preferred temperature the relationship of temperature with larval growth abundances and recruitment is variable running the gamut from no relationship positive negative and dome shaped lluch belda et al 1991 jacobson and maccall 1995 mcclatchie et al 2010 fernández corredor et al 2020 and references therein spawners in the study area were observed to occur most frequently in waters with temperatures between 27 5 28 c and exhibited a dome shaped relationship with a minimum of 25 5 c and maximum of 30 5 c villanoy et al 2015 apart from being an indicator of upwelling shifts away from these more optimal temperature conditions in the spawning and recruitment areas could have domino effects on recruitment strength out of the three environmental factors investigated the chlorophyll a concentration experienced by sardine larvae did not have a distinct pattern of interannual variability chlorophyll a has been identified to be a good indicator of interannual s lemuru catches in the northern mindanao population villanoy et al 2011 and for the bali population sartimbul et al 2010 higher chlorophyll a conditions and primary productivity are broadly positively related to higher larval abundances and recruitment mann and lazier 2013 fernández corredor et al 2020 and references therein however the interplay of the effects of food availability and physical factors on larval recruitment and hence fish populations are recognized to be important this is embodied in bakun s triad requirements bakun 1998 for high fish productivity 1 nutrient enrichment 2 larval food aggregation and 3 larval retention cury and roy 1989 also surmise through the optimal environmental window hypothesis that the optimum condition for larval survival occurs at moderate upwelling intensities which reduces losses from advection and turbulence yet still provides enough nutrient enrichment and primary production as previously discussed chlorophyll a concentrations experienced by the sardine larvae during the nem season could be sufficient at the levels observed in this study and thus variabilities in larval recruitment could be more strongly impacted by advection and temperature interannual differences the life history of these small pelagic fishes is characterized by early sexual maturity high egg production but low survival rates to adults and relatively short life spans coupled with their mostly passive dispersal during their early life history stages these characteristics lead to high vulnerability to variabilities in environmental forcing which can then impact recruitment success into the sardine stocks the distinct interannual differences in the conditions experienced by sardine larvae could partly explain the variability also observed in sardine catches during these years fisheries data from three different sources generally show a pattern where 2009 to 2011 were low catch years and 2012 to 2014 were high catch years fig 6 these observed interannual patterns in the catch of adult sardines coincide with the interannual differences in the environmental conditions of the sardine larvae spawned during the peak spawning period the low catches during march to july 2009 corresponded to poor modelled environmental conditions for the november 2008 to february 2009 cohort which experienced low retention recruits for this period experienced relatively lower chlorophyll a and higher presumed to be less optimal temperatures the large spike in the experienced chlorophyll a for the 2009 to 2010 cohort did not seem to translate to an increase in the sardine population as catches from march to july 2010 were still relatively low suggesting that prey availability may have been outweighed by the low retention and high sst experienced by this cohort favorable current patterns resulting in larval retention within the coastal areas possibly plays a big role in predicting adult populations particularly within the dipolog dapitan and sindangan bay areas as the observed increase in sardine catch since 2011 coincides with the increase in modelled larval retention as well as more optimal sst and relatively high experienced chlorophyll a overall these general catch patterns can potentially partly be explained by the interannual variabilities in environmental conditions however consideration of lag times in recruitment and other stock fishery dynamics should be considered in further analysis in 2011 an annual sardine fishing closure covering the period december to february of each year was started by the department of agriculture da and the department of interior and local government dilg of the philippines through the issuance of a joint da dilg administrative order jao 2011 this was implemented as a means of protecting adult spawners it should be noted that despite the legislated ban sporadic commercial sardine fishing during the ban period still occurred de guzman et al 2015a nonetheless the increase in sardine catches fig 6 after 2011 has been touted as due to the effectiveness of the ban in reducing fishing mortality and increasing recruitment rola et al 2018 and serves as affirmation of the success of the management measure department of agriculture 2014 fishing effort has been identified to exert considerable pressure on sardine fisheries which are sensitive to environmental controls suda et al 2005 in addition to the reduction of fishing mortality of spawning adults during the closure period resulting in recruitment success the model results suggest that the environmental conditions experienced by sardine larvae also improved during years when the fishing closure was implemented although disentangling and quantifying the relative contributions of larval retention prey availability and temperature conditions to interannual variability of recruitment success and the adult population size is beyond the scope of this study the interplay of these environmental conditions with fishing mortality can have an overall impact on sardine larval recruitment and consequently adult sardine catches within the southern philippines as has also been observed for sardine populations and landed catch around the globe alheit and peck 2019 chavez et al 2003 santos et al 2012 somarakis et al 2019 5 summary and recommendations short lived small pelagics such as s lemuru are highly affected by regional weather patterns houde 2009 which heighten the risk from present and future stressors to recruitment katara 2014 similar to the s lemuru population in indonesia sartimbul et al 2010 sambah et al 2012 the variability in the southern philippines stock is related to productivity in the area the modeled trends in environmental conditions imply that the spawning patterns observed are adaptations to maximize sardine recruitment this study elucidates that not only is recruitment success associated with productive surface waters during the northeast monsoon transport and temperature also significantly modulate the observed spawning seasonality during the peak spawning season the reduced retention of larvae near the coastal waters may be offset by reduced mortalities due to improved prey density and cooler temperatures which are hypothesized to be more optimal analysis of interannual differences in the experienced conditions of larvae in the peak spawning months suggests that years with improved environmental conditions for spawned larvae high retention and experienced chlorophyll a and low experienced temperature can increase recruitment to the stock to quantify the role of fishing mortality and changing environmental conditions in sardine population variability in a more detailed manner would require improving the model to incorporate the full sardine life cycle e g biogenergetic growth models and developmental stage parameters together with realistic natural and fishing mortality rates this is currently not possible with the available information on s lemuru in the philippines the most important data gaps to be supplemented are the identification of the specific thermal niche of s lemuru stock and its reproductive success with regard to variabilities in ambient temperatures studying the temperature recruitment relationship specific to s lemuru is vital in modeling the effects of climate change especially since larvae at the tropics which are presently used to a narrow temperature range will experience greater shifts in temperature llopiz et al 2014 further insight into the diel vertical migration specific for s lemuru is also recommended since larvae are known to regulate their vertical position to take advantage of the vertical stratification of currents kristiansen et al 2009 sponaugle et al 2002 the minimal yet significant effect of the depth occupied by sardines in the simulation highlights the need to collect in situ information regarding the position of sardine larvae and adults with depth to inform future modeling efforts the current model captures key factors known to influence small pelagic fishes such as sardines however incorporating more detailed life history processes as they interact with environmental conditions could fine tune and shift the importance of particular factors contributing to their population dynamics though this model covers the primary spawning grounds and stocks of s lemuru expanding the spatial coverage of the model to cover a larger domain can provide insights into connections to other areas across different life stages it is critical that sardine stock management measures take into account the ranges of environmental parameters that are suitable for sardine recruitment in order to understand the role of the environment in recruitment variability and potential reduction of the sardine population s resilience from fishing

haliotis discus hannai ino is one of the important mariculture species in china presently h discus hannai is extensively cultured in two coastal provinces in china shandong in the north and fujian in the south and is usually cultured in the north south relay mode in order to simulate the growth of abalone in the north and south an individual dynamic energy budget deb model was constructed for abalone model simulation was done by stella software using water temperature and food consumption as forcing functions with 18 energy budget related parameters the deb model was then validated by field data collected in a relay culture operation in 2017 to 2018 model simulation revealed that the simulated growth of abalone in non relay culture scenarios was significantly lower than that in the relay mode in sanggou bay in the north and xiuyu sea in the south the shell length and dry flesh weight reached 6 3 cm and 10 g or 5 29 cm and 4 6 g respectively as a result of simulated growth for 365 d of abalone seedlings at 2 8 cm and 0 3 g while the abalone growth in relay culture reached a shell length of 6 8 cm and dry flesh weight of 10 9 g growth simulations by the deb model in both

growing more rapidly than capture fisheries fao 2018 and it is widely recognized that aquaculture will become an increasingly important source of seafood products as one of the main aquaculture species in china abalone made a new record in yield at 180 267 tons in 2019 a 10 increase from the previous year and quadrupled that of 2009 42 373 tons bof 2020 2010 abalone is a valuable and attractive aquaculture species owing to their high nutritional value and market demand as a delicacy moodley et al 2014 although abalone aquaculture is increasing rapidly in china it is facing with a number of challenges including sea temperature rise disease related mortality and the limit of carrying capacity ke 2013 liu and cai 2018 haliotis discus hannai ino is phylogenetically classified into phylum mollusca class gastropoda order archaeogastropoda family haliotidae and genus haliotis li et al 1995 kresge et al 2015 it has been one of the most valuable species for catch fishery in china and was well known as soft gold of the ocean liu et al 2003 h discus hannai is also the main abalone species being cultured in china mostly produced in fujian southern china and shandong northern china provinces who contribute 82 7 and 8 1 of the total production respectively under the traditional culture mode when abalone farming were restricted to one place high mortality may happen during summer and over the winter due to unfavorable water temperatures and it took over two years for the abalone to reach market size of about 7 cm shell length hu et al 2015 in order to improve the growth performance of abalone the north south relay mode was on first trial around 2000 when the first batch of juvenile abalone from shandong province was transported to fujian province in november and they were then transferred back to the north in april in the following year and grow in the north until they reached market size in the autumn fig 1 this mode of aquaculture has been on expansion over the years and has been very successful as the culture cycle was reduced by six months li et al 2007 2004 individual based models ibm are powerful and flexible tools for predicting individual growth of organisms and it can be used as submodule of population models and for evaluation of aquaculture capacity liu and cai 2018 individual based growth models have been set up for a number of species such as the sfg scope for growth model for assessment of energy status of animals filgueira et al 2011 von bertalanffy model for predicting linear growth rate in juveniles jue et al 2007 helidoniotis et al 2011 and bioenergetics model simulating individual energy distribution by energy budget equation chang and wang 1998 zhang et al 2017 and dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 1986 ren and ross 2005 etc most of ibms of abalone are based on traditional energy budget equation chang and wang 1998 martin et al 2011 energy consumed c energy used for growth p energy lost as respiration r energy lost in excretion u energy loss to feces f these models are mainly for analyzing single or multiple factors affecting abalone s growth under laboratory conditions however the environmental conditions for aquaculture are multi faceted and dynamic compared to the traditional energy budget equation model deb model can not only quantify the distribution of assimilated energy in the entire individual life cycle including for physical growth gonadal development and maturity but also reflect the impact of environment food and other restrictive factors on the growth process of abalone to a better extent deb models have also a wider range of applications and can be used in different environmental applications the deb model is built upon dynamic energy budge theory kooijman 1986 which was based on κ rule and developed for understanding the dynamics of biological systems from cells to ecosystems via an approach for simulating mass and energy balance kooijman 2000 it has been widely used in aquaculture molluscan species such as pacific oyster crassostrea gigas ren and ross 2005 japanese scallop patinopecten yessoensis zhang et al 2017 and manila clam ruditapes philippinarum dong et al 2020 however all these are filter feeding species and a gap exists in understanding the dynamic energy budget for fed mollusk such as abalone the null hypothesis is that the north south relay mode of abalone aquaculture by taking advantage of suitable environmental conditions may achieve the best allocation and utilization of material and energy this rationale could be verified though deb model simulation in this study a deb model was developed for abalone h discus hannai and was used to predict the growth of abalone under different environmental conditions related to the relay culture mode the model may provide insight into the energy distribution characteristics of the animal so as to assess their response to changing environmental conditions such as temperature and feed model simulations were also used to compare the performance of abalone in the relay culture and non relay culture in order to verify the rationale of this practice validation of the model was conducted using several goodness of fit indices in order to test the robustness of this model 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the coastline of china spans 18 000 km and across more than 44 of latitude therefore the environment for aquaculture in northern and southern china especially the water temperature is very different sanggou bay is a semi enclosed bay located in the eastern part of the shandong peninsula in northern china 37 6 30 37 11 40 n 122 32 50 122 40 20 e with an area of 144km2 it is one of the most important aquaculture waters in shandong province annual average water temperature in this coastal sea is 13 c and the average salinity is 31 76 cai et al 2019 xiuyu sea is located in the middle of southeast coast of fujian province in southern china 24 30 29 25 22 33 n 118 56 38 120 05 25 e it is comprised of three major bays including pazhou pinghai xinghua and their surrounding waters it has very rich living marine resources and is the main producing area of haliotis discus nanri wu 2007 the annual average water temperature in xiuyu sea is around 20 c 2 2 equations of abalone deb model the equations deployed in the abalone deb model are briefly described below we kept most of the equations based on the deb theory with notation and symbols following those in kooijman 2000 whereby the following main rules apply variables are represented by symbols lowercase symbols are usually associated with uppercase symbols quantity is expressed in square brackets as unit volume per unit of biological surface area is shown with brackets the rate is expressed in dots showing the dimension of each time according to deb theory the growth and reproduction of abalone are expressed by differential equations of three states energy reserves e energy for structural body volume ev and reproductive reserve energy er h discus hannai has a narrow range of optimal temperatures shi et al 2002 so temperature changes may greatly affect its growth by influencing the assimilation rate and maintenance rate of abalone the temperature function k t is expressed by the arrhenius equation kooijman et al 2010 which mainly reflects the physiological reaction rate of abalone as a function of external water temperature relative to the reference temperature it is equal to 1 k t k 0 exp t a t 0 t a t 1 exp t a l t t a l t l exp t a h t h t a h t 1 where k0 is the reference physiological reaction rate k0 1 ta is the arrhenius temperature k t0 is the reference temperature tl is the lower boundary of tolerance range tal and tah are the lower and higher threshold of arrhenius temperatures k beyond which the rate of physiological reaction will decrease th is the upper boundary of tolerance range k assimilation is the process by which organisms convert food and nutrients obtained from the environment into their own structural substances or energy storage the nutrient source for cultivated abalone is seaweeds such as kelp therefore the assimilation rate p a is calculated based on food intake and as a function of absorption efficiency at various temperatures 2 p a k t a e μ x j x where ae is the absorption efficiency which have different value at different temperatures μx is food conversion factor j g and jx is daily food consumption g d metabolism is the decomposition and transformation of nutrients in the organism catalyzed by enzymes causing changes in the organism s material and energy metabolic rate p c is the amount of energy released transferred and stored in the abalone body according to kooijman 2000 chapter 3 4 metabolic rate can be calculated as 3 p c k t e e g κ e e g p a m v 2 3 e m p m v where e represents energy density e e v j cm 3 eg is the volume specific cost for structure j cm 3 and em is the maximum energy density in the reserve compartment substituting p c in differential equations of v and e allows us to simulate these two state variables as a function of food concentration ṗam is the maximum surface area specific assimilation rate j cm 2 d 1 κ is the fraction of energy utilization rate spent on maintenance plus growth ṗm is the maintenance cost j cm 2 d 1 dynamic energy reserves in abalone are the difference between assimilation rate p a and metabolic rate p c which are given by the equation 4 d e d t p a p c it is assumed that a fraction of the utilization rate is used for maintenance and structural growth including the increase in weight of soft tissue and shell length for the change of the structural volume maintenance rate is proportional to the body volume therefore 5 d e v d t κ p c p m 6 v e v e g the maintenance costs rest with homeostasis for example a metazoan of twice the volume of a conspecific has twice as many cells each using a fixed amount of energy for maintenance so maintenance rate ṗm is proportional to the structural volume v 7 p m k t p m v where ṗm is the maintenance cost j cm 2 d 1 if the somatic and maturity maintenance rate coefficients are equal the maturity maintenance ṗj is proportional to the structure v until the juvenile abalone grows and reaches sexual maturity at volume vp maturity maintenance does not increase beyond this level thus ṗj is defined as 8 p j k t min v v p p m 1 κ κ the dynamics for energy allocation goes first to maturation in juveniles and then to the reproduction buffer er in adults are 9 d

factors in the deb model of abalone are water temperature t and food intake jx and their values were obtained by field survey and sampling at different times eighteen peremeters were identified for the deb model following previous studies table 1 the food intake of abalone in non relay mode was set based on relay farming that is all abalone were fed ad libitum so that the feed was in excess in winter or summer but the absorption efficiency was different at different temperatures the absorption efficiency value of abalone at 12 c 24 c were 58 66 as adapted from huang et al 2008 nie and yan 1985 found that abalone stopped feeding at 5 c and 30 c so the absorption efficiency at these temperatures was set as 0 therefore the change in absorption efficiency of h discus hannai at different temperatures was obtained by curve fitting fig 2 different environmental conditions water temperature and feeding were used as forcing factors to run the model and simulate the growth of abalone in different culture modes variation in water temperature of xiuyu sea and sanggou bay between november 2017 and november 2018 are shown in fig 3 the highest water temperature in xiuyu sea was 29 c in summer and the lowest temperature in winter was 13 75 c while in sanggou bay it was 25 7 c and 2 c respectively temporal variations of daily food consumption are illustrated in fig 4 daily food consumption of abalone may increase as the animal grows and may also change with the temperature as shown in fig 4 it was the highest in june and lowest in november within a year 2 4 deb model of abalone the above formula and parameters were used to construct the deb model by stella architect 1 4 3 fig 5 the total simulation time period was 365 d the step length was 1 d the time when the abalone seedlings were transferred out to sea and hang onto the rafts was defined as the first day when the shell length was 2 9 cm and the dry flesh weight was 0 1 g on average 2 5 sensitivity analysis and model evaluation all statistical analyses were carried out using spss 16 0 and excel 2016 a sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions according to majkowski 1982 every parameter was modified by 10 and the modeling results of each run were analyzed using a sensitivity index si to calculate the resulting percentage change in the dry tissue mass 12 s i 1 n t 1 n d w t 1 d w t 0 d w t 0 100 where n is the number of simulated days dwt 0 is the dry flesh weight predicted with the standard simulation at time t and dwt 1 is the dry flesh weight predicted with a new parameter value at time t model evaluation is the process of determining the effectiveness of the model the deb model for abalone was evaluated by calculating the coefficient of determination r2 alewell and manderscheid 1998 of simulated and observed values modeling efficiency me vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 blanco et al 2007 lo et al 2011 and theil s inequality coefficient u theil 1966 blanco 2007 lo 2011 the calculations were conducted as follows 13 m e 1 i 1 n d i 2 i 1 n o i s i 2 where o is the observed data s is the simulated value di observed i simulated i this index provides a simple performance evaluation on a relative scale me 1 indicates a perfect fit me 0 indicates that the model is no better than a simple average of the estimated values while negative values indicate poor model performance 14 u i 1 n d i 2 i 1 n o i 2 where u can assume values of 0 and greater u 0 indicates perfect model simulation u 1 indicates the model produces estimates that are not better than assuming the variable does not change and if u 1 means the predictive power of the model is unacceptable blanco et al 2007 lo et al 2011 2 6 validation of the model about 100 abalone were randomly sampled at raft culture sites at sanggou bay and xiuyu sea regularly between the 6 19 months in their life cycle for biometric measurements the result is expressed as mean standard deviation dry flesh weight dw of the abalone was determined to the nearest 0 001 g by electronic balance after a 72 hour freeze drying in order to predict the goodness of fit of the model a liner regression analysis was conducted between the simulated value and the observed value and a slope close to 1 indicated for reliable model simulation 3 results 3 1 simulated growth of abalone by deb model simulation of abalone growth in the relay culture mode was done by running the deb model using water temperature and feeding as the forcing factors validation of the model was performed simultaneously by comparing the predicted shell length and dry flesh weight to measurements by sampling at the farms in xiuyu sea and sanggou bay fig 6 simulated growth highly correlated the observed values in shell length a and weight b the abalone grew from 2 8 cm to 6 8 cm in shell length after being cultured for one year and the dry flesh weight increased from 0 3 g to about 10 9 g quantile quantile ploting was conducted for the simulated and observed growth data fig 6 the best situation is that the scatter points all fall on the straight line of the linear equation y x according to the scatter plot of simulated and observed values the fitting degrees r² of shell length quantile quantile plots and y x was 0 946 c while r² of dry flesh weight quantile quantile plots and y x was 0 956 d indicating that the results of model simulation had acceptable goodness of fit 3 2 energy allocation of abalone in north south relay assimilated energy is usually allocated as energy reserves e structural body volume ev and reproductive reserve energy er in animals variation in these energy allocations in abalone during the relay culture is shown in fig 7 during the first 60 days in growout the energy of feeding and assimilation is preferentially used for volume maintenance and growth ev accounting for 60 to 90 of the total assimilated energy energy reserves e increased with the cultivation time reaching a maximum value of about 56 of assimilated energy by 250d and then ev continued to dominate energy allocation the energy for reproductive reserve and development er has accumulated over time though finally reaching a proportion only close to 5 3 3 performance of abalone in different culture mode for non relay cultured abalone significant difference was observed between the simulated growth of those cultured in the north and in the south after growout for one year the shell length of abalone reached 5 3 cm in xiuyu sea southern china and 6 cm in sanggou bay northern china fig 8 shows that abalone grew rapidly in shell length and dry weight in fujian before 200d but the growth rate decreased afterwards an opposite trend in growth was observed in sanggou bay where the abalone rapidly increased its growth rate after 200d in the north south relay mode by seemingly taking advantages of the two places abalone showed high rate of shell length and dry weight increase throughout the whole period of growout fig 9 the water temperature is significantly different in northern and southern china fig 10 which may be the key factor determining the simulated growth of abalone by deb model according to the results of the simulation the value of temperature dependence function k t varied significantly between the different culture mode the maximum value of k t 1 69 was reached twice during the growout period in non relay culture around the first day and 180 d in november and march respectively in southern china xiuyu sea while around 240 d and 310 d may and october respectively in northern china sanggou bay but the value of k t was much higher in the relay culture during most of the growout period and it reached the maximum value for four times by referencing the temperature record at the time it was found that the maximum value of k t corresponds to water temperatures around 20 c 3 4 sensitive analyses and model evaluation according to calculations by formula 12 it was found that the sensitivity index si value of energy content of reserves μe and volume specific costs for structure eg were higher than any other parameters an increase or decrease of 10 in parameters μe and eg yielded a variation of dry flesh weight at 6 4 and 4 in contrast similar changes in the parameters of reproductive reserves fixed in eggs κr structural body volume at puberty vp reserves and gonad had minimal effects on the predicted dry flesh weight resulting in only 0 3 and 0 07 variations of the values fig 11 goodness of fit tests were conducted for the abalone deb model developed in this study by three different measures indices of model performance were calculated following formuli 13 and 14 and the results are presented in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed values for shell length and dry flesh weight were relatively high at 0 96 and 0 99 respectively values of theil s inequality coefficient u were 0 07 and 0 19 and the modeling efficiency s me values are 0 95 and 0 91 for shell length and dry flesh weight all these results indicate that model performance is acceptable 4 discussion 4 1 the north south relay mode of abalone culture temperature has a great influence on the growth of abalone shi et al 2002 and the optimum water temperature for h discus hannai s feeding and growth is 15 22 c abnormal physiological and biochemical activities were observed in abalone when the water temperature rose above 28 c and feeding may stop at 5 c nie and yan 1985 as the top abalone producing province in china fujian has relatively higher water temperatures in summer shandong the second top producer of abalone in china has lower temperatures in winter due to the extreme temperatures in both places the cultured h discus hannai suffer from high mortality and slow growth during certain periods of time abalone farmers began to test the north south relay mode around year 2000 li et al 2007 by transferring abalone from the north to the south in november for overwintering then return them to the north in april of the following year abalone farmers in southern china may deploy the same method vice versa by relaying abalone at different sizes zeng et al 2020 this duly became a routine practice over the last two decades and proved to be economically successful according to model simulations abalone non relay cultured in fujian may undergo rapid growth in the early stage november until early spring but slow growth in may and june when the dry soft tissue may even stop growing on the contrary abalone non relay cultured in rongcheng may undergo slow growth during november may due to the unfavorable water temperatures the simulated results of this study confirmed the study of li 2007 who found that abalone grew significantly better in rongcheng shandong than in putian fujian in summer comparison of the growth of h discus hannai at different temperature regimes in northern and southern china revealed significant influence of temperature on the growth rates and energy allocation in abalone by taking advantage of the optimum temperature ranges in both fujian and shandong provinces throughout the year relay cultured abalone may achieve higher survivorship and better meat quality besides enjoying significantly greater growth rate 4 2 deb modeling of abalone by food availability deb model simulates the growth process of organisms based on the principle of energy distribution it has been well applied in aquaculture species including finfish bivalve and shrimp bayne and widdows 1978 van der meer 2006 sarà et al 2013 by adapting models for filter feeding bivalves dong et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 a deb model for abalone was constructed in this study simulating the growth of abalone for one year until they reach market size the food source for filter feeding bivalve species is mainly phytoplankton yet as a forage feeding mollusk abalone are benthic foraging animals and in aquaculture they are mainly fed with kelp as practiced in china abalone in growout is usually fed ad libitum at a regular time frequency while cleaning of the leftover feed is conducted simultaneously therefore the feeding module in the abalone deb model should be set differently from the filter feeding bivalves which could often be limited by the natural primary production in the water column in deb model for fed aquatic species such as shrimp and finfish the feed index were generally set to a fixed value for example in the deb model of brown shrimp crangon crangon l the food index was set as a constant value indicating the optimal food conditions of shrimp f 1 campos et al 2009 the simulation result thus reflected the growth of shrimp under optimal food conditions which may be slightly different from the actual living condition of shrimp in constructing the deb model of a capture fishery species small yellow croaker larimichthys polyactis ren et al 2020 compiled time series food biomass information for some of the most abundant prey species and set a food index f based on a weighted sum of the available data the value of f was set close to 0 in winter but close to 1 in other seasons from the assumption that food availability varies seasonally from relatively scarce in winter to abundant haberle et al 2020 discussed growth and reproductive output as a function at various food levels in the deb model for bivalve pinna nobilis through setting the value ranges of f between the lowest food scenario f f 0 to ad libitum feeding f 1 in a lifespan including common food level of wild populations f 0 72 and the highest f that did not support reproduction f 0 16 in order to model the feeding and growth of cultured abalone accurately we set daily food consumption as a forcing function based on the weight of feed kelp before and after feeding at regular intervals and the energy conversion was calculated by abalone s absorption efficiency at different temperatures by measuring the content of organic matter and ash in feed and feces and calculating the ash specific gravity at different temperatures huang et al 2008 the model showed acceptable accuracy through verification by measurements in feed consumption and growth values of abalone in inshore longline culture 4 3 the potential of deb model as a tool to predict the growth of abalone all deb models are built upon parameters and it is vital to identify the parameters and to estimate their values precisely stéphane et al 2006 troost et al 2010 therefore sensitivity analyses were carried out in this study for each parameter to determine their influence on the modeling results parameters μe and eg showed the most significant impact on the model results according to the sensitivity analyses as an increase of 10 in the value of these parameters may result in 6 4 or 4 increase in the predicted dry flesh weight of abalone at the same time the feasibility and fitting effect of the model are determined by calculating model efficiency and other related indices r square modeling efficiency and theil s inequality coefficient the results showed that the model has a good ability to predict the growth of abalone decades have passed since the birth of deb model which is still being constantly improved along with the method for its parameter estimation the deb model is applicable to the current population of abalone but the set of parameter values may not be adequate for simulating its biological behavior prior to the 1960s when it was only wildly caught or even before it was extensively cultivated in the 1980s ke 2013 this is because in the past few decades abalone farming practices have evolved from wild caught only to being life cycle closed successfully and grown out by extensive offshore longlines or industrialized systems furthermore for different breeds and different culture conditions the physiological parameters of abalone may vary slightly therefore in order to ensure the accuracy of model predictions some of the model parameters need to be fine tuned or determined again for wider application at the same time there is no measured data to test the simulated growth of abalone in the non relay culture mode and further study is needed for model calibration based on simultaneous grow out of abalone in relay or non relay mode constructing deb model to predict the growth of abalone has far reaching significance for rational planning of aquaculture waters by information supported decision making in order to realize the sustainable development of aquaculture although the abalone deb model is individual based it can be developed and evolve into a population model or even an ecosystem model if further correlation will be made and parameters developed with precision for environmental factors such as eutrophication and ocean acidification etc so as to predict the environmental impact on cultured or wild populations and communities such a high level deb model will help us to formulate proactive plans and play a greater

summer and over the winter due to unfavorable water temperatures and it took over two years for the abalone to reach market size of about 7 cm shell length hu et al 2015 in order to improve the growth performance of abalone the north south relay mode was on first trial around 2000 when the first batch of juvenile abalone from shandong province was transported to fujian province in november and they were then transferred back to the north in april in the following year and grow in the north until they reached market size in the autumn fig 1 this mode of aquaculture has been on expansion over the years and has been very successful as the culture cycle was reduced by six months li et al 2007 2004 individual based models ibm are powerful and flexible tools for predicting individual growth of organisms and it can be used as submodule of population models and for evaluation of aquaculture capacity liu and cai 2018 individual based growth models have been set up for a number of species such as the sfg scope for growth model for assessment of energy status of animals filgueira et al 2011 von bertalanffy model for predicting linear growth rate in juveniles jue et al 2007 helidoniotis et al 2011 and bioenergetics model simulating individual energy distribution by energy budget equation chang and wang 1998 zhang et al 2017 and dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 1986 ren and ross 2005 etc most of ibms of abalone are based on traditional energy budget equation chang and wang 1998 martin et al 2011 energy consumed c energy used for growth p energy lost as respiration r energy lost in excretion u energy loss to feces f these models are mainly for analyzing single or multiple factors affecting abalone s growth under laboratory conditions however the environmental conditions for aquaculture are multi faceted and dynamic compared to the traditional energy budget equation model deb model can not only quantify the distribution of assimilated energy in the entire individual life cycle including for physical growth gonadal development and maturity but also reflect the impact of environment food and other restrictive factors on the growth process of abalone to a better extent deb models have also a wider range of applications and can be used in different environmental applications the deb model is built upon dynamic energy budge theory kooijman 1986 which was based on κ rule and developed for understanding the dynamics of biological systems from cells to ecosystems via an approach for simulating mass and energy balance kooijman 2000 it has been widely used in aquaculture molluscan species such as pacific oyster crassostrea gigas ren and ross 2005 japanese scallop patinopecten yessoensis zhang et al 2017 and manila clam ruditapes philippinarum dong et al 2020 however all these are filter feeding species and a gap exists in understanding the dynamic energy budget for fed mollusk such as abalone the null hypothesis is that the north south relay mode of abalone aquaculture by taking advantage of suitable environmental conditions may achieve the best allocation and utilization of material and energy this rationale could be verified though deb model simulation in this study a deb model was developed for abalone h discus hannai and was used to predict the growth of abalone under different environmental conditions related to the relay culture mode the model may provide insight into the energy distribution characteristics of the animal so as to assess their response to changing environmental conditions such as temperature and feed model simulations were also used to compare the performance of abalone in the relay culture and non relay culture in order to verify the rationale of this practice validation of the model was conducted using several goodness of fit indices in order to test the robustness of this model 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas the coastline of china spans 18 000 km and across more than 44 of latitude therefore the environment for aquaculture in northern and southern china especially the water temperature is very different sanggou bay is a semi enclosed bay located in the eastern part of the shandong peninsula in northern china 37 6 30 37 11 40 n 122 32 50 122 40 20 e with an area of 144km2 it is one of the most important aquaculture waters in shandong province annual average water temperature in this coastal sea is 13 c and the average salinity is 31 76 cai et al 2019 xiuyu sea is located in the middle of southeast coast of fujian province in southern china 24 30 29 25 22 33 n 118 56 38 120 05 25 e it is comprised of three major bays including pazhou pinghai xinghua and their surrounding waters it has very rich living marine resources and is the main producing area of haliotis discus nanri wu 2007 the annual average water temperature in xiuyu sea is around 20 c 2 2 equations of abalone deb model the equations deployed in the abalone deb model are briefly described below we kept most of the equations based on the deb theory with notation and symbols following those in kooijman 2000 whereby the following main rules apply variables are represented by symbols lowercase symbols are usually associated with uppercase symbols quantity is expressed in square brackets as unit volume per unit of biological surface area is shown with brackets the rate is expressed in dots showing the dimension of each time according to deb theory the growth and reproduction of abalone are expressed by differential equations of three states energy reserves e energy for structural body volume ev and reproductive reserve energy er h discus hannai has a narrow range of optimal temperatures shi et al 2002 so temperature changes may greatly affect its growth by influencing the assimilation rate and maintenance rate of abalone the temperature function k t is expressed by the arrhenius equation kooijman et al 2010 which mainly reflects the physiological reaction rate of abalone as a function of external water temperature relative to the reference temperature it is equal to 1 k t k 0 exp t a t 0 t a t 1 exp t a l t t a l t l exp t a h t h t a h t 1 where k0 is the reference physiological reaction rate k0 1 ta is the arrhenius temperature k t0 is the reference temperature tl is the lower boundary of tolerance range tal and tah are the lower and higher threshold of arrhenius temperatures k beyond which the rate of physiological reaction will decrease th is the upper boundary of tolerance range k assimilation is the process by which organisms convert food and nutrients obtained from the environment into their own structural substances or energy storage the nutrient source for cultivated abalone is seaweeds such as kelp therefore the assimilation rate p a is calculated based on food intake and as a function of absorption efficiency at various temperatures 2 p a k t a e μ x j x where ae is the absorption efficiency which have different value at different temperatures μx is food conversion factor j g and jx is daily food consumption g d metabolism is the decomposition and transformation of nutrients in the organism catalyzed by enzymes causing changes in the organism s material and energy metabolic rate p c is the amount of energy released transferred and stored in the abalone body according to kooijman 2000 chapter 3 4 metabolic rate can be calculated as 3 p c k t e e g κ e e g p a m v 2 3 e m p m v where e represents energy density e e v j cm 3 eg is the volume specific cost for structure j cm 3 and em is the maximum energy density in the reserve compartment substituting p c in differential equations of v and e allows us to simulate these two state variables as a function of food concentration ṗam is the maximum surface area specific assimilation rate j cm 2 d 1 κ is the fraction of energy utilization rate spent on maintenance plus growth ṗm is the maintenance cost j cm 2 d 1 dynamic energy reserves in abalone are the difference between assimilation rate p a and metabolic rate p c which are given by the equation 4 d e d t p a p c it is assumed that a fraction of the utilization rate is used for maintenance and structural growth including the increase in weight of soft tissue and shell length for the change of the structural volume maintenance rate is proportional to the body volume therefore 5 d e v d t κ p c p m 6 v e v e g the maintenance costs rest with homeostasis for example a metazoan of twice the volume of a conspecific has twice as many cells each using a fixed amount of energy for maintenance so maintenance rate ṗm is proportional to the structural volume v 7 p m k t p m v where ṗm is the maintenance cost j cm 2 d 1 if the somatic and maturity maintenance rate coefficients are equal the maturity maintenance ṗj is proportional to the structure v until the juvenile abalone grows and reaches sexual maturity at volume vp maturity maintenance does not increase beyond this level thus ṗj is defined as 8 p j k t min v v p p m 1 κ κ the dynamics for energy allocation goes first to maturation in juveniles and then to the reproduction buffer er in adults are 9 d

factors in the deb model of abalone are water temperature t and food intake jx and their values were obtained by field survey and sampling at different times eighteen peremeters were identified for the deb model following previous studies table 1 the food intake of abalone in non relay mode was set based on relay farming that is all abalone were fed ad libitum so that the feed was in excess in winter or summer but the absorption efficiency was different at different temperatures the absorption efficiency value of abalone at 12 c 24 c were 58 66 as adapted from huang et al 2008 nie and yan 1985 found that abalone stopped feeding at 5 c and 30 c so the absorption efficiency at these temperatures was set as 0 therefore the change in absorption efficiency of h discus hannai at different temperatures was obtained by curve fitting fig 2 different environmental conditions water temperature and feeding were used as forcing factors to run the model and simulate the growth of abalone in different culture modes variation in water temperature of xiuyu sea and sanggou bay between november 2017 and november 2018 are shown in fig 3 the highest water temperature in xiuyu sea was 29 c in summer and the lowest temperature in winter was 13 75 c while in sanggou bay it was 25 7 c and 2 c respectively temporal variations of daily food consumption are illustrated in fig 4 daily food consumption of abalone may increase as the animal grows and may also change with the temperature as shown in fig 4 it was the highest in june and lowest in november within a year 2 4 deb model of abalone the above formula and parameters were used to construct the deb model by stella architect 1 4 3 fig 5 the total simulation time period was 365 d the step length was 1 d the time when the abalone seedlings were transferred out to sea and hang onto the rafts was defined as the first day when the shell length was 2 9 cm and the dry flesh weight was 0 1 g on average 2 5 sensitivity analysis and model evaluation all statistical analyses were carried out using spss 16 0 and excel 2016 a sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions according to majkowski 1982 every parameter was modified by 10 and the modeling results of each run were analyzed using a sensitivity index si to calculate the resulting percentage change in the dry tissue mass 12 s i 1 n t 1 n d w t 1 d w t 0 d w t 0 100 where n is the number of simulated days dwt 0 is the dry flesh weight predicted with the standard simulation at time t and dwt 1 is the dry flesh weight predicted with a new parameter value at time t model evaluation is the process of determining the effectiveness of the model the deb model for abalone was evaluated by calculating the coefficient of determination r2 alewell and manderscheid 1998 of simulated and observed values modeling efficiency me vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 blanco et al 2007 lo et al 2011 and theil s inequality coefficient u theil 1966 blanco 2007 lo 2011 the calculations were conducted as follows 13 m e 1 i 1 n d i 2 i 1 n o i s i 2 where o is the observed data s is the simulated value di observed i simulated i this index provides a simple performance evaluation on a relative scale me 1 indicates a perfect fit me 0 indicates that the model is no better than a simple average of the estimated values while negative values indicate poor model performance 14 u i 1 n d i 2 i 1 n o i 2 where u can assume values of 0 and greater u 0 indicates perfect model simulation u 1 indicates the model produces estimates that are not better than assuming the variable does not change and if u 1 means the predictive power of the model is unacceptable blanco et al 2007 lo et al 2011 2 6 validation of the model about 100 abalone were randomly sampled at raft culture sites at sanggou bay and xiuyu sea regularly between the 6 19 months in their life cycle for biometric measurements the result is expressed as mean standard deviation dry flesh weight dw of the abalone was determined to the nearest 0 001 g by electronic balance after a 72 hour freeze drying in order to predict the goodness of fit of the model a liner regression analysis was conducted between the simulated value and the observed value and a slope close to 1 indicated for reliable model simulation 3 results 3 1 simulated growth of abalone by deb model simulation of abalone growth in the relay culture mode was done by running the deb model using water temperature and feeding as the forcing factors validation of the model was performed simultaneously by comparing the predicted shell length and dry flesh weight to measurements by sampling at the farms in xiuyu sea and sanggou bay fig 6 simulated growth highly correlated the observed values in shell length a and weight b the abalone grew from 2 8 cm to 6 8 cm in shell length after being cultured for one year and the dry flesh weight increased from 0 3 g to about 10 9 g quantile quantile ploting was conducted for the simulated and observed growth data fig 6 the best situation is that the scatter points all fall on the straight line of the linear equation y x according to the scatter plot of simulated and observed values the fitting degrees r² of shell length quantile quantile plots and y x was 0 946 c while r² of dry flesh weight quantile quantile plots and y x was 0 956 d indicating that the results of model simulation had acceptable goodness of fit 3 2 energy allocation of abalone in north south relay assimilated energy is usually allocated as energy reserves e structural body volume ev and reproductive reserve energy er in animals variation in these energy allocations in abalone during the relay culture is shown in fig 7 during the first 60 days in growout the energy of feeding and assimilation is preferentially used for volume maintenance and growth ev accounting for 60 to 90 of the total assimilated energy energy reserves e increased with the cultivation time reaching a maximum value of about 56 of assimilated energy by 250d and then ev continued to dominate energy allocation the energy for reproductive reserve and development er has accumulated over time though finally reaching a proportion only close to 5 3 3 performance of abalone in different culture mode for non relay cultured abalone significant difference was observed between the simulated growth of those cultured in the north and in the south after growout for one year the shell length of abalone reached 5 3 cm in xiuyu sea southern china and 6 cm in sanggou bay northern china fig 8 shows that abalone grew rapidly in shell length and dry weight in fujian before 200d but the growth rate decreased afterwards an opposite trend in growth was observed in sanggou bay where the abalone rapidly increased its growth rate after 200d in the north south relay mode by seemingly taking advantages of the two places abalone showed high rate of shell length and dry weight increase throughout the whole period of growout fig 9 the water temperature is significantly different in northern and southern china fig 10 which may be the key factor determining the simulated growth of abalone by deb model according to the results of the simulation the value of temperature dependence function k t varied significantly between the different culture mode the maximum value of k t 1 69 was reached twice during the growout period in non relay culture around the first day and 180 d in november and march respectively in southern china xiuyu sea while around 240 d and 310 d may and october respectively in northern china sanggou bay but the value of k t was much higher in the relay culture during most of the growout period and it reached the maximum value for four times by referencing the temperature record at the time it was found that the maximum value of k t corresponds to water temperatures around 20 c 3 4 sensitive analyses and model evaluation according to calculations by formula 12 it was found that the sensitivity index si value of energy content of reserves μe and volume specific costs for structure eg were higher than any other parameters an increase or decrease of 10 in parameters μe and eg yielded a variation of dry flesh weight at 6 4 and 4 in contrast similar changes in the parameters of reproductive reserves fixed in eggs κr structural body volume at puberty vp reserves and gonad had minimal effects on the predicted dry flesh weight resulting in only 0 3 and 0 07 variations of the values fig 11 goodness of fit tests were conducted for the abalone deb model developed in this study by three different measures indices of model performance were calculated following formuli 13 and 14 and the results are presented in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed values for shell length and dry flesh weight were relatively high at 0 96 and 0 99 respectively values of theil s inequality coefficient u were 0 07 and 0 19 and the modeling efficiency s me values are 0 95 and 0 91 for shell length and dry flesh weight all these results indicate that model performance is acceptable 4 discussion 4 1 the north south relay mode of abalone culture temperature has a great influence on the growth of abalone shi et al 2002 and the optimum water temperature for h discus hannai s feeding and growth is 15 22 c abnormal physiological and biochemical activities were observed in abalone when the water temperature rose above 28 c and feeding may stop at 5 c nie and yan 1985 as the top abalone producing province in china fujian has relatively higher water temperatures in summer shandong the second top producer of abalone in china has lower temperatures in winter due to the extreme temperatures in both places the cultured h discus hannai suffer from high mortality and slow growth during certain periods of time abalone farmers began to test the north south relay mode around year 2000 li et al 2007 by transferring abalone from the north to the south in november for overwintering then return them to the north in april of the following year abalone farmers in southern china may deploy the same method vice versa by relaying abalone at different sizes zeng et al 2020 this duly became a routine practice over the last two decades and proved to be economically successful according to model simulations abalone non relay cultured in fujian may undergo rapid growth in the early stage november until early spring but slow growth in may and june when the dry soft tissue may even stop growing on the contrary abalone non relay cultured in rongcheng may undergo slow growth during november may due to the unfavorable water temperatures the simulated results of this study confirmed the study of li 2007 who found that abalone grew significantly better in rongcheng shandong than in putian fujian in summer comparison of the growth of h discus hannai at different temperature regimes in northern and southern china revealed significant influence of temperature on the growth rates and energy allocation in abalone by taking advantage of the optimum temperature ranges in both fujian and shandong provinces throughout the year relay cultured abalone may achieve higher survivorship and better meat quality besides enjoying significantly greater growth rate 4 2 deb modeling of abalone by food availability deb model simulates the growth process of organisms based on the principle of energy distribution it has been well applied in aquaculture species including finfish bivalve and shrimp bayne and widdows 1978 van der meer 2006 sarà et al 2013 by adapting models for filter feeding bivalves dong et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 a deb model for abalone was constructed in this study simulating the growth of abalone for one year until they reach market size the food source for filter feeding bivalve species is mainly phytoplankton yet as a forage feeding mollusk abalone are benthic foraging animals and in aquaculture they are mainly fed with kelp as practiced in china abalone in growout is usually fed ad libitum at a regular time frequency while cleaning of the leftover feed is conducted simultaneously therefore the feeding module in the abalone deb model should be set differently from the filter feeding bivalves which could often be limited by the natural primary production in the water column in deb model for fed aquatic species such as shrimp and finfish the feed index were generally set to a fixed value for example in the deb model of brown shrimp crangon crangon l the food index was set as a constant value indicating the optimal food conditions of shrimp f 1 campos et al 2009 the simulation result thus reflected the growth of shrimp under optimal food conditions which may be slightly different from the actual living condition of shrimp in constructing the deb model of a capture fishery species small yellow croaker larimichthys polyactis ren et al 2020 compiled time series food biomass information for some of the most abundant prey species and set a food index f based on a weighted sum of the available data the value of f was set close to 0 in winter but close to 1 in other seasons from the assumption that food availability varies seasonally from relatively scarce in winter to abundant haberle et al 2020 discussed growth and reproductive output as a function at various food levels in the deb model for bivalve pinna nobilis through setting the value ranges of f between the lowest food scenario f f 0 to ad libitum feeding f 1 in a lifespan including common food level of wild populations f 0 72 and the highest f that did not support reproduction f 0 16 in order to model the feeding and growth of cultured abalone accurately we set daily food consumption as a forcing function based on the weight of feed kelp before and after feeding at regular intervals and the energy conversion was calculated by abalone s absorption efficiency at different temperatures by measuring the content of organic matter and ash in feed and feces and calculating the ash specific gravity at different temperatures huang et al 2008 the model showed acceptable accuracy through verification by measurements in feed consumption and growth values of abalone in inshore longline culture 4 3 the potential of deb model as a tool to predict the growth of abalone all deb models are built upon parameters and it is vital to identify the parameters and to estimate their values precisely stéphane et al 2006 troost et al 2010 therefore sensitivity analyses were carried out in this study for each parameter to determine their influence on the modeling results parameters μe and eg showed the most significant impact on the model results according to the sensitivity analyses as an increase of 10 in the value of these parameters may result in 6 4 or 4 increase in the predicted dry flesh weight of abalone at the same time the feasibility and fitting effect of the model are determined by calculating model efficiency and other related indices r square modeling efficiency and theil s inequality coefficient the results showed that the model has a good ability to predict the growth of abalone decades have passed since the birth of deb model which is still being constantly improved along with the method for its parameter estimation the deb model is applicable to the current population of abalone but the set of parameter values may not be adequate for simulating its biological behavior prior to the 1960s when it was only wildly caught or even before it was extensively cultivated in the 1980s ke 2013 this is because in the past few decades abalone farming practices have evolved from wild caught only to being life cycle closed successfully and grown out by extensive offshore longlines or industrialized systems furthermore for different breeds and different culture conditions the physiological parameters of abalone may vary slightly therefore in order to ensure the accuracy of model predictions some of the model parameters need to be fine tuned or determined again for wider application at the same time there is no measured data to test the simulated growth of abalone in the non relay culture mode and further study is needed for model calibration based on simultaneous grow out of abalone in relay or non relay mode constructing deb model to predict the growth of abalone has far reaching significance for rational planning of aquaculture waters by information supported decision making in order to realize the sustainable development of aquaculture although the abalone deb model is individual based it can be developed and evolve into a population model or even an ecosystem model if further correlation will be made and parameters developed with precision for environmental factors such as eutrophication and ocean acidification etc so as to predict the environmental impact on cultured or wild populations and communities such a high level deb model will help us to formulate proactive plans and play a greater role in science based management of abalone aquaculture declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest in submitting the manuscript of a dynamic energy budget model for abalone

24622,the emergy accounting method has been widely applied to terrestrial and marine ecosystems although there is a lack of emergy studies focusing on phytoplankton primary production phytoplankton production is a pivotal process since it is intimately coupled with oceanic food webs energy fluxes carbon cycle and earth s climate in this study we proposed a new methodology to perform a biophysical assessment of the global phytoplankton primary production combining machine learning ml techniques and an emergy based accounting model firstly we produced global phytoplankton production estimates using an artificial neural network ann model secondly we assessed the main energy inputs supporting the global phytoplankton production finally we converted these inputs into emergy units and analysed the results from an ecological perspective among the energy flows tides showed the highest maximum emergy contribution to global phytoplankton production highlighting the importance of thise flow in the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems in addition an emergy production ratio was calculated showing different global patterns in terms of emergy convergence into the primary production process we believe that the proposed emergy based assessment of phytoplankton production could be extremely valuable to improve our understanding of this key biological process at global scale adopting a systems perspective this model can also provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of marine ecosystem services at global scale keywords phytoplankton primary production

implemented an emergy based assessment for coastal and marine ecosystem services in china while many emergy studies have been applied to explore benthic marine ecosystems there is a lack of emergy studies focusing on marine primary production in the water column at both local and global scales in the context of marine ecosystems phytoplankton primary production is a crucial biological process since it accounts for about 94 and 50 of marine and global autotrophic production duarte and cebrián 1996 accordingly phytoplankton production represents the bulk of energy for structuring marine food webs allowing the generation of natural capital stocks and the delivery of provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services blythe et al 2020 buonocore et al 2020a chakraborty et al 2020 furthermore phytoplankton production exerts a regulating effect on earth s climate through a net uptake of co2 from the atmosphere with a share of the fixed carbon removed from the fast carbon cycle through sinking of organic matter longhurst and glen harrison 1989 for these reasons phytoplankton production is a pivotal component of marine ecosystems functioning and enhancing its understanding is a central issue in modern oceanography the study of marine phytoplankton production on a global scale requires to be supported by ecological models this support maximizes theinformation derived from in situ measurements which are expensive and time consuming several models were developed to estimate primary production from ocean color and some of them were compared in published studies carr et al 2006 friedrichs et al 2009 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 among the available phytoplankton production estimators the one developed by scardi 2001 is based on a machine learning ml technique i e artificial neural network ann the strengths of the ml approaches rely on the ability to handle complex and non linear relationships which are ubiquitous in natural systems catucci and scardi 2020 franceschini et al 2019 lek et al 1996 mattei and scardi 2020 olden et al 2008 moreover they can exploit a wide range of predictive variables since no a priori explicit mathematical formulation of the link between predictive variables and the output is needed the latter feature is extremely valuable when remotely sensed information is taken into account since phytoplankton primary production is a central process in the marine ecosystem functioning several research areas could benefit from a deepening in the understanding of its dynamics from a climate perspective a global assessment of phytoplankton production could improve the comprehension of climate change effects on this process and to the ones related to it such as the global carbon cycle blanchard et al 2012 barange et al 2014 maureaud et al 2017 behrenfeld et al 2006 boyce et al 2010 moreover several marine ecosystem services and functions are related to phytoplankton autotrophic production buonocore et al 2019 costanza et

1992 conti and scardi 2010 russo et al 2019 in this work we developed and applied a novel methodology to perform a biophysical assessment of the global phytoplankton primary production combining ml techniques and an emergy based environmental accounting model 2 materials and methods the integrated modeling approach implemented in this study could be divided in three main steps firstly we estimated the global phytoplankton production using an ann model which requires only predictive variables that can be either retrieved from remote sensing platforms or derived from them the latter feature allows the model user to freely retrieve the needed information from online repositories secondly we gathered all the information about the main energy inputs converging to the marine ecosystem and influencing the phytoplankton production matter inputs to the primary production can be mainly considered as quantities continuously recycling into the system on a global scale for this reason we assumed that matter inputs do not carry any emergy value and were not considered for the emergy analysis in this work finally we converted the energy inputs into emergy units and explored our results using data analysis and visualization tools the methodology was applied on data referred to the year 2018 since it was the most recent year for which all the needed data were available the main steps of our approach are described in the following paragraphs 2 1 phytoplankton primary production model we used an ann model scardi 2001 to estimate integrated phytoplankton primary production on a global scale the ann was trained with a classic version of the error back propagation algorithm rumelhart et al 1986 the software used to train the ann was developed in fortran 90 the fortran program and a python script to estimate the phytoplankton production are available upon request the predictive variables included the day of the year and the geographic coordinates of the selected area the coordinates were extracted from a 4320 8640 matrix latitude x longitude with a resolution of 0 041 0 041 this resolution was selected for consistency with the modis aqua data the day of the year was set as the 15th day of each month to provide a mean monthly estimate the day of the year and the longitude were passed as input after a trigonometric transformation which produced two derived variables while the latitude was not transformed mattei et al 2018 scardi 2001 the model also needed the surface irradiance frouin et al 2012 frouin and pinker 1995 sea surface temperature werdell et

last three predictive variables were computed using models or mathematical equations the first was the mixed layer depth which could be estimated using several models e g monterey and levitus levitus et al 1994 levitus and boyer 1994 the second one was the daylength which we computed as function of the day of the year and latitude the last one was the pb opt which is a physiological variable computed as function of the sea surface temperature behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 a list of the ann model inputs and output is shown in table 1 after retrieving the predictive variables we used the ann model to estimate the mean phytoplankton production on a global scale for each month of the year 2018 we kept the 4 km resolution of the modis aqua data thus producing a 4320 8640 grid 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees ascii file for each month containing the production appraisals subsequently we used these files to generate global production maps figure 1 shows the global production map generated for january 2018 the maps generated for all the months of the year are available in the online supplementary materials the missing values shown as black pixels in fig 1 represent the areas for which the predictive variables were not available the lack of information was mainly due to the cloud coverage of the ocean which impeded the measurement of surface chlorophyll a from remote sensing platforms this phenomenon was not homogeneous neither spatially nor temporally in fact the main affected areas were those at higher latitude with different patterns throughout the year see supplementary materials and figs 5 8 2 2 energy inputs we relied on both the ecological knowledge of the phytoplankton production process reynolds 2006 and the current literature on emergy accounting brown and ulgiati 2016a campbell and tilley 2016 lee et al 2019 to identify and assess the main energy inputs supporting phytoplankton primary production at global scale fig 2 the energy inputs can be divided in primary and secondary sources the primary renewable energy inputs also known as the global tripartite comprise the solar tidal and geothermal exergy brown et al 2016 the secondary renewable energy sources are generated by the interactions of the primary ones the first primary renewable input taken into account was the solar energy we converted the same photosynthetically active radiation par data used as input for the ann model into total solar radiation total radiation 2 32 par this variable showed the higher resolution among the gathered data and was stored in a 4320 8640 grid 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees the unit of measure was converted from e m 2 day 1 to j m 2 day 1 to evaluate the energy contribution to the system this was not a straightforward operation since the former measures energy quanta while the latter refers to an energy flux we used the relationship found by britton and dodd 1976 1 µe m 2 s 1 corresponds to 0 219 w m 2 to convert µe m 2 s 1 to w m 2 then we obtained j s 1 since by definition 1 w 1 j s 1 and the j m 2 day 1 multiplying by the second in a day the solar energy input was calculated according to the following equation 1 e s u n l i g h t 0 219 e t where e s u n l i g h t is the solar energy expressed as j m 2 day 1 while e is the solar energy expressed as µe m 2 s 1 and t are the seconds in a day moreover the tidal energy which plays an important role in the water column mixing and ocean circulation blauw et al 2012 cadier et al 2017 jorge and beusekom 1995 was assessed on the base of information retrieved from the swedish national data service https snd gu se en catalog study ecds0243 001 the dimensionality of the data grid was 2880 5760 0 062 latitude x 0 062 longitude degrees we computed the energy contribution of tides using the following formula 2 e t i d e s 1 2 n t 365 h 2 ρ w g where n t is the annual number of tidal cycles h 2 is the annual average cycle amplitude m ρ w is the sea water density 1030 kg m 3 and g is the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 finally we accounted for the surface heat flow that is a crucial process in the earth s energy dynamics beardsmore et al 2001 since it represents one of the interfaces between earth s solid interior hydrosphere cryosphere and atmosphere fahnestock et al 2001 mashayek et al 2013 scott et al 2001 the global surface heat flow map produced by davies 2013 was used to assess the heat flow energy contribution the map was available as a 90 180 1 latitude x 1 longitude degree grid and the heat flow data were stored as mw m 2 we converted the values into j m2 day 1 to assess the heat flow daily energy finally to assess the exergy contribution we used an average carnot efficiency of 69 lee et al 2019 regarding the secondary energy inputs the wind stress on the ocean surface was firstly considered this stress influences the water column physical dynamics which in turn deeply affect phytoplanktonic organisms jorge and beusekom 1995 manwell et al 2010 we retrieved the wind speed from the era5 monthly averaged data hersbach et al 2019 which are stored in the copernicus climate data store cds the wind energy contribution to the marine systems has been calculated following the procedure developed by brown and ulgiati 2016a we computed the geostrophic wind velocity using the 10 m wind speed according to the following formula 3 3 v v r e f h h r e f α where v is the geostrophic wind velocity v r e f is the reference velocity wind speed at 10 m h is the height for the geostrophic wind 1000 m h r e f is the reference height 10 m and α is the surface roughness exponent 0 1 manwell et al 2010 subsequently the wind energy contribution was assessed according to the following formula 4 4 e w i n d 1 2 ρ a k g n v 3 a t where ρ a 1 229 kg m 3 is the air density at sea level k n g is a geostrophic drag coefficient 1 26 10 3 garratt 1994 a is an area of 1 m2 and t are the seconds in a day the chemical potential of rainfall over the ocean brown and ulgiati 2016b lee et al 2019 was assessed on the base of precipitation data retrieved from the era5 monthly averaged data stored as m day 1 and in a 720 1440 grid 0 25 latitude x 0 25 longitude degrees we computed the rain energy contribution according to the following equation 5 e r a i n r ρ w g where r is the rainfall m day 1 ρ w is the sea water density 1030 kg m 3 1030 103 g and g is the gibbs constant 4 72 j g 1 lee et al 2019 based on the era5 monthly averaged data we also assessed the terrestrial runoff that is an important nutrient input in coastal areas where it is accountable due to their higher production magnitude compared to open ocean data were stored in a 720 1440 0 25 latitude x 0 25 longitude degrees grid and expressed in m day 1 the chemical potential of runoff was computed through the following equation 6 e r u n o f f r ρ w g where r is the runoff expressed as m day 1 ρ w is the water density 106 g m 3 and g is the gibbs constant 4 72 j g 1 2 3 emergy accounting emergy measures the cumulative environmental support to a process odum 1996 1988 emergy accounting aims at evaluating the environmental performance of a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs driving the functioning of natural systems e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow and human driven flows driving socioeconomic systems brown and ulgiati 2016c 2016a franzese et al 2014 2009 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar emergy joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 mass and energy inputs to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support after the evaluation of the main energy inputs converging to the marine ecosystem and driving the phytoplankton production we converted them into emergy inputs sej m 2 day 1 by using specific unit emergy values uevs sej j 1 sej g 1 table 2 the uevs were updated to the last emergy baseline 1 20 1025 sej year 1 computed by brown et al 2016 once the emergy inputs were assessed we summed them to evaluate the total emergy supporting phytoplankton production for each month of the 2018 the total emergy was calculated following the emergy algebra rules according to the following formula proposed by brown and ulgiati 2016 7 e m t o t m a x e m s u n e m t i d e s e m h e a t f l o w e m w i n d e m r a i n e m r u n o f f this method compares the sum of the global tripartite with the largest of secondary and tertiary sources taking the larger of these two values as the emergy input following this procedure we produced 12 grids with a spatial resolution of 4320 8640 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees one for each month of 2018 in which we computed the emergy value of phytoplankton production for each pixel subsequently we mapped these grids and we computed an emergy production ratio in order to highlight different global patterns in the emergy conversion into primary production fig 5 8 and supplementary materials as pointed out in section 2 1 missing values in the grids and on the maps refer to missing value of the predictive variables used to estimate the primary production finally to analyze the temporal variability of the emergy production ratio we computed its variance for the 2018 the variance was computed using the values of each month for the same pixel in order to avoid biases we calculated the variance only for the pixels that showed at least 6 values out of 12 and less than 3 missing values in a row fig 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy inputs magnitude variability and hierarchy once assessed the contribution of the energy inputs to the marine system we analysed their magnitude and hierarchy fig 3 among the renewable energy input supporting phytoplankton primary production solar exergy had the larger maximum minimum and average values for the year 2018 table 3 this is not surprising since this component of the global tripartite is the main available source of energy for the biosphere and it allows the generation and the maintenance of natural systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium e g ecosystems in fact the solar energy exploitation by photosynthetic organisms which convert this free energy flux into chemical bonds fuels the bulk of natural systems the global inter annual variability of solar energy was not as pronounced as the one associated with other inputs in fact it was the only exergy source which showed a maximum and an average value of the same order of magnitude i e 107 j m 2 day 1 fig 3 tidal energy was the second member of the global tripartite that showed a large free energy contribution its maximum value was the closest to the solar one but its global variability showed different features in fact maximum and minimum tidal contribution where the most distant from each other showing a magnitude of 104 and 10 4 respectively table 3 this feature reflects the differences of tidal amplitude in distinct areas especially between open ocean and costal zones from an ecological perspective tides deeply influence the ocean physical dynamics which in turn affect the living organism especially the planktonic ones in fact tides generate tidal currents which in turn influence the dynamic of the water column moreover tidal mixing phenomena generates upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters to the euphotic zone thus affecting phytoplankton composition and production jorge and beusekom 1995 blauw et al 2012 cadier et al 2017 the contribution of geothermal flow was lower than the other two primary renewable resources with an average global contribution of 5 81 103 j m 2 day 1 table 3 on the other hand it showed the smaller distance between maximum and minimum among all the energy sources taken into account i e only two orders of magnitude the role of the heat flow on large scale circulation and tracer distribution was highlighted by several studies with particular emphasis for the deep ocean circulation beardsmore et al 2001 mashayek et al 2013 scott et al 2001 accordingly global circulation patterns and nutrients upwelling phenomena which deeply influence global phytoplankton production are related to this energy source the wind energy input showed characteristics similar to tidal energy its maximum value was several orders of magnitude larger than its minimum fig 3 conversely the maximum value of wind energy contribution to the marine system was lower than the tidal one while its global average was larger from a global perspective surface circulation is deeply influenced by winds net input of kinetic energy into the oceans furthermore the winds ocean interaction supports the formation of waves and deep stable stratification both of which affect living organisms within the water column jorge and beusekom 1995 manwell et al 2010 zhai 2013 the rainfall and runoff contribution to the marine system has been taken into account as chemical potential which can be defined as the tendency of a substance to change job and herrmann 2006 the contribution of the precipitation resulted larger from a maximum minimum and average perspective compared to runoff fig 3 this difference was particularly evident when the average was taken into account in fact while the difference does not seem high for the maximum and minimum values the rainfall average contribution was an order of magnitude larger than the runoff one table 3 rainfall influences several aspects of the ocean surface such as temperature and salinity these physical characteristics in turn affect both sea water density and interactions with the atmosphere determining stratification phenomena and gas solubility doney 1995 schlössel et al 1997 although the runoff maximum contribution was lower than the other secondary energy inputs it was of the same magnitude order 105 on the other hand runoff showed the lowest global average value fig 3 since its effect is limited to coastal areas where its contribution to the marine system and primary production is not negligible in fact it provides new nutrients from land ecosystems thus boosting phytoplankton production which is frequently nutrient limited chase et al 2007 spatharis et al 2008 3 2 emergy inputs magnitude variability and hierarchy table 4 shows the emergy value of the energy inputs supporting global phytoplankton production the emergy values are compared in fig 4 since the conversion only involved the multiplication by constant values uevs the variability of each energy source was not affected and the features showed in the previous paragraph are still valid on the other hand the magnitude of the contribution from the emergy perspective was different with respect to the energy one fig 3 tides was the global tripartite component that showed the highest maximum and average emergy contribution to the marine system but they still presented the second lowest minimum these features show how the contribution of tides is not homogeneous between different marine areas the contribution of runoff and rainfall chemical potential was also high in fact their high uev values reflect that they cannot be disregarded when assessing ecological systems job and herrmann 2006 lee et al 2019 heat flow and wind emergy resulted to be very close from a maximum and a global average perspective as stated in section 3 1 the former heats the deep ocean thus influencing the large scale ocean circulation while the latter interacts with the shallower layers driving the surface water movements conversely the wind emergy minimum is still the lowest one among the considered inputs thus remarking its high global variability from a global perspective we found that all the inputs shared the same order of magnitude 107 of the daily average for the 2018 fig 4 the 2018 total emergy input to the phytoplankton primary production computed from our analysis was 8 26 1024 sej y 1 3 3 global emergy of phytoplankton primary production once the global inputs of energy flows were assessed and converted into emergy units we computed the total emergy supporting phytoplankton primary production 8 26 1024 sej y 1 and the emergy to production ratio the latter allowed to highlight marine system areas that interact differently with the energy inputs in fact a large emergy to production ratio was associated to areas which showed either a high level of emergy flows but low phytoplankton production or elevated primary production and huge emergy flows we analysed the global maps of integrated production emergy and emergy to production ratio for 4 different months which in turn refer to seasonal phases of phytoplankton global cycle figs 5 to 8 from an ecological perspective we used this analysis to highlight both temporal and spatial patterns associated with phytoplankton production january 2018 presented low level of phytoplankton production in most areas of the northern hemisphere fig 5a this production contraction during the winter months is a common feature at northern temperate latitudes 23 5 to 66 5 n especially in the north atlantic the majority of the north pacific and the mediterranean basins this phenomenon is mainly due to the lack of solar radiation which plays a key role in the photosynthetic process this characteristic can be noted also in the emergy map fig 5b which shows low values for the abovementioned areas moreover the high values of the emergy to production ratio in the rare areas that show high emergy levels highlight the impossibility to convert the available energy into primary production fig 5c a notable exception to this trend is the high level of production in the arabian sea since its phytoplankton dynamics are mainly driven by the nutrients upwelling caused by the monsoon cycles that characterize the area dickson et al 2001 on the other hand the southern hemisphere shows an opposite trend since solar energy is not a limiting factor during this period of the year high levels of primary production can be found in the coastal areas of argentina uruguay and south brazil in this continental shelf area the interactions between brazil and malvinas currents generate an upwelling of nutrients which coupled with favourable irradiation conditions generates a remarkable magnitude of phytoplankton production a large share of production characterizes also the southern portion of the oceans especially along the subtropical front favourable conditions for the phytoplankton production are reflected by the emergy to production ratio in fact this ratio shows low values in spite of the large level of emergy that characterizes these highly productive areas this feature suggests that during this period of the year the energy conveyed to the system can be effectively converted into phytoplankton production during spring fig 6 a we can notice an enhancement of the primary production in the northern temperate zone in fact a spring phytoplankton production peak is a common feature in this area this peak is fueled by the coupling of a high nutrient concentration in the euphotic zone which is the result of the low consumption rate during the winter months and a raise of the irradiance level even if we do not have the same spatial coverage of northern hemisphere during january and april a production enhancement can be shown in the northern part of the atlantic pacific and mediterranean basins we can see this trend in these areas also looking at the emergy to production ratio which is lower in fig 6c with respect to fig 5c particularly high values of production are found near the coast where the nutrient inputs from land can deeply influence the phytoplankton growth this is a general feature of the oceanic production and will be later discussed along with other characteristics that are more dependent on the spatial variability than the temporal one in the southern hemisphere we can observe an overall reduction of primary production with respect to fig 5 the decrease is coupled with an increase of the emergy to production ratio which suggests that external factors such as nutrient depletion and lowering in irradiance could affect primary production during the summer months in the northern hemisphere the production peak shifted towards higher latitude this feature is highlighted by both fig 7 a and c which showed higher production and lower emergy to production ratio values respectively on the other hand areas in which the nutrients consumed during the spring maximum were not replenished by land inputs showed a decrease in production and a raise in the production to emergy ratio this is partially due to a strong surface stratification caused by the high level of irradiance that characterizes the summer months the mediterranean basin and the strip of the atlantic ocean that showed a spring peak fall in the latter described category the areas which show a large emergy to production ratio in the higher latitudes are those which also receive a high share of energy since phytoplankton production is a biological process it has biological constraints and when the maximum value is reached additional energy will not result in a production enhancement fig 7 in the southern hemisphere the information was limited since remotely sensed estimates of chlorophyll a concentration are not always available nonetheless we can notice a boost in the phytoplankton production coupled with a decrease in the emergy to production ratio along the coast of africa oceania south america and south asia with respect to april fig 6 the last considered month was october the overall production magnitude keeps contracting in the north atlantic and the northeast pacific ocean conversely few areas such as the mediterranean basin and the northwest pacific experienced a second production peak fig 8 a the former phenomenon was mainly due to the reduction in solar energy during autumn while the latter could be caused by a seasonal mixing that occurs with the lowering of seas surface temperature and the following surface stratification break this mixing brings nutrients in the euphotic zone thus resulting in a second seasonal peak in the southern hemisphere the production raised with respect to april in fact in october the irradiance available in this part of the world increases positively influencing the phytoplankton production accordingly the emergy to production ratio was considerably low in the south area of the main basins we observed that several patterns highlighted by the emergy assessment were more dependent on the geographical characteristics of the area than on the seasonal cycle of the phytoplankton production for instance the upwelling areas showed common features independently of the season these areas presented a higher level of production compared to other regions moreover even if the emergy values in these zones were high the emergy to production ratio was consistently low this feature pointed out how these areas can exploit the energy potential thanks to new nutrients coming from deep layers of the water column the equatorial pacific the coast of chile the coast of peru the brazil malvinas current interaction zone the coast of angola and the subtropical front perfectly fit this description another general pattern was the tendency to have higher levels of phytoplankton production in coastal areas in fact these areas are influenced by nutrient inputs from land or from coastal upwelling phenomena both enhancing primary production conversely open ocean regions are often associated with low production values sinking of organic matter and water column stratification often lead these areas to nutrient depletion which in turn limits the phytoplankton no matter what energy inputs can fuel the system for these reasons open ocean is generally characterized by high level of emergy production ratio to further exploit the information provided by the emergy to production ratio we analysed its variability during the year therefore we computed the variance of this ratio for each pixel that showed less than 6 missing values and less than 3 missing values in a row out of 12 i e one for each month the rationale behind this procedure was to avoid biases in the variance computation due to over and under represented periods of the year the grid obtained was used to produce a map which displays the variability of the emergy to production ratio on a global scale fig 9 b the exclusion of the areas with not enough data or which presented more than 3 months of missing values in a row led to a loss of information at higher latitudes on the other hand this procedure returned a more reliable variance assessment which in turn led to a more consistent analysis from an ecological perspective it was not surprising to find a lower variance in the upwelling areas since nutrients are the most limiting factor in oceanic phytoplankton production if an upwelling phenomenon provides continuous fuel for exploiting the potential available energy the production will receive a boost in both magnitude and stability a stable level of primary production throughout the year is an important feature since it can support the structuring of complex food webs conveying more energy towards higher trophic levels in this context the emergy to primary production ratio can be seen as an inverse measure of energy transfer efficiency in the trophic webs the equatorial pacific upwelling system is among the largest and most stable ones in fact the pacific ocean is one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world not only due to his large extension but also because it encompasses several upwelling areas two of the major upwelling systems in the atlantic ocean i e brazil malvinas currents interaction and angola coast share the same low variance values not surprisingly areas subjected to strong seasonality show a larger level of variability this feature well suits several areas whose characteristics were previously described in this paragraph such as the north atlantic and the north and the south pacific the mediterranean sea showed a low variance of the emergy to production ratio this basin is a closed and oligotrophic one which has an overall low potential in terms of phytoplankton production indeed its low variability of the emergy to production ratio can be interpreted as a consequence of these peculiar features finally we analysed the latitudinal trend of the emergy to production ratio variance by computing the average of each row in the grid fig 9a the two hemispheres show different characteristics mainly due to the difference in land coverage which in turn affects the seasonality and the trends of phytoplankton production in the northern hemisphere we saw high levels of variability around 50 n since this latitude encompasses several areas characterized by strong seasonality subsequently the average values decrease to a local minimum around 40 n this low variability was due to the presence of the mediterranean basin whose low potential heavily affects the average computation in this latitudinal range the variability remains constant till 32 n where it raised again reaching maximum values around 8 n this area includes atlantic and pacific areas dominated by strong primary production seasonality from 8 n to the equator the average variability steadily decreased till a minimum value the low values of variance that characterizes this area could be attributed mainly to the stable environmental conditions of the equator in the southern hemisphere the average variability raised to a local maximum value from 0 to roughly 25 s this area includes coastal and open oceans area with a marked seasonality e g the indian ocean the latter was the first strong difference between the two hemispheres from 20 to roughly 30 s the average variance oscillates around local maximum values this feature was due to the presence of both stable areas and areas affected by strong seasonality in fact the former latitudes encompass areas such as the pacific upwelling area which was one of the most stable and productive and less stable areas such as the eastern africa coast and the southern indian ocean then the average variability dropped till 38 s and showed a second peak around 42 n finally the average emergy to production variance drop again and remains relatively constant till 47 s this substantial drop was mainly linked to the production stability of the subtropical front which sustains a high level of production throughout the year and was previously highlighted as one of the most productive areas this was the last evident characteristic that distinguished the two hemispheres then the average variability spikes again to maximum values around 52 s where our analysis had to stop due to missing information the uncertainties in this work are related to both the primary production and emergy estimates the former appraisals were produced using an ann model scardi 2001 which was analysed and compared with several other estimators campbell et al 2002 carr et al 2006 friedrichs et al 2009 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 the comparison works determined a range of 49 60 gt c y 1 carr et al 2006 for the global annual phytoplankton production this uncertainty highlights need to further investigate this important biological process the high level of variability of this process coupled with data paucity have been recognised as the main limiting factors influencing our ability to model the global marine phytoplankton production our analysis of global phytoplankton production is also limited to the ocean areas for which satellite data are available from the emergy perspective the main uncertainties derived from the spatio temporal coverage of the considered variables and possibility to assess their variability for example the tides and the heat flow data used in this work have an annual temporal resolution thus not convoying any inter annual variability in our analysis moreover the heat flow dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 latitude x 1 longitude even on a global scale this coarse resolution limits the spatial details provided by this variable one possible effect of a coarse input resolution could be the detail loss especially in the land sea and in the coast open sea interface these limitations could be overcome by enhancing the spatio temporal resolution of the environmental variables used as inputs finally the access to different estimates for each environmental variable could be useful to assess their uncertainty and how they affect the global emergy appraisals from a numerical perspective unfortunately it is not an easy task to find global and ready to use datasets for most of the environmental variables used in this work 4 conclusions in this work we combined ml and environmental accounting models to perform a global assessment of phytoplankton primary production the ann technique was used to estimate phytoplankton production while the emergy accounting method was used to assess the energy input flows supporting primary production at global scale the proposed methodology allowed to analyze both temporal and geographical global patterns of oceanic primary production and to compute an emergy production ratio showing different global patterns in terms of emergy convergence into the primary production process we believe that the assessment of global phytoplankton production proposed in this work could be a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of this pivotal biological process from a systems perspective the global assessment can also provide a useful benchmark for future assessment of marine ecosystem services at global scale in fact phytoplankton production plays a crucial role as energy source for structuring the marine food webs on which in turn depends the generation of ecosystem services vital

24622,the emergy accounting method has been widely applied to terrestrial and marine ecosystems although there is a lack of emergy studies focusing on phytoplankton primary production phytoplankton production is a pivotal process since it is intimately coupled with oceanic food webs energy fluxes carbon cycle and earth s climate in this study we proposed a new methodology to perform a biophysical assessment of the global phytoplankton primary production combining machine learning ml techniques and an emergy based accounting model firstly we produced global phytoplankton production estimates using an artificial neural network ann model secondly we assessed the main energy inputs supporting the global phytoplankton production finally we converted these inputs into emergy units and analysed the results from an ecological perspective among the energy flows tides showed the highest maximum emergy contribution to global phytoplankton production highlighting the importance of thise flow in the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems in addition an emergy production ratio was calculated showing different global patterns in terms of emergy convergence into the primary production process we believe that the proposed emergy based assessment of phytoplankton production could be extremely valuable to improve our understanding of this key biological process at global scale adopting a systems perspective this model can also provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of marine ecosystem services at global scale keywords phytoplankton primary production

characterized by complex networks and emergent properties buonocore et al 2019 jørgensen et al 2011 jørgensen and fath 2004 several functions have been identified as principles able to explore ecosystems complexity and development these functions are known as goal functions gfs and can be divided into three macro categories the biotic the network and the thermodynamic gfs jørgensen and

implemented an emergy based assessment for coastal and marine ecosystem services in china while many emergy studies have been applied to explore benthic marine ecosystems there is a lack of emergy studies focusing on marine primary production in the water column at both local and global scales in the context of marine ecosystems phytoplankton primary production is a crucial biological process since it accounts for about 94 and 50 of marine and global autotrophic production duarte and cebrián 1996 accordingly phytoplankton production represents the bulk of energy for structuring marine food webs allowing the generation of natural capital stocks and the delivery of provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services blythe et al 2020 buonocore et al 2020a chakraborty et al 2020 furthermore phytoplankton production exerts a regulating effect on earth s climate through a net uptake of co2 from the atmosphere with a share of the fixed carbon removed from the fast carbon cycle through sinking of organic matter longhurst and glen harrison 1989 for these reasons phytoplankton production is a pivotal component of marine ecosystems functioning and enhancing its understanding is a central issue in modern oceanography the study of marine phytoplankton production on a global scale requires to be supported by ecological models this support maximizes theinformation derived from in situ measurements which are expensive and time consuming several models were developed to estimate primary production from ocean color and some of them were compared in published studies carr et al 2006 friedrichs et al 2009 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 among the available phytoplankton production estimators the one developed by scardi 2001 is based on a machine learning ml technique i e artificial neural network ann the strengths of the ml approaches rely on the ability to handle complex and non linear relationships which are ubiquitous in natural systems catucci and scardi 2020 franceschini et al 2019 lek et al 1996 mattei and scardi 2020 olden et al 2008 moreover they can exploit a wide range of predictive variables since no a priori explicit mathematical formulation of the link between predictive variables and the output is needed the latter feature is extremely valuable when remotely sensed information is taken into account since phytoplankton primary production is a central process in the marine ecosystem functioning several research areas could benefit from a deepening in the understanding of its dynamics from a climate perspective a global assessment of phytoplankton production could improve the comprehension of climate change effects on this process and to the ones related to it such as the global carbon cycle blanchard et al 2012 barange et al 2014 maureaud et al 2017 behrenfeld et al 2006 boyce et al 2010 moreover several marine ecosystem services and functions are related to phytoplankton autotrophic production buonocore et al 2019 costanza et al 1997 melaku canu et al 2015 richardson and schoeman 2004 accordingly the management of the marine system and its resources is deeply linked with the characteristics of this biological process nixon 1992 conti and scardi 2010 russo et al 2019 in this work we developed and applied a novel methodology to perform a biophysical assessment of the global phytoplankton primary production combining ml techniques and an emergy based environmental accounting model 2 materials and methods the integrated modeling approach implemented in this study could be divided in three main steps firstly we estimated the global phytoplankton production using an ann model which requires only predictive variables that can be either retrieved from remote sensing platforms or derived from them the latter feature allows the model user to freely retrieve the needed information from online repositories secondly we gathered all the information about the main energy inputs converging to the marine ecosystem and influencing the phytoplankton production matter inputs to the primary production can be mainly considered as quantities continuously recycling into the system on a global scale for this reason we assumed that matter inputs do not carry any emergy value and were not considered for the emergy analysis in this work finally we converted the energy inputs into emergy units and explored our results using data analysis and visualization tools the methodology was applied on data referred to the year 2018 since it was the most recent year for which all the needed data were available the main steps of our approach are described in the following paragraphs 2 1 phytoplankton primary production model we used an ann model scardi 2001 to estimate integrated phytoplankton primary production on a global scale the ann was trained with a classic version of the error back propagation algorithm rumelhart et al 1986 the software used to train the ann was developed in fortran 90 the fortran program and a python script to estimate the phytoplankton production are available upon request the predictive variables included the day of the year and the geographic coordinates of the selected area the coordinates were extracted from a 4320 8640 matrix latitude x longitude with a resolution of 0 041 0 041 this resolution was selected for consistency with the modis aqua data the day of the year was set as the 15th day of each month to provide a mean monthly estimate the day of the year and the longitude were passed as input after a trigonometric transformation which produced two derived variables while the latitude was not transformed mattei et al 2018 scardi 2001 the model also needed the surface irradiance frouin et al 2012 frouin and pinker 1995 sea surface temperature werdell et al 2013 and surface chlorophyll a concentration hu et al 2012 morel and maritorena 2001 o reilly et al 1998 werdell and bailey 2005 these predictors can be downloaded from the modis aqua repository at the following link https oceandata sci gsfc nasa gov modis aqua mapped monthly 4km these environmental variables are available with a resolution of 0 041 0 041 4320 8640 latitude x longitude grids the last three predictive variables were computed using models or mathematical equations the first was the mixed layer depth which could be estimated using several models e g monterey and levitus levitus et al 1994 levitus and boyer 1994 the second one was the daylength which we computed as function of the day of the year and latitude the last one was the pb opt which is a physiological variable computed as function of the sea surface temperature behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 a list of the ann model inputs and output is shown in table 1 after retrieving the predictive variables we used the ann model to estimate the mean phytoplankton production on a global scale for each month of the year 2018 we kept the 4 km resolution of the modis aqua data thus producing a 4320 8640 grid 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees ascii file for each month containing the production appraisals subsequently we used these files to generate global production maps figure 1 shows the global production map generated for january 2018 the maps generated for all the months of the year are available in the online supplementary materials the missing values shown as black pixels in fig 1 represent the areas for which the predictive variables were not available the lack of information was mainly due to the cloud coverage of the ocean which impeded the measurement of surface chlorophyll a from remote sensing platforms this phenomenon was not homogeneous neither spatially nor temporally in fact the main affected areas were those at higher latitude with different patterns throughout the year see supplementary materials and figs 5 8 2 2 energy inputs we relied on both the ecological knowledge of the phytoplankton production process reynolds 2006 and the current literature on emergy accounting brown and ulgiati 2016a campbell and tilley 2016 lee et al 2019 to identify and assess the main energy inputs supporting phytoplankton primary production at global scale fig 2 the energy inputs can be divided in primary and secondary sources the primary renewable energy inputs also known as the global tripartite comprise the solar tidal and geothermal exergy brown et al 2016 the secondary renewable energy sources are generated by the interactions of the primary ones the first primary renewable input taken into account was the solar energy we converted the same photosynthetically active radiation par data used as input for the ann model into total solar radiation total radiation 2 32 par this variable showed the higher resolution among the gathered data and was stored in a 4320 8640 grid 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees the unit of measure was converted from e m 2 day 1 to j m 2 day 1 to evaluate the energy contribution to the system this was not a straightforward operation since the former measures energy quanta while the latter refers to an energy flux we used the relationship found by britton and dodd 1976 1 µe m 2 s 1 corresponds to 0 219 w m 2 to convert µe m 2 s 1 to w m 2 then we obtained j s 1 since by definition 1 w 1 j s 1 and the j m 2 day 1 multiplying by the second in a day the solar energy input was calculated according to the following equation 1 e s u n l i g h t 0 219 e t where e s u n l i g h t is the solar energy expressed as j m 2 day 1 while e is the solar energy expressed as µe m 2 s 1 and t are the seconds in a day moreover the tidal energy which plays an important role in the water column mixing and ocean circulation blauw et al 2012 cadier et al 2017 jorge and beusekom 1995 was assessed on the base of information retrieved from the swedish national data service https snd gu se en catalog study ecds0243 001 the dimensionality of the data grid was 2880 5760 0 062 latitude x 0 062 longitude degrees we computed the energy contribution of tides using the following formula 2 e t i d e s 1 2 n t 365 h 2 ρ w g where n t is the annual number of tidal cycles h 2 is the annual average cycle amplitude m ρ w is the sea water density 1030 kg m 3 and g is the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 finally we accounted for the surface heat flow that is a crucial process in the earth s energy dynamics beardsmore et al 2001 since it represents one of the interfaces between earth s solid interior hydrosphere cryosphere and atmosphere fahnestock et al 2001 mashayek et al 2013 scott et al 2001 the global surface heat flow map produced by davies 2013 was used to assess the heat flow energy contribution the map was available as a 90 180 1 latitude x 1 longitude degree grid and the heat flow data were stored as mw m 2 we converted the values into j m2 day 1 to assess the heat flow daily energy finally to assess the exergy contribution we used an average carnot efficiency of 69 lee et al 2019 regarding the secondary energy inputs the wind stress on the ocean surface was firstly considered this stress influences the water column physical dynamics which in turn deeply affect phytoplanktonic organisms jorge and beusekom 1995 manwell et al 2010 we retrieved the wind speed from the era5 monthly averaged data hersbach et al 2019 which are stored in the copernicus climate data store cds the wind energy contribution to the marine systems has been calculated following the procedure developed by brown and ulgiati 2016a we computed the geostrophic wind velocity using the 10 m wind speed according to the following formula 3 3 v v r e f h h r e f α where v is the geostrophic wind velocity v r e f is the reference velocity wind speed at 10 m h is the height for the geostrophic wind 1000 m h r e f is the reference height 10 m and α is the surface roughness exponent 0 1 manwell et al 2010 subsequently the wind energy contribution was assessed according to the following formula 4 4 e w i n d 1 2 ρ a k g n v 3 a t where ρ a 1 229 kg m 3 is the air density at sea level k n g is a geostrophic drag coefficient 1 26 10 3 garratt 1994 a is an area of 1 m2 and t are the seconds in a day the chemical potential of rainfall over the ocean brown and ulgiati 2016b lee et al 2019 was assessed on the base of precipitation data retrieved from the era5 monthly averaged data stored as m day 1 and in a 720 1440 grid 0 25 latitude x 0 25 longitude degrees we computed the rain energy contribution according to the following equation 5 e r a i n r ρ w g where r is the rainfall m day 1 ρ w is the sea water density 1030 kg m 3 1030 103 g and g is the gibbs constant 4 72 j g 1 lee et al 2019 based on the era5 monthly averaged data we also assessed the terrestrial runoff that is an important nutrient input in coastal areas where it is accountable due to their higher production magnitude compared to open ocean data were stored in a 720 1440 0 25 latitude x 0 25 longitude degrees grid and expressed in m day 1 the chemical potential of runoff was computed through the following equation 6 e r u n o f f r ρ w g where r is the runoff expressed as m day 1 ρ w is the water density 106 g m 3 and g is the gibbs constant 4 72 j g 1 2 3 emergy accounting emergy measures the cumulative environmental support to a process odum 1996 1988 emergy accounting aims at evaluating the environmental performance of a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs driving the functioning of natural systems e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow and human driven flows driving socioeconomic systems brown and ulgiati 2016c 2016a franzese et al 2014 2009 according to this method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar emergy joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 mass and energy inputs to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to calculate the total emergy support after the evaluation of the main energy inputs converging to the marine ecosystem and driving the phytoplankton production we converted them into emergy inputs sej m 2 day 1 by using specific unit emergy values uevs sej j 1 sej g 1 table 2 the uevs were updated to the last emergy baseline 1 20 1025 sej year 1 computed by brown et al 2016 once the emergy inputs were assessed we summed them to evaluate the total emergy supporting phytoplankton production for each month of the 2018 the total emergy was calculated following the emergy algebra rules according to the following formula proposed by brown and ulgiati 2016 7 e m t o t m a x e m s u n e m t i d e s e m h e a t f l o w e m w i n d e m r a i n e m r u n o f f this method compares the sum of the global tripartite with the largest of secondary and tertiary sources taking the larger of these two values as the emergy input following this procedure we produced 12 grids with a spatial resolution of 4320 8640 0 041 latitude x 0 041 longitude degrees one for each month of 2018 in which we computed the emergy value of phytoplankton production for each pixel subsequently we mapped these grids and we computed an emergy production ratio in order to highlight different global patterns in the emergy conversion into primary production fig 5 8 and supplementary materials as pointed out in section 2 1 missing values in the grids and on the maps refer to missing value of the predictive variables used to estimate the primary production finally to analyze the temporal variability of the emergy production ratio we computed its variance for the 2018 the variance was computed using the values of each month for the same pixel in order to avoid biases we calculated the variance only for the pixels that showed at least 6 values out of 12 and less than 3 missing values in a row fig 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy inputs magnitude variability and hierarchy once assessed the contribution of the energy inputs to the marine system we analysed their magnitude and hierarchy fig 3 among the renewable energy input supporting phytoplankton primary production solar exergy had the larger maximum minimum and average values for the year 2018 table 3 this is not surprising since this component of the global tripartite is the main available source of energy for the biosphere and it allows the generation and the maintenance of natural systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium e g ecosystems in fact the solar energy exploitation by photosynthetic organisms which convert this free energy flux into chemical bonds fuels the bulk of natural systems the global inter annual variability of solar energy was not as pronounced as the one associated with other inputs in fact it was the only exergy source which showed a maximum and an average value of the same order of magnitude i e 107 j m 2 day 1 fig 3 tidal energy was the second member of the global tripartite that showed a large free energy contribution its maximum value was the closest to the solar one but its global variability showed different features in fact maximum and minimum tidal contribution where the most distant from each other showing a magnitude of 104 and 10 4 respectively table 3 this feature reflects the differences of tidal amplitude in distinct areas especially between open ocean and costal zones from an ecological perspective tides deeply influence the ocean physical dynamics which in turn affect the living organism especially the planktonic ones in fact tides generate tidal currents which in turn influence the dynamic of the water column moreover tidal mixing phenomena generates upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters to the euphotic zone thus affecting phytoplankton composition and production jorge and beusekom 1995 blauw et al 2012 cadier et al 2017 the contribution of geothermal flow was lower than the other two primary renewable resources with an average global contribution of 5 81 103 j m 2 day 1 table 3 on the other hand it showed the smaller distance between maximum and minimum among all the energy sources taken into account i e only two orders of magnitude the role of the heat flow on large scale circulation and tracer distribution was highlighted by several studies with particular emphasis for the deep ocean circulation beardsmore et al 2001 mashayek et al 2013 scott et al 2001 accordingly global circulation patterns and nutrients upwelling phenomena which deeply influence global phytoplankton production are related to this energy source the wind energy input showed characteristics similar to tidal energy its maximum value was several orders of magnitude larger than its minimum fig 3 conversely the maximum value of wind energy contribution to the marine system was lower than the tidal one while its global average was larger from a global perspective surface circulation is deeply influenced by winds net input of kinetic energy into the oceans furthermore the winds ocean interaction supports the formation of waves and deep stable stratification both of which affect living organisms within the water column jorge and beusekom 1995 manwell et al 2010 zhai 2013 the rainfall and runoff contribution to the marine system has been taken into account as chemical potential which can be defined as the tendency of a substance to change job and herrmann 2006 the contribution of the precipitation resulted larger from a maximum minimum and average perspective compared to runoff fig 3 this difference was particularly evident when the average was taken into account in fact while the difference does not seem high for the maximum and minimum values the rainfall average contribution was an order of magnitude larger than the runoff one table 3 rainfall influences several aspects of the ocean surface such as temperature and salinity these physical characteristics in turn affect both sea water density and interactions with the atmosphere determining stratification phenomena and gas solubility doney 1995 schlössel et al 1997 although the runoff maximum contribution was lower than the other secondary energy inputs it was of the same magnitude order 105 on the other hand runoff showed the lowest global average value fig 3 since its effect is limited to coastal areas where its contribution to the marine system and primary production is not negligible in fact it provides new nutrients from land ecosystems thus boosting phytoplankton production which is frequently nutrient limited chase et al 2007 spatharis et al 2008 3 2 emergy inputs magnitude variability and hierarchy table 4 shows the emergy value of the energy inputs supporting global phytoplankton production the emergy values are compared in fig 4 since the conversion only involved the multiplication by constant values uevs the variability of each energy source was not affected and the features showed in the previous paragraph are still valid on the other hand the magnitude of the contribution from the emergy perspective was different with respect to the energy one fig 3 tides was the global tripartite component that showed the highest maximum and average emergy contribution to the marine system but they still presented the second lowest minimum these features show how the contribution of tides is not homogeneous between different marine areas the contribution of runoff and rainfall chemical potential was also high in fact their high uev values reflect that they cannot be disregarded when assessing ecological systems job and herrmann 2006 lee et al 2019 heat flow and wind emergy resulted to be very close from a maximum and a global average perspective as stated in section 3 1 the former heats the deep ocean thus influencing the large scale ocean circulation while the latter interacts with the shallower layers driving the surface water movements conversely the wind emergy minimum is still the lowest one among the considered inputs thus remarking its high global variability from a global perspective we found that all the inputs shared the same order of magnitude 107 of the daily average for the 2018 fig 4 the 2018 total emergy input to the phytoplankton primary production computed from our analysis was 8 26 1024 sej y 1 3 3 global emergy of phytoplankton primary production once the global inputs of energy flows were assessed and converted into emergy units we computed the total emergy supporting phytoplankton primary production 8 26 1024 sej y 1 and the emergy to production ratio the latter allowed to highlight marine system areas that interact differently with the energy inputs in fact a large emergy to production ratio was associated to areas which showed either a high level of emergy flows but low phytoplankton production or elevated primary production and huge emergy flows we analysed the global maps of integrated production emergy and emergy to production ratio for 4 different months which in turn refer to seasonal phases of phytoplankton global cycle figs 5 to 8 from an ecological perspective we used this analysis to highlight both temporal and spatial patterns associated with phytoplankton production january 2018 presented low level of phytoplankton production in most areas of the northern hemisphere fig 5a this production contraction during the winter months is a common feature at northern temperate latitudes 23 5 to 66 5 n especially in the north atlantic the majority of the north pacific and the mediterranean basins this phenomenon is mainly due to the lack of solar radiation which plays a key role in the photosynthetic process this characteristic can be noted also in the emergy map fig 5b which shows low values for the abovementioned areas moreover the high values of the emergy to production ratio in the rare areas that show high emergy levels highlight the impossibility to convert the available energy into primary production fig 5c a notable exception to this trend is the high level of production in the arabian sea since its phytoplankton dynamics are mainly driven by the nutrients upwelling caused by the monsoon cycles that characterize the area dickson et al 2001 on the other hand the southern hemisphere shows an opposite trend since solar energy is not a limiting factor during this period of the year high levels of primary production can be found in the coastal areas of argentina uruguay and south brazil in this continental shelf area the interactions between brazil and malvinas currents generate an upwelling of nutrients which coupled with favourable irradiation conditions generates a remarkable magnitude of phytoplankton production a large share of production characterizes also the southern portion of the oceans especially along the subtropical front favourable conditions for the phytoplankton production are reflected by the emergy to production ratio in fact this ratio shows low values in spite of the large level of emergy that characterizes these highly productive areas this feature suggests that during this period of the year the energy conveyed to the system can be effectively converted into phytoplankton production during spring fig 6 a we can notice an enhancement of the primary production in the northern temperate zone in fact a spring phytoplankton production peak is a common feature in this area this peak is fueled by the coupling of a high nutrient concentration in the euphotic zone which is the result of the low consumption rate during the winter months and a raise of the irradiance level even if we do not have the same spatial coverage of northern hemisphere during january and april a production enhancement can be shown in the northern part of the atlantic pacific and mediterranean basins we can see this trend in these areas also looking at the emergy to production ratio which is lower in fig 6c with respect to fig 5c particularly high values of production are found near the coast where the nutrient inputs from land can deeply influence the phytoplankton growth this is a general feature of the oceanic production and will be later discussed along with other characteristics that are more dependent on the spatial variability than the temporal one in the southern hemisphere we can observe an overall reduction of primary production with respect to fig 5 the decrease is coupled with an increase of the emergy to production ratio which suggests that external factors such as nutrient depletion and lowering in irradiance could affect primary production during the summer months in the northern hemisphere the production peak shifted towards higher latitude this feature is highlighted by both fig 7 a and c which showed higher production and lower emergy to production ratio values respectively on the other hand areas in which the nutrients consumed during the spring maximum were not replenished by land inputs showed a decrease in production and a raise in the production to emergy ratio this is partially due to a strong surface stratification caused by the high level of irradiance that characterizes the summer months the mediterranean basin and the strip of the atlantic ocean that showed a spring peak fall in the latter described category the areas which show a large emergy to production ratio in the higher latitudes are those which also receive a high share of energy since phytoplankton production is a biological process it has biological constraints and when the maximum value is reached additional energy will not result in a production enhancement fig 7 in the southern hemisphere the information was limited since remotely sensed estimates of chlorophyll a concentration are not always available nonetheless we can notice a boost in the phytoplankton production coupled with a decrease in the emergy to production ratio along the coast of africa oceania south america and south asia with respect to april fig 6 the last considered month was october the overall production magnitude keeps contracting in the north atlantic and the northeast pacific ocean conversely few areas such as the mediterranean basin and the northwest pacific experienced a second production peak fig 8 a the former phenomenon was mainly due to the reduction in solar energy during autumn while the latter could be caused by a seasonal mixing that occurs with the lowering of seas surface temperature and the following surface stratification break this mixing brings nutrients in the euphotic zone thus resulting in a second seasonal peak in the southern hemisphere the production raised with respect to april in fact in october the irradiance available in this part of the world increases positively influencing the phytoplankton production accordingly the emergy to production ratio was considerably low in the south area of the main basins we observed that several patterns highlighted by the emergy assessment were more dependent on the geographical characteristics of the area than on the seasonal cycle of the phytoplankton production for instance the upwelling areas showed common features independently of the season these areas presented a higher level of production compared to other regions moreover even if the emergy values in these zones were high the emergy to production ratio was consistently low this feature pointed out how these areas can exploit the energy potential thanks to new nutrients coming from deep layers of the water column the equatorial pacific the coast of chile the coast of peru the brazil malvinas current interaction zone the coast of angola and the subtropical front perfectly fit this description another general pattern was the tendency to have higher levels of phytoplankton production in coastal areas in fact these areas are influenced by nutrient inputs from land or from coastal upwelling phenomena both enhancing primary production conversely open ocean regions are often associated with low production values sinking of organic matter and water column stratification often lead these areas to nutrient depletion which in turn limits the phytoplankton no matter what energy inputs can fuel the system for these reasons open ocean is generally characterized by high level of emergy production ratio to further exploit the information provided by the emergy to production ratio we analysed its variability during the year therefore we computed the variance of this ratio for each pixel that showed less than 6 missing values and less than 3 missing values in a row out of 12 i e one for each month the rationale behind this procedure was to avoid biases in the variance computation due to over and under represented periods of the year the grid obtained was used to produce a map which displays the variability of the emergy to production ratio on a global scale fig 9 b the exclusion of the areas with not enough data or which presented more than 3 months of missing values in a row led to a loss of information at higher latitudes on the other hand this procedure returned a more reliable variance assessment which in turn led to a more consistent analysis from an ecological perspective it was not surprising to find a lower variance in the upwelling areas since nutrients are the most limiting factor in oceanic phytoplankton production if an upwelling phenomenon provides continuous fuel for exploiting the potential available energy the production will receive a boost in both magnitude and stability a stable level of primary production throughout the year is an important feature since it can support the structuring of complex food webs conveying more energy towards higher trophic levels in this context the emergy to primary production ratio can be seen as an inverse measure of energy transfer efficiency in the trophic webs the equatorial pacific upwelling system is among the largest and most stable ones in fact the pacific ocean is one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world not only due to his large extension but also because it encompasses several upwelling areas two of the major upwelling systems in the atlantic ocean i e brazil malvinas currents interaction and angola coast share the same low variance values not surprisingly areas subjected to strong seasonality show a larger level of variability this feature well suits several areas whose characteristics were previously described in this paragraph such as the north atlantic and the north and the south pacific the mediterranean sea showed a low variance of the emergy to production ratio this basin is a closed and oligotrophic one which has an overall low potential in terms of phytoplankton production indeed its low variability of the emergy to production ratio can be interpreted as a consequence of these peculiar features finally we analysed the latitudinal trend of the emergy to production ratio variance by computing the average of each row in the grid fig 9a the two hemispheres show different characteristics mainly due to the difference in land coverage which in turn affects the seasonality and the trends of phytoplankton production in the northern hemisphere we saw high levels of variability around 50 n since this latitude encompasses several areas characterized by strong seasonality subsequently the average values decrease to a local minimum around 40 n this low variability was due to the presence of the mediterranean basin whose low potential heavily affects the average computation in this latitudinal range the variability remains constant till 32 n where it raised again reaching maximum values around 8 n this area includes atlantic and pacific areas dominated by strong primary production seasonality from 8 n to the equator the average variability steadily decreased till a minimum value the low values of variance that characterizes this area could be attributed mainly to the stable environmental conditions of the equator in the southern hemisphere the average variability raised to a local maximum value from 0 to roughly 25 s this area includes coastal and open oceans area with a marked seasonality e g the indian ocean the latter was the first strong difference between the two hemispheres from 20 to roughly 30 s the average variance oscillates around local maximum values this feature was due to the presence of both stable areas and areas affected by strong seasonality in fact the former latitudes encompass areas such as the pacific upwelling area which was one of the most stable and productive and less stable areas such as the eastern africa coast and the southern indian ocean then the average variability dropped till 38 s and showed a second peak around 42 n finally the average emergy to production variance drop again and remains relatively constant till 47 s this substantial drop was mainly linked to the production stability of the subtropical front which sustains a high level of production throughout the year and was previously highlighted as one of the most productive areas this was the last evident characteristic that distinguished the two hemispheres then the average variability spikes again to maximum values around 52 s where our analysis had to stop due to missing information the uncertainties in this work are related to both the primary production and emergy estimates the former appraisals were produced using an ann model scardi 2001 which was analysed and compared with several other estimators campbell et al 2002 carr et al 2006 friedrichs et al 2009 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 the comparison works determined a range of 49 60 gt c y 1 carr et al 2006 for the global annual phytoplankton production this uncertainty highlights need to further investigate this important biological process the high level of variability of this process coupled with data paucity have been recognised as the main limiting factors influencing our ability to model the global marine phytoplankton production our analysis of global phytoplankton production is also limited to the ocean areas for which satellite data are available from the emergy perspective the main uncertainties derived from the spatio temporal coverage of the considered variables and possibility to assess their variability for example the tides and the heat flow data used in this work have an annual temporal resolution thus not convoying any inter annual variability in our analysis moreover the heat flow dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 latitude x 1 longitude even on a global scale this coarse resolution limits the spatial details provided by this variable one possible effect of a coarse input resolution could be the detail loss especially in the land sea and in the coast open sea interface these limitations could be overcome by enhancing the spatio temporal resolution of the environmental variables used as inputs finally the access to different estimates for each environmental variable could be useful to assess their uncertainty and how they affect the global emergy appraisals from a numerical perspective unfortunately it is not an easy task to find global and ready to use datasets for most of the environmental variables used in this work 4 conclusions in this work we combined ml and environmental accounting models to perform a global assessment of phytoplankton primary production the ann technique was used to estimate phytoplankton production while the emergy accounting method was used to assess the energy input flows supporting primary production at global scale the proposed methodology allowed to analyze both temporal and geographical global patterns of oceanic primary production and to compute an emergy production ratio showing different global patterns in terms of emergy convergence into the primary production process we believe that the assessment of global phytoplankton production proposed in this work could be a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of this pivotal biological process from a systems perspective the global assessment can also provide a useful benchmark for future assessment of marine ecosystem services at global scale in fact phytoplankton production plays a crucial role as energy source for structuring the marine food webs on which in turn depends the generation of ecosystem services vital

prediction results will also be distinguished after long term application and screening a few sdms coped well with environmental conditions and have been widely used up so far the generalized linear model glm proposed by nelder and wedderburn 1972 appeared very early and has been applied to the suitability research of species as a habitat suitability model glm performs a good analysis when there are a large number of species or lack of data hirzel et al 2001 the generalized additive model gam is a non parametric extension of glm and is used to deal with complex geographic data to predict spatial distributions of species zaniewski et al 2002 unlike glm or gam the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp could predict the distribution of plants and animals through automated spatial modeling and filter out potential sources of errors stockwell 1999 subsequently the maxent model appeared at the historic moment which used maximum entropy techniques to model the distribution of species and its sequential update algorithms could handle a very large number of features phillips et al 2006 by contrast with garp maxent predicted the distribution more accurately when it considered presence only data ray et al 2018 with the advancement of machine learning techniques džeroski et al 1997 chon et al 2001 several models have been developed using a variety of algorithms such as classification trees debeljak et al 2001 random forest rf freeman et al 2012 and generalized boosting model which is usually called boosted regression trees gbm brt hallstan et al 2013 the fuzzy matter element model fme which is established on the basis of fuzzy mathematics and gis could provide and quantify an effective method for the evaluation of plant habitat suitability fme fits the relationship between environmental variables data at sampling sites and species characteristics such as the content of marker compounds extracted from the species nino et al 2017 in 2012 our team firstly used the fme to predict the suitability distribution of schisandra sphenanthera rehd et wils in qinling mountains lu et al 2012 after our effort we have applied fme to study the suitability distribution of many medicinal plants using different number of environment variables table 1 hence we have accumulated valuable experience in optimizing and improving fme bayesian theories or methods are widely used in various fields of research such as financial econometrics wang et al 2017a risk management xin et al 2017 environmental assessment and management marcot and penman 2018 road infrastructure sierra et al 2018 mechanical engineering wang et al 2017b wang and matthies 2019 biotechnology gendelman et al 2017 and ecology salliou et al 2017 there are some studies focused on species habitat research based on bayesian theory feki sahnoun et al 2018 wiest et al 2019 thompson et al 2020 in terms of ecological suitability some researchers chose bayesian methods to study the habitat distribution of animals for vertebrates they have proved that the bayesian network bn based on abundant prior knowledge is sufficient to establish a model with reasonable sensitivity tantipisanuh et al 2014 gieder et al 2014 used bn to study the response of habitat to sea level rise and successfully predicted the existence of bird nests on the barrier islands havron et al 2017 applied bn to a small and marine dataset to model the probability of occurrence of three macrofauna species they were the first to show that bn can effectively model habitat suitability of benthic macrofauna hradsky et al 2017 showed that although only remote sensed or mapped variables are provided bn can effectively distinguish the existence of most native mammal species in the otway ranges in southeastern australia using bayesian hierarchical species distribution model coll et al 2019 predicted the distribution of european hake merluccius merluccius anglerfishes lophius piscatorius and l budegassa and red mullets mullus barbatus and m surmuletus in an exploited marine ecosystem of the northwestern mediterranean sea in addition to animals few studies have used bayesian theory to focus on the suitability distribution of terrestrial plants meineri et al 2015 disentangled direct and indirect associations between landscape physiography environmental variables and species distribution of four common plants at their northern range limit in sweden by gaussian bn however due to the difficulty of data collection and experience acquisition no scholars have directly used bn to predict the distribution of plant species suitability this inspired us to make a species suitability prediction of bn supported by fuzzy mathematics our approach closely links to ecological niche theory patten and auble 1981 chinese mathematician cai founded matter element theory cai 1983 in this research we use matter element theory fuzzy membership function zadeh 1965 the principle of maximum entropy parkash et al 2008 and fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation lu et al 2012 to assist bn modeling fuzzy membership functions could fit the membership relations between fuzzy features such as medicinal effective contents of species and different numerical environmental variables in general the scope of fuzzy membership degree is 0 1 zadeh 1965 the principle of maximum entropy of information could determine the weighting coefficients associated with the observed data avoiding the subjective bias with only using experience fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation could achieve the original data standardization according to the membership relations lu et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 fuzzy mathematics could help us build habitat suitability models in the absence of expert experience in this research the role of fuzzy mathematics mainly reflects in the value classification of states of single environmental variables sevs the determination of states of integrated environmental variables ievs and habitat suitability node as for bn it mainly reflects in the construction of model s frame the calculation of the probability of species habitat suitability and sensitivity analysis the results of fuzzy mathematics will process into the bn model angelica sinensis oliv diels as an example of model construction in this article a sinensis is a perennial herb mainly distributed in the provinces of gansu sichuan shaanxi hubei and yunnan committee of flora of china 1992 the roots use as chinese herbal medicine chm and marker compound of ferulic acid content should be no lower than 0 05 committee of national pharmacopoeia 2020 the roots of a sinensis have been used historically as a tonic hematopoietic and anti inflammatory agent for the treatment of gynecological diseases such as menstrual disorders amenorrhea and dysmenorrheal for thousands of years in chinese herbal medicine prescriptions lü et al 2009 cao et al 2010 our modeling objective is to build fuzzy mathematics and bayesian network model fbm to reconstruct the real relationship between environmental variables and a sinensis habitats to predict the habitat suitability of a sinensis and to show the optimal results of the predicted sites given by fbm the original data will discretize by fuzzy mathematics classification fmc and equal interval classification eic we also use additional testing sites to compare the predicted results of the fbm and fme to verify the reliability of the fbm using general data this paper attempts to prove that fbm has great potential in predicting the suitability of medicinal plant habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we obtain the location information of distribution sites of a sinensis by consulting flora of china investigation resource reports literature and digital herbarium the sites with ferulic acid content acquired from shang et al 2015 in order to remove the errors caused by the excessive concentration of sampling sites we select samples by eliminating adjacent sampling sites finally we obtain 90 sampling sites of a sinensis with complete information including ferulic acid content fig 1 2 2 collection of environmental variables we collect bio climatic variables soil variables topographic variables and light variables which are used to simulate the distribution suitability of a sinensis for bio climatic variables we collect 19 sevs bio1 bio19 from the worldclim database www worldclim org current for soil variables we collect 5 sevs from the harmonized world soil database hwsd http www fao org soils portal en for topographic variables we collect 3 sevs from the resource and environment data cloud platform resdc http www resdc cn in addition 4 sevs related to light are acquired from the chinese ecosystem research network cern http www cern ac cn variables data selection is a three step process the first step is to set up membership function between all sevs and the content of ferulic acid with 90 sampling sites of a sinensis in matlab software matlab software 9 1 2016 retained sevs were those with an r squared greater than 0 8 the second step is to do the correlation analysis with environmental variables that we have chosen in order to remove the high correlation variables and prevent overfitting of the model if two or three variables are highly correlated choose the one that has more biological significance and value for a sinensis growth finally we obtain eight sevs including bio1 annual mean temperature bio10 mean temperature of warmest quarter bio12 annual precipitation bio15 precipitation seasonality bio18 precipitation of the warmest quarter som soil organic matter totalrad13 annual total solar radiation and el elevation above sea level the eight sevs included two kinds of temperature bio1 and bio10 three kinds of precipitation bio12 bio15 and bio18 one soil variable som one light variable totalrad13 and one terrain variable el 2 3 bayesian network for fbm in the field of bayesian theory the bayesian paradigm is based on a concept that the probability of an event can be corrected by the knowledge of additional information smith et al 1985 and the modification of this probability is called the condition bn is usually a common method when bayesian theory applies to practical research havron et al 2017 more specifically bn is causal network that assigns probabilities to all internal nodes child nodes the parent nodes and the child nodes connect by directional arrow the states of their parent nodes are used as the condition for probability transfer hence the state of the parent nodes could affect the state of the child nodes by the arrows fuster parra et al 2015 as a part of fbm construction bn is an important assumption that there is no loop in the network formally the network is a directed acyclic graph here the theoretical framework of bn proposed by fbm includes three parts including eight sevs nodes bio1 bio10 bio12 bio15 bio18 som totalrad13 and el three ievs nodes temperature suitability precipitation suitability and soil suitability and habitat suitability node the simple diagram of the fbm model is constructed as fig 2 a by learning the network structure with fmc information see table 2 in the machine hugin hugin expert 8 4 2016 the network structure of model a is obtained by machine learning of 90 sampling sites without adding operator experience information in the process of model building fig 2b and fig 2c we constructed temperature precipitation and soil as three ievs nodes habitat suitability is a node supported by precipitation temperature and soil nodes the common ground of model b and model c 1 the networks are roughly divided into three layers 2 the suitability of temperature bio1 and bio10 precipitation bio12 bio15 and bio18 and soil som directly determine the habitat suitability of a sinensis 3 the effects of topography el regard as potential impacts on temperature and precipitation russak 2009 marini et al 2011 for the difference between model b and model c model b has a clear hierarchy fig 2b considering the importance of annual mean temperature bio1 and annual precipitation bio12 for the growing of a sinensis the model c add two connection arrows directed from nodes of bio1 and bio12 to the node of habitat suitability fig 2c based on the model b for an fbm network the probability distribution of each node must be described by a set of mutually exclusive states such as table 2 before obtaining the probability distribution of the entire network we need to set the states of all nodes 2 4 the states of sevs nodes in fbm bns are usually modeled on discrete domains so continuous variables need to be discretized first uusitalo 2007 hence we classify eight sevs by fmc and eic discrete method in order to set the state of sevs through fmc we establish the membership function between the marker compound ferulic acid of a sinensis and environmental variables of 90 sampling sites based on the matlab software to determine variables thresholds lu et al 2012 guo et al 2016 the value of each membership function degree of membership indicates that the higher the value of the function the higher the content of the marker compound ferulic acid according to the degree of membership we classify the states of the environmental variables we divide the numerical range for fmc so that each sevs node could classify into four states table 2 1 2 3 and 4 respectively represent node state 1 2 3 and 4 of sevs by fmc and different states represent respective numerical intervals the process of dividing numerical intervals has the following three steps take bio1 as an example firstly according to bio1 values and the marker compound ferulic acid of 90 sampling sites the relationship between the bio1 and ferulic acid is fitted using matlab software eq 1 is the membership function 1 f x exp 10 x 74 86 26 18 2 where x represents the actual value of bio1 f x represents bio1 s membership of ferulic acid in a sinensis this represents the extent to which bio1 supports the production ferulic acid of a sinensis the value of f x ranges from 0 to 1 if the degree of membership is 0 it indicates that the attribute has a complete non membership meaning that bio1 does not support the synthesis of ferulic acid if the degree of membership is 1 it means that the attribute has a complete membership meaning that bio1 completely support the synthesis of ferulic acid in a sinensis the value between 0 and 1 implies that the attribute has a partial membership combined with the results of fuzzy mathematics and expert opinions the classification limits of membership degree we choose are 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively secondly because the numerical distribution of f x has symmetry table 3 when the value of the formula f x is 0 3 we can get two thresholds of x at 4 61 and 10 36 when the value is 0 5 we can obtain two thresholds 5 31 and 9 67 when the value is 0 7 we can acquire two thresholds 5 92 and 9 05 these numerical intervals represent the different support of environmental variable bio1 for the growth of a sinensis table 3 according to the similarity relationship reflected by the numerical attributes of sevs table 2 table 3 fmc is classified eic is the control group of fmc both of the eic and fmc are used together to explore the efficiency of the model using raw data eic is a classification method based on completely equal sevs intervals the interval of sevs values divided into four equal intervals in the study area the classification results are show in table 4 ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ respectively represent node state ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ of sevs by eic both fmc and eic are applicable to model b fig 2b and model c fig 2c for model a fig 2a this paper only uses the information of fmc not eic because when we try to use eic information to obtain the network structure through machine learning the result violates the most basic ecological and physical laws to sum up we can identify the state of sevs node through fmc and eic 2 5 the states of ievs and habitat suitability nodes in fbm for the three ievs and habitat suitability nodes we set the states as unsuitable lowly suitable moderately suitable and highly suitable we have three steps to confirm the state of the ievs and habitat suitability node in each sampling sites firstly we calculate and obtain membership function with all eight sevs secondly the weight of environmental variables is confirmed by the weight of the evaluation index which determined by the maximum entropy principle of information zhao et al 2017 thirdly the comprehensive suitability evaluation index rk is determined by the fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation calculated as eq 2 here rw is the information entropy weight vector of the index rξ is the fuzzy matter element lu et al 2012 2 r k r w r ξ m 1 m 2 m m k j k 1 k 2 k m where the fuzzy operator in the formula adopts k j i 1 n w i ξ ij kj is the total score of the suitability evaluation index in the jth evaluation unit wi is the weight value of the ith index and ξij is the ith index membership degree of jth grid mm represents mth grid the value of kj 0 1 indicates that the greater the value is the more suitable of the grid unit for species growth under temperature precipitation soil factors or whole habitat conditions for the comprehensive suitability evaluation index rk values less than 0 3 are treat as unsuitable values from 0 3 to 0 5 are identified as lowly suitable values from 0 5 to 0 7 represent moderately suitable and values more than 0 7 represent highly suitable through the comprehensive suitability assessment of precipitation temperature soil and the habitat suitability we can find out the states of all ievs and habitat suitability nodes in the fbm network at each sample site finally we obtain the states of all nodes in fbm network with all sampling sites 2 6 probability setting and evaluation of model the size of the conditional probability distribution table cpt is the product of all possible states of the parent and child nodes butz et al 2010 in general cpt is determined from the data through various methods but a more objective and effective method of obtaining cpt is through case studies such as machine learning here the cpt of fbm network obtains through machine learning by the hugin hugin expert 8 4 2016 software learning function the log likelihood index lie et al 2018 plays an important role in the transition from the priori probability to the posteriori probability by expectation maximization em algorithm basak et al 2012 em algorithm uses an iterative process to determine the candidate network in the process thereby estimating the value of log likelihood indexes as for the log likelihood value the more explanatory variables the more explained parts in the dependent variable the larger the corresponding likelihood function and conversely the fewer explanatory variables the smaller the likelihood function kharroubi and sweeting 2010 here the log likelihood of the data given the model is simply the sum of the log likelihoods of the individual cases the size of the formula value takes from the sum of squared residuals and the sample size and the formula is negative hence the smaller the absolute value and the smaller the sum of squared residuals the higher the effectiveness of parameter fitting lie et al 2018 however as the value of the log likelihood function becomes smaller we cannot judge that the model with reduced variables is better than the previous model akaike information criterion aic commonly used for model selection burnham and anderson 2004 aic is a standard to measure the goodness of fitness characterizing how well the model matches the data akaike 1987 for fbm the fitting validity of the model represents the matching degree of the model to the data here aic is computed as l k where l is the log likelihood and k is the number of free parameters in the model using hugin software the result of simplified aic formula is negative the smaller the absolute value the better the model performance burnham and anderson 2004 2 7 modelling process the models are ordered from the standpoint of their adequacy halfon and reggiani 1978 therefore we choose three kinds of network models fig 2 and two methods of information classification fmc and eic with nine kinds of learning sequence of sampling sites table 5 to compare the suitability and uncertainty of the three models in the study area 50 predicted sites fig 1 are randomly selected which are used as the prediction sites for the suitability of a sinensis and the accuracy and uncertainty of the model are evaluated even if it is difficult to collect data on the occurrence of a sinensis with complete information including ferulic acid content we still collect additional 10 testing sites information including ferulic acid content information to compare the results of three fbm model fig 2 constructed by the two methods of information classification table 2 table 4 with the fme 2 8 sensitivity analysis of environmental variables in this paper the state of each node and cpt of all nodes are obtained according to the a sinensis sampling sites and the sensitivity analysis of environmental variables affecting the habitat of a sinensis is carried out starting from the parent node the state of the node is input hugin software for inference each state of a node is preset to 100 and the remaining nodes are not set the remaining nodes are probabilistic transmitted according to bayesian inference the probability difference between each child node and its initial state is calculated the larger the difference the stronger the sensitivity 3 results 3 1 the prediction results of model a b and c the predicted results of model a b and c with 50 predicted sites of nine kinds of sites sequences are show in appendix a there are four states of habitat suitability of a sinensis including highly suitable moderately suitable lowly suitable and unsuitable there are some special results like and which can characterize the performance differences between three models the means the impossible distribution in the network probability reasoning process beyond the predicted range which is called conflict the means the probability of highly moderately lowly suitable and unsuitable is equal to 25 which is called equal probability when calculating the relevant indicators in the results we find that model a is learned from the network structure based on the original data which performed poorly appendix table a1 in the two discretization methods whether it is model b appendix table a2 a3 or model c appendix table a4 a5 the performance of fmc is better than eic all models learn data from 10 sampling sites seq 1st and in the prediction results conflict has a higher occurrence rate table 6 obviously it caused by too little sample information consider seq 1st as the first stage seq 2nd to seq 5th as the second stage and seq 6th to seq 9th as the third stage in these three stages with the prediction results of models a b and c the incidence of conflict is gradually decreasing table 6 for equal probability the occurrence rates are different due to different models model b does not have the phenomenon of equal probability appendix table a2 a3 while model a has been increasing in these three stages table 6 when model c is based on eic the occurrence rate of equal probability has been increasing appendix table a5 and basis of fmc it first rises and then decreases appendix table a4 table 6 3 2 test results we use 10 testing sites to evaluate the performance of fbm models a b and c and fme the result shows that models a b and c are in a stable after learning the information of 90 sampling sites appendix a1 5 thus fbm chose cpt after learning the information of 90 sampling sites seq 9th to infer the results of the test sites the fme also used information from 90 sampling sites to model compared with fbm and fme table 7 the test results of model b and c are consistent with the results of fme by fmc model a has two equal probability occurrences except for id1 of test sites the prediction results of models b and c test sites are consistent by eic in terms of fme prediction results there is 30 difference model b has an unclear boundary in the discrimination between highly suitable and moderately suitable through eic from the results the operation of model b and model c through fmc is more stable and good 3 3 model fitting validation stabilization and optimal model by fmc the absolute value of aic of model a tends to be the highest among the three models and the absolute value of aic of model b is the lowest fig 4a the absolute value of log likelihood of model a is the lowest among the three models followed by model b and model c fig 4b by eic the absolute value of aic of model b is much smaller than that of model c fig 4c but the absolute value of log likelihood of model c is smaller than the value of model b fig 4d in the experiment the model with the least aic absolute value is usually chosen therefore the aic absolute value of model b is the minimum between the two methods of discretization fmc and eic for model b the aic absolute value of fmc fig 4a is smaller than that of eic fig 4c based on the fitting validity stabilization of the model and predicted results the model b with sevs states divided by fmc is the best fig 3 shows the conditional probability distribution of model b after learning the information by fmc from environmental data finally we confirm that the predicted results of seq 9th of b model with sevs states divided by fmc and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation is accurate for a sinensis showed in fig 5 among them if the predicted sites have the same probability of suitability appendix table a2 we show the lowest level of suitability fig 5 generally it can be seen that the highly and moderately suitable habitats of a sinensis are mainly distributed in gansu and shaanxi which is consistent with genuine producing areas of a sinensis shang et al 2015 lowly suitable habitats are located in yunnan sichuan chongqing and hubei 3 4 sensitivity analysis of sevs and ievs on habitat suitability of a sinensis the sensitivity analysis is provided based on cpt fig 3 of b model after learning 90 sampling sites with sevs states divided by fmc seq 9th and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation eq 2 in order to analyze the degree of influence of sevs and ievs on the habitat suitability of a sinensis we set the limit values for each node in the fbm which is to set the sevs and ievs nodes separately we set the probability of a node in a certain state to 100 the other state probability settings of this node are all 0 appendix table a6 at the same time the remaining nodes retain the original probability state after the probability transfer the state probabilities of a sinensis suitable habitat nodes are recorded and these state probabilities are compared to the state probabilities of the habitat suitability nodes of a sinensis fig 3 the result indicates that different probability setting methods lead to changes in the probability values of four suitability levels appendix table a6 we extract the maximum and minimum values of the probability change of suitability fig 6 for the result of sevs the main environmental variables that promote the increase or decrease of highly suitable probability tend to be the same fig 6a including som bio1 and bio10 this means that the change of temperature and soil factor dominates the change of highly suitability probability for moderately suitable habitats the main environmental variables affecting their probability changes are som bio1 and el fig 6b this is an interesting finding soil temperature and topographic factors together dominate the change in the probability of a moderately suitable habitat however there is a discrepancy between the main environmental variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability and the reduction of their probability fig 6c the main variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability are bio1 11 54 bio10 5 11 el 3 59 and the main factors that reduce the probability are bio1 9 6 som 7 31 el 4 17 fig 6c this implies that the environmental variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability do not have the same influence when reducing the lowly suitable probability the simulation for unsuitable probability changes shows the similar result fig 6d as for the three ievs the temperature suitability node causes the highest change in the probability of highly suitable moderately suitable and lowly suitable fig 6a b c this implies the important influence of temperature factors on the suitability of the habitat of a sinensis for the unsuitable probability change the precipitation suitability node reaches the maximum value 24 49 when increasing its occurrence probability while the soil suitability node reaches the minimum value 12 59 when decreasing its occurrence probability fig 6d this implies the important adjustment role of precipitation and soil factors in the transformation of the unsuitable habitat of a sinensis into the suitable habitat 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors and fbm prediction limits compared to the bioclimatic variables soil terrain and light data the method we use has important biological significance for plant growth these data are collected from the most widely used data set and are used to predict the distribution of species potential soberón and peterson 2005 pliscoff et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 although local factors such as geographic location and biological interactions are sometimes considered to be important factors for maintaining plant growth in a local area our team assumes that bioclimatic soil terrain light variables and their relationships mechanisms are key drivers of physiological processes related to species survival however the factors such as biological interaction types and processes are currently difficult to obtain at large spatial scales liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a 2020b at the same time the obstacles to assess the impact of human activities on the growth of research objectives will complicate the initial fbm research and evaluation the dynamics and diversity of species and biological interactions are not considered in the modeling of a sinensis in this study we can work with experts in biogeography ecology and ecophysiology to address these issues in a more coordinated way for the prediction results fbm takes the form of points in future with the optimization of the model we expect the model prediction to be presented in a flat form for bn it allows us to integrate different data sources into a single framework molina navarro et al 2020 ramírez et al 2019 believes that bn combines qualitative data with expert knowledge and can obtain better risk assessment by formalizing objective and quantitative evaluation models bn allows modelers to incorporate data expert knowledge or any combination of the two koen et al 2017 in the absence of current data it is still feasible for bn to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales grafius et al 2019 the combination of ecological process interaction and spatial explicit data in the bn frame can improve researchers clear understanding of the process in space froese et al 2019 here rf and maxent have better spatial distribution performance to a certain extent elith et al 2010 however only maxent can use categorical data as input for environmental variables guo et al 2017 2019 fbm retains the input advantage of maxent in data and allows input of categorical data in addition fbm composed of bn allows the addition of more empirical and decision making data which can effectively integrate various ecological data other models such as maxent rf are difficult to do fbm has unique advantages in flexible data fusion including data types that can be added visualization of data relationships etc 4 2 network framework and node state of fbm three network frameworks of fbm are compared with each other model a represents machine learning structure and models b and c represent human experience including previous literature and practice in fact all models contain the wisdom of machine learning because in the subsequent process of obtaining cpt they all learn the data automatically fbm combines regression expectation maximization and bayesian inference algorithms it provides more information on the potential cause pathways of species habitat suitability than fme lu et al 2012 rf zhang et al 2020b and maxent guo et al 2017 bayesian inference considers the inter independency between predictive variables and the relationship between variables and outcome is usually non linear feki sahnoun et al 2018 bn can capture the interactions between predictor variables hradsky et al 2017 and can easily be updated with new knowledge on the nature of relationships already established in bn molina navarro et al 2020 hence this potential advantage of fbm approach is particularly useful for observational studies with a large number of variables as causality and time relationships are often unknown in these studies this paper follows the previous suitability state allocation method to deal with fbm network ievs and habitat suitability nodes and divides the suitability of a sinensis into unsuitable lowly suitable moderately suitable and highly suitable fmc and eic are used to preprocess sevs fmc uses a mapping relationship between environmental variables and membership degrees the eic is used as a control group corresponding to fmc to participate in model data preprocessing bayesian networks usually require discrete data uusitalo 2007 discretization means that only the rough features of the original distribution are captured friedman and goldszmidt 1996 and statistical information is lost hamilton et al 2015 lucena moya et al 2015 meyer et al 2014 however discretization is beneficial in this study with the increase of learning data fbm has successfully provided reliable results table 6 sensitivity analysis appendix table a6 and the popular fbm has not provided biased results therefore discretization can mitigate the effects of noise data incorrectly saved values typing errors incorrect values feki sahnoun et al 2018 4 3 model reliability and robustness model evaluation uses aic and log likelihood function indicators fig 4 fuzzy mathematics constructs a membership function between environment variables and a sinensis eigenvalues ferulic acid content and is similar to constructing a normal distribution in addition to log likelihood this paper uses aic instead of bayesian information criterion bic because especially in the case of bic it can only be used if the posterior distribution can be approximated by any normal distribution burnham and anderson 2004 fuzzy mathematics first eliminates the traces of gaussian noise and the remaining information may contain some poisson distribution through discretization therefore due to the rigor of the research aic is used to evaluate the goodness of model fitting burnham and anderson 2004 in addition to aic and log likelihood values fbm can also try to use kappa tss and auc for model performance measurement in the future because they are widely used to evaluate sdms guo et al 2018 not only statistical indicators the research also needs to try to measure the difference in model prediction performance through different statistical data swets 1988 at the same time the eic method as a control group can help researchers find the effectiveness of the modeling data without fuzzy mathematical denoising algorithm models b and c both use fmc table 2 and eic table 4 discretization methods respectively observation shows that two models models b and c better fitting and reasonable reasoning when learning fmc data fig 4 in the comparison between fbm and fme the results also show that fmc is superior to eic table 7 wiest et al 2019 believes that a target training data set can build a model probability structure which helps a more robust cross validation analysis we developed fbm on a regional scale rather than a smaller sub region or statistical scale the three fbm frameworks and the corresponding target training data sets can build the model probability distribution which is the performance of powerful cross validation analysis although there are no specific guidelines to derive the number of cases for the structure and parameters of the fbm as the cases increase the bn model becomes more robust in all fbm whether used fmc or eic it is shows that after the model structure parameters are fixed as the amount of data increases the implicit parameters required for inference will increase fig 4 and the absolute values of the aic and log likelihood functions will also increase by evaluating the fmc data model a model b and model c have very different feedback model a only comes from machine structure learning model a has fewer nodes so the model has fewer independent variables than the other two models and the absolute value of the log likelihood is also smaller fig 4b but model a has too many hidden variables and the absolute value of aic is much higher than that of the other two models fig 4a similarly model b is superior to model c in data fitting as is the model structure because the implicit parameters of model b are less than model c it can prevent the model from overfitting during the mapping process although the results contain a number of conflict and equal probability events the probability of this happening decreases with the increase of the learning data table 6 the conflict indicates that the software cannot obtain results after calculation the reason is that the network s inference oversteps the scope of reasoning this means the network probability distribution selected by researchers cannot exist in the current network the predicted sites are not suitable for the species growth or the structure of the network model is not reasonable the results show that the model requires a large amount of original data and the quality and quantity of the original data have a profound impact on the prediction results of the fbm model this is the same as other sdms such as glm garp and rf hirzel et al 2001 ray et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b 4 4 case and features of fbm in china a sinensis is widely known as a chm committee of national pharmacopoeia 2020 the quality of a sinensis and its marker compound ferulic acid are systematic research zhang et al 2012 2019 ma et al 2015 sufficient and perfect basic research data can effectively support our research this is why we choose a sinensis instead of other medicinal plants as a typical case each model has its own theoretical framework and is different from the concept definition with species suitability different from most previous models such as glm garp rf maxent hirzel et al 2001 ray et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b guo et al 2017 fbm has a unique understanding of species suitability as described in the above method the membership function fits the marker compound ferulic acid of a sinensis and environmental variables together and then further processes to obtain the level of species suitability because fbm currently mainly targets medicinal plants to a large extent the level of the content of species marker compound that is the level of medicinal value represents the level of species suitability fbm emphasizes that the content of species marker compound determines the suitability of the species habitat the original data required by the fbm model includes the content of species marker compound the location of the species occurrence and environmental data we have compared fbm with fme in the manuscript however models such as glm garp rf and maxent combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates elith and leathwick 2009 there is no data on the content of species marker compound for simulation therefore for medicinal plants fbm s prediction mechanism is more effective and can help us quickly predict where there will be high quality medicinal materials because of the different definitions of habitat suitability and different data sources the structure of fbm and other models such as rf and maxent are very different and the evaluation methods are also different the reliability from different model systems actually comes from different statistical models strandén and christensen 2011 the comparison between fbm and other models such as rf and maxent cannot help fbm to improve model prediction accuracy reliability and robustness through a series of reliability and robustness analyses this study adopted the results of seq 9th of b model with sevs states divided by fmc and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation fig 5 in this study 50 predicted sites of a sinensis were randomly selected in the study area fig 1 from the prediction results the distribution of a sinensis habitat suitability is related to the sampling sites the prediction result reflects the distribution pattern of ferulic acid content in a sinensis sampling sites the highly and moderately suitable habitats of a sinensis are mainly distributed in gansu and shaanxi shang et al 2015 this also further confirms that the model has a reasonable mapping and promotion ability fbm adds sensitivity analysis to help researchers further explore the impact of variables on habitat suitability from appendix table a6 we further extract the degree of influence of each node on the habitat status of a sinensis fig 6 through the maximum and minimum values in the suitability probability changes appendix table a6 we can find out that som bio1 bio10 and el affect the increase and decrease of four suitability probabilities in different degrees fig 6 in terms of the range of suitability probability changes min to max almost all four suitability changes are dominated by these environmental variables som bio1 and bio10 for ievs the temperature suitability node still has a great influence on suitability of a sinensis fig 6 fbm performs bayesian inference based on fmc the role of fuzzy mathematics in this study is for the discretization of nodes according to the degree of membership we classify the states of the environmental variables table 2 this means that each state of the eight sevs itself contains some information that supports or not support the suitability of a sinensis for example bio1 node appendix table a6 when the probability of 4 is 100 the probability of highly suitable is the largest 39 82 and the probability of unsuitable is the smallest 11 58 in contrast when the 1 probability is 100 the highly suitable probability is the smallest 17 29 and the unsuitable probability is the largest 21 80 in summary the four states of fmc table 2 from state 1 to state 4 imply the gradual support of environmental variables for the growth of a sinensis obviously fmc can extract the relationship between the value of environmental variables and the growth of a sinensis while eic cannot fig 4 table 6 hence fmc significantly improves the operating efficiency of fbm through fmc and the sensitivity analysis appendix table a6 bio1 in 5 92 c 9 05 c bio10 in 14 80 c 18 60 c bio12 in 568 79 mm 791 33 mm bio15 in 69 04 87 48 and bio18 in 284 28 mm 428 mm can promote the highly suitable habitats of a sinensis table 2 which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies shang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 consistent with the research results of genuine producing areas som has a profound effect on the growth quality of a sinensis zhao et al 2002 this is an interesting finding we can continue to analyze the range where sevs have the greatest influence on the moderately suitable lowly suitable and unsuitable habitats of a sinensis table 2 appendix table a6 unlike fme fbm pre processes the data while preserving the adaptability of the species to the environment it adds a machine learning process that can perform detailed probabilistic reasoning and explore relationships between environmental variables thereby improving the model s ability to identify and fit data and the efficiency of using species data 5 conclusion combining fuzzy mathematics expert experience machine learning and bayesian reasoning taking a sinensis as a case a species habitat suitability model fbm is established in this study model a is generated by machine learning models b and c combine previous research and experience compared with model a the model frameworks b and c are more accurate and reliable model b has simple structure parameters efficient data identification and data output stability is better than model c and model a comparative experiments of two discretization methods fmc and eic show that the results of fmc is effectively recognized by the fbm and reliable results are output fbm sensitivity analysis helps researchers explore in detail the effects of environmental factors on various aspects of species habitat suitability it is easy for researchers to obtain terrestrial plants environmental data needed for fbm operation and many plants have species characteristics that can be used for fbm hence the concept and framework of fbm may have a broad application prospect for research on species habitat suitability in the future credit

24623,there are many different types of species distribution models sdms that are widely used in the field of ecology in this research we explored a new advanced mechanism for predicting the distribution of species based on fuzzy membership function principle of maximum entropy fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation and the framework of bayesian networks we use fuzzy mathematics and bayesian network model fbm to simulate relationships between species habitats and environmental variables and the relationship may be difficult to quantify effectively fbm which combines species data environmental data expert experience and machine learning could reduce the data and system error in the case of medicinal plant angelica sinensis oliv diels many approaches have been applied including nine learning sequence of sampling sites three fbm models two types of information classification by fuzzy mathematical classification fmc and equal interval classification eic and the evaluation of aic and log likelihood through the comparison of reasoning results between fbm and fuzzy matter element model fme in testing sites the result shows that the combination of objective data and empirical model structure makes fbm have better result output besides fbm sensitivity analysis helps researchers explore in detail the impact of environmental factors on each level of species habitat suitability the temperature factor has an important influence on the highly suitable moderately suitable and lowly suitable habitats of a sinensis through fmc and sensitivity analysis annual mean temperature bio1 in 5 92 c 9 05 c and mean temperature of warmest quarter bio10 in 14 80 c 18 60 c are the highly suitable habitat temperature range of a sinensis keywords bayesian network bn fuzzy matter element model fme fuzzy mathematics and bayesian network model fbm species habitat suitability angelica sinensis oliv diels 1 introduction many researchers are interested in species distribution models sdms on this basis the relationship model between habitat occurrence localities and environmental requirements was constructed phillips et al 2006 since the late twentieth century scholars have been using mathematical methods to construct species environmental suitability models to help people understand the living conditions of species friedman 1991 manel et al 1999 breiman 2001 elith et al 2006 each model has its own theoretical framework and is different from the concept definition with species suitability due to the systematic error of different sdms the final prediction results will also be distinguished after long term application and screening a few sdms coped well with environmental conditions and have been widely used up so far the generalized linear model glm proposed by nelder and wedderburn 1972 appeared very early and has been applied to the suitability research of species as a habitat suitability model glm performs a good analysis when there are a large number of species or lack of data hirzel et al 2001 the generalized additive model gam is a non parametric extension of glm and is used to deal with complex geographic data to predict spatial distributions of species zaniewski et al 2002 unlike glm or gam the genetic algorithm for rule set production garp could predict the distribution of plants and animals through automated spatial modeling and filter out potential sources of errors stockwell 1999 subsequently the maxent model appeared at the historic moment which used maximum entropy techniques to model the distribution of species and its sequential update algorithms could handle a very large number of features phillips et al 2006 by contrast with garp maxent predicted the distribution more accurately when it considered presence only data ray et al 2018 with the advancement of machine learning techniques džeroski et al 1997 chon et al 2001 several models have been developed using a variety of algorithms such as classification trees debeljak et al 2001 random forest rf freeman et al 2012 and generalized boosting model which is usually called boosted regression trees gbm brt hallstan et al 2013 the fuzzy matter element model fme which is established on the basis of fuzzy mathematics and gis could provide and quantify an effective method for the evaluation of plant habitat suitability fme fits the relationship between environmental variables data at sampling sites and species characteristics such as the content of marker compounds extracted from the species nino et al 2017 in 2012 our team firstly used the fme to predict the suitability distribution of schisandra sphenanthera rehd et wils in qinling mountains lu et al 2012 after our effort we have applied fme to study the suitability distribution of many medicinal plants using different number of environment variables table 1 hence we have accumulated valuable experience in optimizing and improving fme bayesian theories or methods are widely used in various fields of research such as financial econometrics wang et al 2017a risk management xin et al 2017 environmental assessment and management marcot and penman 2018 road infrastructure sierra et al 2018 mechanical engineering wang et al 2017b wang and matthies 2019 biotechnology gendelman et al 2017 and ecology salliou et al 2017 there are some studies focused on species habitat research based on bayesian theory feki sahnoun et al 2018 wiest et al 2019 thompson et al 2020 in terms of ecological suitability some researchers chose bayesian methods to study the habitat distribution of animals for vertebrates they have proved that the bayesian network bn based on abundant prior knowledge is sufficient to establish a model with reasonable sensitivity tantipisanuh et al 2014 gieder et al 2014 used bn to study the response of habitat to sea level rise and successfully predicted the existence of bird nests on the barrier islands havron et al 2017 applied bn to a small and marine dataset to model the probability of occurrence of three macrofauna species they were the first to show that bn can effectively model habitat suitability of benthic macrofauna hradsky et al 2017 showed that although only remote sensed or mapped variables are provided bn can effectively distinguish the existence of most native mammal species in the otway ranges in southeastern australia using bayesian hierarchical species distribution model coll et al 2019 predicted the distribution of european hake merluccius merluccius anglerfishes lophius piscatorius and l budegassa and red mullets mullus barbatus and m surmuletus in an exploited marine ecosystem of the northwestern mediterranean sea in addition to animals few studies have used bayesian theory to focus on the suitability distribution of terrestrial plants meineri et al 2015 disentangled direct and indirect associations between landscape physiography environmental variables and species distribution of four common plants at their northern range limit in sweden by gaussian bn however due to the difficulty of data collection and experience acquisition no scholars have directly used bn to predict the distribution of plant species suitability this inspired us to make a species suitability prediction of bn supported by fuzzy mathematics our approach closely links to ecological niche theory patten and auble 1981 chinese mathematician cai founded matter element theory cai 1983 in this research we use matter element theory fuzzy membership function zadeh 1965 the principle of maximum entropy parkash et al 2008 and fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation lu et al 2012 to assist bn modeling fuzzy membership functions could fit the membership relations between fuzzy features such as medicinal effective contents of species and different numerical environmental variables in general the scope of fuzzy membership degree is 0 1 zadeh 1965 the principle of maximum entropy of information could determine the weighting coefficients associated with the observed data avoiding the subjective bias with only using experience fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation could achieve the original data standardization according to the membership relations lu et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 fuzzy mathematics could help us build habitat suitability models in the absence of expert experience in this research the role of fuzzy mathematics mainly reflects in the value classification of states of single environmental variables sevs the determination of states of integrated environmental variables ievs and habitat suitability node as for bn it mainly reflects in the construction of model s frame the calculation of the probability of species habitat suitability and sensitivity analysis the results of fuzzy mathematics will process into the bn model angelica sinensis oliv diels as an example of model construction in this article a sinensis is a perennial herb mainly distributed in the provinces of gansu sichuan shaanxi hubei and yunnan committee of flora of china 1992 the roots use as chinese herbal medicine chm and marker compound of ferulic acid content should be no lower than 0 05 committee of national pharmacopoeia 2020 the roots of a sinensis have been used historically as a tonic hematopoietic and anti inflammatory agent for the treatment of gynecological diseases such as menstrual disorders amenorrhea and dysmenorrheal for thousands of years in chinese herbal medicine prescriptions lü et al 2009 cao et al 2010 our modeling objective is to build fuzzy mathematics and bayesian network model fbm to reconstruct the real relationship between environmental variables and a sinensis habitats to predict the habitat suitability of a sinensis and to show the optimal results of the predicted sites given by fbm the original data will discretize by fuzzy mathematics classification fmc and equal interval classification eic we also use additional testing sites to compare the predicted results of the fbm and fme to verify the reliability of the fbm using general data this paper attempts to prove that fbm has great potential in predicting the suitability of medicinal plant habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we obtain the location information of distribution sites of a sinensis by consulting flora of china investigation resource reports literature and digital herbarium the sites with ferulic acid content acquired from shang et al 2015 in order to remove the errors caused by the excessive concentration of sampling sites we select samples by eliminating adjacent sampling sites finally we obtain 90 sampling sites of a sinensis with complete information including ferulic acid content fig 1 2 2 collection of environmental variables we collect bio climatic variables soil variables topographic variables and light variables which are used to simulate the distribution suitability of a sinensis for bio climatic variables we collect 19 sevs bio1 bio19 from the worldclim database www worldclim org current for soil variables we collect 5 sevs from the harmonized world soil database hwsd http www fao org soils portal en for topographic variables we collect 3 sevs from the resource and environment data cloud platform resdc http www resdc cn in addition 4 sevs related to light are acquired from the chinese ecosystem research network cern http www cern ac cn variables data selection is a three step process the first step is to set up membership function between all sevs and the content of ferulic acid with 90 sampling sites of a sinensis in matlab software matlab software 9 1 2016 retained sevs were those with an r squared greater than 0 8 the second step is to do the correlation analysis with environmental variables that we have chosen in order to remove the high correlation variables and prevent overfitting of the model if two or three variables are highly correlated choose the one that has more biological significance and value for a sinensis growth finally we obtain eight sevs including bio1 annual mean temperature bio10 mean temperature of warmest quarter bio12 annual precipitation bio15 precipitation seasonality bio18 precipitation of the warmest quarter som soil organic matter totalrad13 annual total solar radiation and el elevation above sea level the eight sevs included two kinds of temperature bio1 and bio10 three kinds of precipitation bio12 bio15 and bio18 one soil variable som one light variable totalrad13 and one terrain variable el 2 3 bayesian network for fbm in the field of bayesian theory the bayesian paradigm is based on a concept that the probability of an event can be corrected by the knowledge of additional information smith et al 1985 and the modification of this probability is called the condition bn is usually a common method when bayesian theory applies to practical research havron et al 2017 more specifically bn is causal network that assigns probabilities to all internal nodes child nodes the parent nodes and the child nodes connect by directional arrow the states of their parent nodes are used as the condition for probability transfer hence the state of the parent nodes could affect the state of the child nodes by the arrows fuster parra et al 2015 as a part of fbm construction bn is an important assumption that there is no loop in the network formally the network is a directed acyclic graph here the theoretical framework of bn proposed by fbm includes three parts including eight sevs nodes bio1 bio10 bio12 bio15 bio18 som totalrad13 and el three ievs nodes temperature suitability precipitation suitability and soil suitability and habitat suitability node the simple diagram of the fbm model is constructed as fig 2 a by learning the network structure with fmc information see table 2 in the machine hugin hugin expert 8 4 2016 the network structure of model a is obtained by machine learning of 90 sampling sites without adding operator experience information in the process of model building fig 2b and fig 2c we constructed temperature precipitation and soil as three ievs nodes habitat suitability is a node supported by precipitation temperature and soil nodes the common ground of model b and model c 1 the networks are roughly divided into three layers 2 the suitability of temperature bio1 and bio10 precipitation bio12 bio15 and bio18 and soil som directly determine the habitat suitability of a sinensis 3 the effects of topography el regard as potential impacts on temperature and precipitation russak 2009 marini et al 2011 for the difference between model b and model c model b has a clear hierarchy fig 2b considering the importance of annual mean temperature bio1 and annual precipitation bio12 for the growing of a sinensis the model c add two connection arrows directed from nodes of bio1 and bio12 to the node of habitat suitability fig 2c based on the model b for an fbm network the probability distribution of each node must be described by a set of mutually exclusive states such as table 2 before obtaining the probability distribution of the entire network we need to set the states of all nodes 2 4 the states of sevs nodes in fbm bns are usually modeled on discrete domains so continuous variables need to be discretized first uusitalo 2007 hence we classify eight sevs by fmc and eic discrete method in order to set the state of sevs through fmc we establish the membership function between the marker compound ferulic acid of a sinensis and environmental variables of 90 sampling sites based on the matlab software to determine variables thresholds lu et al 2012 guo et al 2016 the value of each membership function degree of membership indicates that the higher the value of the function the higher the content of the marker compound ferulic acid according to the degree of membership we classify the states of the environmental variables we divide the numerical range for fmc so that each sevs node could classify into four states table 2 1 2 3 and 4 respectively represent node state 1 2 3 and 4 of sevs by fmc and different states represent respective numerical intervals the process of dividing numerical intervals has the following three steps take bio1 as an example firstly according to bio1 values and the marker compound ferulic acid of 90 sampling sites the relationship between the bio1 and ferulic acid is fitted using matlab software eq 1 is the membership function 1 f x exp 10 x 74 86 26 18 2 where x represents the actual value of bio1 f x represents bio1 s membership of ferulic acid in a sinensis this represents the extent to which bio1 supports the production ferulic acid of a sinensis the value of f x ranges from 0 to 1 if the degree of membership is 0 it indicates that the attribute has a complete non membership meaning that bio1 does not support the synthesis of ferulic acid if the degree of membership is 1 it means that the attribute has a complete membership meaning that bio1 completely support the synthesis of ferulic acid in a sinensis the value between 0 and 1 implies that the attribute has a partial membership combined with the results of fuzzy mathematics and expert opinions the classification limits of membership degree we choose are 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively secondly because the numerical distribution of f x has symmetry table 3 when the value of the formula f x is 0 3 we can get two thresholds of x at 4 61 and 10 36 when the value is 0 5 we can obtain two thresholds 5 31 and 9 67 when the value is 0 7 we can acquire two thresholds 5 92 and 9 05 these numerical intervals represent the different support of environmental variable bio1 for the growth of a sinensis table 3 according to the similarity relationship reflected by the numerical attributes of sevs table 2 table 3 fmc is classified eic is the control group of fmc both of the eic and fmc are used together to explore the efficiency of the model using raw data eic is a classification method based on completely equal sevs intervals the interval of sevs values divided into four equal intervals in the study area the classification results are show in table 4 ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ respectively represent node state ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ of sevs by eic both fmc and eic are applicable to model b fig 2b and model c fig 2c for model a fig 2a this paper only uses the information of fmc not eic because when we try to use eic information to obtain the network structure through machine learning the result violates the most basic ecological and physical laws to sum up we can identify the state of sevs node through fmc and eic 2 5 the states of ievs and habitat suitability nodes in fbm for the three ievs and habitat suitability nodes we set the states as unsuitable lowly suitable moderately suitable and highly suitable we have three steps to confirm the state of the ievs and habitat suitability node in each sampling sites firstly we calculate and obtain membership function with all eight sevs secondly the weight of environmental variables is confirmed by the weight of the evaluation index which determined by the maximum entropy principle of information zhao et al 2017 thirdly the comprehensive suitability evaluation index rk is determined by the fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation calculated as eq 2 here rw is the information entropy weight vector of the index rξ is the fuzzy matter element lu et al 2012 2 r k r w r ξ m 1 m 2 m m k j k 1 k 2 k m where the fuzzy operator in the formula adopts k j i 1 n w i ξ ij kj is the total score of the suitability evaluation index in the jth evaluation unit wi is the weight value of the ith index and ξij is the ith index membership degree of jth grid mm represents mth grid the value of kj 0 1 indicates that the greater the value is the more suitable of the grid unit for species growth under temperature precipitation soil factors or whole habitat conditions for the comprehensive suitability evaluation index rk values less than 0 3 are treat as unsuitable values from 0 3 to 0 5 are identified as lowly suitable values from 0 5 to 0 7 represent moderately suitable and values more than 0 7 represent highly suitable through the comprehensive suitability assessment of precipitation temperature soil and the habitat suitability we can find out the states of all ievs and habitat suitability nodes in the fbm network at each sample site finally we obtain the states of all nodes in fbm network with all sampling sites 2 6 probability setting and evaluation of model the size of the conditional probability distribution table cpt is the product of all possible states of the parent and child nodes butz et al 2010 in general cpt is determined from the data through various methods but a more objective and effective method of obtaining cpt is through case studies such as machine learning here the cpt of fbm network obtains through machine learning by the hugin hugin expert 8 4 2016 software learning function the log likelihood index lie et al 2018 plays an important role in the transition from the priori probability to the posteriori probability by expectation maximization em algorithm basak et al 2012 em algorithm uses an iterative process to determine the candidate network in the process thereby estimating the value of log likelihood indexes as for the log likelihood value the more explanatory variables the more explained parts in the dependent variable the larger the corresponding likelihood function and conversely the fewer explanatory variables the smaller the likelihood function kharroubi and sweeting 2010 here the log likelihood of the data given the model is simply the sum of the log likelihoods of the individual cases the size of the formula value takes from the sum of squared residuals and the sample size and the formula is negative hence the smaller the absolute value and the smaller the sum of squared residuals the higher the effectiveness of parameter fitting lie et al 2018 however as the value of the log likelihood function becomes smaller we cannot judge that the model with reduced variables is better than the previous model akaike information criterion aic commonly used for model selection burnham and anderson 2004 aic is a standard to measure the goodness of fitness characterizing how well the model matches the data akaike 1987 for fbm the fitting validity of the model represents the matching degree of the model to the data here aic is computed as l k where l is the log likelihood and k is the number of free parameters in the model using hugin software the result of simplified aic formula is negative the smaller the absolute value the better the model performance burnham and anderson 2004 2 7 modelling process the models are ordered from the standpoint of their adequacy halfon and reggiani 1978 therefore we choose three kinds of network models fig 2 and two methods of information classification fmc and eic with nine kinds of learning sequence of sampling sites table 5 to compare the suitability and uncertainty of the three models in the study area 50 predicted sites fig 1 are randomly selected which are used as the prediction sites for the suitability of a sinensis and the accuracy and uncertainty of the model are evaluated even if it is difficult to collect data on the occurrence of a sinensis with complete information including ferulic acid content we still collect additional 10 testing sites information including ferulic acid content information to compare the results of three fbm model fig 2 constructed by the two methods of information classification table 2 table 4 with the fme 2 8 sensitivity analysis of environmental variables in this paper the state of each node and cpt of all nodes are obtained according to the a sinensis sampling sites and the sensitivity analysis of environmental variables affecting the habitat of a sinensis is carried out starting from the parent node the state of the node is input hugin software for inference each state of a node is preset to 100 and the remaining nodes are not set the remaining nodes are probabilistic transmitted according to bayesian inference the probability difference between each child node and its initial state is calculated the larger the difference the stronger the sensitivity 3 results 3 1 the prediction results of model a b and c the predicted results of model a b and c with 50 predicted sites of nine kinds of sites sequences are show in appendix a there are four states of habitat suitability of a sinensis including highly suitable moderately suitable lowly suitable and unsuitable there are some special results like and which can characterize the performance differences between three models the means the impossible distribution in the network probability reasoning process beyond the predicted range which is called conflict the means the probability of highly moderately lowly suitable and unsuitable is equal to 25 which is called equal probability when calculating the relevant indicators in the results we find that model a is learned from the network structure based on the original data which performed poorly appendix table a1 in the two discretization methods whether it is model b appendix table a2 a3 or model c appendix table a4 a5 the performance of fmc is better than eic all models learn data from 10 sampling sites seq 1st and in the prediction results conflict has a higher occurrence rate table 6 obviously it caused by too little sample information consider seq 1st as the first stage seq 2nd to seq 5th as the second stage and seq 6th to seq 9th as the third stage in these three stages with the prediction results of models a b and c the incidence of conflict is gradually decreasing table 6 for equal probability the occurrence rates are different due to different models model b does not have the phenomenon of equal probability appendix table a2 a3 while model a has been increasing in these three stages table 6 when model c is based on eic the occurrence rate of equal probability has been increasing appendix table a5 and basis of fmc it first rises and then decreases appendix table a4 table 6 3 2 test results we use 10 testing sites to evaluate the performance of fbm models a b and c and fme the result shows that models a b and c are in a stable after learning the information of 90 sampling sites appendix a1 5 thus fbm chose cpt after learning the information of 90 sampling sites seq 9th to infer the results of the test sites the fme also used information from 90 sampling sites to model compared with fbm and fme table 7 the test results of model b and c are consistent with the results of fme by fmc model a has two equal probability occurrences except for id1 of test sites the prediction results of models b and c test sites are consistent by eic in terms of fme prediction results there is 30 difference model b has an unclear boundary in the discrimination between highly suitable and moderately suitable through eic from the results the operation of model b and model c through fmc is more stable and good 3 3 model fitting validation stabilization and optimal model by fmc the absolute value of aic of model a tends to be the highest among the three models and the absolute value of aic of model b is the lowest fig 4a the absolute value of log likelihood of model a is the lowest among the three models followed by model b and model c fig 4b by eic the absolute value of aic of model b is much smaller than that of model c fig 4c but the absolute value of log likelihood of model c is smaller than the value of model b fig 4d in the experiment the model with the least aic absolute value is usually chosen therefore the aic absolute value of model b is the minimum between the two methods of discretization fmc and eic for model b the aic absolute value of fmc fig 4a is smaller than that of eic fig 4c based on the fitting validity stabilization of the model and predicted results the model b with sevs states divided by fmc is the best fig 3 shows the conditional probability distribution of model b after learning the information by fmc from environmental data finally we confirm that the predicted results of seq 9th of b model with sevs states divided by fmc and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation is accurate for a sinensis showed in fig 5 among them if the predicted sites have the same probability of suitability appendix table a2 we show the lowest level of suitability fig 5 generally it can be seen that the highly and moderately suitable habitats of a sinensis are mainly distributed in gansu and shaanxi which is consistent with genuine producing areas of a sinensis shang et al 2015 lowly suitable habitats are located in yunnan sichuan chongqing and hubei 3 4 sensitivity analysis of sevs and ievs on habitat suitability of a sinensis the sensitivity analysis is provided based on cpt fig 3 of b model after learning 90 sampling sites with sevs states divided by fmc seq 9th and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation eq 2 in order to analyze the degree of influence of sevs and ievs on the habitat suitability of a sinensis we set the limit values for each node in the fbm which is to set the sevs and ievs nodes separately we set the probability of a node in a certain state to 100 the other state probability settings of this node are all 0 appendix table a6 at the same time the remaining nodes retain the original probability state after the probability transfer the state probabilities of a sinensis suitable habitat nodes are recorded and these state probabilities are compared to the state probabilities of the habitat suitability nodes of a sinensis fig 3 the result indicates that different probability setting methods lead to changes in the probability values of four suitability levels appendix table a6 we extract the maximum and minimum values of the probability change of suitability fig 6 for the result of sevs the main environmental variables that promote the increase or decrease of highly suitable probability tend to be the same fig 6a including som bio1 and bio10 this means that the change of temperature and soil factor dominates the change of highly suitability probability for moderately suitable habitats the main environmental variables affecting their probability changes are som bio1 and el fig 6b this is an interesting finding soil temperature and topographic factors together dominate the change in the probability of a moderately suitable habitat however there is a discrepancy between the main environmental variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability and the reduction of their probability fig 6c the main variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability are bio1 11 54 bio10 5 11 el 3 59 and the main factors that reduce the probability are bio1 9 6 som 7 31 el 4 17 fig 6c this implies that the environmental variables that promote the increase of lowly suitable probability do not have the same influence when reducing the lowly suitable probability the simulation for unsuitable probability changes shows the similar result fig 6d as for the three ievs the temperature suitability node causes the highest change in the probability of highly suitable moderately suitable and lowly suitable fig 6a b c this implies the important influence of temperature factors on the suitability of the habitat of a sinensis for the unsuitable probability change the precipitation suitability node reaches the maximum value 24 49 when increasing its occurrence probability while the soil suitability node reaches the minimum value 12 59 when decreasing its occurrence probability fig 6d this implies the important adjustment role of precipitation and soil factors in the transformation of the unsuitable habitat of a sinensis into the suitable habitat 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors and fbm prediction limits compared to the bioclimatic variables soil terrain and light data the method we use has important biological significance for plant growth these data are collected from the most widely used data set and are used to predict the distribution of species potential soberón and peterson 2005 pliscoff et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 although local factors such as geographic location and biological interactions are sometimes considered to be important factors for maintaining plant growth in a local area our team assumes that bioclimatic soil terrain light variables and their relationships mechanisms are key drivers of physiological processes related to species survival however the factors such as biological interaction types and processes are currently difficult to obtain at large spatial scales liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a 2020b at the same time the obstacles to assess the impact of human activities on the growth of research objectives will complicate the initial fbm research and evaluation the dynamics and diversity of species and biological interactions are not considered in the modeling of a sinensis in this study we can work with experts in biogeography ecology and ecophysiology to address these issues in a more coordinated way for the prediction results fbm takes the form of points in future with the optimization of the model we expect the model prediction to be presented in a flat form for bn it allows us to integrate different data sources into a single framework molina navarro et al 2020 ramírez et al 2019 believes that bn combines qualitative data with expert knowledge and can obtain better risk assessment by formalizing objective and quantitative evaluation models bn allows modelers to incorporate data expert knowledge or any combination of the two koen et al 2017 in the absence of current data it is still feasible for bn to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales grafius et al 2019 the combination of ecological process interaction and spatial explicit data in the bn frame can improve researchers clear understanding of the process in space froese et al 2019 here rf and maxent have better spatial distribution performance to a certain extent elith et al 2010 however only maxent can use categorical data as input for environmental variables guo et al 2017 2019 fbm retains the input advantage of maxent in data and allows input of categorical data in addition fbm composed of bn allows the addition of more empirical and decision making data which can effectively integrate various ecological data other models such as maxent rf are difficult to do fbm has unique advantages in flexible data fusion including data types that can be added visualization of data relationships etc 4 2 network framework and node state of fbm three network frameworks of fbm are compared with each other model a represents machine learning structure and models b and c represent human experience including previous literature and practice in fact all models contain the wisdom of machine learning because in the subsequent process of obtaining cpt they all learn the data automatically fbm combines regression expectation maximization and bayesian inference algorithms it provides more information on the potential cause pathways of species habitat suitability than fme lu et al 2012 rf zhang et al 2020b and maxent guo et al 2017 bayesian inference considers the inter independency between predictive variables and the relationship between variables and outcome is usually non linear feki sahnoun et al 2018 bn can capture the interactions between predictor variables hradsky et al 2017 and can easily be updated with new knowledge on the nature of relationships already established in bn molina navarro et al 2020 hence this potential advantage of fbm approach is particularly useful for observational studies with a large number of variables as causality and time relationships are often unknown in these studies this paper follows the previous suitability state allocation method to deal with fbm network ievs and habitat suitability nodes and divides the suitability of a sinensis into unsuitable lowly suitable moderately suitable and highly suitable fmc and eic are used to preprocess sevs fmc uses a mapping relationship between environmental variables and membership degrees the eic is used as a control group corresponding to fmc to participate in model data preprocessing bayesian networks usually require discrete data uusitalo 2007 discretization means that only the rough features of the original distribution are captured friedman and goldszmidt 1996 and statistical information is lost hamilton et al 2015 lucena moya et al 2015 meyer et al 2014 however discretization is beneficial in this study with the increase of learning data fbm has successfully provided reliable results table 6 sensitivity analysis appendix table a6 and the popular fbm has not provided biased results therefore discretization can mitigate the effects of noise data incorrectly saved values typing errors incorrect values feki sahnoun et al 2018 4 3 model reliability and robustness model evaluation uses aic and log likelihood function indicators fig 4 fuzzy mathematics constructs a membership function between environment variables and a sinensis eigenvalues ferulic acid content and is similar to constructing a normal distribution in addition to log likelihood this paper uses aic instead of bayesian information criterion bic because especially in the case of bic it can only be used if the posterior distribution can be approximated by any normal distribution burnham and anderson 2004 fuzzy mathematics first eliminates the traces of gaussian noise and the remaining information may contain some poisson distribution through discretization therefore due to the rigor of the research aic is used to evaluate the goodness of model fitting burnham and anderson 2004 in addition to aic and log likelihood values fbm can also try to use kappa tss and auc for model performance measurement in the future because they are widely used to evaluate sdms guo et al 2018 not only statistical indicators the research also needs to try to measure the difference in model prediction performance through different statistical data swets 1988 at the same time the eic method as a control group can help researchers find the effectiveness of the modeling data without fuzzy mathematical denoising algorithm models b and c both use fmc table 2 and eic table 4 discretization methods respectively observation shows that two models models b and c better fitting and reasonable reasoning when learning fmc data fig 4 in the comparison between fbm and fme the results also show that fmc is superior to eic table 7 wiest et al 2019 believes that a target training data set can build a model probability structure which helps a more robust cross validation analysis we developed fbm on a regional scale rather than a smaller sub region or statistical scale the three fbm frameworks and the corresponding target training data sets can build the model probability distribution which is the performance of powerful cross validation analysis although there are no specific guidelines to derive the number of cases for the structure and parameters of the fbm as the cases increase the bn model becomes more robust in all fbm whether used fmc or eic it is shows that after the model structure parameters are fixed as the amount of data increases the implicit parameters required for inference will increase fig 4 and the absolute values of the aic and log likelihood functions will also increase by evaluating the fmc data model a model b and model c have very different feedback model a only comes from machine structure learning model a has fewer nodes so the model has fewer independent variables than the other two models and the absolute value of the log likelihood is also smaller fig 4b but model a has too many hidden variables and the absolute value of aic is much higher than that of the other two models fig 4a similarly model b is superior to model c in data fitting as is the model structure because the implicit parameters of model b are less than model c it can prevent the model from overfitting during the mapping process although the results contain a number of conflict and equal probability events the probability of this happening decreases with the increase of the learning data table 6 the conflict indicates that the software cannot obtain results after calculation the reason is that the network s inference oversteps the scope of reasoning this means the network probability distribution selected by researchers cannot exist in the current network the predicted sites are not suitable for the species growth or the structure of the network model is not reasonable the results show that the model requires a large amount of original data and the quality and quantity of the original data have a profound impact on the prediction results of the fbm model this is the same as other sdms such as glm garp and rf hirzel et al 2001 ray et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b 4 4 case and features of fbm in china a sinensis is widely known as a chm committee of national pharmacopoeia 2020 the quality of a sinensis and its marker compound ferulic acid are systematic research zhang et al 2012 2019 ma et al 2015 sufficient and perfect basic research data can effectively support our research this is why we choose a sinensis instead of other medicinal plants as a typical case each model has its own theoretical framework and is different from the concept definition with species suitability different from most previous models such as glm garp rf maxent hirzel et al 2001 ray et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b guo et al 2017 fbm has a unique understanding of species suitability as described in the above method the membership function fits the marker compound ferulic acid of a sinensis and environmental variables together and then further processes to obtain the level of species suitability because fbm currently mainly targets medicinal plants to a large extent the level of the content of species marker compound that is the level of medicinal value represents the level of species suitability fbm emphasizes that the content of species marker compound determines the suitability of the species habitat the original data required by the fbm model includes the content of species marker compound the location of the species occurrence and environmental data we have compared fbm with fme in the manuscript however models such as glm garp rf and maxent combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates elith and leathwick 2009 there is no data on the content of species marker compound for simulation therefore for medicinal plants fbm s prediction mechanism is more effective and can help us quickly predict where there will be high quality medicinal materials because of the different definitions of habitat suitability and different data sources the structure of fbm and other models such as rf and maxent are very different and the evaluation methods are also different the reliability from different model systems actually comes from different statistical models strandén and christensen 2011 the comparison between fbm and other models such as rf and maxent cannot help fbm to improve model prediction accuracy reliability and robustness through a series of reliability and robustness analyses this study adopted the results of seq 9th of b model with sevs states divided by fmc and ievs states divided by comprehensive suitability evaluation fig 5 in this study 50 predicted sites of a sinensis were randomly selected in the study area fig 1 from the prediction results the distribution of a sinensis habitat suitability is related to the sampling sites the prediction result reflects the distribution pattern of ferulic acid content in a sinensis sampling sites the highly and moderately suitable habitats of a sinensis are mainly distributed in gansu and shaanxi shang et al 2015 this also further confirms that the model has a reasonable mapping and promotion ability fbm adds sensitivity analysis to help researchers further explore the impact of variables on habitat suitability from appendix table a6 we further extract the degree of influence of each node on the habitat status of a sinensis fig 6 through the maximum and minimum values in the suitability probability changes appendix table a6 we can find out that som bio1 bio10 and el affect the increase and decrease of four suitability probabilities in different degrees fig 6 in terms of the range of suitability probability changes min to max almost all four suitability changes are dominated by these environmental variables som bio1 and bio10 for ievs the temperature suitability node still has a great influence on suitability of a sinensis fig 6 fbm performs bayesian inference based on fmc the role of fuzzy mathematics in this study is for the discretization of nodes according to the degree of membership we classify the states of the environmental variables table 2 this means that each state of the eight sevs itself contains some information that supports or not support the suitability of a sinensis for example bio1 node appendix table a6 when the probability of 4 is 100 the probability of highly suitable is the largest 39 82 and the probability of unsuitable is the smallest 11 58 in contrast when the 1 probability is 100 the highly suitable probability is the smallest 17 29 and the unsuitable probability is the largest 21 80 in summary the four states of fmc table 2 from state 1 to state 4 imply the gradual support of environmental variables for the growth of a sinensis obviously fmc can extract the relationship between the value of environmental variables and the growth of a sinensis while eic cannot fig 4 table 6 hence fmc significantly improves the operating efficiency of fbm through fmc and the sensitivity analysis appendix table a6 bio1 in 5 92 c 9 05 c bio10 in 14 80 c 18 60 c bio12 in 568 79 mm 791 33 mm bio15 in 69 04 87 48 and bio18 in 284 28 mm 428 mm can promote the highly suitable habitats of a sinensis table 2 which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies shang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 consistent with the research results of genuine producing areas som has a profound effect on the growth quality of a sinensis zhao et al 2002 this is an interesting finding we can continue to analyze the range where sevs have the greatest influence on the moderately suitable lowly suitable and unsuitable habitats of a sinensis table 2 appendix table a6 unlike fme fbm pre processes the data while preserving the adaptability of the species to the environment it adds a machine learning process that can perform detailed probabilistic reasoning and explore relationships between environmental variables thereby improving the model s ability to identify and fit data and the efficiency of using species data 5 conclusion combining fuzzy mathematics expert experience machine learning and bayesian reasoning taking a sinensis as a case a species habitat suitability model fbm is established in this study model a is generated by machine learning models b and c combine previous research and experience compared with model a the model frameworks b and c are more accurate and reliable model b has simple structure parameters efficient data identification and data output stability is better than model c and model a comparative experiments of two discretization methods fmc and eic show that the results of fmc is effectively recognized by the fbm and reliable results are output fbm sensitivity analysis helps researchers explore in detail the effects of environmental factors on various aspects of species habitat suitability it is easy for researchers to obtain terrestrial plants environmental data needed for fbm operation and many plants have species characteristics that can be used for fbm hence the concept and framework of fbm may have a broad application prospect for research on species habitat suitability in the future credit

24624,as a raw material for ethanol the production of sugarcane in brazil is a very important and profitable agribusiness sector in the last decades with the prohibition of burning cane fields and the expansion of plantations there has been a significant increase in the population of pests the most important of which is a sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis it affects the stalks of plants causing losses and decreasing the industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process thus the purpose of this work is to study an interaction between the sugarcane borer and its larval parasite cotesia flavipes the interaction between these populations is modeled by a host parasitoid system for which the study is done considering an influence of seasonal variation on the dynamics of the system it has been shown that this variation generates chaotic dynamics in the system in order to keep the pest population below economic damage a biological control strategy has been proposed which consists of introducing into the environment the amount of pest parasitoids determined by the state dependent riccati equation sdre method keywords sugarcane borer biological control seasonality sdre 1 introduction in recent years economic interest in the production of sugarcane in brazil has grown significantly especially due to its importance for the production of ethanol a fuel in which brazil is the second largest producer in the world rafikov and silveira 2014 the sugarcane is a long lasting monoculture from 12 to 18 months grown on large tracts of land on a commercial scale the sugarcane borer the diatraea sacharalis is considered the most important sugarcane pest causing damage from the third month after planting where the cane is in the tillering stage and its population growth is also favored by high rainfall levels and high temperatures spring and summer in its life cycle the female after mating lays in total of her life cycle about 300 eggs in the leaves of the cane after an incubation period of 4 to 9 days the larvae emerge from the eggs the newborn larvae scrape the leaves and pierce the softer part of the sugarcane stalk building internal galleries causing direct damage that results in the death of the sprout dry leaves weight loss and atrophy as well as indirect damage when there is contamination by yeasts that cause rot in the stems decreasing the purity of the sugarcane juice increasing the loss of industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process aya et al 2017 macedo and botelho 1988 parra et al 2002 vargas et al 2015 the caterpillars in the pupa stage can last a long time in winter when weather conditions are unfavorable and the number of hours of sunlight decreases going through a period called diapause or numbness however the drill reaches its adult state duration of 5 to 7 days totaling a life cycle that can vary from 60 to 90 days depending on external conditions considering a cane field with 18 month cane cultivation 6 to 7 generations of borers can occur during this period molnár et al 2016 the biological control which consists of reducing the pest population using natural enemies such as predators parasitoids andpathogens is the only viable and efficient option since it is impossible to use insecticides against the sugarcane borer in the larval stage because the larva is found inside the plant the wasp cotesia flavipes is the most important parasitoid of the sugarcane borer used in biological control in brazil parra et al 2002 parra 2014 parra and junior 2019 the wasps are bred in laboratories and are released on plantations infested with borers the mathematical modeling of pest and parasitoid populations and control theory are adequate tools to choose a good parasitoid release strategy in the field mathematical models and sugarcane borer control strategies were considered in molnár et al 2016 and rafikov and silveira 2013 2014 in the models mentioned above the coefficients are considered constant that is without considering the seasonality factor in different seasons of the year factors such as temperature humidity and rain can influence the interactions between pests and parasitoids this work considers the seasonality based on the interaction model of borer populations and its parasitoid that was proposed in rafikov and silveira 2014 it was discovered the chaotic dynamics of the host parasitoid agroecosystem in the environment with seasonality the presence of chaotic behavior in the agroecosystem can lead to the extinction of the parasitoid population and resurgence of pests with high density values for biological control of systems with chaotic behavior in works molter and rafikov 2014 and rafikov et al 2008 the linear feedback and lyapunov function methods were used on the other hand the state dependent riccati equation sdre control strategy banks et al 2007 mracek and cloutier 1998 is commonly used to control the dynamics of nonlinear systems and systems that have chaotic behavior as can be seen in works choi 2012 and ghaffari and arebi 2016 in the present work the sdre methodology will be used as the control strategy to control the dynamics of the system with chaotic behavior the mathematical modeling presented in this work of the sugarcane borer system including seasonality the chaotic system dynamics and the impulsive control methodology is a novelty 2 mathematical model of dynamics and control in this section we present the mathematical model of the sugarcane borer and parasitoid dynamics and the sdre control methodology 2 1 mathematical model of interactions between the sugarcane borer and its parasitoid cotesia flavipes let h be the larvae density of the sugarcane borer host population i the density of the larvae population parasitized by cotesia flavipes infected host population and p the density of the larvae parasitoid cotesia flavipes the following mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis and its larvae parasitoid cotesia flavipes was proposed in rafikov and silveira 2014 1 h r 1 h k h n 1 h β p h i β h p i m 2 n 2 p δ n 2 i m 3 p were r is the intrinsic growth rate k is the carrying capacity of the environment m 2 and m 3 are mortality rates of the parasitized larvae and the adult parasitoid populations n 1 is the fraction of the larvae population which moults into pupae stage at time t n 2 is the fraction of the parasitized larvae from which the adult parasitoids emerge at time t β is the intrinsic rate of parasitism and δ is a number of the adult parasitoids which emerge from one parasitized larvae at time t all the parameters are assumed to be nonnegative constant in rafikov and silveira 2014 three equilibrium points of model 1 were obtained 2 e 1 0 0 0 e 2 k r n 1 r 0 0 e 3 h 3 i 3 p 3 where h 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 β δ n 2 p 3 1 β r 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 β δ n 2 k n 1 and i 3 m 3 p 3 δ n 2 to biological control the three populations in the system 1 have non zero values therefore only the equilibrium point e 3 will be considered investigations in rafikov and silveira 2014 showed the equilibrium point e 3 is locally stable if and only if m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 k r n 1 β m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 φ k with φ μ 1 2 μ 1 2 4 μ 2 μ 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 and μ 2 m 2 n 2 m 3 r n 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 in β m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 φ k a supercritical hopf bifurcation occurs in the system in which the model changes from an asymptotically stable behavior to a limit cycle the non seasonally model with constant coefficients does not take into account that in the winter months the pupa stage can last for a long time in section 3 the influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the ecosystem is considered 2 2 sdre nonlinear control design consider the nonlinear dynamical system given by 3 x f x b x u f 0 0 where x r n denotes the state u r m the control and f x r n r n and b x r n r n m are differentiable in all arguments the goal of the control problem is to find the vector function u that drives the system 3 from an initial state to 0 minimizing the following cost functional 4 j u 0 x t q x x u t r x u d t where the matrix q x r n r n n is symmetric positive semidefinite and the matrix r x r n r m m is symmetric positive definite we are assuming the functions f x b x q x and r x sufficiently smooth according with banks et al 2007 and mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 the sdre method to find the sub optimal solution to the problem 3 4 consists of the following steps 1 use direct of parametrization factorization to present the non linear system in a similar form to the linear one with matrices dependent on state variables 5 x a x x b x u where 6 f x a x x 2 solution of the riccati equation with state dependent matrices for initial system values 7 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 where the matrix p x is symmetric and positive definite to all the values of x 3 non linear feedback controller project 8 u r 1 b t p x x 4 integration of 3 with the control 6 finding the state of the system in the next moment of time 5 repeating the process from the step 2 under the hypotheses f 0 0 e f c 1 r n there is always at least one continuous matrix function a x that satisfy 5 the matrix a x r n r n n found through mathematical factoring is not unique to n 1 in mracek and cloutier 1998 were evaluated as the following properties of the sdre method associated with the form 7 with state dependent coefficients 1 the state dependent representation 5 is a parametrization of the system 3 stabilizable controllable in the region ω r n if the pair a x b x is stabilizable controllable point to point in the linear direction for all values of c ω 2 the state dependent representation 4 is a parametrization of system 3 detectable observable in the region ω r n if the pair a x q 1 2 x it is detectable observable point to point pointwise is the linear direction for all values of x ω in banks et al 2007 was showed a theorem that present conditions of local asymptotic stability the theorem is stated in appendix using the result of this theorem it can be shown that the system with the control given by 8 is locally asymptotically stable 3 main results in this section we present the simulation results of the seasonal system dynamics of the sugarcane borer and its parasitoid and the continuous control of the system using the sdre method 3 1 seasonal dynamics of the sugarcane borer parasitoid agroecosystem environmental factors such as temperature humidity and rainfall influence the intrinsic growth rate in this chapter a numerical study is made of the seasonal variation in the growth rate represented by the parameter r this parameter will have its values defined by the following function rinaldi et al 1993 zhang et al 2012 9 r 0 19 1 r 1 sin 2 π t 365 in which r 1 represents the intensity of seasonality the fig 1 shows the variation of parasitism rate r into of a time period of 400 days that in a cane field could encompasses from the planting of the cane to the harvest it is possible to identify that in october when planting starts the abundant rains the increase in temperature and the hours of sunshine a day are favorable conditions for the growth of both the cane the borer and the larva parasitoid which find their peak in march from april onwards with the decrease in rainfall and the arrival of winter the parasitism rate declines until september in a process of numbness in october with the arrival of spring the population growth and parasitism cycle is reestablished parra et al 2002 the simulations were carried out with the values of the parameters given in rafikov and silveira 2014 r 0 19 n 1 1 50 n 2 1 16 δ 40 m 2 0 036 m 3 0 5 k 25000 time series of population density variation with and without seasonality in figs 2 and 3 show the considerable influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the agroecosystem the system without seasonality presents periodic oscillations of a simple limit cycle fig 2 the system with seasonally presents a different dynamic from periodic oscillations non periodic oscillations with a time interval of more than 100 days in winter with almost no population variations fig 3 bifurcation diagrams show that there are two ranges of values of the coefficient r 1 for which the system has chaotic behavior and two so called windows where the system establishes periodic or quasi periodic behavior fig 4 in figs 2 6 we use the parameter value r 1 0 85 fig 6 shows a strange attractor the phase portrait of the system without seasonality shows an attractor of the limit cycle type as shown in fig 5 in figs 2 and 3 the constant line represents the threshold of economic damage which in this work was taken as 2500 larvae per hectare rafikov and silveira 2014 the initial conditions are h 0 i 0 p 0 3000 1000 3000 the presence of chaotic behavior in the agroecosystem under consideration can lead to the extinction of the parasitoid population and the resurgence of pests with high density values in the next subsection will be considered biological control for the chaotic agroecosystem in order to keep pest density below economic damage 3 2 biological control in the ecosystem with seasonal variations as seen in fig 3 the density of the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis for most of the time is above the threshold of economic damage in order to carry out biological control in the field we have to find a strategy to release adults parasitoids cotesia flavipes based on the theory of optimal control for the system 3 without seasonality this problem was solved in rafikov and silveira 2014 using linear control feedback for system with seasonality we propose to use the sdre control methodology the system 3 with control has the following form 10 h r 1 h k h n 1 h β p h i β h p i m 2 n 2 p δ n 2 i m 3 p u in eq 10 the control function is introduced in the third equation and represents insertion of parasitoids in the system let h be the value of the desired level of pests below the economic damage threshold the parameters of equilibrium point that correspond to this value can be found from the system r 1 h k h n 1 h β h p 0 11 β h p i m 2 n 2 0 δ n 2 i m 3 p u 0 considering the equilibrium eqs 11 the variables of system 10 can be written with deviations as h x 1 h i x 2 i 12 p x 3 p u u u where x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the variables with deviations u is the control that ensures the value of h and u is the control that stabilize the system at the desired equilibrium point the system with deviations has the following form 13 x 1 x 1 r r x 1 2 h k n 1 β x 3 p h β x 3 x 2 x 1 β x 3 p x 2 m 2 n 2 x 3 β h x 3 δ n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u now following the steps presented in section 2 we will present the system 13 in a similar way to the linear one with matrices dependent on state variables 14 x a x x b x u where a possible parameterization is a r r x 1 2 h k n 1 β x 3 p 0 h β β x 3 p m 2 n 2 h β 0 δ n 2 m 3 b 0 0 1 t in the second step choosing the weight coefficients q x and r x of the functional 4 we can solve algebraic riccati equation with state dependent matrices for system values 15 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 where the matrix p x is symmetric and defined positive for all the values of x in the third step the function of the nonlinear feedback control is calculated as 16 u r 1 b t p x x finally the integration of the system 8 with the control 16 determines the state of the system in the next moment of time the calculations are repeated from the second stage 3 3 application to the agroecosystem to perform the numerical simulations the functional weight coefficients 4 were chosen in the form q d i a g 10 10 10 and r d i a g 1 in our control system to guarantee the larvae density below economic damage we chose h 2000 larvae hectare since the economic damage threshold is 2500 larvae hectare rafikov and silveira 2013 2014 the values of the desired equilibrium point of the other variables were calculated from the system 11 i 3158 parasitized larvae hectare and p 19441 predators hectare and u 1825 5 parasitoids hectare day the fig 7 shows that the chaotic agroecosystem 10 guided by the control u u u reaches the desired equilibrium point around 20 days the simulation was done with r 1 0 85 in fig 8 there is the control function u that consists of the adult release of parasitoids in the plantation it can be seen that at the beginning of the control application the release of cotesia per day per hectare is more intense and decreases until it becomes constant from 35 days when the system stabilizes around the desired level 4 field applications it is expensive to carry out the daily parasitoid release program proposed in the previous section in a sugarcane field a possible application can be done through a weekly decision on the release of parasitoids using the control function u u u where u is determined by the function 16 if at the moment of decision making the pest density is below the decision level of economic damage the control is equal to 0 that is u 0 otherwise a number of parasitoids computed from eq 16 and introduced in the system 10 are released throughout all the simulation period the control value u is only calculated when the weekly larvae collection shows a level of larvae above the decision level taken as h ˆ 2300 the growth of the population h t in a period of one week can quickly overcome the threshold of economic damage therefore choosing h as the decision level proved to be early which means that the larvae population even with the insertion of parasitoids can exceed the threshold of economic damage hence h ˆ was chosen as the decision level which is closer to the threshold of economic damage the weekly process of activating and deactivating the control can be summarized in the following steps 1 if h t h ˆ then solve the system 10 for u 0 2 if h t h ˆ then follow the steps below 3 calculate the deviations from the desired regime x 1 h h x 2 i i and x 3 p p 4 calculate matrices a and b with x values calculated in step 3 5 use eq 15 to obtain the matrix p 6 use eq 16 to calculate u 7 calculate the control value u u u 8 add the value of u to the third equation of the system 10 9 solve the system 10 with the updated values h i and p u now being the initial conditions of the system fig 9 shows the uncontrolled system with seasonality where we can note that the impulsive control should be applied from the beginning since the level of pests is above the threshold of economic damage fig 10 shows the dynamics of the controlled system with impulsive release fig 11 shows the impulsive parasitoid release program on days 0 14 28 182 322 350 371 392 the total amount of parasitoids released with this strategy is considerably below the continuous control in this control strategy the harvesting of field information is weekly however parasitoids are introduced into the system only when the pest population exceeds h ˆ 2300 decision level for parasitoid release we emphasize that u negative values were discarded and for the feasibility of applying the impulsive control the initial level of parasitoids to be inserted in the systems should be high as can be seen in figs 10 and 11 as an application in the sugarcane crops works da silva miguel et al 2018 and nava et al 2009 indicate impulsive release of parasitoids in fact comparing figs 7 and 10 one can observe that the impulsive control keeps the larvae population below the threshold of economic damage using less amount of parasitoid release in addition impulsive control follows the recommendation of releasing parasitoids in the system at spaced periods of time 5 conclusions in this work we first studied the influence of seasonality on the interaction dynamics between the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis and its larval parasitoid cotesia flavipes based on the model proposed in rafikov and silveira 2014 the study showed that the system 3 with seasonality presents a more complex dynamics than in the case of constant parameters the system without seasonality depending on values of β presents the simple attractor or the simple limit cycle bifurcation diagrams of the system 3 with seasonality show that there are two ranges of values of the coefficient r 1 for which the system presents the chaotic behavior and two so called windows where the system establishes a periodic or almost periodic behavior the presence of chaotic behavior in the agroecosystem under consideration can lead to the extinction of the parasitoid population and the resurgence of pests with high density values to keep the pest population below economic damage threshold a biological control strategy was proposed using the sdre method which proved to be effective in bringing the system to the desired level in a few days being a very promising result for the sugar and alcohol sector observing the oscillatory behavior of the growth rate r shown in fig 1 and the insertion of parasitoids in the agroecosystem shown in fig 11 it is noticed that with the exception of the parasitoids release in the initial instant and in the period between 150 and 200 days the other releases occur during periods of intense growth of the larvae population which is in agreement with a real application where parasitoids are released when there is a larvae population increase in the crop taking into account the two forms of control considered the continuous control and the impulsive control we figure out that the impulsive control is more economical in terms of pest management in addition to representing a viable implementation therefore it is expected that

24624,as a raw material for ethanol the production of sugarcane in brazil is a very important and profitable agribusiness sector in the last decades with the prohibition of burning cane fields and the expansion of plantations there has been a significant increase in the population of pests the most important of which is a sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis it affects the stalks of plants causing losses and decreasing the industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process thus the purpose of this work is to study an interaction between the sugarcane borer and its larval parasite cotesia flavipes the interaction between these populations is modeled by a host parasitoid system for which the study is done considering an influence of seasonal variation on the dynamics of the system it has been shown that this variation generates chaotic dynamics in the system in order to keep the pest population below economic damage a biological control strategy has been proposed which consists of introducing into the environment the amount of pest parasitoids determined by the state dependent riccati equation sdre method keywords sugarcane borer biological control seasonality sdre 1 introduction in recent years economic interest in the production of sugarcane in brazil has grown significantly especially due to its importance for the production of ethanol a fuel in which brazil is the second largest producer in the world rafikov and silveira 2014 the sugarcane is a long lasting monoculture from 12 to 18 months grown on large tracts of land on a commercial scale the sugarcane borer the diatraea sacharalis is considered the most important sugarcane pest causing damage from the third month after planting where the cane is in the tillering stage and its population growth is also favored by high rainfall levels and high temperatures spring and summer in its life cycle the female after mating lays in total of her life cycle about 300 eggs in the leaves of the cane after an incubation period of 4 to 9 days the larvae emerge from the eggs the newborn larvae scrape the leaves and pierce the softer part of the sugarcane stalk building internal galleries causing direct damage that results in the death of the sprout dry leaves weight loss and atrophy as well as indirect damage when there is contamination by yeasts that cause rot in the stems decreasing the purity of the sugarcane juice increasing the loss of industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process aya et al 2017 macedo and botelho 1988 parra et al 2002 vargas et al 2015 the caterpillars in the pupa stage can last a long time in winter when weather conditions are unfavorable and the number of hours of sunlight decreases going through a period called diapause or numbness however the drill reaches its adult state duration of 5 to 7 days totaling a life cycle that can vary from 60 to 90 days depending on external conditions considering a cane field with 18 month cane cultivation 6 to 7 generations of borers can occur during this period molnár et al 2016 the biological control which consists of reducing the pest population using natural enemies such as predators parasitoids andpathogens is the only viable and efficient option since it is impossible to use insecticides against the sugarcane borer in the larval stage because the larva is found inside the plant the wasp cotesia flavipes is the most important parasitoid of the sugarcane borer used in biological control in brazil parra et al 2002 parra 2014 parra and junior 2019 the wasps are bred in laboratories and are released on plantations infested with borers the mathematical modeling of pest and parasitoid populations and control theory are adequate tools to choose a good parasitoid release strategy in the field mathematical models and sugarcane borer control strategies were considered in molnár et al 2016 and rafikov and silveira 2013 2014 in the models mentioned above the coefficients are considered constant that is without considering the seasonality factor in different seasons of the year factors such as temperature humidity and rain can influence the interactions between pests and parasitoids this work considers the seasonality based on the interaction model of borer populations and its parasitoid that was proposed in rafikov and silveira 2014 it was discovered the chaotic dynamics of the host parasitoid agroecosystem in the environment with seasonality the presence of chaotic behavior in the agroecosystem can lead to the extinction of the parasitoid population and resurgence of pests with high density values for biological control of systems with chaotic behavior in works molter and rafikov 2014 and rafikov et al 2008 the linear feedback and lyapunov function methods were used on the other hand the state dependent riccati equation sdre control strategy banks et al 2007 mracek and cloutier 1998 is commonly used to control the dynamics of nonlinear systems and systems that have chaotic behavior as can be seen in works choi 2012 and ghaffari and arebi 2016 in the present work the sdre methodology will be used as the control strategy to control the dynamics of the system with chaotic behavior the mathematical modeling presented in this work of the sugarcane borer system including seasonality the chaotic system dynamics and the impulsive control methodology is a novelty 2 mathematical model of dynamics and control in this section we present the mathematical model of the sugarcane borer and parasitoid dynamics and the sdre control methodology 2 1 mathematical model of interactions between the sugarcane borer and its parasitoid cotesia flavipes let h be the larvae density of the sugarcane borer host population i the density of the larvae population parasitized by cotesia flavipes infected host population and p the density of the larvae parasitoid cotesia flavipes the following mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis and its larvae parasitoid cotesia flavipes was proposed in rafikov and silveira 2014 1 h r 1 h k h n 1 h β p h i β h p i m 2 n 2 p δ n 2 i m 3 p were r is the intrinsic growth rate k is the carrying capacity of the environment m 2 and m 3 are mortality rates of the parasitized larvae and the adult parasitoid populations n 1 is the fraction of the larvae population which moults into pupae stage at time t n 2 is the fraction of the parasitized larvae from which the adult parasitoids emerge at time t β is the intrinsic rate of parasitism and δ is a number of the adult parasitoids which emerge from one parasitized larvae at time t all the parameters are assumed to be nonnegative constant in rafikov and silveira 2014 three equilibrium points of model 1 were obtained 2 e 1 0 0 0 e 2 k r n 1 r 0 0 e 3 h 3 i 3 p 3 where h 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 β δ n 2 p 3 1 β r 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 β δ n 2 k n 1 and i 3 m 3 p 3 δ n 2 to biological control the three populations in the system 1 have non zero values therefore only the equilibrium point e 3 will be considered investigations in rafikov and silveira 2014 showed the equilibrium point e 3 is locally stable if and only if m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 k r n 1 β m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 φ k with φ μ 1 2 μ 1 2 4 μ 2 μ 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 m 2 n 2 m 3 and μ 2 m 2 n 2 m 3 r n 1 m 2 n 2 m 3 in β m 3 m 2 n 2 r δ n 2 φ k a supercritical hopf bifurcation occurs in the system in which the model changes from an asymptotically stable behavior to a limit cycle the non seasonally model with constant coefficients does not take into account that in the winter months the pupa stage can last for a long time in section 3 the influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the ecosystem is considered 2 2 sdre nonlinear control design consider the nonlinear dynamical system given by 3 x f x b x u f 0 0 where x r n denotes the state u r m the control and f x r n r n and b x r n r n m are differentiable in all arguments the goal of the control problem is to find the vector function u that drives the system 3 from an initial state to 0 minimizing the following cost functional 4 j u 0 x t q x x u t r x u d t where the matrix q x r n r n n is symmetric positive semidefinite and the matrix r x r n r m m is symmetric positive definite we are assuming the functions f x b x q x and r x sufficiently smooth according with banks et al 2007 and mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 the sdre method to find the sub optimal solution to the problem 3 4 consists of the following steps 1 use direct of parametrization factorization to present the non linear system in a similar form to the linear one with matrices dependent on state variables 5 x a x x b x u where 6 f x a x x 2 solution of the riccati equation with state dependent matrices for initial system values 7 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 where the matrix p x is symmetric and positive definite to all the values of x 3 non linear feedback controller project 8 u r 1 b t p x x 4 integration of 3 with the control 6 finding the state of the system in the next moment of time 5 repeating the process from the step 2 under the hypotheses f 0 0 e f c 1 r n there is always at least one continuous matrix function a x that satisfy 5 the matrix a x r n r n n found through mathematical factoring is not unique to n 1 in mracek and cloutier 1998 were evaluated as the following properties of the sdre method associated with the form 7 with state dependent coefficients 1 the state dependent representation 5 is a parametrization of the system 3 stabilizable controllable in the region ω r n if the pair a x b x is stabilizable controllable point to point in the linear direction for all values of c ω 2 the state dependent representation 4 is a parametrization of system 3 detectable observable in the region ω r n if the pair a x q 1 2 x it is detectable observable point to point pointwise is the linear direction for all values of x ω in banks et al 2007 was showed a theorem that present conditions of local asymptotic stability the theorem is stated in appendix using the result of this theorem it can be shown that the system with the control given by 8 is locally asymptotically stable 3 main results in this section we present the simulation results of the seasonal system dynamics of the sugarcane borer and its parasitoid and the continuous control of the system using the sdre method 3 1 seasonal dynamics of the sugarcane borer parasitoid agroecosystem environmental factors such as temperature humidity and rainfall influence the intrinsic growth rate in this chapter a numerical study is made of the seasonal variation in the growth rate represented by the parameter r this parameter will have its values defined by the following function rinaldi et al 1993 zhang et al 2012 9 r 0 19 1 r 1 sin 2 π t 365 in which r 1 represents the intensity of seasonality the fig 1 shows the variation of parasitism rate r into of a time period of 400 days that in a cane field could encompasses from the planting of the cane to the harvest it is possible to identify that in october when planting starts the abundant rains the increase in temperature and the hours of sunshine a day are favorable conditions for the growth of both the cane the borer and the larva parasitoid which find their peak in march from april onwards with the decrease in rainfall and the arrival of winter the parasitism rate declines until september in a process of numbness in october with the arrival of spring the population growth and parasitism cycle is reestablished parra et al 2002 the simulations were carried out with the values of the parameters given in rafikov and silveira 2014 r 0 19 n 1 1 50 n 2 1 16 δ 40 m 2 0 036 m 3 0 5 k 25000 time series of population density variation with and without seasonality in figs 2 and 3 show the considerable influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the agroecosystem the system without seasonality presents periodic oscillations of a simple limit cycle fig 2 the system with seasonally presents a different dynamic from periodic oscillations non periodic oscillations with a time interval of more than 100 days in winter with almost no population variations fig 3 bifurcation diagrams show that there are two ranges of values of the coefficient r 1 for which the system has chaotic behavior and two so called windows where the system establishes periodic or quasi periodic behavior fig 4 in figs 2 6 we use the parameter value r 1 0 85 fig 6 shows a strange attractor the phase portrait of the system without seasonality shows an attractor of the limit cycle type as shown in fig 5 in figs 2 and 3 the constant line represents the threshold of economic damage which in this work was taken as 2500 larvae per hectare rafikov and silveira 2014 the initial conditions are h 0 i 0 p 0 3000 1000 3000 the presence of chaotic behavior in the agroecosystem under consideration can lead to the extinction of the parasitoid population and the resurgence of pests with high density values in the next subsection will be considered biological control for the chaotic agroecosystem in order to keep pest density below economic damage 3 2 biological control in the ecosystem with seasonal variations as seen in fig 3 the density of the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis for most of the time is above the threshold of economic damage in order to carry out biological control in the field we have to find a strategy to release adults parasitoids cotesia flavipes based on the theory of optimal control for the system 3 without seasonality this problem was solved in rafikov and silveira 2014 using linear control feedback for system with seasonality we propose to use the sdre control methodology the system 3 with control has the following form 10 h r 1 h k h n 1 h β p h i β h p i m 2 n 2 p δ n 2 i m 3 p u in eq 10 the control function is introduced in the third equation and represents insertion of parasitoids in the system let h be the value of the desired level of pests below the economic damage threshold the parameters of equilibrium point that correspond to this value can be found from the system r 1 h k h n 1 h β h p 0 11 β h p i m 2 n 2 0 δ n 2 i m 3 p u 0 considering the equilibrium eqs 11 the variables of system 10 can be written with deviations as h x 1 h i x 2 i 12 p x 3 p u u u where x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the variables with deviations u is the control that ensures the value of h and u is the control that stabilize the system at the desired equilibrium point the system with deviations has the following form 13 x 1 x 1 r r x 1 2 h k n 1 β x 3 p h β x 3 x 2 x 1 β x 3 p x 2 m 2 n 2 x 3 β h x 3 δ n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u now following the steps presented in section 2 we will present the system 13 in a similar way to the linear one with matrices dependent on state variables 14 x a x x b x u where a possible parameterization is a r r x 1 2 h k n 1 β x 3 p 0 h β β x 3 p m 2 n 2 h β 0 δ n 2 m 3 b 0 0 1 t in the second step choosing the weight coefficients q x and r x of the functional 4 we can solve algebraic riccati equation with state dependent matrices for system values 15 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 where the matrix p x is symmetric and defined positive for all the values of x in the third step the function of the nonlinear feedback control is calculated as 16 u r 1 b t p x x finally the integration of the system 8 with the control 16 determines the state of the system in the next moment of time the calculations are repeated from the second stage 3 3 application to the agroecosystem to perform the numerical simulations the functional weight coefficients 4 were chosen in the form q d i a g 10 10 10 and r d i a g 1 in our control system to guarantee the larvae density below economic damage we chose h 2000 larvae hectare since the economic damage threshold is 2500 larvae hectare rafikov and silveira 2013 2014 the values of the desired equilibrium point of the other variables were calculated from the system 11 i 3158 parasitized larvae hectare and p 19441 predators hectare and u 1825 5 parasitoids hectare day the fig 7 shows that the chaotic agroecosystem 10 guided by the control u u u reaches the desired equilibrium point around 20 days the simulation was done with r 1 0 85 in fig 8 there is the control function u that consists of the adult release of parasitoids in the plantation it can be seen that at the beginning of the control application the release of cotesia per day per hectare is more intense and decreases until it becomes constant from 35 days when the system stabilizes around the desired level 4 field applications it is expensive to carry out the daily parasitoid release program proposed in the previous section in a sugarcane field a possible application can be done through a weekly decision on the release of parasitoids using the control function u u u where u is determined by the function 16 if at the moment of decision making the pest density is below the decision level of economic damage the control is equal to 0 that is u 0 otherwise a number of parasitoids computed from eq 16 and introduced in the system 10 are released throughout all the simulation period the control value u is only calculated when the weekly larvae collection shows a level of larvae above the decision level taken as h ˆ 2300 the growth of the population h t in a period of one week can quickly overcome the threshold of economic damage therefore choosing h as the decision level proved to be early which means that the larvae population even with the insertion of parasitoids can exceed the threshold of economic damage hence h ˆ was chosen as the decision level which is closer to the threshold of economic damage the weekly process of activating and deactivating the control can be summarized in the following steps 1 if h t h ˆ then solve the system 10 for u 0 2 if h t h ˆ then follow the steps below 3 calculate the deviations from the desired regime x 1 h h x 2 i i and x 3 p p 4 calculate matrices a and b with x values calculated in step 3 5 use eq 15 to obtain the matrix p 6 use eq 16 to calculate u 7 calculate the control value u u u 8 add the value of u to the third equation of the system 10 9 solve the system 10 with the updated values h i and p u now being the initial conditions of the system fig 9 shows the uncontrolled system with seasonality where we can note that the impulsive control should be applied from the beginning since the level of pests is above the threshold of economic damage fig 10 shows the dynamics of the controlled system with impulsive release fig 11 shows the impulsive parasitoid release program on days 0 14 28 182 322 350 371 392 the total amount of parasitoids released with this strategy is considerably below the continuous control in this control strategy the harvesting of field information is weekly however parasitoids are introduced into the system only when the pest population exceeds h ˆ 2300 decision level for parasitoid release we emphasize that u negative values were discarded and for the feasibility of applying the impulsive control the initial level of parasitoids to be inserted in the systems should be high as can be seen in figs 10 and 11 as an application in the sugarcane crops works da silva miguel et al 2018 and nava et al 2009 indicate impulsive release of parasitoids in fact comparing figs 7 and 10 one can observe that the impulsive control keeps the larvae population below the
