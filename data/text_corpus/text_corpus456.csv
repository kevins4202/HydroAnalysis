2280,water transfers and processes governing the chemistry of groundwaters and clay pore waters were investigated in the critical zone developed in tégulines clay in the area of brienne le chateau at east of the aube alluvium plain france a pit digging campaign along two stepped west facing hillslopes along the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley gives evidence of a thin quaternary clay silty and carbonate free loams overlying tégulines clay mobile regolith along the slopes and the presence of a carbonate alluvium layer in pits of the brevonne valley groundwaters at the first ridgetop attest of a temporary perched water table while groundwaters at top of tégulines clay along the first west facing steep slope toward the brevonne river provide evidence of lateral groundwater transfers and runoff of waters toward the valley which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain groundwaters have low concentrations of total dissolved solids tds 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate waters their δ18o and δd of groundwaters are consistent with local meteoric values an 18o and d enrichment in groundwaters at the bottom of the second hillslope and in waters from reservoirs indicates evaporation processes the δ13cco2 of dissolved inorganic carbone in groundwaters is essentially due to degradation of organic matter the composition of the pore waters from tégulines clay in boreholes are chemically heterogeneous and different from groundwaters they are ca mg so4 rich and show a large range of tds concentrations 592 6457 mg l the highest values are measured in the most intensely weathered clay developed in the first 10 15 m under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley this latter seems to represent a large intermediate discharge zone between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain the δ18o and δd of pore waters are alined along the local meteoric water line indicating that meteoric waters have diffused through the clay formation during post depositional history and replaced original connate seawater on contrary the 87sr 86sr ratios of pore waters remain almost similar to that of lower cretaceous seawater suggesting a limited diffusion of sr since the formation deposition toward the top of the formation in the aube brevonne paleovalley major cation and anion concentrations 18o and d enrichment and a slight increase of the 87sr 86sr ratios suggest the diffusion of evaporated waters the δ13c δ18o 87sr 86sr ratios and 14c activity of concretions at top of tégulines clay show that they precipitated from evaporated old groundwaters the oldest one at 34 ky in the tph2 1 pit at the ridgetop of the second hillslope and a younger age of 8 ky in the tv4 1 pit keywords tégulines clay critical zone landscape water transfer hydrogeochemistry multi isotopic approach data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the understanding of solute transport in critical zone cz developed in clay formation is an issue of primary importance both for the preservation of our natural environment and more specifically for long term assessment of the efficiency of the sub surface geological waste repository clay formations effectively act as a natural low permeability protective barrier preventing contamination of groundwater resources due to extremely long time scales for groundwater flow and solute transport and to the capacity of clay minerals to fix cationic and oxyanionic toxic chemicals debure et al 2018 2020 desaulniers et al 1981 gaucher et al 2006 hendry et al 2004 hendry and wassenaar 2000 mazurek et al 2011 mazurek et al 2009 remenda et al 1994 the study of the critical zone requires specific investigations of earth surface processes and water and solute transfers crossing time scales from geological times to anthropic time to cross such scales need to analyse present day waters and the records of the water fluxes in the geologic media e g soils and sediments with time interactions in cz between the marine reduced clay formation and surficial reservoirs including the atmosphere that is an infinite oxygen reservoir the hydrosphere and vegetation induce mineral chemical petrophysical and mechanical changes in the clay formation that influence pore water chemistry and solute transfers bolton et al 2006 brantley et al 2013 hendry and wassenaar 2000 jin and brantley 2011 jin et al 2013 jin et al 2010 lerouge et al 2018 sullivan et al 2016 tremosa et al 2020 tuttle and breit 2009 tuttle et al 2009 the reaction rates in the cz are the highest in the vadose zone and especially in the zone where the water table varies indeed the water slows the o2 migration rate since the diffusion of gases is faster in the air than in water in this zone complex and overlapping biogeochemical reactions occur that require reactive transport modelling to be deconvoluted and reconciled li et al 2017 macquarrie and mayer 2005 discrepancies are frequently observed when trying to extrapolate laboratory data used for modelling at the field scale tremosa et al 2020 maher et al 2006 pacheco and alencoão 2006 often either field data used as input of the models are acquired in constrained environments or modelling of the field is restricted to some specific area of interest bao et al 2017 milesi et al 2020 li et al 2013 such models remain often one dimensional models conceptual models or focus only on a little part of the investigated watershed one borehole or several trenches of a few dozen of centimetres or on the major biogeochemical reactions bao et al 2017 milesi et al 2020 li et al 2013 arizaleta 2020 mayer et al 2015 an important aspect of assessing the long term efficiency of the near surface repository is developing a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeochemical functioning of the entire targeted area in the watershed in order to define initial conditions of the disposal and to predict water flows for this reason it remains essential to obtain the most complete dataset mineralogy geochemistry petrophysical properties and hydrogeology for a decade tégulines clay a low permeability clay formation outcropping in the area of brienne le chateau north eastern france has been investigated in the context of surface repository for low level radioactive waste by andra the french national radioactive waste management agency a multi disciplinary approach has been applied to core samples from boreholes of three successive drilling campaigns through the clay formation to define the depth of the critical zone and the key parameters controlling chemistry of tégulines clay pore waters a detailed petrological study based on major iron bearing redox sensitive minerals feii pyrite siderite ankerite clay minerals and on the valence of iron combined with the petrophysical properties allowed defining the depth of the cz in the aub1010 borehole and proposing a first sketch model of the redox changes in the tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 oxidation in tégulines clay is characterized more by progressive reactions than by a sharp redox reaction front the oxidation reactions extend down to 20 m depth corresponding to the transition between a nonplastic to a plastic rock and the oxidation of diagenetic glauconite pellets a complementary gas monitoring co2 o2 n2 alkanes on core samples of tégulines clay from aub1010 aub230 and aub240 boreholes and carbon isotopes on co2 allowed defining the consequences of weathering processes on gases dissolved in pore waters lerouge et al 2020 the dataset showed that the first 10 12 m zone of tégulines clay corresponds to a highly reactive clay influenced essentially by pyrite oxidation calcite dissolution and degradation of organic matter and formation of iron hydroxides le meur et al 2021 the δ13c of co2 indicates that organic matter degradation was a major source of co2 at shallow depths and down to 10 12 m which is the maximum depth at which we observed fossil roots all these data constituted a first set of parameters for the building of a 1d vertical solute reactive transport modelling through the tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 2020 however hydrogeochemical processes remain poorly constrained in the studied area the main objectives of this work were to further investigate hydrogeochemical processes of cz developed in tégulines clay in the studied area based on hydrogeochemistry combined with a multi isotopic approach δ13c δd δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c such approach has been developed at susquehanna shale hills cz observatory sullivan et al 2016 and references therein the new field campaign at east of brienne le chateau and juzanvigny included boreholes and pits dug along two stepped west facing hillslopes corresponding to the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley on the eastern side of the aube alluvium plain the campaign of pit digging aimed at examining the conversion of tégulines clay into regolith and overlying sediments and soils the root network downslope transport of mobile regolith and at sampling waters rainfall surficial reservoirs and groundwaters additional deep boreholes 30 to 90 m allowed sampling tégulines clay through the cz and below in order to 1 define the variability of depth of the weathering profile in the studied area and 2 obtain tégulines clay pore waters for hydrochemistry chemical analyses of pore waters in claystones is challenging it can be obtained either by squeezing of samples fernández et al 2014 or by chemical pore water modelling using phreeqc gaucher et al 2009 wersin et al 2016 first chemical analyses of tégulines clay pore waters by squeezing are available in lerouge et al 2018 2020 in this paper we completed the dataset by pore water chemical data calculated with the phreeqc model of gaucher et al 2009 and already developed for tégulines clay in lerouge et al 2020 the pore water chemical model is based on anion leaching cl so4 2 and no3 measurement of exchangeable cations using the method described in hadi et al 2016 the dissolved inorganic carbon dic obtained by core degassing girard et al 2005 lerouge et al 2020 and mineral assemblage lerouge et al 2018 hydrogeochemistry of waters allowed characterizing the hydrochemical facies and mechanisms controlling water chemistry including water rock interactions dilution and evaporation processes cherchali et al 2022 li et al 2013 here we examined more specifically the role of the clay interlayers as cation exchanger according to cloutier et al 2008 the multi isotopic δ13c δd δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c approach was applied on waters to elucidate their origin and their age ferguson et al 2020 sullivan et al 2016 a similar multi isotopic δ13c 18o 87sr 86sr and 14c approach was carried out on carbonate concretions which recorded episods of the high reactivity of tégulines clay at the top of the formation 2 geological setting and field campaign the studied area is located in the area of brienne le chateau and juzanvigny in the eastern part of the paris basin fig 1 a the brienne plain is bounded to the north by the chalky hills of the cenomanian 100 5 ma to 93 9 my from which flows the voire river a tributary of the aube river and to the west and the south by hills carved by the aube river in the tégulines clay of early cretaceous age 145 to 100 5 my voinchet et al 2015 the aube river deposited five stepped fluvial terraces in the alluvial plain of brienne in relation to the major climatic cycles throughout the middle pleistocene 780 000 to 125 000 yr hatrival et menillet 2002 voinchet et al 2015 currently smooth reliefs characterize the area of brienne juzanvigny the distribution of the residual flaps of the five stepped fluvial deposits indicates that the present day aube river flowing in the middle of the plain has flowed far away in the past voinchet et al 2015 the main hydrologic reservoir of the region is a vast cone of sedimentation which filled the aube valley and forms a wide alluvial plain passing between brienne le château and juzanvigny hatrival and menillet 2002 sediments consist of calcarous sands and gravels whose thickness increases from upstream to downstream and are covered by loams the tégulines clay forms the low permeability substratum of this reservoir the aptian greensands underlying tégulines clay and overlying plicatules clay form a captive aquifer hatrival and menillet 2002 the large lakes of the reservoir dams of the paris city seine and aube reservoirs are located in the southeast of the study area fig 14a thirteen 5 m deep pits were dug and five boreholes were drilled in the area of juzanvigny to have a better knowledge of the distribution of the quaternary formations and the weathering profile depths in the tégulines clay in studied area fig 1b pits were dug in october 2017 along two ridgetops dotted red lines and associated hillslopes dotted blue lines on the eastern side of the present day aube river valley fig 1b and 1c eight pits were dug in grasslands green squares two in croplands orange squares and three in forest black squares drainage has been installed in the 1980 s at about 1 m depth in cropland in which the tph1 1 pit and aub230 borehole were drilled during digging some groundwaters flowed in the pits those waters were especially abundant in two pits located at the bottom of the first hillslope tv1 1 and tv1 2 where an alluvium layer released plenty of water which flooded the pits more than a meter high fig 2 two boreholes aub210 aub230 entirely crosscut the three units of the tégulines clay formation an upper carbonate clay rich unit a clay rich unit and a clay quartz rich unit lerouge et al 2018 the aub240 borehole drilled at the north of juzanvigny in may 2018 crosscut several meters of brienne marls before crosscutting 70 m of tégulines clay without reaching the aptian greensands this borehole is considered as the reference borehole for mineralogy physical and chemical properties of tégulines clay due to the overlying brienne marls that protect them from weathering the aub230 borehole drilled in place of the tph1 1 pit on the first ridgetop in december 2017 entirely crosscut 63 m of tégulines clay before attaining greensands at 68 m the aub210 borehole drilled in place of the tph2 1 pit on the second ridgetop in october 2018 crosscut 76 m of tégulines clay before attaining greensands at 84 m the aub260 and aub270 boreholes drilled in october 2018 are two 30 m deep boreholes crosscutting the weathering zone of tégulines clay aub260 is near the tph2 4 pit on the second ridgetop whereas aub270 is near the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope corresponding to the paleo valley of brevonne aube river 3 sampling and methods the soil sediment and rock samples were regularly taken at least every meter in 5 m deep pits in boreholes they were taken every meter down to 15 m then every five meters down to 30 m and every ten meters below 30 m in boreholes fig 4 the samples were rapidly and systematically conditioned on the field to limit the atmospheric contact two types of conditioning were used 1 aluminum bags sealed under vacuum for mineralogy water content chemical and isotopic analyses 2 glass jars under he pressure of 700 mbars for gas monitoring and concentration dic and isotopic composition of co2 dissolved in pore waters groundwaters flowing from the pit wall were directly collected in small vials vials were systematically filled to limit atmospheric contact and maintained at temperature of 4 c two reservoirs and rainfall were also sampled a multidisciplinary approach was applied to water samples and rock samples water analyses included a measure of ph alkalinity major anions and cation concentrations their δ18o and δd and 14c to approximate their age rock characterization included petrology mineral quantification anion leaching cation exchange capacity sample degassing to estimate dic and measurement of 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium calcite concretions were analysed for their δ13c δ18o and 87sr 86sr ratio in order to determine their origin and for 14c in order to estimate their age the details of the collecting procedure sample preservation from oxidation are extensively described in former papers lerouge et al 2018 2020 analytical techniques are given in the supplementary file sd1 4 results 4 1 field observations 4 1 1 hillslopes the two hillslopes correspond from west to east to the present day west facing hillslope of the brevonne river and the old west facing hillslope of the aube brevonne river fig 1c the aube old valley is characterized by near planar slopes that are topographically asymmetric with slightly steeper 4 west facing than east facing 2 hillslopes the east facing hillslopes are mantled with more variable regolith than the west facing hillslopes tégulines clay generally does not directly outcrop observations of the thirteen 5 m deep pits show that tégulines clay are covered by quaternary sediments then 30 cm thick soil fig 2 the thickness of quaternary sediments varies from 1 m up to more than 5 m in the pits tph1 2 tv1 3 tph2 3 and tph2 5 where tegulines clay are not reached fig 2 along both hillslopes quaternary sediments mainly consist of yellowish silty clay loam with a few occurrences of overlying beige sandy loam 1 m thick at the top of the second hillslope pits tph2 1 tph2 4 and tph2 5 fig 2 silty clay loam is relatively sticky and characterized by manganese oxides rich levels present at different depths and by a greyish network particularly developed in the first meters in association with the system of living roots but also dead roots fig 2 the silty clay loam directly overlies tégulines clay except in the tv1 1 and tv1 2 pits in the valley of the brevonne river where a carbonate alluvium layer overlies in place green and slightly decompacted tégulines clay that provides evidence of an erosion phase followed by the alluvium deposit in the valley in the tv1 2 pit the alluvium layer separates a 3 m thick slice of weathered tégulines clay from the in place tégulines clay these two pits provide evidence of an erosion phase followed by the alluvium deposit in the valley and of local sliding of clays along the slope later than carbonate alluvium deposit the top of tégulines clay corresponds to a change of colour from yellow to light green yellow fig 3 b d the presence of calcite further noted calcite transition fig 3g and in some cases to slip surfaces tph1 1 tv1 4 tv4 3 and tv4 1 fig 3c a layer of clay colluvium covers tégulines clay in place in the tph1 1 and tv1 4 pits fig 2 fig 3d yellow tégulines clay corresponds to oxidized facies containing some manganese oxides rich levels fig 3f and iron hydroxides fig 3j the thickness of yellow tégulines clay attains 4 m in the tph2 1 pit at the top of the second hillslope and 1 2 m at the bottom of the two hillslopes tv1 1 and tv4 1 pits calcite is present as secondary cm sized concretions or a thin white calcite layer fig 3 fig 3g i the root network that crosscut quaternary sediments also crosscut tégulines clay down to 5 m depth fig 3e 4 1 2 boreholes the aub240 reference borehole crosscut several meters of alluvium before attaining the brienne marls at 8 4 m and the tégulines clay at 20 m fig 4 tégulines clay crosscut by this borehole is compact and dark green and has a homogeneous aspect the bottom of tégulines clay is not attained in this borehole the aub210 borehole drilled near the tph2 1 pit crosscut 1 m of quartz sandy loam then 7 8 m of yellow silty clay loam before attaining the top of tégulines clay fig 4 very rapidly the tégulines clay changes from ochrous to yellowish greenish colour until 14 m and to greenish grey until 18 m below 18 m clay is compact and dark green the last ten meters are very dark green and richer in glauconite and silty quartz the aub230 drilled near the tph1 1 pit crosscut 30 cm of brown soil 5 m of yellow silty clay loam before attaining the top of tégulines clay marked by plastic texture and ochrous colour fig 4 tégulines clay changes rapidly from ochrous to yellowish greenish colour until 11 m and to greenish grey until 20 25 m below 20 25 m clay is compact and dark green the last few meters are very dark green richer in glauconite and silty quartz the bottom is marked by the presence of phosphates the aub260 borehole drilled near the tph2 4 pit crosscut 30 cm of light brown soil 60 cm of quartz sandy loam then 5 3 m of yellow silty clay loam before attaining the top of tégulines clay fig 4 tegulines clay is ochrous and plastic until 7 8 m and changes

greenish colour at 3 m until 11 m and to greenish grey and rapidly to dark green a small root is observed at 10 8 m between 12 and 30 m tégulines clay is rich in carbonate bioclasts the different zones identified in the weathering profile of the tégulines clay formation crosscut by the different aub210 230 260 and 270 boreholes are almost similar but their thickness varies from one borehole to another fig 4 the yellowish greenish plastic reactive zone characterized by the intense oxidation of pyrite and the presence of iron hydroxides and gypsum is the thickest in aub230 and aub270 boreholes the greenish grey plastic zone is the thickest in the aub230 borehole and is limited to few meters in other boreholes below tégulines clay is compact and seems to be preserved from oxidation 4 2 sediment characterization 4 2 1 surficial formations it was sometimes difficult to make clear limits between yellow silty clay loam colluvium and top of tégulines clay on the field fig 3d the mineralogy of surficial formations and tégulines clay was characterized in details in the tph1 1 pit and associated aub230 borehole yellow silty clay loam of the tph1 1 analysed by xrd consist of 61 70 wt of quartz and 21 32 wt of clay minerals with minor plagioclase k feldspar and rutile the clay fraction characterized by 2 µm xrd consists of kaolinite 31 39 wt smectite rich illite smectite mixed layers 40 51 wt illite mica 18 21 wt and traces of chlorite vermiculite in thin sections quartz essentially occurs as numerous 60 µm detrital grains and coarse grains 100 400 µm fig 4 the amount of coarse quartz grains varies from one pit to another clay mineral fraction occurs as a yellow brownish fine disseminated matrix but also as brownish altered glauconite pellets resulting from tégulines clay and possibly greensands dismantling colluvium is free of coarse quartz grains and is an agglomerate of tégulines clay roundish blocks showing various states of alteration and impregnation by iron hydroxides in all the pits some layers contain mn oxides or are rich in iron hydroxides that are not detected by xrd analyses infrared spectra on all the samples show that carbonates are absent from the surficial formations and revealed only the presence of quartz clays and iron oxyhydroxides such as goethite the carbonate s absence was used as a tracer to determine the depth of the surficial formations the top of the tégulines clay is reached once the carbonates were detected 4 2 2 tégulines clay the top of tégulines clay attained at about 5 m below the ground surface consists of plastic entirely oxidized claystone 57 wt of clay and 42 wt of quartz feldspar with a brown network associated with roots xrd does not detect carbonates but they still occur as rare residual calcite bioclasts gypsum and iron hydroxides entirely replaced pyrite nodules and framboids the clay fraction is highly rich in smectite rich illite smectite mixed layers 77 84 wt with kaolinite 14 wt and minor illite micas 2 3 wt as illustrated in fig 5 below 5 m the xrd quantification allows dividing the clay formation into three parts 1 a carbonate clay rich unit between 5 and 25

25 m until 67 m reduced dark green and compacted tégulines clay are well preserved the diagenetic assemblage includes framboidal pyrite calcite glauconite and francolite carbonates occur as detrital bioclasts including foraminifers bivalves and micrite the largest calcite crystals are present in the carbonate clay rich unit the bottom of the clay formation is characterized by the highest clay content 70 72 wt 27 29 wt of quartz feldspar silty fraction and no carbonate 4 3 cation exchange capacity cec we measured cation exchange capacity on 68 samples from the seven selected pits where tégulines clay was attained at 5 m depth fig 6 supplementary datafile sd2 samples exhibit a large range of cec values between 4 4 and 36 9 meq 100 g fig 6a the highest cec values up to 37 meq 100 g characterize clay rich slide surfaces and associated colluvium in the tph1 1 tv1 4 tv4 3 and tv4 1 pits and surficial formations overlying carbonate alluvium in the tv1 1 pit most clay silty loams have cec 15 16 meq 100 g whitish sandy loam has the lowest cec values down to 2 4 meq 100 g at the top of tégulines clay the cec values are in the range of 18 21 meq 100 g the lowest values of 12 meq 100 g are measured in tégulines clay of the tv4 2 pit although cec values are heterogeneous the cation distribution in the clay exchange sites is almost homogeneous with 80 10 ca2 10 20 mg2 and minor k and na fig 6b cation exchange capacity was measured on 54 samples from the four boreholes where tégulines outcropped or were near surface aub260 aub270 aub210 aub230 fig 6c supplementary datafile sd2 data from the aub1010 borehole drilled during the 2015 campaign were added for comparison the cec values and cation distribution at exchange sites between 4 and 6 m are very similar to those

the top of tégulines clay of the tph1 1 pit is slightly higher due to high no3 concentration 2 mmol l waters of the carpière reservoir and le petit etang reservoir have low tds 300 mg l and are calcic carbonate waters 4 4 2 leaching chloride sulfate and nitrate anion concentrations in pore waters of surficial formations and tégulines clay crosscut in boreholes anion leaching was realized on 144 samples from the 13 pits and 63 core samples from the five boreholes aub210 aub230 aub240 aub260 aub270 the concentrations of leached anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured in leaching of samples with milliq water at three solid water ratios 5 10 and 20 g l they were correlated with solid to liquid ratios suggesting they were not controlled by mineral dissolution precipitation and adsorption mechanisms in that case the anion concentration in the leachate is linearly proportional with the solid water ratio and the linear regression crosscuts zero and can be used to recalculate anion concentration of pore water in the clay sample as follows c i c l e a c h e d i v m ω 1 anionaccessibility where i is the anion species cl so4 2 and no3 c l e a c h e d i is the concentration of the i anion in the leachate v is the volume in l of deionized water m the mass in g of dry powdered clay rock and ω the water content of the rock at saturation in kg water kg drysolid 1 the anion accessibility in tegulines clay was estimated close to 1 in lerouge et al 2018 anion concentrations in pore waters of all the samples are given in the supplementary datafile sd2 data from the aub1010

inorganic carbon dic in pore waters the sample degassing protocol was applied to 94 core samples collected in the five boreholes aub210 aub230 aub240 aub260 aub270 and to 54 samples collected in pits this sampling included only 3 samples of soil 19 samples of quaternary loams and 126 samples of tégulines clay the monitoring of the partial pressure of the co2 gas pco2 was realized for each sample conditioned in a glass jar until a steady state of the pco2 was reached 2 3 months the steady state was not reached in soil the pco2 measured at the end of the monitoring was conversed in mmole of co2 produced per kg of soil a steady state was reached in quaternary loams and tégulines clay the pco2 measured at the end of the monitoring was conversed into a dic concentration given in mmole of co2

from the top of weathered tégulines clay down to 10 12 m and then decreases to become almost constant below 20 25 m mean value 1 1 5 mmol l pw whatever the borehole the δ13cco2 at the top of tégulines is 21 pdb and increases to values up to 10 pdb below 20 25 m fig 8 4 4 4 pore water chemistry modelling we assessed the pore water chemistry in all the tégulines clay samples from the pits and aub240

developed by gaucher et al 2006 2009 to model the pore water chemistry of callovian oxfordian clay and already applied to tégulines clay in lerouge et al 2020 the mineral assemblage was generally calcite goethite gypsum in tégulines clay above 10 12 m and calcite goethite pyrite below pyrite or gypsum were selected based on microscopic observations data are given in supplementary datafile sd2 4 5 isotope geochemistry 4 5 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of pore waters a sample of rainfall surficial waters of the la carpière and le petit etang reservoirs and the 11 groundwaters sampled in pits were analysed for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes supplementary datafile sd2 rainfall has δ18o and δd of 7 6 and 50 8 vs smow surficial waters of the reservoirs show a high 18o and d enrichment with δ18o and δd close to 0 1 and 10 vs smow indicating significant evaporation processes fig 9 a b the δ18o and δd of groundwaters collected in quaternary loams and tégulines clay from 5 m deep pits of the first hillslope are almost homogeneous with values ranging between 7 1 and 6 6 vs smow and between 47 8 and 44 6 vs smow respectively fig 9a b they are slightly isotopically enriched in 18o and d compared to meteoric waters but are however in good agreement with the local and global meteoric water lines kloppmann et al 1998 fig 9c the δ18o and δd of groundwaters collected in quaternary loams and tégulines clay of the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope are significantly enriched in 18o and d compared to meteoric waters with values ranging between 4 9 and 4 2 vs smow and between 38 5 and 34 9 vs smow respectively fig 9c the δ18o and δd of extracted pore waters from tégulines clay of the aub230 borehole ranged between 8 1 and 7 vs smow and between 57 and 50 vs smow respectively fig 9 they are in good agreement with the local meteoric water line fig 9c the pore waters δ18o and δd at the bottom of the formation are close to greensands waters bougligny innocent et al 2021 fig 9c 4 5 2 14c isotopes of groundwaters the 14c activity was measured in groundwaters of the ancient alluvium in the tv1 1 4 8 m and tv1 2 3 m pits and in groundwaters at the top of tégulines clay on the ridge top of the first hillslope tph1 1 5 4 m indicating that they are younger than 50 ky table 2 the δ13c of dic of the three groundwaters are almost similar and 12 pdb the value of the natural environment the 14c activities correspond to young ages of 1420 30 3590 30 and 300 30 years respectively 4 5 3 sr on clay exchanger concentrations and 87sr 86sr the concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium were measured in 35 samples in five pits tph1 1 tph2 4 tv1 4 tv1 1 tv4 1 including 4 soils 19 samples of silty clay loam and 12 samples of tégulines clay at the top of the formation and 21 core samples from the aub230 borehole supplementary datafile sd2 soils are characterized by the lowest concentrations of exchangeable strontium 0 2 12 ppm and by the highest 87sr 86sr ratios of 0 7091 0 7105 the exchangeable strontium concentrations range between 2 5 and 42 ppm in silty clay loam and between 22 and 56 ppm at the top of tégulines clay from pits the 87sr 86sr ratios of exchangeable strontium range between 0 7085 and 0 7108 in silty clay loam and between 0 7079 and 0 7084 at the top of tégulines clay from pits in tégulines clay from the borehole aub230 concentrations of exchangeable strontium range between 259 and 1958 ppm and 87sr 86sr ratios between 0 7074 and 0 7081 the profiles of concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium in function of depth shows a decrease of the concentrations and an increase of 87sr 86sr ratio from the top of tegulines clay toward the surface fig 10 a b 4 5 4 calcite concretions two concretions of calcite sampled in pits tph2 1 at 1 1 m and tv4 1 at 4 2 m were analysed for their δ13c δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c table 2 the δ13c and δ18o of both concretions are very similar 9 pdb and 26 vs smow conversely their 87sr 86sr ratios are different 0 71020 for tph2 1 1 1 m and 0 70783 for tv4 1 4 2 m the 14c activity was measured in both concretions confirming that they are younger than 50 ky the δ13c of calcite aliquot used for the age measurement of the concretion tph2 1 at 1 1 m is in good agreement with the value we measured in our laboratory its 14c activity corresponds to a young age of 8 ky for the concretion tph2 1 at 1 1 m the δ13c of calcite aliquot used for the age measurement of the concretion tv4 1 at 4 2 m is slightly higher than the value we measured at the laboratory indicating it probably contains a contribution of ancient marine carbonate consequently the age of this concretion is probably younger than the age of 37 ky estimated from the 14c activity 5 discussion 5 1 pore water chemistry in the critical zone major ion chemistry of surficial waters and ground water combined with local geology has been widely used to study subsurface hydrogeochemical processes cherchali et al 2022 cloutier et al 2008 gao et al 2019 kumar and james 2016 lakshmanan et al 2003 li et al 2013 sun et al 2021 hereafter surficial waters ground waters and pore waters of surficial formations and tégulines clay of this study as well as available data of pore waters obtained by squeezing of tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 2020 were used to constrain hydrogeochemical processes and water sediment interactions at the scale of the area waters of the reservoirs in the paleo valley and groundwaters collected in pits of the first hillslope and at the bottom of the second hillslope have low ionic strength total dissolved solids tds 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate waters according to the piper s classification fig 11 a their low mg ca ratios significantly lower than 1 their relative high alkalinity and δ13c 12 pdb are characteristic of suboxic groundwaters böhlke and horan 2000 water chemical composition of the carpière reservoir is almost similar to that of groundwaters of the first ridgetop tph1 1 and tph1 2 while water chemical composition of le petit etang reservoir is almost similar to that of the groundwaters of the tv4 1 pit in the paleovalley tégulines clay pore waters squeezing and calculated have chemical compositions and tds different from those of groundwaters they are dominantly ca mg so4 rich according to the piper s classification fig 11b and have significantly higher tds than groundwaters and loam pore waters we reported tégulines clay pore waters in a gibbs diagram to illustrate their high variability of tds 592 6457 mg l and to relate them for determining major processes controlling their chemistry fig 12 a pore waters of unweathered clay crosscut in the aub240 borehole have the lowest tds 627 100 mg l associated with the lowest cl concentrations 1 3 mmol l dic concentrations 1 5 mmol l and so4 2 concentrations 6 5 mmol l pore waters in the lower part of tégulines clay in the boreholes aub210 and aub260 are quite similar to that of the aub240 reference and plot in the domain of water rock interactions of the gibbs diagram for cations and anions fig 12a pore waters of the weathered tégulines clay in the 5 12 m zone including the top of the formation of all the boreholes exhibit larger chemical variations than unweathered clay they have the highest tds 2263 6457 mg l associated with the highest cl concentrations up to 22 mmol l dic concentrations up to 11 6 mmol l and so4 2 concentrations up to 77 mmol l most of these pore waters also plot in the field of water rock interactions excepted pore waters of the aub1010 and aub230 that plot in the field of evaporation processes for anions and out of the field for cations at the top of the tégulines clay in contact with loams chemistry of clay pore waters tends to be richer in ca2 and in dic and is closer to that of loams the weathering intensity and the depth of the weathering profile vary a lot along the two successive hillslopes separated by a small valley that is the paleo valley of the aube la brevonne river fig 13 according to the tds spatial distribution the most intense weathering processes seem to have developed under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley on the ridgetop of the second west facing hillslope aub210 aub260 boreholes the weathering intensity is lower and pore waters are a little modified the increase of the ionic strength is associated with the combined increase of the cl dic and so4 2 concentrations the increase of the cl concentrations is important in the paleo valley between the aub230 and aub1010 boreholes while the dic and so4 2 concentrations increase more homogeneously in the upper part of tégulines clay down to 12 m and independently of the position in the slopes here data provide evidence of a significant increase of cl concentrations in tégulines clay pore waters in the 5 12 m zone of aub1010 borehole aub230 borehole and tph2 4 pit and to a lesser extent in quaternary loam tph1 1 pore waters overlying tégulines clay of the aub230 borehole the cl enrichment affects tégulines clay to a less extend below 12 m down to 20 30 m in the two boreholes and consequently affects quite all the thickness of the clay in the aub1010 borehole because tph1 1 pit and aub230 and aub1010 boreholes were drilled in cropland a contribution of anthropogenic cl coming from fertilizers cannot be ruled out however based on the transport parameters porosity and permeability of surficial formations and tégulines clay andra 2015 diffusion from the surface seems unlikely to explain such high concentrations of chloride down to 20 30 m in the two boreholes the enrichment in cl of pore waters is correlated with high dic and so4 2 measured in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes this general enrichment inducing high tds could be attributed to an evaporation process as shown previously in the gibbs diagram for anions but not for cations evaporation results in an increase of tds concentrations at constant na cl ratios in our case most of the cl rich pore waters in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes show an increase of tds concentrations but have a na cl ratio significantly lower than 1 fig 12b giving evidence of other processes than evaporation evaporation processes strongly suggest an ancient period of warm and dry climate these conditions favour the occurrence of ionic exchange during the recharge of ca2 rich groundwaters in presence of clay minerals with high cation exchange capacities cec and na on their exchange sites cloutier et al 2010 the negative correlation between na cl and ca2 mg2 highlights ion exchange processes fig 12c two types of ion exchange normal and reverse are identified by reporting pore waters in a ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 diagram with a 1 1 mixing line rajmohan and elango 2004 in our case pore waters are on or above the mixing line towards the ca2 mg2 field indicating that reverse ionic exchange processes are dominant fig 12d according to the following reaction na ca mg clay na clay ca2 mg2 the enrichment in sulfates in pore waters of tégulines clay in the weathered zone down to 12 m is consistent with the observation of gypsum and iron hydroxides ferrihydrite goethite in replacement of early pyrite lerouge et al 2018 the formation of such phases with higher molar volume ferrihydrite 34 36 cm3 mol 1 blanc et al 2012 goethite 20 82 cm3 mol 1 gypsum than pyrite 23 94 cm3 mol 1 and containing variable amounts of water induces 1 a volume expansion that can contribute to the increase of porosity gu et al 2020 but also 2 a higher sensitivity to hydrometric conditions that can significantly modify mechanical properties such as plasticity lerouge et al 2018 the increase of porosity and changes in mechanical properties induced by the oxidation of pyrite are two major factors influencing water and gas diffusion rates through the critical zone 5 2 natural isotopic tracers 5 2 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of waters the tégulines clay pore waters below 6 m lie next to the lmwl and gmwl local and global meteoric water lines kloppmann et al 1998 indicating that meteoric waters have diffused through the clay formation during post depositional history and replaced original connate seawater fig 9b the δ18o andδdofpore waters of tégulinesclay below 6 m are almost similar to present day local meteoric waters the δ18o andδd of pore waters at the bottom of the clay formation are similar to those of the greensands aquifer above 5 6 m theδ18o andδdofgroundwatersand tégulines clay pore waters in the 5 m deep pits of the first hillslope and in the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope show an 18o and d enrichment groundwaters of the first hillslope are near the lmwl while groundwaters of the tv4 1 pit plot along a line with a slope of 5 87 between rainfall on the lmwl and the reservoirs of la carpière and le petit etang indicating that groundwaters and reservoirs are affected by evaporation processes groundwaters of the first hillslope are slightly enriched in 18o and d probably due to regular recharge by meteoric waters 5 2 2 strontium isotopes of exchangeable strontium strontium isotopes when coupled with sr concentrations are a good monitor of geochemical processes in natural clayey formations lerouge et al 2010 and are also used to investigate the mixing of different groundwaters négrel et al 2001 sullivan et al 2016 demonterova et al 2022 the 87sr 86sr of exchangeable strontium is representative of strontium in present day pore waters of clay rich formations lerouge et al 2010 in unweathered and slightly weathered tégulines clay from boreholes aub1010 and aub230 below 12 m 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium ranges between 0 7074 and 0 7075 with a mean value of 0 707438 0 000034 this range of values is consistent with the lower cretaceous seawater jones and jenkyns 2001 suggesting a limited diffusion of sr since the formation deposition in weathered tégulines clay 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium slightly increases from 0 7075 to 0 7084 at the top of the formation the 87sr 86sr ratios of exchangeable strontium of overlying silty clay loam are 0 7085 0 7109 the decreasing of strontium content on the exchangeable fraction at the top of tégulines clay coupled with the increasing 87sr 86sr ratio suggests a slight dilution of téguline clay pore waters by groundwaters of overlying silty clay loam 5 2 3 dic δ13c of dic and carbonates and 14c activity the chemical contrast between groundwaters and pore waters in silty clay loam which are diluted waters and tégulines pore waters indicate that dic concentrations at the top of the tégulines clay down to 10 12 m are not due to diffusion of surficial pore waters into the clays the dic increases rapidly up to 10 mmol l from the top of weathered tégulines clay down to 10 12 m and then decreases to become almost constant below 20 m 1 1 5 mmol l pw whatever the borehole the δ13cco2 at the top of tégulines is 21 pdb and increases to values of 10 pdb at 15 20 m fig 8 the highest values are consistent with δ13cco2 calculated at equilibrium with calcite δ13cco2 calcite 10 pdb lerouge et al 2020 the large δ13cco2 range 19 8 to 10 5 of the weathered tégulines clay indicates a mixed origin of co2 component internally controlled by the equilibrium between pore waters and calcite δ13cco2 calcite 10 pdb and co2 release by the degradation of organic matter δ13cco2 organic matter 29 pdb we estimate the contributions in of the organic matter degradation xorganic matter and co2 due to calcite equilibrium xcalcite to dic and the corresponding concentrations nco2 om and nco2 cc given in mmol l for each δ13cco2 of clay sample fig 8 the data give evidence of a co2 peak due to organic matter at the top of the clay and a co2 peak due to calcite equilibrium in the 5 12 m zone this latter is significantly higher than dic in unweathered tégulines clay in agreement with the dissolution of marine carbonates and more specifically carbonate bioclasts in highly reactive tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 it is noteworthy that in most of the pits where the loam clay boundary is accessible secondary carbonates rapidly precipitated as a fine calcite layer close to the boundary when the contact is stable and as concretions in tégulines clay when a slide plan separates clay from the surficial formation rare secondary carbonates also precipitated in cracks affecting loam at the ridgetop of the secondary hillslope tph2 1 aub210 the position of the secondary carbonates probably informs on the water table limit the morphology of calcite precipitates rather depends on the sedimentary rock texture a fine layer of calcite homogeneously precipitated in microporosity of top of the tégulines clay when rock microstructures were modified a few and rock was weathered a few concretions and precipitations in cracks precipitated in sedimentary rocks when rock texture was highly modified by weathering and dessication in unsaturated zone the δ13c and δ18o of the concretions at the top tph2 1 and the bottom tv4 1 of the second hillslope allowed calculating δ13c and δ18o of fluid from which they precipitated using the carbon and oxygen isotopic fractionations between calcite and water at 20 c respectively 2 deines et al 1974 and 29 1 kim and o neil 1997 the δ13cfluid value of 11 5 pdb the δ18ofluid value of 3 vs smow and 87sr 86sr ratios of the concretions show that secondary calcite concretions are isotopically at equilibrium with groundwaters that were affected by an intense evaporating process the 14c activity of both concretions confirms their old ages the oldest one at 34 ky in the tph2 1 pit at the ridgetop of the second hillslope and a younger age of 8 ky in the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the hillslope even though high dic are well correlated in depth with quite a recent mineral reactivity and organic matter om degradation previous dic profile chemical modelling using phreeqc program needed to take into account evaporation processes in association with mineral and om reactivity to explain the high dic values measured in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes lerouge et al 2020 5 3 nitrates as tracer of anthropic activity natural nitrate concentrations in surficial and groundwaters are estimated to 5 to 15 mg l 0 08 0 24 mmol l brenot et al 2008 the use of nitrogen fertilizers has significantly increased the diffuse nitrate loading of surface waters and groundwaters in agricultural areas the regulatory limit for nitrate in drinking wateris 10 mg l as nitrate nitrogen no3 n2 and is approximately equivalent to the world health organization who guideline of 50 mg l 0 8 mmol l as no3 ward et al 2018 nitrate concentrations in all the tégulines clay pore waters from boreholes are low and in the range of natural waters nitrate concentrations in loams overlying tégulines clay vary from site to site significant high values up to 18 mmol l pw are measured by leaching of soil samples of pits tph1 1 tv1 1 and tv4 1 dug in cropland in october 2017 while in other pits dug in grassland values rarely exceed the regulatory limit for nitrate in drinking water supplementary figure sd3 nitrate concentrations rapidly decrease below the regulatory limit at 1 1 3 m in the three pits dug in cropland the decrease is faster in the tph1 1 and tv4 1 than in the tv1 1 pit which is the present day brevonne aube valley the 1 1 3 m depth corresponds to the depth of the drainage system that was installed in the 1980 s and probably helps nitrates to migrate to the discharge zone it is noteworthy that concentrations measured in waters extracted by squeezing of core samples in december 2017 are lower than that obtained by leaching of equivalent samples dug in the tph1 1 pit in october 2017 probably suggesting the contribution of a soluble nitrate form during leaching nitrate can act as an oxidant only if microorganisms are present bosh et al 2012 in the system that is likely at a shallow depth where it reaches a maximum of 1 70 m and is barely detectable below 2 40 m then oxygen is the more abundant oxidant and reaches its maximum at 5 m and is still present at 10 m lerouge et al 2020 the weathering is thus rate limited by oxygen especially at the hilltop and to a lesser extent in the valley where the nitrate concentration can be much more important 17 mmol l at 5 m in aub1010 but not present anymore at 10 m 5 4 weathering profile and hydrology in the studied area the studied area is very close and upstream of the hydrological chalk watershed extending from the reservoir s dams to pont sur seine of the seine aube confluence fig 14a bendjoudi et al 2002 combining fieldwork with petrological and geochemical data allows a better understanding the current hydrological system functioning at the scale of the studied area the variations of present day topography and slope angle influence the water flow direction and flow accumulation and allow defining the recharge and discharge zones the present day topography and the hydrographic network result from the successive river banks developed later than the oligocene eocene erosion surface and associated with major climatic cycles during quaternary the age of the lowest fluvial terrace fya above the aube major bed on the east of the studied area is 300 165 ky voinchet et al 2015 the pit digging campaign in october 2017 provided evidence of groundwaters in 5 m deep pits between the bottom of the second hillslope and the bottom of the first hillslope near the brevonne river the 14c ages of three groundwaters tph1 1 tv1 1 tv1 2 are lower than 10 kyrs and consequently younger than the last ice age the shallow groundwaters at the first ridgetop tph1 1 5 4 m correspond to a temporary perched water table that is favoured by the increase of the clay content and particularly of smectite in the succession of quaternary clay loams and colluvium overlying tégulines clay as observed in the tph1 1 pit aub230 borehole fig 14 b their youngest age of 300 years indicates that the ridgetop constitutes a current zone of recharge rainfalls falling on this relief infiltrate quaternary loams and laterally flow for one part along the first west facing hillslope of the present day brevonne valley and another part along the east facing hillslope of the brévonne aube paleo valley teles et al 2004 voinchet et al 2015 the steeper west facing slope promotes landslide by gravity tv1 1 tv1 2 drainage and runoff of waters towards the brevonne valley which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain and at a larger scale to the seine aube confluence fig 14a the groundwaters of the tv1 2 and tv1 1 pits were collected in carbonate alluvium corresponding probably to the ancient aube fya fluvial terrace observed at the east 165 300 kyrs voinchet et al 2015 their δ13c δ18o and δd are similar to that of groundwaters of the ridgetop suggesting that all the waters have the same origin have evolved in the same environment and are isotopically equilibrated with the carbon system the groundwater δ18o and δd are slightly enriched compared to meteoric waters corresponding to 5 10 of evaporation however they are chemically different and older groundwaters of the recharge zone are more diluted and less calcic than that of the slope and that of the discharge zone strongly suggesting water sediment interactions toward the discharge zone in that case we cannot neglect the possibility of contamination of ancient carbon source 14c free increasing 14c age the almost flat morphology of the east facing slope and the bottom of the west facing slope of the brevonne aube paleo valley is more likely to collect stagnant waters that can invade the loamy horizon of the paleo valley during wet periods the presence of small reservoirs such as the la carpière and of le petit etang reservoirs and the installation of drainage in the cropland on the east facing slope is consistent with wetlands the paleo valley has an altitude slightly higher than the current aube brevonne valley and is connected to the voire valley at the north and the brevonne valley at the south it does not belong to the current aube alluvium plain however its position at the confluence of the two rivers is included in the aube widespread floodplain invaded during exceptional raining events as attest by the deposits of quaternary loams on the ridgetops as well as silty loams of the studied area the δ18o and δd of reservoirs natural or created for drainage with values evolving to seawater signature during the dry period summer are significantly enriched compared to meteoric waters indicating important evaporation processes the groundwater δ18o and δd collected in the paleo valley are probably a mixing between these evaporated waters waters of the recharge zones and runoff waters during wet seasons autumn to spring all these data rather suggest that the paleo valleys of the area represent large intermediate discharge zones between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain 6 conclusions a field campaign including twelve 5 m deep pits and five deep 30 90 m boreholes was conducted in the area of brienne le chateau at the east of the aube alluvium plain france the pit digging campaign along two stepped west facing hillslopes along the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley showed that thin quaternary clay silty and carbonate free loams cover tégulines clay in all the area their thickness varies between 1 2 m on the upper part of the hillslopes to 5 10 m on the top of the two east facing hillslopes landslides of clay loams and tégulines clay displaced downslope one meter thick layer of chalky gravel covers tégulines clay in the valley of the brevonne river the pit digging also allowed collecting groundwaters in 5 m deep pits between the bottom of the second hillslope and the bottom of the first hillslope near the brevonne river groundwaters have low tds concentrations 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate water type the distribution of groundwaters and their 14c ages provided evidence of a current zone of recharge and temporary perched water table at the first ridgetop and recent lateral groundwater transfers and runoff of waters along the first west facing steep slope toward the brevonne river which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain the perched water table is favoured by the increase of the clay and smectite contents in the quaternary clay loams and colluvium overlying tégulines clay groundwaters of the recharge zone are more diluted and less calcic than that of the slope and that of the discharge zone strongly suggesting water sediment interactions toward the discharge zone combined petrological and geochemical studies of tégulines clay from deep boreholes showed that the weathering intensity and the depth of the weathering profile vary a lot along the two successive hillslopes highlighting the need to acquire data at the watershed scale to be able to understand its 3d functioning the pore water chemistry of tégulines clay differs from that of groundwaters they are ca2 mg2 so4 2 rich water type and show a large range of tds concentrations 592 6457 mg l the highest values are measured in the most intensely weathered clays that developed in the first 10 15 m under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley on the ridgetop of the second west facing hillslope the weathering intensity is low and pore waters are little modified the aube brevonne paleo valley could represent a large intermediate discharge zone between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain included in the aube widespread floodplain and invaded during exceptional raining events the high ionic strengths combined with high δ18o and δd water values measured in tegulines clay pore waters of this paleo valley suggest ancient important evaporation processes associated with a cation exchange from the clay exchange sites finally the data obtained in the present study enable us to understand the flow paths of the studied watershed which is closely linked to the mineralogical transformation this helped to get a comprehensive description of the major processes that will govern that watershed functioning declaration of competing interest the

2280,water transfers and processes governing the chemistry of groundwaters and clay pore waters were investigated in the critical zone developed in tégulines clay in the area of brienne le chateau at east of the aube alluvium plain france a pit digging campaign along two stepped west facing hillslopes along the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley gives evidence of a thin quaternary clay silty and carbonate free loams overlying tégulines clay mobile regolith along the slopes and the presence of a carbonate alluvium layer in pits of the brevonne valley groundwaters at the first ridgetop attest of a temporary perched water table while groundwaters at top of tégulines clay along the first west facing steep slope toward the brevonne river provide evidence of lateral groundwater transfers and runoff of waters toward the valley which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain groundwaters have low concentrations of total dissolved solids tds 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate waters their δ18o and δd of groundwaters are consistent with local meteoric values an 18o and d enrichment in groundwaters at the bottom of the second hillslope and in waters from reservoirs indicates evaporation processes the δ13cco2 of dissolved inorganic carbone in groundwaters is essentially due to degradation of organic matter the composition of the pore waters from tégulines clay in boreholes are chemically heterogeneous and different from groundwaters they are ca mg so4 rich and show a large range of tds concentrations 592 6457 mg l the highest values are measured in the most intensely weathered clay developed in the first 10 15 m under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley this latter seems to represent a large intermediate discharge zone between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain the δ18o and δd of pore waters are alined along the local meteoric water line indicating that meteoric waters have diffused through the clay formation during post depositional history and replaced original connate seawater on contrary the 87sr 86sr ratios of pore waters remain almost similar to that of lower cretaceous seawater suggesting a limited diffusion of sr since the formation deposition toward the top of the formation in the aube brevonne paleovalley major cation and anion concentrations 18o and d enrichment and a slight increase of the 87sr 86sr ratios suggest the diffusion of evaporated waters the δ13c δ18o 87sr 86sr ratios and 14c activity of concretions at top of tégulines clay show that they precipitated from evaporated old groundwaters the oldest one at 34 ky in the tph2 1 pit at the ridgetop of the second hillslope and a younger age of 8 ky in the tv4 1 pit keywords tégulines clay critical zone landscape water transfer hydrogeochemistry multi isotopic approach data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the understanding of solute transport in critical zone cz developed in clay formation is an issue of primary importance both for the preservation of our natural environment and more specifically for long term assessment of the efficiency of the sub surface geological waste repository clay formations effectively act as a natural low permeability protective barrier preventing contamination of groundwater resources due to extremely long time scales for groundwater flow and solute transport and to the capacity of clay minerals to fix cationic and oxyanionic toxic chemicals debure et al 2018 2020 desaulniers et al 1981 gaucher et al 2006 hendry et al 2004 hendry and wassenaar 2000 mazurek et al 2011 mazurek et al 2009 remenda et al 1994 the study of the critical zone requires specific investigations of earth surface processes and water and solute transfers crossing time scales from geological times to anthropic time to cross such scales need to analyse present day waters and the records of the water fluxes in the geologic media e g soils and sediments with time interactions in cz between the marine reduced clay formation and surficial reservoirs including the atmosphere that is an infinite oxygen reservoir the hydrosphere and vegetation induce mineral chemical petrophysical and mechanical changes in the clay formation that influence pore water chemistry and solute transfers bolton et al 2006 brantley et al 2013 hendry and wassenaar 2000 jin and brantley 2011 jin et al 2013 jin et al 2010 lerouge et al 2018 sullivan et al 2016 tremosa et al 2020 tuttle and breit 2009 tuttle et al 2009 the reaction rates in the cz are the highest in the vadose zone and especially in the zone where the water table varies indeed the water slows the o2 migration rate since the diffusion of gases is faster in the air than in water in this zone complex and overlapping biogeochemical reactions occur that require reactive transport modelling to be deconvoluted and reconciled li et al 2017 macquarrie and mayer 2005 discrepancies are frequently observed when trying to extrapolate laboratory data used for modelling at the field scale tremosa et al 2020 maher et al 2006 pacheco and alencoão 2006 often either field data used as input of the models are acquired in constrained environments or modelling of the field is restricted to some specific area of interest bao et al 2017 milesi et al 2020 li et al 2013 such models remain often one dimensional models conceptual models or focus only on a little part of the investigated watershed one borehole or several trenches of a few dozen of centimetres or on the major biogeochemical reactions bao et al 2017 milesi et al 2020 li et al 2013 arizaleta 2020 mayer et al 2015 an important aspect of assessing the long term efficiency of the near surface repository is developing a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeochemical functioning of the entire targeted area in the watershed in order to define initial conditions of the disposal and to predict water flows for this reason it remains essential to obtain the most complete dataset mineralogy geochemistry petrophysical properties and hydrogeology for a decade tégulines clay a low permeability clay formation outcropping in the area of brienne le chateau north eastern france has been investigated in the context of surface repository for low level radioactive waste by andra the french national radioactive waste management agency a multi disciplinary approach has been applied to core samples from boreholes of three successive drilling campaigns through the clay formation to define the depth of the critical zone and the key parameters controlling chemistry of tégulines clay pore waters a detailed petrological study based on major iron bearing redox sensitive minerals feii pyrite siderite ankerite clay minerals and on the valence of iron combined with the petrophysical properties allowed defining the depth of the cz in the aub1010 borehole and proposing a first sketch model of the redox changes in the tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 oxidation in tégulines clay is characterized more by progressive reactions than by a sharp redox reaction front the oxidation reactions extend down to 20 m depth corresponding to the transition between a nonplastic to a plastic rock and the oxidation of diagenetic glauconite pellets a complementary gas monitoring co2 o2 n2 alkanes on core samples of tégulines clay from aub1010 aub230 and aub240 boreholes and carbon isotopes on co2 allowed defining the consequences of weathering processes on gases dissolved in pore waters lerouge et al 2020 the dataset showed that the first 10 12 m zone of tégulines clay corresponds to a highly reactive clay influenced essentially by pyrite oxidation calcite dissolution and degradation of organic matter and formation of iron hydroxides le meur et al 2021 the δ13c of co2 indicates that organic matter degradation was a major source of co2 at shallow depths and down to 10 12 m which is the maximum depth at which we observed fossil roots all these data constituted a first set of parameters for the building of a 1d vertical solute reactive transport modelling through the tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 2020 however hydrogeochemical processes remain poorly constrained in the studied area the main objectives of this work were to further investigate hydrogeochemical processes of cz developed in tégulines clay in the studied area based on hydrogeochemistry combined with a multi isotopic approach δ13c δd δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c such approach has been developed at susquehanna shale hills cz observatory sullivan et al 2016 and references therein the new field campaign at east of brienne le chateau and juzanvigny included boreholes and pits dug along two stepped west facing hillslopes corresponding to the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley on the eastern side of the aube alluvium plain the campaign of pit digging aimed at examining the conversion of tégulines clay into regolith and overlying sediments and soils the root network downslope transport of mobile regolith and at sampling waters rainfall surficial reservoirs and groundwaters additional deep boreholes 30 to 90 m allowed sampling tégulines clay through the cz and below in order to 1 define the variability of depth of the weathering profile in the studied area and 2 obtain tégulines clay pore waters for hydrochemistry chemical analyses of pore waters in claystones is challenging it can be obtained either by squeezing of samples fernández et al 2014 or by chemical pore water modelling using phreeqc gaucher et al 2009 wersin et al 2016 first chemical analyses of tégulines clay pore waters by squeezing are available in lerouge et al 2018 2020 in this paper we completed the dataset by pore water chemical data calculated with the phreeqc model of gaucher et al 2009 and already developed for tégulines clay in lerouge et al 2020 the pore water chemical model is based on anion leaching cl so4 2 and no3 measurement of exchangeable cations using the method described in hadi et al 2016 the dissolved inorganic carbon dic obtained by core degassing girard et al 2005 lerouge et al 2020 and mineral assemblage lerouge et al 2018 hydrogeochemistry of waters allowed characterizing the hydrochemical facies and mechanisms controlling water chemistry including water rock interactions dilution and evaporation processes cherchali et al 2022 li et al 2013 here we examined more specifically the role of the clay interlayers as cation exchanger according to cloutier et al 2008 the multi isotopic δ13c δd δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c approach was applied on waters to elucidate their origin and their age ferguson et al 2020 sullivan et al 2016 a similar multi isotopic δ13c 18o 87sr 86sr and 14c approach was carried out on carbonate concretions which recorded episods of the high reactivity of tégulines clay at the top of the formation 2 geological setting and field campaign the studied area is located in the area of brienne le chateau and juzanvigny in the eastern part of the paris basin fig 1 a the brienne plain is bounded to the north by the chalky hills of the cenomanian 100 5 ma to 93 9 my from which flows the voire river a tributary of the aube river and to the west and the south by hills carved by the aube river in the tégulines clay of early cretaceous age 145 to 100 5 my voinchet et al 2015 the aube river deposited five stepped fluvial terraces in the alluvial plain of brienne in relation to the major climatic cycles throughout the middle pleistocene 780 000 to 125 000 yr hatrival et menillet 2002 voinchet et al 2015 currently smooth reliefs characterize the area of brienne juzanvigny the distribution of the residual flaps of the five stepped fluvial deposits indicates that the present day aube river flowing in the middle of the plain has flowed far away in the past voinchet et al 2015 the main hydrologic reservoir of the region is a vast cone of sedimentation which filled the aube valley and forms a wide alluvial plain passing between brienne le château and juzanvigny hatrival and menillet 2002 sediments consist of calcarous sands and gravels whose thickness increases from upstream to downstream and are covered by loams the tégulines clay forms the low permeability substratum of this reservoir the aptian greensands underlying tégulines clay and overlying plicatules clay form a captive aquifer hatrival and menillet 2002 the large lakes of the reservoir dams of the paris city seine and aube reservoirs are located in the southeast of the study area fig 14a thirteen 5 m deep pits were dug and five boreholes were drilled in the area of juzanvigny to have a better knowledge of the distribution of the quaternary formations and the weathering profile depths in the tégulines clay in studied area fig 1b pits were dug in october 2017 along two ridgetops dotted red lines and associated hillslopes dotted blue lines on the eastern side of the present day aube river valley fig 1b and 1c eight pits were dug in grasslands green squares two in croplands orange squares and three in forest black squares drainage has been installed in the 1980 s at about 1 m depth in cropland in which the tph1 1 pit and aub230 borehole were drilled during digging some groundwaters flowed in the pits those waters were especially abundant in two pits located at the bottom of the first hillslope tv1 1 and tv1 2 where an alluvium layer released plenty of water which flooded the pits more than a meter high fig 2 two boreholes aub210 aub230 entirely crosscut the three units of the tégulines clay formation an upper carbonate clay rich unit a clay rich unit and a clay quartz rich unit lerouge et al 2018 the aub240 borehole drilled at the north of juzanvigny in may 2018 crosscut several meters of brienne marls before crosscutting 70 m of tégulines clay without reaching the aptian greensands this borehole is considered as the reference borehole for mineralogy physical and chemical properties of tégulines clay due to the overlying brienne marls that protect them from weathering the aub230 borehole drilled in place of the tph1 1 pit on the first ridgetop in december 2017 entirely crosscut 63 m of tégulines clay before attaining greensands at 68 m the aub210 borehole drilled in place of the tph2 1 pit on the second ridgetop in october 2018 crosscut 76 m of tégulines clay before attaining greensands at 84 m the aub260 and aub270 boreholes drilled in october 2018 are two 30 m deep boreholes crosscutting the weathering zone of tégulines clay aub260 is near the tph2 4 pit on the second ridgetop whereas aub270 is near the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope corresponding to the paleo valley of brevonne aube river 3 sampling and methods the soil sediment and rock samples were regularly taken at least every meter in 5 m deep pits in boreholes they were taken every meter down to 15 m then every five meters down to 30 m and every ten meters below 30 m in boreholes fig 4 the samples were rapidly and systematically conditioned on the field to limit the atmospheric contact two types of conditioning were used 1 aluminum bags sealed under vacuum for mineralogy water content chemical and isotopic analyses 2 glass jars under he pressure of 700 mbars for gas monitoring and concentration dic and isotopic composition of co2 dissolved in pore waters groundwaters flowing from the pit wall were directly collected in small vials vials were systematically filled to limit atmospheric contact and maintained at temperature of 4 c two reservoirs and rainfall were also sampled a multidisciplinary approach was applied to water samples and rock samples water

impregnation by iron hydroxides in all the pits some layers contain mn oxides or are rich in iron hydroxides that are not detected by xrd analyses infrared spectra on all the samples show that carbonates are absent from the surficial formations and revealed only the presence of quartz clays and iron oxyhydroxides such as goethite the carbonate s absence was used as a tracer to determine the depth of the surficial formations the top of the tégulines clay is reached once the carbonates were detected 4 2 2 tégulines clay the top of tégulines clay attained at about 5 m below the ground

pits were analysed for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes supplementary datafile sd2 rainfall has δ18o and δd of 7 6 and 50 8 vs smow surficial waters of the reservoirs show a high 18o and d enrichment with δ18o and δd close to 0 1 and 10 vs smow indicating significant evaporation processes fig 9 a b the δ18o and δd of groundwaters collected in quaternary loams and tégulines clay from 5 m deep pits of the first hillslope are almost homogeneous with values ranging between 7 1 and 6 6 vs smow and between 47 8 and 44 6 vs smow respectively fig 9a b they are slightly isotopically enriched in 18o and d compared to meteoric waters but are however in good agreement with the local and global meteoric water lines kloppmann et al 1998 fig 9c the δ18o and δd of groundwaters collected in quaternary loams and tégulines clay of the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope are significantly enriched in 18o and d compared to meteoric waters with values ranging between 4 9 and 4 2 vs smow and between 38 5 and 34 9 vs smow respectively fig 9c the δ18o and δd of extracted pore waters from tégulines clay of the aub230 borehole ranged between 8 1 and 7 vs smow and between 57 and 50 vs smow respectively fig 9 they are in good agreement with the local meteoric water line fig 9c the pore waters δ18o and δd at the bottom of the formation are close to greensands waters bougligny innocent et al 2021 fig 9c 4 5 2 14c isotopes of groundwaters the 14c activity was measured in groundwaters of the ancient alluvium in the tv1 1 4 8 m and tv1 2 3 m pits and in groundwaters at the top of tégulines clay on the ridge top of the first hillslope tph1 1 5 4 m indicating that they are younger than 50 ky table 2 the δ13c of dic of the three groundwaters are almost similar and 12 pdb the

and 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium were measured in 35 samples in five pits tph1 1 tph2 4 tv1 4 tv1 1 tv4 1 including 4 soils 19 samples of silty clay loam and 12 samples of tégulines clay at the top of the formation and 21 core samples from the aub230 borehole supplementary datafile sd2 soils are characterized by the lowest concentrations of exchangeable strontium 0 2 12 ppm and by the highest 87sr 86sr ratios of 0 7091 0 7105 the exchangeable strontium concentrations range between 2 5 and 42 ppm in silty clay loam and between 22 and 56 ppm at the top of tégulines clay from pits the 87sr 86sr ratios of exchangeable strontium range between 0 7085 and 0 7108 in silty clay loam and between 0 7079 and 0 7084 at the top of tégulines clay from pits in tégulines clay from the borehole aub230 concentrations of exchangeable strontium range between 259 and 1958 ppm and 87sr 86sr ratios between 0 7074 and 0 7081 the profiles of concentration and 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium in function of depth shows a decrease of the concentrations and an increase of 87sr 86sr ratio from the top of tegulines clay toward the surface fig 10 a b 4 5 4 calcite concretions two concretions of calcite sampled in pits tph2 1 at 1 1 m and tv4 1 at 4 2 m were analysed for their δ13c δ18o 87sr 86sr and 14c table 2 the δ13c and δ18o of both concretions are very similar 9 pdb and 26 vs smow conversely their 87sr 86sr ratios are different 0 71020 for tph2 1 1 1 m and 0 70783 for tv4 1 4 2 m the 14c activity was measured in both concretions confirming that they are younger than 50 ky the δ13c of calcite aliquot used for the age measurement of the concretion tph2 1 at 1 1 m is in good agreement with the value we measured in our laboratory its 14c activity corresponds to a young age of 8 ky for the concretion tph2 1 at 1 1 m the δ13c of calcite aliquot used for the age measurement of the concretion tv4 1 at 4 2 m is slightly higher than the value we measured at the laboratory indicating it probably contains a contribution of ancient marine carbonate consequently the age of this concretion is probably younger than the age of 37 ky estimated from the 14c activity 5 discussion 5 1 pore water chemistry in the critical zone major ion chemistry of surficial waters and ground water combined with local geology has been widely used to study subsurface hydrogeochemical processes cherchali et al 2022 cloutier et al 2008 gao et al 2019 kumar and james 2016 lakshmanan et al 2003 li et al 2013 sun et al 2021 hereafter surficial waters ground waters and pore waters of surficial formations and tégulines clay of this study as well as available data of pore waters obtained by squeezing of tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 2020 were used to constrain hydrogeochemical processes and water sediment interactions at the scale of the area waters of the reservoirs in the paleo valley and groundwaters collected in pits of the first hillslope and at the bottom of the second hillslope have low ionic strength total dissolved solids tds 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate waters according to the piper s classification fig 11 a their low mg ca ratios significantly lower than 1 their relative high alkalinity and δ13c 12 pdb are characteristic of suboxic groundwaters böhlke and horan 2000 water chemical composition of the carpière reservoir is almost similar to that of groundwaters of the first ridgetop tph1 1 and tph1 2 while water chemical composition of le petit etang reservoir is almost similar to that of the groundwaters of the tv4 1 pit in the paleovalley tégulines clay pore waters squeezing and calculated have chemical compositions and tds different from those of groundwaters they are dominantly ca mg so4 rich according to the piper s classification fig 11b and have significantly higher tds than groundwaters and loam pore waters we reported tégulines clay pore waters in a gibbs diagram to illustrate their high variability of tds 592 6457 mg l and to relate them for determining major processes controlling their chemistry fig 12 a pore waters of unweathered clay crosscut in the aub240 borehole have the lowest tds 627 100 mg l associated with the lowest cl concentrations 1 3 mmol l dic concentrations 1 5 mmol l and so4 2 concentrations 6 5 mmol l pore waters in the lower part of tégulines clay in the boreholes aub210 and aub260 are quite similar to that of the aub240 reference and plot in the domain of water rock interactions of the gibbs diagram for cations and anions fig 12a pore waters of the weathered tégulines clay in the 5 12 m zone including the top of the formation of all the boreholes exhibit larger chemical variations than unweathered clay they have the highest tds 2263 6457 mg l associated with the highest cl concentrations up to 22 mmol l dic concentrations up to 11 6 mmol l and so4 2 concentrations up to 77 mmol l most of these pore waters also plot in the field of water rock interactions excepted pore waters of the aub1010 and aub230 that plot in the field of evaporation processes for anions and out of the field for cations at the top of the tégulines clay in contact with loams chemistry of clay pore waters tends to be richer in ca2 and in dic and is closer to that of loams the weathering intensity and the depth of the weathering profile vary a lot along the two successive hillslopes separated by a small valley that is the paleo valley of the aube la brevonne river fig 13 according to the tds spatial distribution the most intense weathering processes seem to have developed under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley on the ridgetop of the second west facing hillslope aub210 aub260 boreholes the weathering intensity is lower and pore waters are a little modified the increase of the ionic strength is associated with the combined increase of the cl dic and so4 2 concentrations the increase of the cl concentrations is important in the paleo valley between the aub230 and aub1010 boreholes while the dic and so4 2 concentrations increase more homogeneously in the upper part of tégulines clay down to 12 m and independently of the position in the slopes here data provide evidence of a significant increase of cl concentrations in tégulines clay pore waters in the 5 12 m zone of aub1010 borehole aub230 borehole and tph2 4 pit and to a lesser extent in quaternary loam tph1 1 pore waters overlying tégulines clay of the aub230 borehole the cl enrichment affects tégulines clay to a less extend below 12 m down to 20 30 m in the two boreholes and consequently affects quite all the thickness of the clay in the aub1010 borehole because tph1 1 pit and aub230 and aub1010 boreholes were drilled in cropland a contribution of anthropogenic cl coming from fertilizers cannot be ruled out however based on the transport parameters porosity and permeability of surficial formations and tégulines clay andra 2015 diffusion from the surface seems unlikely to explain such high concentrations of chloride down to 20 30 m in the two boreholes the enrichment in cl of pore waters is correlated with high dic and so4 2 measured in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes this general enrichment inducing high tds could be attributed to an evaporation process as shown previously in the gibbs diagram for anions but not for cations evaporation results in an increase of tds concentrations at constant na cl ratios in our case most of the cl rich pore waters in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes show an increase of tds concentrations but have a na cl ratio significantly lower than 1 fig 12b giving evidence of other processes than evaporation evaporation processes strongly suggest an ancient period of warm and dry climate these conditions favour the occurrence of ionic exchange during the recharge of ca2 rich groundwaters in presence of clay minerals with high cation exchange capacities cec and na on their exchange sites cloutier et al 2010 the negative correlation between na cl and ca2 mg2 highlights ion exchange processes fig 12c two types of ion exchange normal and reverse are identified by reporting pore waters in a ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 diagram with a 1 1 mixing line rajmohan and elango 2004 in our case pore waters are on or above the mixing line towards the ca2 mg2 field indicating that reverse ionic exchange processes are dominant fig 12d according to the following reaction na ca mg clay na clay ca2 mg2 the enrichment in sulfates in pore waters of tégulines clay in the weathered zone down to 12 m is consistent with the observation of gypsum and iron hydroxides ferrihydrite goethite in replacement of early pyrite lerouge et al 2018 the formation of such phases with higher molar volume ferrihydrite 34 36 cm3 mol 1 blanc et al 2012 goethite 20 82 cm3 mol 1 gypsum than pyrite 23 94 cm3 mol 1 and containing variable amounts of water induces 1 a volume expansion that can contribute to the increase of porosity gu et al 2020 but also 2 a higher sensitivity to hydrometric conditions that can significantly modify mechanical properties such as plasticity lerouge et al 2018 the increase of porosity and changes in mechanical properties induced by the oxidation of pyrite are two major factors influencing water and gas diffusion rates through the critical zone 5 2 natural isotopic tracers 5 2 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of waters the tégulines clay pore waters below 6 m lie next to the lmwl and gmwl local and global meteoric water lines kloppmann et al 1998 indicating that meteoric waters have diffused through the clay formation during post depositional history and replaced original connate seawater fig 9b the δ18o andδdofpore waters of tégulinesclay below 6 m are almost similar to present day local meteoric waters the δ18o andδd of pore waters at the bottom of the clay formation are similar to those of the greensands aquifer above 5 6 m theδ18o andδdofgroundwatersand tégulines clay pore waters in the 5 m deep pits of the first hillslope and in the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the second hillslope show an 18o and d enrichment groundwaters of the first hillslope are near the lmwl while groundwaters of the tv4 1 pit plot along a line with a slope of 5 87 between rainfall on the lmwl and the reservoirs of la carpière and le petit etang indicating that groundwaters and reservoirs are affected by evaporation processes groundwaters of the first hillslope are slightly enriched in 18o and d probably due to regular recharge by meteoric waters 5 2 2 strontium isotopes of exchangeable strontium strontium isotopes when coupled with sr concentrations are a good monitor of geochemical processes in natural clayey formations lerouge et al 2010 and are also used to investigate the mixing of different groundwaters négrel et al 2001 sullivan et al 2016 demonterova et al 2022 the 87sr 86sr of exchangeable strontium is representative of strontium in present day pore waters of clay rich formations lerouge et al 2010 in unweathered and slightly weathered tégulines clay from boreholes aub1010 and aub230 below 12 m 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium ranges between 0 7074 and 0 7075 with a mean value of 0 707438 0 000034 this range of values is consistent with the lower cretaceous seawater jones and jenkyns 2001 suggesting a limited diffusion of sr since the formation deposition in weathered tégulines clay 87sr 86sr ratio of exchangeable strontium slightly increases from 0 7075 to 0 7084 at the top of the formation the 87sr 86sr ratios of exchangeable strontium of overlying silty clay loam are 0 7085 0 7109 the decreasing of strontium content on the exchangeable fraction at the top of tégulines clay coupled with the increasing 87sr 86sr ratio suggests a slight dilution of téguline clay pore waters by groundwaters of overlying silty clay loam 5 2 3 dic δ13c of dic and carbonates and 14c activity the chemical contrast between groundwaters and pore waters in silty clay loam which are diluted waters and tégulines pore waters indicate that dic concentrations at the top of the tégulines clay down to 10 12 m are not due to diffusion of surficial pore waters into the clays the dic increases rapidly up to 10 mmol l from the top of weathered tégulines clay down to 10 12 m and then decreases to become almost constant below 20 m 1 1 5 mmol l pw whatever the borehole the δ13cco2 at the top of tégulines is 21 pdb and increases to values of 10 pdb at 15 20 m fig 8 the highest values are consistent with δ13cco2 calculated at equilibrium with calcite δ13cco2 calcite 10 pdb lerouge et al 2020 the large δ13cco2 range 19 8 to 10 5 of the weathered tégulines clay indicates a mixed origin of co2 component internally controlled by the equilibrium between pore waters and calcite δ13cco2 calcite 10 pdb and co2 release by the degradation of organic matter δ13cco2 organic matter 29 pdb we estimate the contributions in of the organic matter degradation xorganic matter and co2 due to calcite equilibrium xcalcite to dic and the corresponding concentrations nco2 om and nco2 cc given in mmol l for each δ13cco2 of clay sample fig 8 the data give evidence of a co2 peak due to organic matter at the top of the clay and a co2 peak due to calcite equilibrium in the 5 12 m zone this latter is significantly higher than dic in unweathered tégulines clay in agreement with the dissolution of marine carbonates and more specifically carbonate bioclasts in highly reactive tégulines clay lerouge et al 2018 it is noteworthy that in most of the pits where the loam clay boundary is accessible secondary carbonates rapidly precipitated as a fine calcite layer close to the boundary when the contact is stable and as concretions in tégulines clay when a slide plan separates clay from the surficial formation rare secondary carbonates also precipitated in cracks affecting loam at the ridgetop of the secondary hillslope tph2 1 aub210 the position of the secondary carbonates probably informs on the water table limit the morphology of calcite precipitates rather depends on the sedimentary rock texture a fine layer of calcite homogeneously precipitated in microporosity of top of the tégulines clay when rock microstructures were modified a few and rock was weathered a few concretions and precipitations in cracks precipitated in sedimentary rocks when rock texture was highly modified by weathering and dessication in unsaturated zone the δ13c and δ18o of the concretions at the top tph2 1 and the bottom tv4 1 of the second hillslope allowed calculating δ13c and δ18o of fluid from which they precipitated using the carbon and oxygen isotopic fractionations between calcite and water at 20 c respectively 2 deines et al 1974 and 29 1 kim and o neil 1997 the δ13cfluid value of 11 5 pdb the δ18ofluid value of 3 vs smow and 87sr 86sr ratios of the concretions show that secondary calcite concretions are isotopically at equilibrium with groundwaters that were affected by an intense evaporating process the 14c activity of both concretions confirms their old ages the oldest one at 34 ky in the tph2 1 pit at the ridgetop of the second hillslope and a younger age of 8 ky in the tv4 1 pit at the bottom of the hillslope even though high dic are well correlated in depth with quite a recent mineral reactivity and organic matter om degradation previous dic profile chemical modelling using phreeqc program needed to take into account evaporation processes in association with mineral and om reactivity to explain the high dic values measured in aub230 and aub1010 boreholes lerouge et al 2020 5 3 nitrates as tracer of anthropic activity natural nitrate concentrations in surficial and groundwaters are estimated to 5 to 15 mg l 0 08 0 24 mmol l brenot et al 2008 the use of nitrogen fertilizers has significantly increased the diffuse nitrate loading of surface waters and groundwaters in agricultural areas the regulatory limit for nitrate in drinking wateris 10 mg l as nitrate nitrogen no3 n2 and is approximately equivalent to the world health organization who guideline of 50 mg l 0 8 mmol l as no3 ward et al 2018 nitrate concentrations in all the tégulines clay pore waters from boreholes are low and in the range of natural waters nitrate concentrations in loams overlying tégulines clay vary from site to site significant high values up to 18 mmol l pw are measured by leaching of soil samples of pits tph1 1 tv1 1 and tv4 1 dug in cropland in october 2017 while in other pits dug in grassland values rarely exceed the regulatory limit for nitrate in drinking water supplementary figure sd3 nitrate concentrations rapidly decrease below the regulatory limit at 1 1 3 m in the three pits dug in cropland the decrease is faster in the tph1 1 and tv4 1 than in the tv1 1 pit which is the present day brevonne aube valley the 1 1 3 m depth corresponds to the depth of the drainage system that was installed in the 1980 s and probably helps nitrates to migrate to the discharge zone it is noteworthy that concentrations measured in waters extracted by squeezing of core samples in december 2017 are lower than that obtained by leaching of equivalent samples dug in the tph1 1 pit in october 2017 probably suggesting the contribution of a soluble nitrate form during leaching nitrate can act as an oxidant only if microorganisms are present bosh et al 2012 in the system that is likely at a shallow depth where it reaches a maximum of 1 70 m and is barely detectable below 2 40 m then oxygen is the more abundant oxidant and reaches its maximum at 5 m and is still present at 10 m lerouge et al 2020 the weathering is thus rate limited by oxygen especially at the hilltop and to a lesser extent in the valley where the nitrate concentration can be much more important 17 mmol l at 5 m in aub1010 but not present anymore at 10 m 5 4 weathering profile and hydrology in the studied area the studied area is very close and upstream of the hydrological chalk watershed extending from the reservoir s dams to pont sur seine of the seine aube confluence fig 14a bendjoudi et al 2002 combining fieldwork with petrological and geochemical data allows a better understanding the current hydrological system functioning at the scale of the studied area the variations of present day topography and slope angle influence the water flow direction and flow accumulation and allow defining the recharge and discharge zones the present day topography and the hydrographic network result from the successive river banks developed later than the oligocene eocene erosion surface and associated with major climatic cycles during quaternary the age of the lowest fluvial terrace fya above the aube major bed on the east of the studied area is 300 165 ky voinchet et al 2015 the pit digging campaign in october 2017 provided evidence of groundwaters in 5 m deep pits between the bottom of the second hillslope and the bottom of the first hillslope near the brevonne river the 14c ages of three groundwaters tph1 1 tv1 1 tv1 2 are lower than 10 kyrs and consequently younger than the last ice age the shallow groundwaters at the first ridgetop tph1 1 5 4 m correspond to a temporary perched water table that is favoured by the increase of the clay content and particularly of smectite in the succession of quaternary clay loams and colluvium overlying tégulines clay as observed in the tph1 1 pit aub230 borehole fig 14 b their youngest age of 300 years indicates that the ridgetop constitutes a current zone of recharge rainfalls falling on this relief infiltrate quaternary loams and laterally flow for one part along the first west facing hillslope of the present day brevonne valley and another part along the east facing hillslope of the brévonne aube paleo valley teles et al 2004 voinchet et al 2015 the steeper west facing slope promotes landslide by gravity tv1 1 tv1 2 drainage and runoff of waters towards the brevonne valley which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain and at a larger scale to the seine aube confluence fig 14a the groundwaters of the tv1 2 and tv1 1 pits were collected in carbonate alluvium corresponding probably to the ancient aube fya fluvial terrace observed at the east 165 300 kyrs voinchet et al 2015 their δ13c δ18o and δd are similar to that of groundwaters of the ridgetop suggesting that all the waters have the same origin have evolved in the same environment and are isotopically equilibrated with the carbon system the groundwater δ18o and δd are slightly enriched compared to meteoric waters corresponding to 5 10 of evaporation however they are chemically different and older groundwaters of the recharge zone are more diluted and less calcic than that of the slope and that of the discharge zone strongly suggesting water sediment interactions toward the discharge zone in that case we cannot neglect the possibility of contamination of ancient carbon source 14c free increasing 14c age the almost flat morphology of the east facing slope and the bottom of the west facing slope of the brevonne aube paleo valley is more likely to collect stagnant waters that can invade the loamy horizon of the paleo valley during wet periods the presence of small reservoirs such as the la carpière and of le petit etang reservoirs and the installation of drainage in the cropland on the east facing slope is consistent with wetlands the paleo valley has an altitude slightly higher than the current aube brevonne valley and is connected to the voire valley at the north and the brevonne valley at the south it does not belong to the current aube alluvium plain however its position at the confluence of the two rivers is included in the aube widespread floodplain invaded during exceptional raining events as attest by the deposits of quaternary loams on the ridgetops as well as silty loams of the studied area the δ18o and δd of reservoirs natural or created for drainage with values evolving to seawater signature during the dry period summer are significantly enriched compared to meteoric waters indicating important evaporation processes the groundwater δ18o and δd collected in the paleo valley are probably a mixing between these evaporated waters waters of the recharge zones and runoff waters during wet seasons autumn to spring all these data rather suggest that the paleo valleys of the area represent large intermediate discharge zones between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain 6 conclusions a field campaign including twelve 5 m deep pits and five deep 30 90 m boreholes was conducted in the area of brienne le chateau at the east of the aube alluvium plain france the pit digging campaign along two stepped west facing hillslopes along the brevonne valley and the aube brevonne paleo valley showed that thin quaternary clay silty and carbonate free loams cover tégulines clay in all the area their thickness varies between 1 2 m on the upper part of the hillslopes to 5 10 m on the top of the two east facing hillslopes landslides of clay loams and tégulines clay displaced downslope one meter thick layer of chalky gravel covers tégulines clay in the valley of the brevonne river the pit digging also allowed collecting groundwaters in 5 m deep pits between the bottom of the second hillslope and the bottom of the first hillslope near the brevonne river groundwaters have low tds concentrations 600 mg l and are calcic carbonate water type the distribution of groundwaters and their 14c ages provided evidence of a current zone of recharge and temporary perched water table at the first ridgetop and recent lateral groundwater transfers and runoff of waters along the first west facing steep slope toward the brevonne river which is a discharge zone belonging to the present day aube alluvium plain the perched water table is favoured by the increase of the clay and smectite contents in the quaternary clay loams and colluvium overlying tégulines clay groundwaters of the recharge zone are more diluted and less calcic than that of the slope and that of the discharge zone strongly suggesting water sediment interactions toward the discharge zone combined petrological and geochemical studies of tégulines clay from deep boreholes showed that the weathering intensity and the depth of the weathering profile vary a lot along the two successive hillslopes highlighting the need to acquire data at the watershed scale to be able to understand its 3d functioning the pore water chemistry of tégulines clay differs from that of groundwaters they are ca2 mg2 so4 2 rich water type and show a large range of tds concentrations 592 6457 mg l the highest values are measured in the most intensely weathered clays that developed in the first 10 15 m under the first ridge top and the low east facing slope of the aube brevonne paleo valley on the ridgetop of the second west facing hillslope the weathering intensity is low and pore waters are little modified the aube brevonne paleo valley could represent a large intermediate discharge zone between the coarse ridgetops recharge zones and the current aube alluvium plain included in the aube widespread floodplain and invaded during exceptional raining events the high ionic strengths combined with high δ18o and δd water values measured in tegulines clay pore waters of this paleo valley suggest ancient important evaporation processes associated with a cation exchange from the clay exchange sites finally the data obtained in the present study enable us to understand the flow paths of the studied watershed which is closely linked to the mineralogical transformation this helped to get a comprehensive description of the major processes that will govern that watershed functioning declaration of competing interest the

2281,flow velocity profile in the vegetal mixing layer was investigated using data collected in the present experiments and those reported in the literature which indicates that the inflection point of the velocity profile does not coincide with the middle position of the vegetal mixing layer aiming to solve this problem the hyperbolic tangent formula that is applicable to the plane mixing layer is modified by revising the inflection point and applying different characteristic scales in the free flow and penetration regions for the problem of predicting flow velocity on top of vegetation we constructed a new calculation method for flow velocity on top of vegetation based on correlation analysis the proposed formula yields significant improvements in representing measured velocity profiles in the vegetated open channel flows in comparison with previous ones the modified formula performs better in exhibiting the similarity of measured velocity profiles over a wide range of flow and vegetation conditions the research results provide technical support for the high precision calculation of the vegetated mixing layer keywords vegetal mixing layer free flow region penetration

hydraulics jiang et al 2022 wu and chen 2014 wu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 submerged vegetation in open channel flow appears as large scale roughness elements which absorb some flow momentum and thus modify the time mean streamwise velocity profile nepf 2012 huai et al 2019 huai et al 2021 xu et al 2022 despite significant efforts made in past decades the velocity distribution remains hardly predictable previous approaches were usually developed by dividing the vegetated flow into different zones in the vertical direction for example the flow can be simply separated into the surface zone above the canopy top and the vegetation zone below it as done by yang and choi 2009 huai et al 2009 and harman and finnigan 2007 in the surface zone the velocity profile is logarithmic yang choi 2009 huai et al 2009 if vegetation is treated as a roughness element in the wall flow the logarithmic law is theoretically applicable only in the outer layer kundu et al 2004 pope 2018 however in the case of shallow submergence the logarithmic zone may not be valid because the outer layer may disappear cheng et al 2012 the dominant vortex structure significantly influences the vegetated flow zhao et al 2019 fig 1 submerged vegetation acts as a porous media to reduce flow velocity within the canopy resulting in two parallel streams with different velocities these two streams interact with each other and a point of inflection appears in the velocity profile approximately at their interface i e the canopy top raupach et al 1996 inherent in such an inflectional velocity profile is the kelvin helmholtz kh instability which enhances the turbulent mixing within the region around the canopy top ghisalberti nepf 2002 given that the mixing region is hydrodynamically similar to the plane mixing layer pml the velocity distribution could be described using the hyperbolic tangent formula that is applied in the pml raupach et al 1996 ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 1 u u r u c tanh z z r l c where u is the time mean streamwise flow velocity u r is the reference velocity at the elevation z r of a selected reference point u c and l c are the characteristic velocity and length scale of the vegetal mixing layer vml respectively and z is the distance upward from the channel bed the selection of u r z r u c and l c varies considerably among different studies and these parameters are often evaluated empirically ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 nikora et al 2013 causing difficulties encountered in the application of eq 1 in the vegetated open channel flows this study investigates how the u profile in any vegetated flow could be generally represented first modified formulas were proposed after discussions about ur zr uc and lc in eq 1 the difference between vml flow and pml flow will be analyzed in this section second 19 runs of laboratory experiments were conducted and 28 sets of previous data were collected to count in different flow and vegetation configurations in this study followed by a comparison between the modified and existing formulas in data fitting finally we made some discussions about the modified formulas and the method to evaluate flow velocity at the canopy top is proposed and discussed 2 theory as shown in fig 1 the vml is confined by the lower boundary z h p and upper boundary z h o correspondingly uh p and uh o are used to denote the two boundary velocities the reference velocity u r in eq 1 can be selected as an average of uh p and uh o ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 and the reference point z r corresponds to the middle height z m although z m generally depends on the velocity profile nezu and sanjou 2008 simply took z m as h o h p 2 i e z m h o h p 2 the characteristic velocity u c represents the strength of the free shear turbulence and is generally selected as half of the difference between uh o and uh p the characteristic length l c is assumed to be 2θ or uh v du dz z h v where θ is the momentum thickness calculated by an integral of the u profile ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 and uh v du dz z h v is the interfacial flow velocity divided by the velocity gradient at the canopy top z h v nikora et al 2013 raupach et al 1996 determinations of θ and uh v du dz z h v also depend on the velocity profile both reflect the length scale of the free shear turbulence and are proportional to the vml thickness h o h p ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 given that h o and h p can be determined directly nepf vivoni 2000 nezu sanjou 2008 zhao et al 2020 l c in eq 1 could be taken as h o h p with the above considerations and by noting that u uh o at z h o and u uh p at z h p eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 2 u u ho u hp 2 u ho u hp 2 tanh z h o h p 2 h o h p 2 2 in the following experimental data will be used to check if eq 2 generally applies to vegetated open channel flows the data comprise two parts the first part was collected by conducting experiments in the present study and the second part includes those reported in the literature 3 experimental data 3 1 cylindrical vegetation experiments experiments were conducted in a 12 m long and 0 6 m wide b 0 6 m rectangular glass side flume introduced by zhao et al 2019 the channel bed slope s was adjustable to make the flow depth h remain constant along the flume the flow discharge q and the depth h were controlled by the variable frequency pump ultrasonic flow meter system at the flume inlet and the tailgate at the flume outlet respectively a combined adjustment of the pump tailgate and the bed slope resulted in a steady and uniform flow condition where the mean bulk velocity u m u m q bh and the h met experimental requirements the vegetation zone covered 8 m long and 0 6 m wide bed area which was situated in the middle of the flume the vegetation was simulated by circular cylinders of diameter d v 0 6 cm and height h v 6 cm and distributed in an aligned manner the distances between neighboring cylinders were set as sx and sy in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively the vegetation density λ is defined by the frontal vegetation area per unit bed area and calculated by λ d v h v s x s y in this experiment the 3d flow velocity was measured by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek norway with an accuracy of 1 mm s experiments were designed by changing λ submergence h h v and um altogether 11 runs were completed with λ 0 18 0 36 0 72 h h v 3 4 5 6 7 and um 10 20 30 cm s table 1 summarizes the experimental variables the boundaries of vml h p and h o were provided by zhao et al 2020 each set of the experiment represents the vegetation and flow condition for example case a 3 30 stands for run a sx 5 cm and sy 4 cm with h h v 3 and um 30 cm s 3 2 foliated vegetation experiments these experiments were carried out in a 10 m long 1 m wide and 1 m high rectangular flume at the china institute of water resources and hydropower research fig 2 the slope of the riverbed can be adjusted as needed the bottom plate of the flume is laid with pvc formwork and the walls are made of glass by controlling the upstream valve with an electromagnetic flowmeter and adjusting the downstream tailgate the water flow can be maintained in a steady and uniform flow condition to meet the requirements of different working conditions a series of experiments were carried out using three different types of vegetation dwarf grass sedge and vallisneria nana the vegetation is laid in aligned lines with strips of 10 m long and 1 m wide for dwarf grass and sedge and 6 m long and 1 m wide for vallisneria nana the vegetation configurations are shown in fig 3 the experiment is designed by changing the water depth vegetation type vegetation density and flow rate the experiment is divided into eight working conditions a and b mean simulated vegetation and c means real flexible vegetation experiment the specific parameters are shown in table 2 adv measured the flow rate the sampling frequency was 200 hz and the sampling time was 120 s this experiment defines ho as the critical height at which the velocity distribution deviates downward from the log law near the free surface equal to approximately 1 7 hv nezu sanjou 2008 nezu and sanjou 2008 considered that in the emergent zone z hp the velocity is almost constant because of strong wake effects of vegetation stems therefore we choose the gauging point where the flow velocity starts to be non uniform upwards as the location of z hp 3 3 previous experiment collection in addition to experiments conducted in the present study data sets reported in previous studies on submerged vegetation flow were also collected the previous data comprised 15 sets for the case of rigid vegetation and 13 sets for the case of flexible vegetation the influence of monami on u profile was also considered in the flexible vegetation flow the relevant information is summarized in table 3 the area of vegetation zone varied e g the length ranging from 2 44 m to 8 m and the width ranging from 0 3 m to 0 91 m the experimental vegetation was selected as a circular cylinder a plastic straw polyethylene film or a real plant the vegetation was arranged in staggered aligned random or columnar patterns with λ varying from 0 064 to 2 133 the um ranged from 2 7 cm s to 74 76 cm s and h h v was from 1 73 to 3 85 previous researchers did not present the h p and h o values in some cases the h p was evaluated as the height where the turbulent shear stress attained 10 of its vertical maximum nepf vivoni 2000 when no turbulent shear stress is provided the point at which flow velocity begins to appear non uniform is taken as h p nezu sanjou 2008 the method for selecting h o has already been mentioned in section 3 2 and will not be repeated here 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of new formula of mixing layer with data fig 4 shows the comparisons of eq 2 with the data in the two regions free flow and penetration which are considered individually the data from different sources collapse onto a single curve and exhibit similarity but the deviation from eq 2 is significant the reason is that the difference between the inflection point and the middle height of the vml has not been distinguished in previous studies ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 the idea of involving flow parameters at the middle height is based on the pml theory where the middle height is the same as the inflection point raupach et al 1996 however the two positions are different in the vml first the inflection point is the exact position where the flow discontinuity and the kh instability happen pope 2018 and it is fixed at the canopy top second the middle height is the position where the flow velocity equals an average of u ho and u hp and it varies for different conditions fig 5 compares the difference between the middle height and the inflection point in the vml the middle height is commonly higher than the inflection point fig 5a and uh p uh o 2 is larger than uh v in most cases fig 5b the difference may become considerable especially for the case of large submergence or dense vegetation because the vml would move upward to the water surface zhao et al 2020 4 2 modified hyperbolic tangent formula the flows in the vml and the pml are hydrodynamically similar but still have some differences in the pml the middle height z z m lies just at the inflection point and the velocity profile is anti symmetric about the position however in the vml the middle height is 0 5 θ higher than the inflection point ghisalberti nepf 2002 and the velocity profile no longer distributes in an anti symmetric manner in the vml the flow resistance changes suddenly at the canopy top as a result the inflection point occurs at the canopy top and the selection of flow parameters at the middle height may become physically unclear in the vml the following consideration assumes that the reference point can be taken at the canopy top furthermore two regions the penetration region h p z h v and the free flow region h v z h o see fig 1 are treated individually in the penetration region the exchange of flow momentum is influenced and even dominated by the canopy drag however the canopy drag disappears in the free flow region implying that different mechanisms exist in the mixing processes in the two regions as a result for the two regions eq 1 can be rewritten separately by selecting different u c and l c meanwhile the velocity u at z h o and z h p should be equal to uh o and uh p respectively the tanh 1 term is also introduced thus eq 1 is rearranged as follows 3 u u h v u h o u h v tanh z h v h o h v tanh 1 for the free flow region 4 u h v u u h v u h p tanh h v z h v h p tanh 1 for the penetration region fig 6 a shows the experimental data collected in the present study plotted in the form of u u hv u ho u hv against z h v h o h v in the free flow region fig 6 b shows the data in the form of u hv u u hv u hp against h v z h v h p in the penetration region the results indicate that the normalized profiles are similar to one another independent of vegetation configuration vegetation density submergence and flow velocity comparing fig 6 with fig 4 the normalization given by eqs 3 and 4 significantly improves in collapsing the measured velocity profiles to a single curve for the velocity profile in the penetration region the measured data for cases d 3 30 and e 3 30 deviate from the formula calculations see fig 6 b these two cases are characterized by narrow longitudinal spacing with sx 2 5 cm for which eq 4 may become invalid the reason is that the small spacing would modify the flow structure through wake turbulence igarashi 1981 to verify the improvement of the proposed modification 28 velocity profiles published in the literature see table 3 were also used for comparison these profiles involve variations in vegetation stiffness shape distribution pattern vegetation density λ mean bulk velocity um and submergence h h v fig 7 shows good agreement between eqs 3 and 4 and the measurements the flows are depth limited for seven cases with h h v 2 where the shallow water inhibits the development of the kh instability cheng et al 2012 nevertheless the comparisons suggest that the proposed modified formula is still valid in the depth limited flow 4 3 flow velocity at the canopy top in performing the preceding eqs 3 and 4 the flow velocity at the canopy top u h v should be determined beforehand this study considers the top of canopy flow velocity to be related to vegetation density vegetation diameter vegetation height and water depth i e u h v f h h v a d v where a λ h v is the area of vegetation holding back water per unit of bed area the formula can be rearranged by some dimensionless treatment as u h v u f α β where u g s h h v is the friction velocity α h h v is the submergence degree γ l c h v and l c 1 c d a h v c d λ h v c d h v d v s x s y s x s y c d d v is the characteristic length scale the correlation analyses of u u h v with h h v and l c h v are shown in fig 8 the results indicate that u u h v and h h v have a significant positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0 48 p 0 05 u u h v and l c h v have a significant negative correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0 79 p 0 01 on this basis the general form of the u u h v versus h h v and l c h v formula is supposed to be 5 u u h v a 1 a 2 h h v a 3 l c h v where a 1 a 2 a 3 is a parameter to be determined genetic programming can automatically identify relationships between dependent and independent variables in a design free framework thus avoiding relatively subjective data analysis liu et al 2020 therefore a genetic algorithm is used to verify the form of eq 5 the eureqa software is applied to find the formulae and evaluates the individual candidate solution formulas based on the fitness function and complexity in solving the target equation attention needs to be paid to the over fitting of the equation considering the accuracy of the solution and the complexity of the equation to select the required equation with particular attention to the point of the pareto frontier the pareto frontier fig 9 shows a positive correlation between the accuracy and complexity of the equation with too much complexity leading to over fitting resulting in a lack of physical significance table 4 shows that with a complexity of 10 the fitness is 0 591 indicating that the formula is accurate and relatively simple in physical form and satisfies the form of eq 5 in table 4 the formula with the complexity of 10 has the same form as eq 5 indicating that the complexity of eq 5 is also 10 based on eq 5 a regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between u u h v with h h v and l c h v 6 u u h v 0 216 0 012 h h v 0 012 l c h v 0 216 0 012 h l c h v i e 7 u h v u 0 216 0 012 h l c h v fig 10 compares eq 7 calculations and experiments measured u h v values the predicted points are within the range of 0 8 times to 1 2 times the measured values the correlation coefficient between the measured u h v and calculated u h v values is 0 966 indicating that the equation is a good predictor of flow velocity at the top of the canopy 5 conclusion this study modifies the hyperbolic tangent velocity profile so that it can be applied to penetration and free flow regions around the canopy top the modification was made by setting the inflection point as the reference point and selecting characteristic scales separately in the free flow and penetration regions in comparison with previous ones the modified formula performs better in exhibiting the similarity of measured velocity profiles over a wide range of flow and vegetation conditions relevant analyses were conducted based on the data collected in the present study and those reported in the literature based on correlation analysis the normalized flow velocity u u h v at the inflection point increases with increasing submergence h hv and decreases with increasing l c h v through the validation of the genetic algorithm the calculation method of u h v is proposed with an accuracy of 0 966 credit authorship contribution statement han qing zhao writing original draft conceptualization methodology

2281,flow velocity profile in the vegetal mixing layer was investigated using data collected in the present experiments and those reported in the literature which indicates that the inflection point of the velocity profile does not coincide with the middle position of the vegetal mixing layer aiming to solve this problem the hyperbolic tangent formula that is applicable to the plane mixing layer is modified by revising the inflection point and applying different characteristic scales in the free flow and penetration regions for the problem of predicting flow velocity on top of vegetation we constructed a new calculation method for flow velocity on top of vegetation based on correlation analysis the proposed formula yields significant improvements in representing measured velocity profiles in the vegetated open channel flows in comparison with previous ones the modified formula performs better in exhibiting the similarity of measured velocity profiles over a wide range of flow and vegetation conditions the research results provide technical support for the high precision calculation of the vegetated mixing layer keywords vegetal mixing layer free flow region penetration

hydraulics jiang et al 2022 wu and chen 2014 wu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 submerged vegetation in open channel flow appears as large scale roughness elements which absorb some flow momentum and thus modify the time mean streamwise velocity profile nepf 2012 huai et al 2019 huai et al 2021 xu et al 2022 despite significant efforts made in past decades the velocity distribution remains hardly predictable previous approaches were usually developed by dividing the vegetated flow into different zones in the vertical direction for example the flow can be simply separated into the surface zone above the canopy top and the vegetation zone below it as done by yang and choi 2009 huai et al 2009 and harman and finnigan 2007 in the surface zone the velocity profile is logarithmic yang choi 2009 huai et al 2009 if vegetation is treated as a roughness element in the wall flow the logarithmic law is theoretically applicable only in the outer layer kundu et al 2004 pope 2018 however in the case of shallow submergence the logarithmic zone may not be valid because the outer layer may disappear cheng et al 2012 the dominant vortex structure significantly influences the vegetated flow zhao et al 2019 fig 1 submerged vegetation acts as a porous media to reduce flow velocity within the canopy resulting in two parallel streams with different velocities these two streams interact with each other

experimental data will be used to check if eq 2 generally applies to vegetated open channel flows the data comprise two parts the first part was collected by conducting experiments in the present study and the second part includes those reported in the literature 3 experimental data 3 1 cylindrical vegetation experiments experiments were conducted in a 12 m long and 0 6 m wide b 0 6 m rectangular glass side flume introduced by zhao et al 2019 the channel bed slope s was adjustable to make the flow depth h remain constant along the flume the flow discharge q and the depth h were controlled by the variable frequency pump ultrasonic flow meter system at the flume inlet and the tailgate at the flume outlet respectively a combined adjustment of the pump tailgate and the bed slope resulted in a steady and uniform flow condition where the mean bulk velocity u m u m q bh and the h met experimental requirements the vegetation zone covered 8 m long and 0 6 m wide bed area which was situated in the middle of the flume the vegetation was simulated by circular cylinders of diameter d v 0 6 cm and height h v 6 cm and distributed in an aligned manner the distances between neighboring cylinders were set as sx and sy in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively the vegetation density λ is defined by the frontal vegetation area per unit bed area and calculated by λ d v h v s x s y in this experiment the 3d flow velocity was measured by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek norway with an accuracy of 1 mm s experiments were designed by changing λ submergence h h v

experiments these experiments were carried out in a 10 m long 1 m wide and 1 m high rectangular flume at the china institute of water resources and hydropower research fig 2 the slope of the riverbed can be adjusted as needed the bottom plate of the flume is laid with pvc formwork and the walls are made of glass by controlling the upstream valve with an electromagnetic flowmeter and adjusting the downstream tailgate the water flow can be maintained in a steady and uniform flow condition to meet the requirements of different working conditions a series of experiments were carried out using three different types of vegetation dwarf grass sedge and vallisneria nana the vegetation is laid in aligned lines with strips of 10 m long and 1 m wide for dwarf grass and sedge and 6 m long and 1 m wide for vallisneria nana the vegetation configurations are shown in fig 3 the experiment is designed by changing the water depth vegetation type vegetation density and flow rate the experiment is divided into eight working conditions a and b mean simulated vegetation and c means real flexible vegetation experiment the specific parameters are shown in table 2 adv measured the flow rate the sampling frequency was 200 hz and the sampling time was 120 s this experiment defines ho as the critical height at which the velocity distribution deviates downward from the log law near the free surface equal to approximately 1 7 hv nezu sanjou 2008 nezu and sanjou 2008 considered that in the emergent zone z hp the velocity is almost constant because of strong wake effects of vegetation stems therefore we choose the gauging point where the flow velocity starts to be non uniform upwards as the location of z hp 3 3 previous experiment collection in addition to experiments conducted in the present study data sets reported in previous studies on submerged vegetation flow were also collected the previous data comprised 15 sets for the case of rigid vegetation and 13 sets for the case of flexible vegetation the influence of monami on u profile was also considered in the flexible vegetation flow the relevant information is summarized in table 3 the area of vegetation zone varied e g the length ranging from 2 44 m to 8 m and the width ranging from 0 3 m to 0 91 m the experimental vegetation was selected as a circular cylinder a plastic straw polyethylene film or a real plant the vegetation was arranged in staggered aligned random or columnar patterns with λ varying from 0 064 to 2 133 the um ranged from 2 7 cm s to 74 76 cm s and h h v was from 1 73 to 3 85 previous researchers did not present the h p and h o values in some cases the h p was evaluated as the height where the turbulent shear stress attained 10 of its vertical maximum nepf vivoni 2000 when no turbulent shear stress is provided the point at which flow velocity begins to appear non uniform is taken as h p nezu sanjou 2008 the method for selecting h o has already been mentioned in section 3 2 and will not be repeated here 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of new formula of mixing layer with data fig 4 shows the comparisons of eq 2 with the data in the two regions free flow and penetration which are considered individually the data from different sources collapse onto a single curve and exhibit similarity but the deviation from eq 2 is significant the reason is that the difference between the inflection point and the middle height of the vml has not been distinguished in previous studies ghisalberti nepf 2002 nezu sanjou 2008 the idea of involving flow parameters at the middle height is based on the pml theory where the middle height is the same as the inflection point raupach et al 1996 however the two positions are different in the vml first the inflection point is the exact position where the flow discontinuity and the kh instability happen pope 2018 and it is fixed at the canopy top second the middle height is the position where the flow velocity equals an average of u ho and u hp and it varies for different conditions fig 5 compares the difference between the middle height and the inflection point in the vml the middle height is commonly higher than the inflection point fig 5a and uh p uh o 2 is larger than uh v in most cases fig 5b the difference may become considerable especially for the case of large submergence or dense vegetation because the vml would move upward to the water surface zhao et al 2020 4 2 modified hyperbolic tangent formula the flows in the vml and the pml are hydrodynamically similar but still have some differences in the pml the middle height z z m lies just at the inflection point and the velocity profile is anti symmetric about the position however in the vml the middle height is 0 5 θ higher than the inflection point ghisalberti nepf 2002 and the velocity profile no longer distributes in an anti symmetric manner in the vml the flow resistance changes suddenly at the canopy top as a result the inflection point occurs at the canopy top and the selection of flow parameters at the middle height may become physically unclear in the vml the following consideration assumes that the reference point can be taken at the canopy top furthermore two regions the penetration region h p z h v and the free flow region h v z h o see fig 1 are treated individually in the penetration region the exchange of flow momentum is influenced and even dominated by the canopy drag however the canopy drag disappears in the free flow region implying that different mechanisms exist in the mixing processes in the two regions as a result for the two regions eq 1 can be rewritten separately by selecting different u c and l c meanwhile the velocity u at z h o and z h p should be equal to uh o and uh p respectively the tanh 1 term is also introduced thus eq 1 is rearranged as follows 3 u u h v u h o u h v tanh z h v h o h v tanh 1 for the free flow region 4 u h v u u h v u h p tanh h v z h v h p tanh 1 for the penetration region fig 6 a shows the experimental data collected in the present study plotted in the form of u u hv u ho u hv against z h v h o h v in the free flow region fig 6 b shows the data in the form of u hv u u hv u hp against h v z h v h p in the penetration region the results indicate that the normalized profiles are similar to one another independent of vegetation configuration vegetation density submergence and flow velocity comparing fig 6 with fig 4 the normalization given by eqs 3 and 4 significantly improves in collapsing the measured velocity profiles to a single curve for the velocity profile in the penetration region the measured data for cases d 3 30 and e 3 30 deviate from the formula calculations see fig 6 b these two cases are characterized by narrow longitudinal spacing with sx 2 5 cm for which eq 4 may become invalid the reason is that the small spacing would modify the flow structure through wake turbulence igarashi 1981 to verify the improvement of the proposed modification 28 velocity profiles published in the literature see table 3 were also used for comparison these profiles involve variations in vegetation stiffness shape distribution pattern vegetation density λ mean bulk velocity um and submergence h h v fig 7 shows good agreement between eqs 3 and 4 and the measurements the flows are depth limited for seven cases with h h v 2 where the shallow water inhibits the development of the kh instability cheng et al 2012 nevertheless the comparisons suggest that the proposed modified formula is still valid in the depth limited flow 4 3 flow velocity at the canopy top in performing the preceding eqs 3 and 4 the flow velocity at the canopy top u h v should be determined beforehand this study considers the top of canopy flow velocity to be related to vegetation density vegetation diameter vegetation height and water depth i e u h v f h h v a d v where a λ h v is the area of vegetation holding back water per unit of bed area the formula can be rearranged by some dimensionless treatment as u h v u f α β where u g s h h v is the friction velocity α h h v is the submergence degree γ l c h v and l c 1 c d a h v c d λ h v c d h v d v s x s y s x s y c d d v is the characteristic length scale the correlation analyses of u u h v with h h v and l c h v are shown in fig 8 the results indicate that u u h v and h

can automatically identify relationships between dependent and independent variables in a design free framework thus avoiding relatively subjective data analysis liu et al 2020 therefore a genetic algorithm is used to verify the form of eq 5 the eureqa software is applied to find the formulae and evaluates the individual candidate solution formulas based on the fitness function and complexity in solving the target equation attention needs to be paid to the over fitting of the equation considering the accuracy of the solution and the complexity of the equation to select the required equation with particular attention to the point of the pareto frontier the pareto frontier fig 9 shows a positive correlation between the accuracy and complexity of the equation with too much

selecting characteristic scales separately in the free flow and penetration regions in comparison with previous ones the modified formula performs better in exhibiting the similarity of measured

2282,in this paper multiple objective functions were used to conduct uncertainty analysis on calibrated streamflow simulations of swat hillslope model swat hs which is a semi distributed model suited for humid mountainous regions swat hs was set up for six watersheds of nyc water supply system and streamflow was simulated at a daily time step each swat hs model setup was then passed through a calibration process for parameter optimization this process involved constraining the model using several alternative objective functions which produce statistically acceptable streamflow simulations which served as an ensemble of predictions for uncertainty analysis we hypothesize that the uncertainty introduced by selecting a single objective function can be large with each objective function being sensitive to a specific hydrologic signature using multiple objective functions result in a wider range in optimum parameter values and an ensemble of simulations based on different objective functions can capture the overall prediction uncertainty through differences in parameter estimates the bayesian model averaging bma method was then applied to ensemble predictions to quantify overall prediction uncertainty the uncertainty analysis showed the similarity of uncertainty interval characteristics for all bma based predictions across all watersheds more than 94 97 of the observations were covered by uncertainty intervals estimated using multiple objective functions when compared to 73 79 of the observations when using a single objective function no significant differences were observed among the six watersheds and the results of their uncertainty analysis were similar we propose the use of multiple objective functions as an option in ensemble modeling of streamflow and uncertainty analysis keywords bayesian model averaging prediction uncertainty reliability precision objective function streamflow data availability the data used for the research are publicly available 1 introduction uncertainty analysis is an important part of hydrological modeling as it is essential in evaluating the strength of a calibrated model in many studies it is important to present model predictions in the form of an uncertainty interval rather than a single value as the best estimation when predicting a variable of interest different models weigh differently towards various aspects of processes being modeled due to a plethora of underlying factors governing such processes that have to be estimated and formulated although each of these models may produce acceptable predictions the predictions may differ since the models do not consider all aspects of a process darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 on the other hand within a single model there exist empirical parameters whose values cannot be measured directly and are usually optimized through a calibration process in the calibration process the optimized values of model parameters are estimated by constraining the simulation errors through verification metrics usually called objective functions many different objective functions have been developed and formulated to serve various purposes therefore based on the choice of objective function the calibration process may result in different sets of parameter values which produce statistically acceptable predictions however in significantly different locations in the parameter space abbaspour et al 2017 hence picking only one model between many plausible models or one single simulation driven from one set of optimized parameters within a single model as superior in all conditions underestimates the uncertainty and reduces the reliability of predictions the uncertainty estimated in this manner which is the initial approach in hydrological studies only accounts for model data mismatches and does not include calibration and between model uncertainties vrugt and robinson 2007 to overcome this problem several techniques have been developed and utilized to incorporate predictions from different sources such as various competing models or alternative methods within a model to account for all possible causes of uncertainty and to quantify and assess it while early techniques used neural networks and fuzzy systems the use of bayes theorem has been growing over the past 20 years dong et al 2013a among the methods developed based on this theorem is bayesian model averaging bma which has been used most intensively and widely due to its simplicity and easy applicability bma is a statistical method that uses the probability density function pdf of an ensemble to quantify the predictive uncertainty and provide probabilistic results darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 in the physical sciences and engineering including earth and atmospheric sciences bma has been used frequently for prediction improvement and uncertainty analysis while in the social and health sciences it has been often used for model selection purposes fragoso et al 2018 ensemble members integrated using bma can come from different sources these sources in hydrological modeling are predictions generated from a combination of 1 various existing models 2 different model structures 3 different model inputs and 4 model calibrations using different objective functions while constructing an ensemble from various models and model structures has been the focus of many studies to improve the predictions and uncertainty estimations the approach of using ensembles derived solely from calibrating one model using various objective functions is less explored such multiple objective predictions are often combined with multi model predictions to construct an ensemble as an example zhang et al 2009 used different swat model structures by selecting different evapotranspiration and flow routing algorithms calibrated using genetic algorithms to create ensembles of two to six models and to characterize uncertainty induced by the model structure madadgar and moradkhani 2014 explored the difference between uncertainty characteristics generated from bma and their proposed copula embedded bma cop bma method in their research seven streamflow predictions were obtained from three conceptual lumped rainfall runoff models sac gr4j and swb and four land surface models isba noah swap and vic all of which served as ensembles for the two bma and cop bma schemes wagena et al 2019 quantified and compared prediction uncertainty for flow sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp estimated using two bayesian models a bma model and a bayesian generalized non linear multilevel to compare the results three ensembles generated from the soil and water assessment tool variable source area model swat vsa the standard soil and water assessment tool swat st and the chesapeake bay program s phase 6 watershed model cbp model all calibrated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function were used in the bma modeling process in the study conducted by viney et al 2009 an ensemble of 10 models with different complexities was constructed to investigate streamflow prediction improvement he et al 2018 conducted uncertainty analysis comparison between three bma schemes bma copula bma cbma and copula bayesian processor associated with bma cbp bma utilizing a multi model ensemble approach strauch et al 2012 used four different precipitation data sources as inputs to a swat model to create a 4 member ensemble for two bma schemes investigating improvement of streamflow predictions similarly in the neto et al 2018 study two precipitation data sources and various spatial interpolation schemes were used to construct a 5 member multi input ensemble by applying different configurations of a swat model of the few studies in which predictions of objective functions are included is a publication by dong et al 2013b in which three hydrological models were calibrated using three objective functions favoring different flow ranges to construct a 9 member ensemble in a bma scheme to investigate streamflow prediction uncertainty in another study three conceptual hydrological rainfall runoff models were incorporated with four designed objective functions for calibrating the models to create two distinctive bma schemes one with three ensemble members and another with nine in order to test the capability of bma in assessing the uncertainty dong et al 2013a duan et al 2007 also explored the improvement of streamflow predictions when using three conceptual hydrological models of sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma simple water balance swb and the hymod model calibrated using three objective functions darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 looked at the bma performance when considering three ensembles coming from 1 different hydrological models multi model 2 combination of using different input in different models multi model multi input 3 combination of using different models when applying various parameter sets multi model multi parameter and 4 combination of using different models inputs and parameters multi model multi input multi parameter m mip they also compared the results of several bma scenarios constructed using different data transformations distribution types standard deviation forms and optimization methods setting up a suite of plausible hydrological models for practical applications can be a computationally intensive and time consuming process requiring quantification and estimation of many different parameters for each model therefore we shifted our focus solely on considering an ensemble of predictions coming from various objective functions each of which holds distinctive advantages in modeling certain flow ranges e g peaks medium and low flows moreover we present a comparison of streamflow prediction uncertainties quantified using different setups of a bma model to analyze their effect on uncertainty estimation these setups were obtained by employing three data transformation techniques and two flow split selection approaches ensemble predictions considered in this study are streamflow simulations generated using a semi distributed model called swat hillslope swat hs a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swat for simulating variable source area vsa hydrology in mountainous regions with humid climate this model gives a better estimation of surface runoff and has the ability to predict the location of saturated areas both of which are key elements in transferring substances from upland areas to the valley bottom and eventually to the receiving waterbody swat hs model was first applied and tested for town brook new york state usa a small 37 km2 headwater watershed in the catskill mountains which showed its ability in predicting streamflow and saturated excess runoff with reasonable accuracy when compared to field observations hoang et al 2017 later hoang et al 2019 presented a scaled up application of the model to the 1178 km2 cannonsville reservoir watershed encompassing town brook to evaluate the model performance in predicting soluble p total dissolved p particulate p and sediment total suspended solids the town brook and cannonsville watersheds are a part of new york city s water supply system located in catskill mountains of new york state and includes five additional reservoirs and associated watersheds located west of the hudson river having proven the suitability and accuracy of swat hs model when applied in this region we have applied the model to all six west of hudson woh watersheds fig 1 streamflow simulations for each watershed were evaluated using bma models composed of seven ensemble members derived from employing seven objective functions used for optimization and parameterization of swat hs uncertainty analysis was performed separately for each watershed and a comparison between uncertainty characteristics obtained using different bma models is also presented 2 materials study area the catskill and delaware systems of new york city s drinking water supply are located west of the hudson river and include six reservoirs which provide 90 of the supply fig 1 these include ashokan and schoharie in the catskill system and cannonsville neversink pepacton and rondout in the delaware system this region is characterized by humid climate with an average annual temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 1123 mm year hoang et al 2017 the catskill system which provides 40 of the drinking water supply is characterized by forested watersheds and relatively higher elevation and rugged terrain with complex glacial geology and fast flowing streams during rainfall and snowmelt events elevated turbidity may occur and impact the quality of water supply cannonsville and pepacton on the other hand are in the delaware system which has a higher proportion of agricultural land due to higher level of agricultural activity the control of phosphorus loads from both point and non point sources to the reservoirs has been the main subject of watershed protection plans for these two watersheds the tributary system in the region is very well developed and main streams are perennial with their peak flow in mid spring and late fall each watershed has a main inflow contributor which carries most of the water into its associated reservoir the combination of humid climate and physical characteristics of the region such as ample vegetation and well structured soils has created an ideal situation for formation of saturated areas and the occurrence of saturation excess runoff throughout the region this phenomenon has been confirmed via field observations by identifying and mapping the saturated areas hoang et al 2017 the dominance of saturation excess runoff also contributes to sediment and nutrient transport to the reservoirs 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model setup the swat hs model was set up for each of the six watersheds the hydrologic response unit hru is the smallest areal component considered in swat hs with each hru characterized by a unique combination of land use soil type and wetness class the input layers used to identify hrus included a digital elevation model dem soil map wetness map and land use map watershed delineation and discretization of hydrologic response units hrus is achieved by overlaying these layers the physical properties of each hru are determined based on their spatial location in the watershed a full description of swat hs model can be found in the hoang et al 2017 study the land use map of each watershed was derived from classified 2009 aerial photography data obtained from new york city department of environmental protection nyc dep the land use and land cover classifications of this map were simplified and adjusted based on the standardized classification provided in the swat model specifications other inputs to swat hs are soil map and a wetness class map the soil map used was extracted from the ssurgo database usda nrcs 2012 a wetness map is a conceptual map dividing the watershed based on soil water storage capacity from downslope to upslope regions and the likelihood of occurrence of saturation this specification of hillslope improves the simulation of lateral and surface runoff from upslope drier wetness classes to downslope wetter wetness classes the topographic wetness index twi is used to delineate wetness classes agnew et al 2006 hoang et al 2017 twi is derived from the fraction of upslope contributing area per unit contour length and the local surface topographic slope both calculated using a 10 meter dem of the watersheds watersheds were discretized into areas associated with 10 wetness classes which were then combined with the soil map daily precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate data daly et al 2008 available in a 4 km by 4 km gridded format were used to drive the model solar radiation and relative humidity were computed for the same grids using mt clim hungerford et al 1989 running et al 1987 a climate interpolation model that estimates solar radiation and relative humidity as functions of air temperature and precipitation for model calibration and validation the usgs gauging stations at the main inflow location of each watershed to its reservoir were used these stations have long term records of daily discharge measurements which is the time step required for swat hs modeling details regarding these stations are presented in fig 1 and table 1 3 2 swat hs model calibration the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup calibration software abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate simulated streamflow to usgs gauge observations the calibration and validation periods were 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 respectively fourteen parameters averaged over the watershed surface and related to processes including snowmelt surface runoff lateral flow groundwater contribution and evapotranspiration as described in table 2 hoang et al 2017 were calibrated by conducting two to three iterations of 2000 simulations each a parameter set for each simulation was generated using a latin hypercube sampling procedure which reduces the number of simulations required for calibration compared to a random sampling procedure the suggested parameter ranges from each iteration were used for subsequent iterations resulting in a narrow range of parameter values and therefore predictive uncertainty the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as a reference for reducing the parameter space parameter ranges used in the final iteration of the calibration period were utilized for a single iteration with 2000 simulations for the validation period having calibrated and validated swat hs for each watershed a set of behavioral parameters nse 0 65 were estimated using swat cup from which the best parameter combinations that optimized each objective function were selected swat cup provides eleven predefined objective functions to generate the best parameter set satisfying the constraint chosen for the objective function from the final iteration we chose the best simulated time series for seven objective functions that gave unique parameter sets and therefore seven unique streamflow time series the seven time series formed the ensemble members for uncertainty analysis in a bma procedure the chosen objective functions were nash sutcliffe efficiency modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse regression coefficient r2 modified regression coefficient br2 sum of the squares of residuals ssqr percent bias pbias and kling gupta efficiency kge abbaspour 2014 while using r2 and br2 objective functions aim to minimize the error variance between simulated and measured data using nse and mnse maximizes the ability of the model to replicate temporal trends in measured data tolson and shoemaker 2007 the ssqr focuses on fitting the frequency distributions of the observed and the simulated series while pbias minimizes the overall underestimation and overestimation bias and tries to improve the predictions for the average of the measured data the kge is an objective function that is less sensitive to high values providing a better estimate of model predictions over the entire flow range each of the selected objective function results in a model parameterization that generates simulations which are statistically acceptable while being different from each other in the rest of this paper we refer to nse mnse r2 br2 pbias kge and ssqr objective functions as of1 to of7 respectively table 3 3 3 bayesian model averaging overview and bma model setup bma is a statistical method which combines pdfs of the ensemble members using bayes theorem to produce a single forecast pdf bayes rule defines the relationship between prior ensemble pdfs and posterior forecast probability distribution based on which the probabilistic prediction of bma for the variable q is given by 1 p q f 1 f k k 1 k w k g k q f k where q is the quantity to be predicted on the basis of input predictions f1 fk wk is the posterior probability of the kth input prediction kth ensemble member this value reflects how well model fk fits observed data each deterministic prediction of fk must be bias corrected using various techniques one of which is linear regression resulting in substitution of fk with the bias corrected term of ak bkfk in eq 1 gk q fk is the conditional pdf of q conditional on fk provided that the underlying variable belongs to gaussian space the conditional pdf can be approximated using a normal distribution therefore the bma predictive mean can be expressed as 2 e q f 1 f k k 1 k w k a k b k f k where 3 q f 1 f k n a k b k f k σ k 2 wk and σk k 1 k in these equations can be estimated employing maximum likelihood method fisher 1922 from the training data for algebraic simplicity and numerical stability the logarithmic form of likelihood function log likelihood for the bma model can be considered which is defined as follows raftery et al 2005 4 l w 1 w k σ 1 2 σ k 2 t l o g k 1 k w k g k a k b k f kt σ k 2 in this equation subscript t denotes time using expectation maximization algorithm maximum likelihood problem stated in eq 4 can be solved through an iterative process and the two associated parameters of mean eq 2 and variance eq 5 for prior bma predictions can be calculated 5 v a r q t f 1 t f kt k 1 k w k a k b k f kt i 1 k w i a i b i f it 2 σ k 2 the bma mean prediction is a weighted average of the individual ensemble predictions with their posterior probabilities being the weights moges et al 2021 the weights reflect the ensemble members relative contribution to predictive skill over the training period hence it makes bma a suitable method for model selection purposes in addition to uncertainty analysis fragoso et al 2018 the variance is the uncertainty associated with bma mean prediction which consists of between model and within model errors dong et al 2013b these two errors are left and right terms of eq 5 s right hand side respectively the advantage of this method lies in its ability to reduce overfitting while improving the final performance when restricting standard deviation parameters σk to be constant σ across all ensemble members sloughter et al 2010 in this study we used ensemblebma package fraley et al 2013 to conduct normal bma analysis and derive bma probabilistic ensemble prediction for any time t for 2001 to 2018 along with the 95 prediction interval the predictions generated using the seven objective functions served as ensemble members for the explained normal bma analysis unlike the calibration procedure described in the previous section a benefit of bma is that it does not require development of metrics to penalize component forecasts for the number of parameters included the number of covariates or their complexity montgomery et al 2012 this makes it a reliable method to analyze uncertainty the normal bma can be used provided that the variable of interest and its ensemble predictions all follow normal probability distribution however streamflow is known to be skewed towards peak values and log normal gamma or weibull distributions may be better candidates to describe such behavior langat et al 2019 to overcome this problem and use the proposed bma analysis a data transformation procedure is required to map the streamflow values from their original space to a gaussian space it has to be noted that such transformations inevitably lead to a deterioration in peak flow sharpness darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 in this study we designed multiple setups for bma model construction to explore the sensitivity of uncertainty to bma methodology and to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the bma probabilistic results when employing different approaches to build a bma model to this end we considered three data transformations including logarithmic box cox and the empirical normal quantile transformation enqt peng et al 2007 applied on the entire time series complete flow approach and on flow percentiles percentile split flow approach the latter case percentile split flow approach is proposed by duan et al 2007 in which the flow distribution is divided into several percentiles and bma is applied to each independently this approach primarily introduced and applied to improve predictions by combining various model s simulations considering these model setups we ended up having six bma models i e bma1 log transformation complete flow approach bma2 box cox transformation complete flow approach bma3 enqt transformation complete flow approach bma4 log transformation percentile split flow approach bma5 box cox transformation percentile split flow approach bma6 enqt transformation percentile split flow approach fig 2 flow split ranges considered for bma4 to bma6 were 0 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 percentiles for bma1 to bma3 the normal bma procedure was applied to the entire transformed time series resulting in a single set of bma weights and standard deviations for each bma model of each watershed for bma4 to bma6 the transformed streamflow values were broken into the mentioned flow ranges and then the normal bma was applied to each flow range separately resulting in multiple sets of weights and standard deviations observations the bma post processed predictions and 95 bma prediction intervals upper and lower limits were integrated in case of flow percentile separation for bma4 to bma6 and then reverted back to their original space non gaussian before further performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis 3 4 performance evaluation and uncertainty assessment criteria to evaluate the performance of simulated streamflow time series for each objective function and for each bma model four statistical metrics including nse kge pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr were employed these metrics were calculated separately for the calibration period 2001 2010 and the validation period 2011 2018 the nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line with a great emphasis on fitted peak values values of nse ranging from 0 to 1 are considered acceptable with higher values indicating better model performance moriasi et al 2007 the kge which is formulated based on flow variability bias and correlations terms is less sensitive to high streamflow values than the nse and provides a better performance measure at all streamflow ranges radcliffe and mukundan 2017 while a kge value of 1 indicates a perfect fit 0 75 kge 0 9 is considered good 0 5 kge 0 75 is intermediate and 0 0 kge 0 5 is poor tsegaw et al 2020 rsr metric is the standardized root means square error rmse which is obtained by dividing the rmse by the standard deviation of the observations the lower the rsr the better the model performance however a rsr of 0 5 is considered low and hence satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 last metric we considered for model performance evaluation was pbias which identifies overall model underestimation positive values and overestimation negative values with absolute value of less than 10 considered as very good between 10 and 15 as good and larger than 25 as unsatisfactory for streamflow simulations moriasi et al 2007 we also employed two verification criteria to quantify the characteristics of prediction uncertainty interval these metrics were containing ratio cr which is defined by the percentage of observations bracketed by the uncertainty interval and average band width ratio br which is the ratio of the average width of the uncertainty interval and the standard deviation of the measured data abbaspour et al 2004 he et al 2018 yang et al 2008 6 cr i 1 n q i l q i o q i u n 7 br 1 n i 1 n q i u q i l σ o where qi l and qi u are the lower and upper bounds corresponding to 2 5 and 97 5 quantile at the time t respectively in eq 6 the numerator is the number of the observed data points qi o that fall within the lower and upper bounds and σ o eq 7 is the standard deviation of the observations cr is an indicator for the goodness of the uncertainty interval therefore a cr value of one is considered to be ideal in general a smaller difference between the cr value in percentage and the expected coverage percentage of an uncertainty interval indicates better performance zhang et al 2009 for example a cr value of closer to 0 95 95 is the satisfactory value when computed for the 95 uncertainty interval on the other hand small values of br indicate reduced uncertainty or greater precision and values 1 are considered satisfactory the cr and br are also used for measuring the reliability of the model and quantifying the sharpness of the results respectively darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 albeit for the 95 uncertainty interval cr values of higher than 0 7 and br values of less than 1 5 are recommended to be adequate when simulating streamflow abbaspour et al 2015 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual model streamflow simulations one source of model uncertainty as mentioned earlier arises from non uniqueness of model parameter values during calibration process abbaspour et al 2017 kouchi et al 2017 fig 3 indicates the value of each parameter based on the selection of objective function for each watershed in this figure each objective function is shown using a different symbol and the shaded band represents the behavioral range for snowmelt parameters of sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and timp the graphs indicate only one value for all objective functions this is due to the two stage calibration process we carried out in the first stage only the snowmelt parameters were calibrated based on nse as objective function and their optimized value was used in the second stage when calibrating flow related parameters and producing behavioral parameter set this method is suggested by hoang et al 2017 to improve the calculation of water balance in the watershed as observed from the graphs in fig 3 although each simulation produced by considering different objective functions was acceptable their associated parameter sets fell at different locations in the parameter space in some cases such as latb parameter for rondout watershed the calibrated values were close while in other cases parameter values were located at the far ends of the parameter range for some objective functions e g surlag for ashokan this reflects the parameter uncertainty which arises from the different structure of each objective function evaluation coefficients of nse kge rsr and pbias for simulations using the seven objective functions versus daily streamflow observations were calculated to investigate the accuracy of the results statistical evaluation of each objective function showed good calibration performance based on model evaluation criteria presented by moriasi et al 2007 as results in table 4 show nse and kge values averaged at 0 66 and 0 77 respectively across all watersheds for the calibration period similarly for the validation period the daily streamflow simulations were good with performance statistics of nse and kge averaged at 0 63 and 0 77 respectively the pbias values averaged at 4 29 and 3 76 for the calibration and validation periods for all objective functions and watersheds however there existed some exceptions for which the verification metrics fell below or outside the range considered good model performance for example of4 s measures of nse and rsr were 0 39 and 0 78 respectively for rondout watershed for the calibration period which is acceptable but not satisfactory in this case however kge and pbias results were very good being 0 66 and 2 1 respectively another example is when pbias was 15 9 for the validation period for pepacton watershed this value belonged to of3 simulation and despite rsr being slightly high both nse and kge values were good overall of4 simulations which were optimized based on the br2 objective function had the lowest performance across all watersheds for both calibration and validation periods however not below satisfactory comparisons between calibration and validation periods showed slight decrease in the performance for most watersheds except ashokan and rondout for which model performance had improved during the validation period what is also noticeable in table 4 is that ashokan and rondout simulations derived from all objective functions generally underestimated the daily streamflow at their outlets for both calibration and validation periods the opposite was true for pepacton for which streamflow values were overestimated for schoharie and neversink all calibration simulations were underestimated while the same pattern was not observed for the validation period and some objective functions had a positive pbias value while others had negative for cannonsville the situation was the opposite while most of the simulations were underestimated in the calibration period all of them showed underestimation in the validation period overall visual inspection of time series for 2001 to 2018 showed that all simulations captured the flow variation very well fig 4 streamflow duration curves for calibration and validation periods fig 5 and fig 6 respectively indicate the ability of the seven objective functions to simulate variability in daily streamflow this curve illustrates the goodness of fit for different flow ranges and the ability of simulations to reproduce the observed frequency of daily flows moriasi et al 2007 simolo et al 2010 at high flows i e top 25 quantile based on observations there was a general tendency to slightly under predict flow values in both calibration and validation periods fig 5 and fig 6 although over prediction of low flows is quite common in hydrological models our results showed moderate under prediction bias for both low i e bottom 25 quantile and medium flows during calibration and validation periods an extreme case of this tendency was schoharie in which most of the objective functions resulted in under predicting the flow on the other hand were cannonsville and pepacton with over estimation of low flows by most of the objective functions unlike other objective functions used to predict the simulations of4 constantly over predicted high flows and under predicted low flows though by only a small degree moreover the assessment of evaluation metrics showed better values for high flows in comparison to low and medium flows across all objective functions indicating the better ability of swat hs in predicting higher flow ranges 4 2 evaluation of bma models streamflow simulations and uncertainty assessment the simulated streamflow time series from the calibration and validation exercise discussed in the previous section which served as ensemble members in bma modeling did not follow a normal distribution in order to use the suggested bma method all these ensembles along with flow observations needed to pass through a data transformation procedure to resolve the non normality of the data and map them to an approximately gaussian space three data transformation techniques were chosen in this regard including log box cox power transformation and enqt which is a rank based transformation in fig 7 a it can be observed that the skewness of the data is mostly on the right hand side tail which corresponds to the peak flow values fig 7b and c show the similarity of the transformed data when log method and box cox were employed fig 7d presents a successful transformation of data graphed on the quantile quantile plot the kolmogorov smirnov test on the transformed data validated that all three transformation schemes were feasible and effective in normalizing the data to evaluate the validity of bma results the predictions were first reverted to their original space and were analyzed separately for calibration and validation periods verification statistics of the bma models are presented in table 5 further validity checks were performed comparing probability density function pdf and cumulative density function cdf of bmas with that of observations and deterministic predictions some of these results are presented in the supplementary material section s1 the details regarding bias correction parameters of ak and bk for all watersheds can also be found in the supplementary material section s2 having all nse and kge statistics on average higher than 0 65 for calibration and validation phases and rsr and pbias of less than 0 6 and 10 respectively across all watersheds and bma models proved the reliability of the bma results for uncertainty assessment having confirmed the reliability of bma models we examined the model weights before moving on to the assessment of the simulation uncertainties the weight associated with each ensemble prediction indicates the relative predictive ability of the ensemble therefore the higher the weight the better the performance of a particular ensemble in simulating the variable of interest in comparison to the other ensembles fig 8 demonstrates the estimated single set weights for bma1 bma2 and bma3 values of single set weights for bma1 bma2 and bma3 and multi set weights corresponding to each flow percentile for bma4 to bma6 along with standard deviation values are available in the supplementary material section s3 across all bma models only one or two ofs were the most dominant contributors to the model while the weights for the rest were insignificant result of averaging weight values of bma4 bma5 and bma6 over all percentiles not shown in fig 8 was consistent with weights estimated for bma1 bma2 and bma3 note that bma1 to bma3 were models performed on the entire time series while bma4 to bma6 were the ones performed on flow percentiles for most watersheds of2 had the largest weight indicating its high accuracy in streamflow simulations this is the ensemble prediction performed using mnse as the objective function mnse is a modified version ofnse which is less sensitive to the effect of extreme values the average weights associated to of2 across all watersheds for bma1 to bma6 were 0 5 0 53 0 42 0 24 0 24 and 0 27 respectively the exception was for neversink simulation for which of3 r2 and of5 pbias occupied the two highest weights of 0 29 and 0 35 respectively among all ensembles of4 br2 and of7 ssqr with the values of 0 06 and 0 05 had the lowest weights across bma models which is in accordance with the performance verification of ensembles presented in table 4 having nse of less than 0 65 and pbias of higher than 2 8 on average across all watersheds no evident pattern was observed when inspecting the weight performance of objective functions across flow percentiles between watersheds and there existed a large variability in bma weights two probabilistic verification uncertainty metrics of cr and br were quantified and are presented in table 6 for bma models and of1 a representative for uncertainty estimation of a single ensemble obtained for swat hs simulations of1 is the ensemble in which nse is employed as the objective function from quantitative indices in table 6 it can be seen that all bmas indicated the adequate characteristics of uncertainty interval in terms of cr 0 7 and br 1 5 across all watersheds this coupled with results from table 4 and table 5 shows the reliability of swat hs ensemble simulations cr and br values for bma models averaged at 0 96 and 0 88 respectively across all woh watersheds the lower values of cr averaging at 0 75 and br averaging at 0 47 estimated for of1 ensemble in comparison to corresponding values for bma1 through bma6 indicate that uncertainty interval characteristics are underestimated when only considering individual simulations rather than a set of plausible predictions fig 9 depicts the comparison between uncertainty intervals shapes derived for of1 and bma1 higher values of br obtained from bma models showed broader uncertainty interval width meaning existence of higher uncertainty level in simulations therefore lower model precision bmas higher cr values indicated higher model reliability statistical analysis performed on uncertainty interval characteristics also indicated the significant difference between model reliability and precision estimated for the of1 ensemble and obtained from bmas fig 10 summarizes the uncertainty interval characteristics values for all bmas across all woh watersheds comparison between bma models revealed the similarity of uncertainty interval characteristics derived from bma1 with bma2 and bma4 with bma5 for each watershed bma1 and bma4 are models with log transformation and bma2 and bma5 are the ones with box cox transformation log transformation is a special case of the box cox method when the power for transforming the data into gaussian space is zero investigating the power derived for this study s streamflow data proved the power to be close to zero explaining the similarity of the two data transformations results from the results presented in table 6 and depicted in fig 10 it is evident that the width of uncertainty intervals associated to bma4 through bma6 are narrower br averaging at 0 7 in comparison to bma1 through bma3 1 06 indicating higher precision estimation for swat hs simulations when using split flow approach the width of uncertainty interval was significantly different for bma models applying split flow approach compared to models with the complete flow approach indicating the dependency of model precision estimation on the bma setup illustration of uncertainty interval associated with bma1 and bma4 in fig 11 also confirms this fact it is noteworthy to mention that cr values for these two sets of models were close 0 95 for bma1 through bma3 and 0 96 for bma4 through bma6 this shows the consistency of the bma models in estimating swat hs reliability in fig 11 the shape of uncertainty interval for bma4 shows multiple locations of discontinuity throughout the time series similar shape of uncertainty interval was also observed for bma5 and bma6 these discontinuities occurred at the location of flow percentiles in split flow approach the flow is divided at percentile thresholds and a separate normal distribution is considered for each later on the posterior distributions of predictions are integrated for the entire simulation period due to this process the discontinuities in uncertainty interval form along the time period although split flow approach proved to be effective in improving predictions it did not seem to be suitable for uncertainty presentation purposes the quantifications and shapes of uncertainty interval obtained from bmas produced similar results across woh watersheds for both calibration and validation periods to look at the precision and reliability of swat hs simulations at different flow ranges the streamflow at the outlet of each watershed was classified into three ranges low flow i e bottom 25 quantile based on observations medium flow i e middle 50 quantile and high flow i e top 25 quantile the uncertainty interval characteristics for various flow ranges were summarized and are presented in table 7 for of1 and bma models which are the average values derived from bmas for each flow range the cr and br values respectively averaging at 0 81 and 3 17 for low flow 0 64 and 2 21 for medium flow and 0 52 and 0 72 for high flow derived for of1 indicated the underestimations of these parameters in each flow range in comparison to bma models cr and br values derived from bmas were 0 96 and 3 98 low flow and 0 97 and 3 48 medium flow on average respectively for high flow cr and br values were 0 93 and 1 36 respectively table 7 shows that both cr and br values dropped from low flow to high flow consistently across all the watersheds for calibration and validation periods this in turn makes it difficult to conduct a comparison between flow ranges uncertainty intervals as cr and br have opposite relations and lower cr is not ideal a sign of low reliability while lower br is ideal indicating high precision certainty of the model predictions higher values of br 3 73 were associated with low and medium flows meaning less precision and certainty in the capability of swat hs to predict such flows at the same time high cr values averaging at 0 96 associated to these flow ranges indicated high reliability of the model on the contrary br value of 1 36 for high flow translated into higher precision of swat hs in predicting such flow range in comparison to low and medium flows while the model reliability for higher flow ranges was slightly lower than that of lower flow ranges fig 12 illustrates variability of cr and br values between bma models in form of ranges for low medium and high flows in case of low and medium flows bma results displayed higher variability of uncertainty interval widths 1 45 7 73 while the estimated cr values were close 0 90 0 99 the opposite held true for high flow as bma models showed relatively closer estimations for br 0 76 2 13 but higher variability for cr 0 85 0 98 this behavior was consistent across all watersheds for low medium and high flows indicating the different characteristics of uncertainty interval and hence estimation of swat hs precision and reliability when using different bma model setups despite the high variation of br values cr values across woh watersheds were higher than 0 8 and even up to 0 99 for all flow ranges shown in fig 12 this exhibits high reliability of swat hs with uncertainty interval which bracketed more than 85 of high flow observations and more than 90 of low and medium flows note that despite having straight lines for each flow range in fig 12 the relationship between cr and br of different bma models was not linear and lines in this graph only represent the range of changes for cr and br separately 5 discussion as stated earlier the precision and reliability of a prediction uncertainty interval are measured by the two indexes of band width and containing ratio cr respectively while the ideal measure of cr is 1 meaning the uncertainty interval encompasses all the observation a cr percentage equal to the coverage percentage of the uncertainty interval is satisfactory dong et al 2013b showed improvement of cr values from the range of 9 81 for ensemble members to the value of around 82 for the bma model with a multi model and multiple objective ensemble zhang et al 2009 obtained cr of higher than 91 calibration and 92 validation when constructing ensembles of 2 to 6 models predictions in the he et al 2018 study cr values ranged from 87 to 92 for the calibration period and 88 to 92 for the validation period when employing a 3 model ensemble in three bma scenarios of bma cbma and cbp bma wang et al 2020 also showed similar results for cr of 94 44 and 91 76 for calibration and validation periods when employing a 3 model ensemble in all of these studies cr is calculated for the 90 prediction uncertainty interval therefore a cr value of close to 90 was expected for the 95 uncertainty interval vrugt and robinson 2007 study resulted in cr values of 94 to 98 when using an 8 model ensemble for four bma scenarios cr values of 97 and 98 5 were also obtained from the wagena et al 2019 study of a bma scheme for calibration and validation periods respectively in this study an ensemble of 3 models two of which were swat vsa and swat st models calibrated using sufi 2 was used for two bma schemes the result of the other scheme bgmm is cr values equal to 96 3 and 97 for the calibration and validation periods respectively in the strauch et al 2012 study which employed a multi input ensemble derived from calibration of swat models using sufi 2 method in two bma schemes cr values improved from 82 to 93 to 96 for the calibration period and from 47 to 87 to 98 for the validation period in a similar study neto et al 2018 exhibited cr values of 98 calibration and 90 validation for bma in comparison with the values for ensemble members constructed from different configurations of a swat model that were calibrated using sufi 2 82 93 for calibration and 64 91 for validation darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 also obtained cr values between 86 and 96 in their study the effect of using different data transformation procedures pdf types used in the bma scheme and standard deviation types was analyzed on the prediction improvement as well as uncertainty estimation for streamflow similar to the aforementioned studies cr values obtained in our study range from 94 to 98 for the entire flow ranges this shows a difference of less than 3 with the 95 prediction uncertainty interval and the effectiveness of multiple objective functions based ensemble approach in improving uncertainty estimations the most similar study to ours is the darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 study and the closest scenarios for which they provided results are the ones that are constructed using normal distribution and different data transformations for two types of individual non constant and common non constant constant value standard deviation forms these scenarios are similar to bma1 bma2 and bma3 the only difference between the scenarios and this study s model is that the standard deviation is considered common and constant for the models in our study same as darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 results cr values are very close for different data transformation with only an insignificant deterioration when applying enqt data transformation in our results uncertainty interval band width is the narrowest for box cox data transformation while the other two data transformations have the same results no such conclusion can be drawn from the darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 study similar to their study we confirm that none of data transformations are superior to the others however applying log transformation is more straightforward than the other two methods for uncertainty interval width studies mostly have provided exact band width b values with flow unit instead of br that is a dimensionless measure b can be obtained by multiplying br with the observations standard deviation for example in vrugt and robinson 2007 and darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 studies b was between 52 to 55 m3 s and 17 to 127 m3 s for the 95 uncertainty interval for different bma scenarios for the 90 uncertainty interval the values of b ranged between 38 to 59 m3 s and 13 to 44 m3 s in he et al 2018 and dong et al 2013a studies respectively in our study b is measured between 14 21 to 36 57 m3 s for the 95 uncertainty interval among all bma models across woh watersheds the difference between b and br makes it difficult to compare this index among studies in the strauch et al 2012 and neto et al 2018 studies however values of br are provided for both ensemble members and bma models these two studies are both based on multi input ensemble construction in the strauch et al 2012 study br ranged from 0 8 to 0 97 calibration and 0 8 1 4 validation for the ensemble while these values increased to 1 25 calibration and 1 9 validation for the two bma schemes employed based on the neto et al 2018 study br ranged from 0 82 to 1 calibration and 0 62 0 89 validation for ensemble members and increased to 1 29 calibration and 1 15 validation for bma this shows an average difference of 64 strauch et al 2012 and 50 neto et al 2018 between br values for ensemble members and bma models these outcomes are consistent with our results which exhibit an increase of around 60 on average in br values after bma analysis when analyzing characteristics of uncertainty interval for flow ranges our results are not always consistent with other studies cr values in both dong et al 2013a and dong et al 2013b studies mostly decrease from high flow to low flow while uncertainty interval narrows down at the same time showing low reliability of low flow predictions in another study wagena et al 2019 also mentioned the existence of a wider b for high flow in their result on the contrary in our study both cr and br values increase from high flow to low flow similar to our results is vrugt and robinson 2007 study in which values of cr are higher for low flow ranges from dong et al 2013b study in which they provided the uncertainty interval s measures of the ensemble members we noted that the change in uncertainty interval characteristics obtained from bma analysis is similar to that of a single model prediction this fact also holds true in our study as the ensemble members uncertainty intervals for low flow ranges have larger cr and wider uncertainty band while high flow ranges have smaller cr and narrower interval see values associated to of1 in table 7 this means that the characteristics of uncertainty interval for an ensemble are impacting the uncertainty interval obtained from bma based on conducted comparisons our approach shows compatible results to other studies however more research has to be done to investigate the superiority inferiority of this method to other ensemble construction methods such as multi model or multi model structures moreover quantifying and comparing dimensionless band width ratio can also give useful information regarding the acquired precision of the approaches employed 6 conclusion the results of this study proves the general ability of swat hs to simulate streamflow for all nyc west of hudson watersheds the performance evaluation metrics of nse kge rsr and pbias for calibration and validation processes showed good results when employing different objective functions to optimize model parameters nse and kge averaged above 0 65 for both calibration and validation periods across all watersheds when comparing simulated daily time series with observations while rsr and pbias stayed relatively low no significant differences in the performance of swat hs were observed among the six watersheds however some watersheds simulations exhibited overall underestimation of low flow e g schoharie or overestimation of it e g pepacton the prediction bias for high flow was approximately the same for all watersheds despite the overall good performance of swat hs the common calibration method of sufi 2 for swat models only includes uncertainties conditioned on the objective function used in this study bma analysis was performed on an ensemble of predictions based on multiple objective functions to improve and quantify the uncertainty in swat hs streamflow simulations comparison of 95 prediction uncertainty interval characteristics obtained from bma analysis with that of behavioral sets simulated during the calibration process indicated that uncertainty interval characteristics was underestimated when using a single objective function thus indicating the advantage of a calibration based on multiple objective functions the underestimation of uncertainty interval characteristics by a single ensemble member was also confirmed for various flow ranges uncertainty interval characteristics were quantified for six different bma models all of which exhibited consistent results for entire flow and different flow ranges i e low medium and high flow and across all woh watersheds bma model setups included combining three data transformations and two flow approaches resulting in six bma models among three data transformation considered for normalizing streamflow simulations the uncertainties obtained from bma models which had log transformations were found to be in very close agreement with the uncertainties obtained with box cox transformation the comparison between bma models performed using complete flow approach versus the ones performed using split flow approach revealed the differences in characteristics of the 95 uncertainty intervals while the containing ratio values for all bmas were close the uncertainty intervals obtained from the models constructed on flow percentiles had narrower band width indicating higher precision and higher certainty of simulations however the shape of the uncertainty interval displayed locations of discontinuity at flow percentile thresholds making it less favorable when analyzing uncertainty therefore caution is recommended when utilizing this approach for uncertainty analysis in summary employing an ensemble of predictions from multiple objective functions improves the uncertainty assessments for entire flow as well as various flow ranges overall containing ratio averaged at higher than 0 95 and band width ratios were less than 0 9 for all watersheds across all bmas this signifies that more than 95 of the observations are captured by the uncertainty interval with a high level of precision for various flow ranges results of bma uncertainty analysis revealed that containing ratio values were higher than 0 85 with an average of 0 95 and a maximum value of 0 99 this means that 85 99 of the observed streamflow values were encompassed by the uncertainty band indicating the reliability of swat hs however the values of bandwidth showed that the sharpness of the results deteriorated in medium and low flows in comparison to high flow simulations another advantage of applying model averaging techniques such as bma is their ability in identifying the higher performing ensemble among all plausible simulations in this case simulation derived from applying mnse objective function was proven to outperform other simulations with having a larger weight assigned to its simulations when performing bma approach credit authorship contribution

2282,in this paper multiple objective functions were used to conduct uncertainty analysis on calibrated streamflow simulations of swat hillslope model swat hs which is a semi distributed model suited for humid mountainous regions swat hs was set up for six watersheds of nyc water supply system and streamflow was simulated at a daily time step each swat hs model setup was then passed through a calibration process for parameter optimization this process involved constraining the model using several alternative objective functions which produce statistically acceptable streamflow simulations which served as an ensemble of predictions for uncertainty analysis we hypothesize that the uncertainty introduced by selecting a single objective function can be large with each objective function being sensitive to a specific hydrologic signature using multiple objective functions result in a wider range in optimum parameter values and an ensemble of simulations based on different objective functions can capture the overall prediction uncertainty through differences in parameter estimates the bayesian model averaging bma method was then applied to ensemble predictions to quantify overall prediction uncertainty the uncertainty analysis showed the similarity of uncertainty interval characteristics for all bma based predictions across all watersheds more than 94 97 of the observations were covered by uncertainty intervals estimated using multiple objective functions when compared to 73 79 of the observations when using a single objective function no significant differences were observed among the six watersheds and the results of their uncertainty analysis were similar we propose the use of multiple objective functions as an option in ensemble modeling of streamflow and uncertainty analysis keywords bayesian model averaging prediction uncertainty reliability precision objective function streamflow data availability the data used for the research are publicly available 1 introduction uncertainty analysis is an important part of hydrological modeling as it is essential in evaluating the strength of a calibrated model in many studies it is important to present model predictions in the form of an uncertainty interval rather than a single value as the best estimation when predicting a variable of interest different models weigh differently towards various aspects of processes being modeled due to a plethora of underlying factors governing such processes that have to be estimated and formulated although each of these models may produce acceptable predictions the predictions may differ since the models do not consider all aspects of a process darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 on the other hand within a single model there exist empirical parameters whose values cannot be measured directly and are usually optimized through a calibration process in the calibration process the optimized values of model parameters are estimated by constraining the simulation errors through verification metrics usually called objective functions many different objective functions have been developed and formulated to serve various purposes therefore based on the choice of objective function the calibration process may result in different sets of parameter values which produce statistically acceptable predictions however in significantly different locations in the parameter space abbaspour et al 2017 hence picking only one model between many plausible models or one single simulation driven from one set of optimized parameters within a single model as superior in all conditions underestimates the uncertainty and reduces the reliability of predictions the uncertainty estimated in this manner which is the initial approach in hydrological studies only accounts for model data mismatches and does not include calibration and between model uncertainties vrugt and robinson 2007 to overcome this problem several techniques have been developed and utilized to incorporate predictions from different sources such as various competing models or alternative methods within a model to account for all possible causes of uncertainty and to quantify and assess it while early techniques used neural networks and fuzzy systems the use of bayes theorem has been growing over the past 20 years dong et al 2013a among the methods developed based on this theorem is bayesian model averaging bma which has been used most intensively and widely due to its simplicity and easy applicability bma is a statistical method that uses the probability density function pdf of an ensemble to quantify the predictive uncertainty and provide probabilistic results darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 in the physical sciences and engineering including earth and atmospheric sciences bma has been used frequently for prediction improvement and uncertainty analysis while in the social and health sciences it has been often used for model selection purposes fragoso et al 2018 ensemble members integrated using bma can come from different sources these sources in hydrological modeling are predictions generated from a combination of 1 various existing models 2 different model structures 3 different model inputs and 4 model calibrations using different objective functions while constructing an ensemble from various models and model structures has been the focus of many studies to improve the predictions and uncertainty estimations the approach of using ensembles derived solely from calibrating one model using various objective functions is less explored such multiple objective predictions are often combined with multi model predictions to construct an ensemble as an example zhang et al 2009 used different swat model structures by selecting different evapotranspiration and flow routing algorithms calibrated using genetic algorithms to create ensembles of two to six models and to characterize uncertainty induced by the model structure madadgar and moradkhani 2014 explored the difference between uncertainty characteristics generated from bma and their proposed copula embedded bma cop bma method in their research seven streamflow predictions were obtained from three conceptual lumped rainfall runoff models sac gr4j and swb and four land surface models isba noah swap and vic all of which served as ensembles for the two bma and cop bma schemes wagena et al 2019 quantified and compared prediction uncertainty for flow sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp estimated using two bayesian models a bma model and a bayesian generalized non linear multilevel to compare the results three ensembles generated from the soil and water assessment tool variable source area model swat vsa the standard soil and water assessment tool swat st and the chesapeake bay program s phase 6 watershed model cbp model all calibrated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function were used in the bma modeling process in the study conducted by viney et al 2009 an ensemble of 10 models with different complexities was constructed to investigate streamflow prediction improvement he et al 2018 conducted uncertainty analysis comparison between three bma schemes bma copula bma cbma and copula bayesian processor associated with bma cbp bma utilizing a multi model ensemble approach strauch et al 2012 used four different precipitation data sources as inputs to a swat model to create a 4 member ensemble for two bma schemes investigating improvement of streamflow predictions similarly in the neto et al 2018 study two precipitation data sources and various spatial interpolation schemes were used to construct a 5 member multi input ensemble by applying different configurations of a swat model of the few studies in which predictions of objective functions are included is a publication by dong et al 2013b in which three hydrological models were calibrated using three objective functions favoring different flow ranges to construct a 9 member ensemble in a bma scheme to investigate streamflow prediction uncertainty in another study three conceptual hydrological rainfall runoff models were incorporated with four designed objective functions for calibrating the models to create two distinctive bma schemes one with three ensemble members and another with nine in order to test the capability of bma in assessing the uncertainty dong et al 2013a duan et al 2007 also explored the improvement of streamflow predictions when using three conceptual hydrological models of sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma simple water balance swb and the hymod model calibrated using three objective functions darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 looked at the bma performance when considering three ensembles coming from 1 different hydrological models multi model 2 combination of using different input in different models multi model multi input 3 combination of using different models when applying various parameter sets multi model multi parameter and 4 combination of using different models inputs and parameters multi model multi input multi parameter m mip they also compared the results of several bma scenarios constructed using different data transformations distribution types standard deviation forms and optimization methods setting up a suite of plausible hydrological models for practical applications can be a computationally intensive and time consuming process requiring quantification and estimation of many different parameters for each model therefore we shifted our focus solely on considering an ensemble of predictions coming from various objective functions each of which holds distinctive advantages in modeling certain flow ranges e g peaks medium and low flows moreover we present a comparison of streamflow prediction uncertainties quantified using different setups of a bma model to analyze their effect on uncertainty estimation these setups were obtained by employing three data transformation techniques and two flow split selection approaches ensemble predictions considered in this study are streamflow simulations generated using a semi distributed model called swat hillslope swat hs a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swat for simulating variable source area vsa hydrology in mountainous regions with humid climate this model gives a better estimation of surface runoff and has the ability to predict the location of saturated areas both of which are key elements in transferring substances from upland areas to the valley bottom and eventually to the receiving waterbody swat hs model was first applied and tested for town brook new york state usa a small 37 km2 headwater watershed in the catskill mountains which showed its ability in predicting streamflow and saturated excess runoff with reasonable accuracy when compared to field observations hoang et al 2017 later hoang et al 2019 presented a scaled up application of the model to the 1178 km2 cannonsville reservoir watershed encompassing town brook to evaluate the model performance in predicting soluble p total dissolved p particulate p and sediment total suspended solids the town brook and cannonsville watersheds are a part of new york city s water supply system located in catskill mountains of new york state and includes five additional reservoirs and associated watersheds located west of the hudson river having proven the suitability and accuracy of swat hs model when applied in this region we have applied the model to all six west of hudson woh watersheds fig 1 streamflow simulations for each watershed were evaluated using bma models composed of seven ensemble members derived from employing seven objective functions used for optimization and parameterization of swat hs uncertainty analysis was performed separately for each watershed and a comparison between uncertainty characteristics obtained using different bma models is also presented 2 materials study area the catskill and delaware systems of new york city s drinking water supply are located west of the hudson river and include six reservoirs which provide 90 of the supply fig 1 these include ashokan and schoharie in the catskill system and cannonsville neversink pepacton and rondout in the delaware system this region is characterized by humid climate with an average annual temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 1123 mm year hoang et al 2017 the catskill system which provides 40 of the drinking water supply is characterized by forested watersheds and relatively higher elevation and rugged terrain with complex glacial geology and fast flowing streams during rainfall and snowmelt events elevated turbidity may occur and impact the quality of water supply cannonsville and pepacton on the other hand are in the delaware system which has a higher proportion of agricultural land due to higher level of agricultural activity the control of phosphorus loads from both point and non point sources to the reservoirs has been the main subject of watershed protection plans for these two watersheds the tributary system in the region is very well developed and main streams are perennial with their peak flow in mid spring and late fall each watershed has a main inflow contributor which carries most of the water into its associated reservoir the combination of humid climate and physical characteristics of the region such as ample vegetation and well structured soils has created an ideal situation for formation of saturated areas and the occurrence of saturation excess runoff throughout the region this phenomenon has been confirmed via field observations by identifying and mapping the saturated areas hoang et al 2017 the dominance of saturation excess runoff also contributes to sediment and nutrient transport to the reservoirs 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model setup the swat hs model was set up for each of the six watersheds the hydrologic response unit hru is the smallest areal component considered in swat hs with each hru characterized by a unique combination of land use soil type and wetness class the input layers used to identify hrus included a digital elevation model dem soil map wetness map and land use map watershed delineation and discretization of hydrologic response units hrus is achieved by overlaying these layers the physical properties of each hru are determined based on their spatial location in the watershed a full description of swat hs model can be found in the hoang et al 2017 study the land use map of each watershed was derived from classified 2009 aerial photography data obtained from new york city department of environmental protection nyc dep the land use and land cover classifications of this map were simplified and adjusted based on the standardized classification provided in the swat model specifications other inputs to swat hs are soil map and a wetness class map the soil map used was extracted from the ssurgo database usda nrcs 2012 a wetness map is a conceptual map dividing the watershed based on soil water storage capacity from downslope to upslope regions and the likelihood of occurrence of saturation this specification of hillslope improves the simulation of lateral and surface runoff from upslope drier wetness classes to downslope wetter wetness classes the topographic wetness index twi is used to delineate wetness classes agnew et al 2006 hoang et al 2017 twi is derived from the fraction of upslope contributing area per unit contour length and the local surface topographic slope both calculated using a 10 meter dem of the watersheds watersheds were discretized into areas associated with 10 wetness classes which were then combined with the soil map daily precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate data daly et al 2008 available in a 4 km by 4 km gridded format were used to drive the model solar radiation and relative humidity were computed for the same grids using mt clim hungerford et al 1989 running et al 1987 a climate interpolation model that estimates solar radiation and relative humidity as functions of air temperature and precipitation for model calibration and validation the usgs gauging stations at the main inflow location of each watershed to its reservoir were used these stations have long term records of daily discharge measurements which is the time step required for swat hs modeling details regarding these stations are presented in fig 1 and table 1 3 2 swat hs model calibration the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup calibration software abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate simulated streamflow to usgs gauge observations the calibration and validation periods were 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 respectively fourteen parameters averaged over the watershed surface and related to processes including snowmelt surface runoff lateral flow groundwater contribution and evapotranspiration as described in table 2 hoang et al 2017 were calibrated by conducting two to three iterations of 2000 simulations each a parameter set for each simulation was generated using a latin hypercube sampling procedure which reduces the number of simulations required for calibration compared to a random sampling procedure the suggested parameter ranges from each iteration were used for subsequent iterations resulting in a narrow range of parameter values and therefore predictive uncertainty the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as a reference for reducing the parameter space parameter ranges used in the final iteration of the calibration period were utilized for a single iteration with 2000 simulations for the validation period having calibrated and validated swat hs for each watershed a set of behavioral parameters nse 0 65 were estimated using swat cup from which the best parameter combinations that optimized each objective function were selected swat cup provides eleven predefined objective functions to generate the best parameter set satisfying the constraint chosen for the objective function from the final iteration we chose the best simulated time series for seven objective functions that gave unique parameter sets and therefore seven unique streamflow time series the seven time series formed the ensemble members for uncertainty analysis in a bma procedure the chosen objective functions were nash sutcliffe efficiency modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse regression coefficient r2 modified regression coefficient br2 sum of the squares of residuals ssqr percent bias pbias and kling gupta efficiency kge abbaspour 2014 while using r2 and br2 objective functions aim to minimize the error variance between simulated and measured data using nse and mnse maximizes the ability of the model to replicate temporal trends in measured data tolson and shoemaker 2007 the ssqr focuses on fitting the frequency distributions of the observed and the simulated series while pbias minimizes the overall underestimation and overestimation bias and tries to improve the predictions for the average of the measured data the kge is an objective function that is less sensitive to high values providing a better estimate of model predictions over the entire flow range each of the selected objective function results in a model parameterization that generates simulations which are statistically acceptable while being different from each other in the rest of this paper we refer to nse mnse r2 br2 pbias kge and ssqr objective functions as of1 to of7 respectively table 3 3 3 bayesian model averaging overview and bma model setup bma is a statistical method which combines pdfs of the ensemble members using bayes theorem to produce a single forecast pdf bayes rule defines the relationship between prior ensemble pdfs and posterior forecast probability distribution based on which the probabilistic prediction of bma for the variable q is given by 1 p q f 1 f k k 1 k w k g k q f k where q is the quantity to be predicted on the basis of input predictions f1 fk wk is the posterior probability of the kth input prediction kth ensemble member this value reflects how well model fk fits observed data each deterministic prediction of fk must be bias corrected using various techniques one of which is linear regression resulting in substitution of fk with the bias corrected term of ak bkfk in eq 1 gk q fk is the conditional pdf of q conditional on fk provided that the underlying variable belongs to gaussian space the conditional pdf can be approximated using a normal distribution therefore the bma predictive mean can be expressed as 2 e q f 1 f k k 1 k w k a k b k f k where 3 q f 1 f k n a k b k f k σ k 2 wk and σk k 1 k in these equations can be estimated employing maximum likelihood method fisher 1922 from the training data for algebraic simplicity and numerical stability the logarithmic form of likelihood function log likelihood for the bma model can be considered which is defined as

problem stated in eq 4 can be solved through an iterative process and the two associated parameters of mean eq 2 and variance eq 5 for prior bma predictions can be calculated 5 v a r q t f 1 t f kt k 1 k w k a k b k f kt i 1 k w i a i b i f it 2 σ k 2 the bma mean prediction is a weighted average of the individual ensemble predictions with their posterior probabilities being the weights moges et al 2021 the weights reflect the ensemble members relative contribution to predictive skill over the training period hence it makes bma a suitable method for model selection purposes in addition to uncertainty analysis fragoso et al 2018 the variance is the uncertainty associated with bma mean prediction which consists of between model and within model errors dong et al 2013b these two errors are left and right terms of eq 5 s right hand side respectively the advantage of this method lies in its ability to reduce overfitting while improving the final performance when restricting standard deviation parameters σk to be constant σ across all ensemble members sloughter et al 2010 in this study we used ensemblebma package fraley et al 2013 to conduct normal bma analysis and derive bma probabilistic ensemble prediction for any time t for 2001 to 2018 along with the 95 prediction interval the predictions generated using the seven objective functions served as ensemble members for the explained normal bma analysis unlike the calibration procedure described in the previous section a benefit of bma is that it does not require development of metrics to penalize component forecasts for the number of parameters included the number of covariates or their complexity montgomery et al 2012 this makes it a reliable method to analyze uncertainty the normal bma can be used provided that the variable of interest and its ensemble predictions all follow normal probability distribution however streamflow is known to be skewed towards peak values and log normal gamma or weibull distributions may be better candidates to describe such behavior langat et al 2019 to overcome this problem and use the proposed bma analysis a data transformation procedure is required to map the streamflow values from their original space to a gaussian space it has to be noted that such transformations inevitably lead to a deterioration in peak flow sharpness darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 in this study we designed multiple setups for bma model construction to explore the sensitivity of uncertainty to bma methodology and to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the bma probabilistic results when employing different approaches to build a bma model to this end we considered three data transformations including logarithmic box cox and the empirical normal quantile transformation enqt peng et al 2007 applied on the entire time series complete flow approach and on flow percentiles percentile split flow approach the latter case percentile split flow approach is proposed by duan et al 2007 in which the flow distribution is divided into several percentiles and bma is applied to each independently this approach primarily introduced and applied to improve predictions by combining various model s simulations considering these model setups we ended up having six bma models i e bma1 log transformation complete flow approach bma2 box cox transformation complete flow approach bma3 enqt transformation complete flow approach bma4 log transformation percentile split flow approach bma5 box cox transformation percentile split flow approach bma6 enqt transformation percentile split flow approach fig 2 flow split ranges considered for bma4 to bma6 were 0 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 percentiles for bma1 to bma3 the normal bma procedure was applied to the entire transformed time series resulting in a single set of bma weights and standard deviations for each bma model of each watershed for bma4 to bma6 the transformed streamflow values were broken into the mentioned flow ranges and then the normal bma was applied to each flow range separately resulting in multiple sets of weights and standard deviations observations the bma post processed predictions and 95 bma prediction intervals upper and lower limits were integrated in case of flow percentile separation for bma4 to bma6 and then reverted back to their original space non gaussian before further performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis 3 4 performance evaluation and uncertainty assessment criteria to evaluate the performance of simulated streamflow time series for each objective function and for each bma model four statistical metrics including nse kge pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr were employed these metrics were calculated separately for the calibration period 2001 2010 and the validation period 2011 2018 the nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line with a great emphasis on fitted peak values values of nse ranging from 0 to 1 are considered acceptable with higher values indicating better model performance moriasi et al 2007 the kge which is formulated based on flow variability bias and correlations terms is less sensitive to high streamflow values than the nse and provides a better performance measure at all streamflow ranges radcliffe and mukundan 2017 while a kge value of 1 indicates a perfect fit 0 75 kge 0 9 is considered good 0 5 kge 0 75 is intermediate and 0 0 kge 0 5 is poor tsegaw et al 2020 rsr metric is the standardized root means square error rmse which is obtained by dividing the rmse by the standard deviation of the observations the lower the rsr the better the model performance however a rsr of 0 5 is considered low and hence satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 last metric we considered for model performance evaluation was pbias which identifies overall model underestimation positive values and overestimation negative values with absolute value of less than 10 considered as very good between 10 and 15 as good and larger than 25 as unsatisfactory for streamflow simulations moriasi et al 2007 we also employed two verification criteria to quantify the characteristics of prediction uncertainty interval these metrics were containing ratio cr which is defined by the percentage of observations bracketed by the uncertainty interval and average band width ratio br which is the ratio of the average width of the uncertainty interval and the standard deviation of the measured data abbaspour et al 2004 he et al 2018 yang et al 2008 6 cr i 1 n q i l q i o q i u n 7 br 1 n i 1 n q i u q i l σ o where qi l and qi u are the lower and upper bounds corresponding to 2 5 and 97 5 quantile at the time t respectively in eq 6 the numerator is the number of the observed data points qi o that fall within the lower and upper bounds and σ o eq 7 is the standard deviation of the observations cr is an indicator for the goodness of the uncertainty interval therefore a cr value of one is considered to be ideal in general a smaller difference between the cr value in percentage and the expected coverage percentage of an uncertainty interval indicates better performance zhang et al 2009 for example a cr value of closer to 0 95 95 is the satisfactory value when computed for the 95 uncertainty interval on the other hand small values of br indicate reduced uncertainty or greater precision and values 1 are considered satisfactory the cr and br are also used for measuring the reliability of the model and quantifying the sharpness of the results respectively darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 albeit for the 95 uncertainty interval cr values of higher than 0 7 and br values of less than 1 5 are recommended to be adequate when simulating streamflow abbaspour et al 2015 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual model streamflow simulations one source of model uncertainty as mentioned earlier arises from non uniqueness of model parameter values during calibration process abbaspour et al 2017 kouchi et al 2017 fig 3 indicates the value of each parameter based on the selection of objective function for each watershed in this figure each objective function is shown using a different symbol and the shaded band represents the behavioral range for snowmelt parameters of sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and timp the graphs indicate only one value for all objective functions this is due to the two stage calibration process we carried out in the first stage only the snowmelt parameters were calibrated based on nse as objective function and their optimized value was used in the second stage when calibrating flow related parameters and producing behavioral parameter set this method is suggested by hoang et al 2017 to improve the calculation of water balance in the watershed as observed from the graphs in fig 3 although each simulation produced by considering different objective functions was acceptable their associated parameter sets fell at different locations in the parameter space in some cases such as latb parameter for rondout watershed the calibrated values were close while in other cases parameter values were located at the far ends of the parameter range for some objective functions e g surlag for ashokan this reflects the parameter uncertainty which arises from the different structure of each objective function evaluation coefficients of nse kge rsr and pbias for simulations using the seven objective functions versus daily streamflow observations were calculated to investigate the accuracy of the results statistical evaluation of each objective function showed good calibration performance based on model evaluation criteria presented by moriasi et al 2007 as results in table 4 show nse and kge values averaged at 0 66 and 0 77 respectively across all watersheds for the calibration period similarly for the validation period the daily streamflow simulations were good with performance statistics of nse and kge averaged at 0 63 and 0 77 respectively the pbias values averaged at 4 29 and 3 76 for the calibration and validation periods for all objective functions and watersheds however there existed some exceptions for which the verification metrics fell below or outside the range considered good model performance for example of4 s measures of nse and rsr were 0 39 and 0 78 respectively for rondout watershed for the calibration period which is acceptable but not satisfactory in this case however kge and pbias results were very good being 0 66 and 2 1 respectively another example is when pbias was 15 9 for the validation period for pepacton watershed this value belonged to of3 simulation and despite rsr being slightly high both nse and kge values were good overall of4 simulations which were optimized based on the br2 objective function had the lowest performance across all watersheds for both calibration and validation periods however not below satisfactory comparisons between calibration and validation periods showed slight decrease in the performance for most watersheds except ashokan and rondout for which model performance had improved during the validation period what is also noticeable in table 4 is that ashokan and rondout simulations derived from all objective functions generally underestimated the daily streamflow at their outlets for both calibration and validation periods the opposite was true for pepacton for which streamflow values were overestimated for schoharie and neversink all calibration simulations were underestimated while the same pattern was not observed for the validation period and some objective functions had a positive pbias value while others had negative for cannonsville the situation was the opposite while most of the simulations were underestimated in the calibration period all of them showed underestimation in the validation period overall visual inspection of time series for 2001 to 2018 showed that all simulations captured the flow variation very well fig 4 streamflow duration curves for calibration and validation periods fig 5 and fig 6 respectively indicate the ability of the seven objective functions to simulate variability in daily streamflow this curve illustrates the goodness of fit for different flow ranges and the ability of simulations to reproduce the observed frequency of daily flows moriasi et al 2007 simolo et al 2010 at high flows i e top 25 quantile based on observations there was a general tendency to slightly under predict flow values in both calibration and validation periods fig 5 and fig 6 although over prediction of low flows is quite common in hydrological models our results showed moderate under prediction bias for both low i e bottom 25 quantile and medium flows during calibration and validation periods an extreme case of this tendency was schoharie in which most of the objective functions resulted in under predicting the flow on the other hand were cannonsville and pepacton with over estimation of low flows by most of the objective functions unlike other objective functions used to predict the simulations of4 constantly over predicted high flows and under predicted low flows though by only a small degree moreover the assessment of evaluation metrics showed better values for high flows in comparison to low and medium flows across all objective functions indicating the better ability of swat hs in predicting higher flow ranges 4 2 evaluation of bma models streamflow simulations and uncertainty assessment the simulated streamflow time series from the calibration and validation exercise discussed in the previous section which served as ensemble members in bma modeling did not follow a normal distribution in order to use the suggested bma method all these ensembles along with flow observations needed to pass through a data transformation procedure to resolve the non normality of the data and map them to an approximately gaussian space three data transformation techniques were chosen in this regard including log box cox power transformation and enqt which is a rank based transformation in fig 7 a it can be observed that the skewness of the data is mostly on the right hand side tail which corresponds to the peak flow values fig 7b and c show the similarity of the transformed data when log method and box cox were employed fig 7d presents a successful transformation of data graphed on the quantile quantile plot the kolmogorov smirnov test on the transformed data validated that all three transformation schemes were feasible and effective in normalizing the data to evaluate the validity of bma results the predictions were first reverted to their original space and were analyzed separately for calibration and validation periods verification statistics of the bma models are presented in table 5 further validity checks were performed comparing probability density function pdf and cumulative density function cdf of bmas with that of observations and deterministic predictions some of these results are presented in the supplementary material section s1 the details regarding bias correction parameters of ak and bk for all watersheds can also be found in the supplementary material section s2 having all nse and kge statistics on average higher than 0 65 for calibration and validation phases and rsr and pbias of less than 0 6 and 10 respectively across all watersheds and bma models proved the reliability of the bma results for uncertainty assessment having confirmed the reliability of bma models we examined the model weights before moving on to the assessment of the simulation uncertainties the weight associated with each ensemble prediction indicates the relative predictive ability of the ensemble therefore the higher the weight the better the performance of a particular ensemble in simulating the variable of interest in comparison to the other ensembles fig 8 demonstrates the estimated single set weights for bma1 bma2 and bma3 values of single set weights for bma1 bma2 and bma3 and multi set weights corresponding to each flow percentile for bma4 to bma6 along with standard deviation values are available in the supplementary material section s3 across all bma models only one or two ofs were the most dominant contributors to the model while the weights for the rest were insignificant result of averaging weight values of bma4 bma5 and bma6 over all percentiles not shown in fig 8 was consistent with weights estimated for bma1 bma2 and bma3 note that bma1 to bma3 were models performed on the entire time series while bma4 to bma6 were the ones performed on flow percentiles for most watersheds of2 had the largest weight indicating its high accuracy in streamflow simulations this is the ensemble prediction performed using mnse as the objective function mnse is a modified version ofnse which is less sensitive to the effect of extreme values the average weights associated to of2 across all watersheds for bma1 to bma6 were 0 5 0 53 0 42 0 24 0 24 and 0 27 respectively the exception was for neversink simulation for which of3 r2 and of5 pbias occupied the two highest weights of 0 29 and 0 35 respectively among all ensembles of4 br2 and of7 ssqr with the values of 0 06 and 0 05 had the lowest weights across bma models which is in accordance with the performance verification of ensembles presented in table 4 having nse of less than 0 65 and pbias of higher than 2 8 on average across all watersheds no evident pattern was observed when inspecting the weight performance of objective functions across flow percentiles between watersheds and there existed a large variability in bma weights two probabilistic verification uncertainty metrics of cr and br were quantified and are presented in table 6 for bma models and of1 a representative for uncertainty estimation of a single ensemble obtained for swat hs simulations of1 is the ensemble in which nse is employed as the objective function from quantitative indices in table 6 it can be seen that all bmas indicated the adequate characteristics of uncertainty interval in terms of cr 0 7 and br 1 5 across all watersheds this coupled with results from table 4 and table 5 shows the reliability of swat hs ensemble simulations cr and br values for bma models averaged at 0 96 and 0 88 respectively across all woh watersheds the lower values of cr averaging at 0 75 and br averaging at 0 47 estimated for of1 ensemble in comparison to corresponding values for bma1 through bma6 indicate that uncertainty interval characteristics are underestimated when only considering individual simulations rather than a set of plausible predictions fig 9 depicts the comparison between uncertainty intervals shapes derived for of1 and bma1 higher values of br obtained from bma models showed broader uncertainty interval width meaning existence of higher uncertainty level in simulations therefore lower model precision bmas higher cr values indicated higher model reliability statistical analysis performed on uncertainty interval characteristics also indicated the significant difference between model reliability and precision estimated for the of1 ensemble and obtained from bmas fig 10 summarizes the uncertainty interval characteristics values for all bmas across all woh watersheds comparison between bma models revealed the similarity of uncertainty interval characteristics derived from bma1 with bma2 and bma4 with bma5 for each watershed bma1 and bma4 are models with log transformation and bma2 and bma5 are the ones with box cox transformation log transformation is a special case of the box cox method when the power for transforming the data into gaussian space is zero investigating the power derived for this study s streamflow data proved the power to be close to zero explaining the similarity of the two data transformations results from the results presented in table 6 and depicted in fig 10 it is evident that the width of uncertainty intervals associated to bma4 through bma6 are narrower br averaging at 0 7 in comparison to bma1 through bma3 1 06 indicating higher precision estimation for swat hs simulations when using split flow approach the width of uncertainty interval was significantly different for bma models applying split flow approach compared to models with the complete flow approach indicating the dependency of model precision estimation on the bma setup illustration of uncertainty interval associated with bma1 and bma4 in fig 11 also confirms this fact it is noteworthy to mention that cr values for these two sets of models were close 0 95 for bma1 through bma3 and 0 96 for bma4 through bma6 this shows the consistency of the bma models in estimating swat hs reliability in fig 11 the shape of uncertainty interval for bma4 shows multiple locations of discontinuity throughout the time series similar shape of uncertainty interval was also observed for bma5 and bma6 these discontinuities occurred at the location of flow percentiles in split flow approach the flow is divided at percentile thresholds and a separate normal distribution is considered for each later on the posterior distributions of predictions are integrated for the entire simulation period due to this process the discontinuities in uncertainty interval form along the time period although split flow approach proved to be effective in improving predictions it did not seem to be suitable for uncertainty presentation purposes the quantifications and shapes of uncertainty interval obtained from bmas produced similar results across woh watersheds for both calibration and validation periods to look at the precision and reliability of swat hs simulations at different flow ranges the streamflow at the outlet of each watershed was classified into three ranges low flow i e bottom 25 quantile based on observations medium flow i e middle 50 quantile and high flow i e top 25 quantile the uncertainty interval characteristics for various flow ranges were summarized and are presented in table 7 for of1 and bma models which are the average values derived from bmas for each flow range the cr and br values respectively averaging at 0 81 and 3 17 for low flow 0 64 and 2 21 for medium flow and 0 52 and 0 72 for high flow derived for of1 indicated the underestimations of these parameters in each flow range in comparison to bma models cr and br values derived from bmas were 0 96 and 3 98 low flow and 0 97 and 3 48 medium flow on average respectively for high flow cr and br values were 0 93 and 1 36 respectively table 7 shows that both cr and br values dropped from low flow to high flow consistently across all the watersheds for calibration and validation periods this in turn makes it difficult to conduct a comparison between flow ranges uncertainty intervals as cr and br have opposite relations and lower cr is not ideal a sign of low reliability while lower br is ideal indicating high precision certainty of the model predictions higher values of br 3 73 were associated with low and medium flows meaning less precision and certainty in the capability of swat hs to predict such flows at the same time high cr values averaging at 0 96 associated to these flow ranges indicated high reliability of the model on the contrary br value of 1 36 for high flow translated into higher precision of swat hs in predicting such flow range in comparison to low and medium flows while the model reliability for higher flow ranges was slightly lower than that of lower flow ranges fig 12 illustrates variability of cr and br values between bma models in form of ranges for low medium and high flows in case of low and medium flows bma results displayed higher variability of uncertainty interval widths 1 45 7 73 while the estimated cr values were close 0 90 0 99 the opposite held true for high flow as bma models showed relatively closer estimations for br 0 76 2 13 but higher variability for cr 0 85 0 98 this behavior was consistent across all watersheds for low medium and high flows indicating the different characteristics of uncertainty interval and hence estimation of swat hs precision and reliability when using different bma model setups despite the high variation of br values cr values across woh watersheds were higher than 0 8 and even up to 0 99 for all flow ranges shown in fig 12 this exhibits high reliability of swat hs with uncertainty interval which bracketed more than 85 of high flow observations and more than 90 of low and medium flows note that despite having straight lines for each flow range in fig 12 the relationship between cr and br of different bma models was not linear and lines in this graph only represent the range of changes for cr and br separately 5 discussion as stated earlier the precision and reliability of a prediction uncertainty interval are measured by the two indexes of band width and containing ratio cr respectively while the ideal measure of cr is 1 meaning the uncertainty interval encompasses all the observation a cr percentage equal to the coverage percentage of the uncertainty interval is satisfactory dong et al 2013b showed improvement of cr values from the range of 9 81 for ensemble members to the value of around 82 for the bma model with a multi model and multiple objective ensemble zhang et al 2009 obtained cr of higher than 91 calibration and 92 validation when constructing ensembles of 2 to 6 models predictions in the he et al 2018 study cr values ranged from 87 to 92 for the calibration period and 88 to 92 for the validation period when employing a 3 model ensemble in three bma scenarios of bma cbma and cbp bma wang et al 2020 also showed similar results for cr of 94 44 and 91 76 for calibration and validation periods when employing a 3 model ensemble in all of these studies cr is calculated for the 90 prediction uncertainty interval therefore a cr value of close to 90 was expected for the 95 uncertainty interval vrugt and robinson 2007 study resulted in cr values of 94 to 98 when using an 8 model ensemble for four bma scenarios cr values of 97 and 98 5 were also obtained from the wagena et al 2019 study of a bma scheme for calibration and validation periods respectively in this study an ensemble of 3 models two of which were swat vsa and swat st models calibrated using sufi 2 was used for two bma schemes the result of the other scheme bgmm is cr values equal to 96 3 and 97 for the calibration and validation periods respectively in the strauch et al 2012 study which employed a multi input ensemble derived from calibration of swat models using sufi 2 method in two bma schemes cr values improved from 82 to 93 to 96 for the calibration period and from 47 to 87 to 98 for the validation period in a similar study neto et al 2018 exhibited cr values of 98 calibration and 90 validation for bma in comparison with the values for ensemble members constructed from different configurations of a swat model that were calibrated using sufi 2 82 93 for calibration and 64 91 for validation darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 also obtained cr values between 86 and 96 in their study the effect of using different data transformation procedures pdf types used in the bma scheme and standard deviation types was analyzed on the prediction improvement as well as uncertainty estimation for streamflow similar to the aforementioned studies cr values obtained in our study range from 94 to 98 for the entire flow ranges this shows a difference of less than 3 with the 95 prediction uncertainty interval and the effectiveness of multiple objective functions based ensemble approach in improving uncertainty estimations the most similar study to ours is the darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 study and the closest scenarios for which they provided results are the ones that are constructed using normal distribution and different data transformations for two types of individual non constant and common non constant constant value standard deviation forms these scenarios are similar to bma1 bma2 and bma3 the only difference between the scenarios and this study s model is that the standard deviation is considered common and constant for the models in our study same as darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 results cr values are very close for different data transformation with only an insignificant deterioration when applying enqt data transformation in our results uncertainty interval band width is the narrowest for box cox data transformation while the other two data transformations have the same results no such conclusion can be drawn from the darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 study similar to their study we confirm that none of data transformations are superior to the others however applying log transformation is more straightforward than the other two methods for uncertainty interval width studies mostly have provided exact band width b values with flow unit instead of br that is a dimensionless measure b can be obtained by multiplying br with the observations standard deviation for example in vrugt and robinson 2007 and darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 studies b was between 52 to 55 m3 s and 17 to 127 m3 s for the 95 uncertainty interval for different bma scenarios for the 90 uncertainty interval the values of b ranged between 38 to 59 m3 s and 13 to 44 m3 s in he et al 2018 and dong et al 2013a studies respectively in our study b is measured between 14 21 to 36 57 m3 s for the 95 uncertainty interval among all bma models across woh watersheds the difference between b and br makes it difficult to compare this index among studies in the strauch et al 2012 and neto et al 2018 studies however values of br are provided for both ensemble members and bma models these two studies are both based on multi input ensemble construction in the strauch et al 2012 study br ranged from 0 8 to 0 97 calibration and 0 8 1 4 validation for the ensemble while these values increased to 1 25 calibration and 1 9 validation for the two bma schemes employed based on the neto et al 2018 study br ranged from 0 82 to 1 calibration and 0 62 0 89 validation for ensemble members and increased to 1 29 calibration and 1 15 validation for bma this shows an average difference of 64 strauch et al 2012 and 50 neto et al 2018 between br values for ensemble members and bma models these outcomes are consistent with our results which exhibit an increase of around 60 on average in br values after bma analysis when analyzing characteristics of uncertainty interval for flow ranges our results are not always consistent with other studies cr values in both dong et al 2013a and dong et al 2013b studies mostly decrease from high flow to low flow while uncertainty interval narrows down at the same time showing low reliability of low flow predictions in another study wagena et al 2019 also mentioned the existence of a wider b for high flow in their result on the contrary in our study both cr and br values increase from high flow to low flow similar to our results is vrugt and robinson 2007 study in which values of cr are higher for low flow ranges from dong et al 2013b study in which they provided the uncertainty interval s measures of the ensemble members we noted that the change in uncertainty interval characteristics obtained from bma analysis is similar to that of a single model prediction this fact also holds true in our study as the ensemble members uncertainty intervals for low flow ranges have larger cr and wider uncertainty band while high flow ranges have smaller cr and narrower interval see values associated to of1 in table 7 this means that the characteristics of uncertainty interval for an ensemble are impacting the uncertainty interval obtained from bma based on conducted comparisons our approach shows compatible results to other studies however more research has to be done to investigate the superiority inferiority of this method to other ensemble construction methods such as multi model or multi model structures moreover quantifying and comparing dimensionless band width ratio can also give useful information regarding the acquired precision of the approaches employed 6 conclusion the results of this study proves the general ability of swat hs to simulate streamflow for all nyc west of hudson watersheds the performance evaluation metrics of nse kge rsr and pbias for calibration and validation processes showed good results when employing different objective functions to optimize model parameters nse and kge averaged above 0 65 for both calibration and validation periods across all watersheds when comparing simulated daily time series with observations while rsr and pbias stayed relatively low no significant differences in the performance of swat hs were observed among the six watersheds however some watersheds simulations exhibited overall underestimation of low flow e g schoharie or overestimation of it e g pepacton the prediction bias for high flow was approximately the same for all watersheds despite the overall good performance of swat hs the common calibration method of sufi 2 for swat models only includes uncertainties conditioned on the objective function used in this study bma analysis was performed on an ensemble of predictions based on multiple objective functions to improve and quantify the uncertainty in swat hs streamflow simulations comparison of 95 prediction uncertainty interval characteristics obtained from bma analysis with that of behavioral sets simulated during the calibration process indicated that uncertainty interval characteristics was underestimated when using a single objective function thus indicating the advantage of a calibration based on multiple objective functions the underestimation of uncertainty interval characteristics by a single ensemble member was also confirmed for various flow ranges uncertainty interval characteristics were quantified for six different bma models all of which exhibited consistent results for entire flow and different flow ranges i e low medium and high flow and across all woh watersheds bma model setups included combining three data transformations and two flow approaches resulting in six bma models among three data transformation considered for normalizing streamflow simulations the uncertainties obtained from bma models which had log transformations were found to be in very close agreement with the uncertainties obtained with box cox transformation the comparison between bma models performed using complete flow approach versus the ones performed using split flow approach revealed the differences in characteristics of the 95 uncertainty intervals while the containing ratio values for all bmas were close the uncertainty intervals obtained from the models constructed on flow percentiles had narrower band width indicating higher precision and higher certainty of simulations however the shape of the uncertainty interval displayed locations of discontinuity at flow percentile thresholds making it less favorable when analyzing uncertainty therefore caution is recommended when utilizing this approach for uncertainty analysis in summary employing an ensemble of predictions from multiple objective functions improves the uncertainty assessments for entire flow as well as various flow ranges overall containing ratio averaged at higher than 0 95 and band width ratios were less than 0 9 for all watersheds across all bmas this signifies that more than 95 of the observations are captured by the uncertainty interval with a high level of precision for various flow ranges results of bma uncertainty analysis revealed that containing ratio values were higher than 0 85 with an average of 0 95 and a maximum value of 0 99 this means that 85 99 of the observed streamflow values were encompassed by the uncertainty band indicating the reliability of swat hs however the values of bandwidth showed that the sharpness of the results deteriorated in medium and low flows in comparison to high flow simulations another advantage of applying model averaging techniques such as bma is their ability in identifying the higher performing ensemble among all plausible simulations in this case simulation derived from applying mnse objective function was proven to outperform other simulations with having a larger weight assigned to its simulations when performing bma approach credit authorship contribution

2283,climate change can result in changes to floods and flood regimes but the relationship between floods and climate change is complex and poorly understood the flood regime influences the nature severity and timing of flood events for any watershed flood regimes should be viewed as a continuum with completely nival snowmelt driven watersheds at one end of the continuum and purely pluvial rainfall driven watersheds at the other flood regimes are important for the operation of flood defenses and to better understand how changes in the flood regime can affect the magnitude of flood events data from 46 long term streamflow gauging stations from reference hydrologic networks rhns in canada 23 and the us 23 are examined to detect changes that have occurred or are continuing to occur in flood regimes from watersheds responding only to climate variations and changes peaks over threshold pot flood events are used to investigate changes in the timing of flood events seasonality measures using circular statistics illustrate changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing and regularity of flood threshold exceedences a nival fraction is determined for each watershed and for each year based on a clustering of the flood events into two groups representing nival and pluvial events changes to the flood regime over time and based on annual temperature are determined from logistic regression of the number of nival and pluvial events for each year while strongly nival watersheds show no changes roughly 15 of the stations exhibit significant changes that represent shifts towards the pluvial end of the flood regime continuum which has implications for design flood estimation and the operation of flood control infrastructure keywords floods shifting flood regimes climate change flood frequency analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in flood frequency analysis it is assumed that the flood series arises from a single distribution and the flood events are statistically independent this is not the case where there are multiple flood generating processes waylen woo 1982 or changes in the flood regime occur over time with either climate change or observed shifts in the climate system modes franks 2002 changes to the flood regime can result in a nonstationary flood series and or a mixture of flood generation processes both of which require special consideration in flood frequency analysis used to estimate design flood values flood frequency methods are predominantly based on event magnitude the method presented here uses circular statistics to separate flood events based upon their day of occurrence as a surrogate for flood generating process in cold regions nival processes such as snowmelt dominate flood occurrence and timing an indicator is introduced to identify basins that may be more sensitive to change flood regime shifts resulting from global warming occur because a warmer atmosphere has an increased capacity to redistribute water suggesting an increase in precipitation and heavy rains the risk of flooding increases with more intense precipitation trenberth 2005 in cold regions a warmer climate is expected to shift the form of precipitation towards rainfall and away from snow and as snow melts earlier in the year in continental and cold regions there is an increased risk of flooding in spring trenberth 2005 while there is evidence indicating increasing intensification of the water cycle flood data do not show widespread increasing trends in floods huntington 2006 sharma et al 2018 projections of floods in future climates involve complex issues that defy generalizations whitfield 2012 changes in flood attributes may result from changes occurring in the atmosphere the catchment landscape and river modifications such as reservoirs bertola et al 2019 the complexity of flood generating mechanisms in space and time demands careful assessment that needs to include considering the flood regime as a continuum from nival to pluvial with atmospheric changes particularly warming shifting many rivers towards the pluvial end of the continuum burn whitfield 2018 there have been numerous studies examining the effects of climate change on floods in cold regions where snow accumulation and melt are important in a catchment during the flood period the anticipated changes in flood seasonality are most pronounced köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2016 but changes in summer precipitation also affect the timing and annual regularity of floods this results in both the magnitude and frequency of events changing as rainfall becomes a more important flood generating process and the contribution of snowmelt to flooding decreases climate change will alter flood hazard by changing flood magnitudes and frequency although the nature of these changes varies by country and region in north america snowmelt floods are occurring earlier and decreasing in magnitude cunderlik ouarda 2009 however increases in fall flood event magnitudes cunderlik ouarda 2009 and frequency whitfield shook 2020 have been observed projections also show that snowpacks will be reduced leading to earlier peak flows and lower runoff volumes hamlet lettenmaier 1999 in the united states there is little evidence of changes in the magnitude of floods but evidence of increasing frequency mallakpour villarini 2015 due to increasing temperature and changes in seasonal rainfall while trends in magnitude frequency duration and volume of frequent floods show large changes few are statistically significant archfield et al 2016 the lack of spatial patterns of the trends indicates a complex fragmented pattern of changes in floods making generalizations difficult shifts in the time of occurrence may be indicative of an increasing frequency of events or of changes in flood generating processes floods in other cold regions have decreased or are unchanged while increased precipitation has increased floods in others changes in timing have been observed in europe but no consistent large scale signal in magnitudes has been observed blöschl et al 2017 mediero et al 2014 identified decreasing trends in flood magnitude and frequency in northwest spain with floods occurring later merz et al 2018 demonstrate spatial coherence amongst floods at 68 gauges in germany with flood rich and flood poor periods that are spatially coherent similarly changes in annual maximum flows oscillated between wet and dry periods but show no trends over the past 100 years in sweden arheimer lindström 2015 but there is an increased importance of rain in flood generation in the south with more frequent rain driven floods in finland the impacts of climate change on floods are not uniform due to regional differences in climate and geography veijalainen et al 2010 floods in snowmelt areas have decreased or are unchanged while increased precipitation has increased floods in other areas changes in floods related to climate change are not consistent across france lang et al 2006 renard et al 2008 but peaks have increased in the northeast and peaks decreased and were earlier in mountainous regions in switzerland the magnitudes of floods are expected to increase due to changes in both flood generating processes and extreme precipitation köplin et al 2014 hanus et al 2021 modelled future changes in magnitude and timing of annual extreme flows in six alpine catchments in austria suggesting earlier annual maxima by 9 to 31 days and a widening of the period for potential flooding in cold regions of asia there has been a downward trend in floods that is attributable to climate and human activities liu et al 2017 in cold arid regions of china floods increased on annual and seasonal time scales after the 1980 s following an increase in temperature and predominantly due to rainstorms and temperature induced melting of glaciers and snowpack zhang et al 2016 in coastal areas of china the pattern of changes in extreme precipitation and floods were similar zhang et al 2017 while the present focus is on the timing of floods in cold regions in other regions shifts in flood generating process have occurred ganguli et al 2020 report many sites show changes in the timing of floods and a mix of nonsignificant trends in the pluvial upper mahanadi basin india with increases in magnitude being pronounced in pot analysis along with a decrease in monsoonal maxima peak discharges warming will also affect other aspects of the water cycle beyond precipitation including evaporation water storage as snow and groundwater but also snowmelt ice cover and breakup and glacial melt ice jam floods in unregulated rivers in canada are occurring earlier rokaya et al 2018 however the magnitude of these events is decreasing in the north and increasing in the south this makes local effects very important in understanding future floods whitfield 2012 climate variability through climate change or climate modes atmosphere ocean oscillations are globally and regionally pertinent to flooding diverse regions of the world exhibit synchronous changes in flood attributes related to global climatic conditions burn arnell 1993 this synchrony may be attributable to changes in modes of the climate system the modes also referred to as teleconnections and climate modes may drive interannual and interdecadal variability of flood magnitude and frequency hodgkins et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2019 the nonstationary patterns of floods in relation to climate change and with low frequency climate modes are not well understood jain lall 2000 the role of teleconnections in relation to shifts in the time of flood occurrence is also assessed as expected for an increased prevalence of rainfall and a decreased prevalence of snowmelt contributions an increase in the number of flood events exceeding a threshold and a decrease in magnitude of the exceedences were observed based on all flood regimes for 23 long record reference sites in canada burn et al 2016 burn whitfield 2016 these changes are more commonly detected in the mixed portions of the continuum than in the most pluvial and nival extremes burn whitfield 2017 these shifts in generating processes cannot be detected from studies of event magnitude alone the present research explores a larger set 46 of long record streamflow data 80 years from reference hydrologic networks rhns in canada and the northern unites states for changes in the cold region flood regime specifically the nival fraction of the flood events for a station is used to indicate the sensitivity to change and these changes are related to potential causative factors this work thus directly tests for changes in flood generating mechanisms rather than examining changes in flood attributes such as the number of over threshold events or the magnitude of these events since flood regime is viewed as a continuum from fully nival sites to fully pluvial sites the novel methodology uses clustering of day of event occurrence using circular methods to separate the flood processes between nival snowmelt events and pluvial rainfall driven events this work contributes to a greater understanding of the changes occurring in flood events in cold regions and explores the implications of these process shifts for the estimation of design floods 2 methods 2 1 data used streamflow records for 46 reference sites from the northern portion of the mid latitudes of north america are used to examine flood regime changes over time with changes in annual temperature and with shifts between climate modes all stations are part of an rhn with 23 stations from the canadian reference hydrometric basin network rhbn brimley et al 1999 and 23 sites from the u s geological survey usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn lins 2012 choosing sites from an rhn ensures that the data are of good quality and are at most minimally impacted by regulation diversions or land use change sites that are part of an rhn have been specifically selected to evaluate the impacts of climate change on streamflow characteristics whitfield et al 2012 the sites selected have data available for the 80 year period from 1938 to 2017 table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of the stations used in this analysis including the station number from the water survey of canada canadian sites or the usgs us stations as well as the station name and drainage area each station is assigned a site number as shown in table 1 the site number is also displayed on fig 1 which shows the location of the stations sites 1 to 23 are from canada and sites 24 to 46 are from the united states the spatial coverage of sites in the study area is sparse especially for the canadian portion the sparse coverage is a direct consequence of the criteria used in selecting sites to include in the analysis first only stations with at least 80 years of record were selected to ensure that long term tendencies are identified in the data records as opposed to short term fluctuations second all stations selected were part of an rhn which ensures that the data records are of good quality and are at most minimally affected by regulation or land use changes hence changes identified can be attributed to climate factors there are unfortunately comparatively few sites with long term data records that also reflect totally pristine conditions peaks over threshold pot data were extract for all sites using the graphical approach described in burn et al 2016 the pot extraction approach follows recommendations by lang et al 1999 to ensure independence of over threshold events pot flood data were selected in this work rather than only annual maximum flood events to provide a more complete characterization of the flood events for a station by including all independent events above a prescribed threshold pot data generally result in more flood events than for annual maximum data with the potential for multiple events in a year as well as no events in years where the maximum event for the year does not exceed the threshold pan et al 2022 provide a recent review of the literature on pot flood data indicating the superiority of pot data in comparison with annual maximum flood data particularly in the context of flood frequency analysis 2 2 methodology multiple measures of changes in the flood regime for a watershed are considered based on changes in the nival fraction of flood events for a station nival fraction is the focus of the analysis since this is an understudied aspect of flood response particularly in the context of flood regime as a continuum it is recognized that flood regimes are not completely characterized by the nival fraction of flood events changes in the nival fraction between different subsets of the data record are first examined a more formal measure of the statistical significance of changes in the nival fraction is estimated using logistic regression details on each element of the methodology are provided below in cold regions the timing of flood events and the flood regime of a watershed are strongly interlinked hence seasonality measures for flood timing defined using circular statistics pewsey et al 2014 form the starting point for the methodology seasonality measures allow each station to be plotted on a polar plot where the mean flood date plots as an angle measured clockwise relative to 1 january january 1 plots at the six o clock position the regularity of the flood events plots as the distance from the center of the plot flood regularity can vary from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less spread in the timing of the flood events such that the regularity is 1 if every flood event occurs on the same day in each year seasonality measures calculated using circular statistics are used herein to display the results and are also a part of the process used to partition the flood events for a station into nival and pluvial events seasonality measures were calculated using the r package circular agostinelli lund 2017 the nival fraction for a station is determined by first clustering the flood events using circular clustering clustering of seasonal events is described in whitfield 2018 clustering of the flood events provides a data driven approach to identifying nival and pluvial events in the data record the over threshold events were clustered based on the date of the maximum flow in an event the date of the maximum flow during an over threshold event was converted to a day of the year i e 1 365 and this was then converted to an angle using 1 θ i doy i 2 π lenyr where θ i is the angle in radians for event i doyi is the day of the year for event i and lenyr is the length of the year in days 365 or 366 the x and y coordinates for the event are then found from 2 x i s i n θ i 3 y i c o s θ i these x and y coordinates provide the positions of the pot events on the unit circle for each site the points defined by a matrix of these x and y coordinates were separated into 2 clusters using partitioning around mediods pam a more robust version of k means clustering reynolds et al 2006 with euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure the pam algorithm was implemented using the r package cluster maechler et al 2019 the clustering of the events into nival and pluvial events for each station yields a vector giving the number of nival events for each year and a vector giving the number of pluvial events for each year the nival fraction for a station is then calculated as the number of nival events divided by the total number of events for the station it should be noted that in this work the nival events can include both snowmelt events and rain on snow events the nival fraction for each station is displayed and changes in the nival fraction for different subsets of the data record are determined the data were divided into subsets based on time years giving early mid and late periods with lengths of 27 26 and 27 years respectively changes in the nival fraction between early and mid early and late and mid and late periods are then determined as a form of exploratory data analysis that allows a visualization of the types of changes that are occurring between these periods choosing a different number of periods can alter these results hence this analysis is a qualitative exploratory analysis that motivates the quantitative analysis of logistic regression a more formal measure of changes in the nival fraction is obtained using logistic regression frei schär 2001 logistic regression is used when the independent variable is binary in the present case either a nival event or a pluvial event arbitrarily nival events are a 1 and pluvial events are a 0 the input for the independent variable is the counts of nival and pluvial events for each year and the model predicts the probability of a nival event as a function of the predictor variable the fit of the model to the data allows the significance of any change in the nival fraction with changes in the predictor variable to be determined for a full description of logistic regression see agresti 2013 logistic regression analysis was conducted using glm in the stats r package r core team 2021 the impacts of climate change on floods are complex and thus any selected predictor or explanatory variable is a surrogate for the complex array of impacts of climate change on flood events the first predictor variable in the logistic regression analysis is the year providing a temporal analysis the temporal analysis is directly analogous to trend analysis of a continuous flood variable such as flood magnitude the second predictor variable used was annual temperature in an attempt to provide a more direct linkage between warming conditions and flood impacts annual temperature data were obtained using climatena v7 10 to extract the data from 1930 to 2020 for the locations of each of the 46 sites climatena https www climatena ca is described in wang et al 2012 2016 the final predictor variables were one of four climate indices where values for each climate index are determined for each year climate modes carry the signal of low frequency variations in the atmosphere that modify precipitation and flood potential at a local scale sankarasubramanian lall 2003 the variability of climate modes has been widely reported in the literature and recently reviewed by kundzewicz et al 2019 each of these modes affects floods in different regions and with different effects the climate indices used herein are the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the north atlantic oscillation nao the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the southern oscillation index soi these climate indices were selected since they have been reported to have impacts on streamflow at locations within the study area for each climate index annual values are used for the current year and for the previous year since some climate indices have been noted to have a lagged impact on flooding resulting in eight analyses in total while the primary focus is on changes in flood regime with time annual temperature is also included to evaluate the relative predictive capability of annual temperature relative to time additionally there are two reasons for considering teleconnections with dominant climate indices first if both a trend over time and a trend in a climate index over time are detected the time trends may be due to the trend in the index which is common for long persistent teleconnections such as amo and pdo second there are cases in the literature where floods and local climate have been linked to phases of climate indices particularly soi and nao and there is interest in how the present results compare 3 results the circular clustering approach was used to identify two clusters for each site consisting of nival and pluvial events respectively there are three sites that contain only nival events sites 20 36 and 37 and three sites that contain only pluvial events sites 22 39 and 46 these sites were considered to have only one cluster the remaining 40 sites have varying mixes of nival and pluvial events with nival fractions ranging from 0 97 site 19 to 0 17 site 40 for site 29 the clustering revealed three evident clusters three clusters were extracted for this site and clusters 1 and 2 were combined resulting in two clusters that were treated the same as was done for the other sites fig 2 provides example polar plots of the pot events for four sites with the sites displayed having decreasing nival fractions from fig 2a to 2d also shown on the polar plots in fig 2 is a kernel density estimate for the circular distribution of the timing of flood events calculated using the r package circular agostinelli lund 2017 the circular density is provided to validate the clustering results the clustering of flood events should group together portions of the unit circle with high density estimates and the dividing points between clusters should correspond to density values close to zero fig 3 is a polar plot showing the mean timing and regularity of flood events for each of the 46 sites the nival fraction for each site is indicated by the colour inside the symbol strongly nival stations such as sites 19 20 36 and 37 are highly regular 1 0 have a high nival fraction 1 00 and have a mean flood occurrence in june pluvial stations such as sites 22 39 40 and 46 have low regularity 0 5 a low nival fraction 0 20 and have a mean flood occurrence in november to january mixed stations experience a combination of nival and pluvial events with the nival fraction determined by whether the dominant number of events is nival e g sites 13 14 and 17 or pluvial e g sites 3 4 5 6 and 7 noteworthy from fig 3 is the general decrease in nival fraction when moving from the upper left of the polar plot to the lower right the histogram in fig 3 shows the number of sites for different values of nival fraction to qualitatively investigate changes in the nival fraction at each site the 80 year data record was divided into three approximately 27 year segments defined as the early mid and late sections of the data record the nival fraction was calculated for each segment for each site and the change in nival fraction between each segment was calculated by subtracting the nival fraction for the earlier segment from the nival fraction for the later segment such that positive nival fraction changes indicate an increased number of nival events in the more recent period fig 4 displays changes in the nival fraction for the sites changes from the early to the mid segment early to late segment and mid to late segment are shown in fig 4a to 4c respectively neither the strongly nival sites nor the strongly pluvial sites show differences between the time periods while the mixed sites show a predominance of negative changes fewer nival events in the more recent segment comparison of the three plots shows that the changes in nival fraction are not uniform over time with the early segment corresponding to the most nival events there are also notable differences in the changes in nival fraction for specific sites between the data segments as illustrated in fig 4d which summarizes the nival fraction changes for each site note that the sites are displayed in fig 4d with nival fraction decreasing from top to bottom site 41 shows a modest decrease in nival fraction from the early to the mid segment but larger decreases in nival fraction from the early to the late and from the mid to late segments conversely site 23 shows a large decrease from early to mid and also from early to late but a more modest change from mid to late there are also sites for which the sign of the change in nival fraction is different for different segment comparisons an example is site 9 that has a large decrease in nival fraction from the early to the mid segment little change from early to late and an increase from mid to late a different sign of nival fraction change for different segment comparisons is also apparent for other sites see fig 4d with sites 2 27 32 and 34 all indicating a later onset of nival fraction decrease logistic regression was used to provide a more quantitative assessment of the change characteristics of the nival fraction for each site that complements the results from fig 4 while alleviating the ambiguity that results from conflicting nival fraction change outcomes for different data segments as noted above example plots of the logistic regression results are in fig 5 which shows results for the same four sites displayed in fig 2 plots for all sites are in fig s1 in the supplemental material the logistic regression plots show the pot events as gray circles stacked either at nival event probability of 1 0 nival events or 0 0 pluvial events and the line of the logistic regression which is colour coded to indicate the significance of the change in the nival fraction solid red p 0 05 dashed red 0 05 p 0 10 gray p 0 10 the largest pot event from each year is also shown in the form of rug plots at the top nival events in blue or at the bottom pluvial events in red of each plot the series of the largest pot event from each year is not necessarily the same as the traditional annual maximum series since some annual maximum events may not exceed the threshold for the pot data hence the series of the largest pot event from each year may be a subset of the annual maximum series the example plots show a site with a significant decreasing change at the 5 significance level fig 5a a decreasing change that is significant at the 10 level fig 5d and sites with insignificant increasing and decreasing changes fig 5b and 5c respectively site 14 shown in fig 5a has a large nival fraction with pluvial events first occurring in the late 1960s and becoming more frequent in the latter part of the record notice that for this site there are two years for which the largest pot event is a pluvial event as indicated by the rug plot on the lower axis red tick marks in contrast to site 14 site 40 fig 5d has a much smaller nival fraction and the change in the nival fraction over time seems to be driven by the increased frequency of pluvial events with the frequency of nival events being low but somewhat consistent throughout the period of record sites 2 and 4 shown in fig 5b and 5c respectively have a mixture of nival and pluvial events both sites have non significant changes in the nival fraction with time based on logistic regression with a decreasing tendency for site 4 and an increasing tendency for site 2 the latter outcome is consistent with the results displayed in fig 4d fig 6 is a map showing the change in nival fraction for each of the sites shown are the sites with a significant decreasing change in nival fraction at the 5 or 10 significance level sites that have a non significant increasing or decreasing change as well as the six sites that exhibit no change note that the six sites with no change are those with all nival or all pluvial events and hence the nival fraction is always 1 or always 0 respectively for all values of the explanatory variable for display purposes the symbols only show the greatest level of significance such that the sites shown as having a decreasing change at the 10 significance level do not include the sites with a decreasing change at the 5 significance level this convention is followed elsewhere in the paper as well note that there are no sites with significant increasing changes there is a grouping of sites with significant decreasing changes in the east central part of the study area as well as a further two sites on the west coast the sites with a non significant increasing change are all located in the eastern part of the study area and all are in canada fig 7 provides a similar breakdown of the change status for each site on a plot of nival event fraction versus the fraction of nival maximum pot events fig 7 uses the same symbols and colours that are used in fig 6 to denote change status the three sites that have only nival events plot in the upper right corner of fig 7 at the point 1 0 1 0 and the three sites with only pluvial events plot in the lower left corner at the point 0 0 0 0 for clarity the three points in each of these corners are separated slightly to emphasize that there are three points in each corner each with the coordinates of 1 0 1 0 or 0 0 0 0 for nival and pluvial sites respectively the remaining 40 sites have a mix of nival and pluvial pot events and all have a fraction of nival maximum pot events that is less than one and greater than zero hence each of these sites has at least one year with a nival maximum pot event and at least one year with a pluvial maximum pot event as can also be seen from the rug plots of the logistic regression results in fig s1 in the supplemental material this suggests that the changes that are occurring in the mix of nival and pluvial events is not limited to events that are close to the pot extraction threshold but rather that at least some of these changes involve substantial events many of the sites with a high nival fraction have a very small number of years for which the maximum pot event for the year is pluvial and hence these sites plot close to 1 0 on the y axis fig 7 reveals that most of the sites with significant changes in nival fraction are sites with a high nival fraction all but one of the significant changes correspond to sites with a nival fraction in excess of around 0 7 the exception is site 40 which has the lowest non zero nival fraction the five sites with non significant increases in nival fraction show no particular pattern on fig 7 table 2 summarizes the results from logistic regression when applied on a temporal basis based on annual temperature and based on each of the four climate indices as well as climate indices lagged by one year note that the categories in table 2 are non overlapping and include all possible outcomes hence the sum of the entries in each column must equal the number of sites which is 46 table 2 reveals that the number of significant changes are very similar for the temporal analysis and for the analysis based on annual temperature with the sole difference being one increasing significant change 5 significance level for annual temperature whereas there are no significant increasing changes for the temporal analysis there are also more decreasing changes that are not significant and fewer increasing non significant changes for the temporal analysis relative to the annual temperature results in comparison with the temporal and annual temperature analyses the climate indices have fewer significant changes and also more of a mix of increasing and decreasing significant changes a larger percentage of the non significant changes are decreasing changes for the temporal analysis and to a lesser extent the annual temperature analysis than for the analyses based on climate indices these results suggest that the observed temporal and annual temperature based decreases in nival fraction are not a chance occurrence but rather a response to climate change leading to changes in flood generating processes example logistic regression plots are presented in fig 8 for the analysis based on annual temperature the sites presented are the four sites used in figs 2 and 5 plots for all sites are in fig s2 in the supplemental material all four sites reveal a decreasing tendency with increasing annual temperature although only site 40 demonstrates a significant change in contrast to the even distribution of the predictor variable for the temporal analysis the annual temperature values are unevenly spaced with a much higher density of values in the central part of the x axis and isolated values at the low and high extremes this is particularly noteworthy for site 4 where there is a grouping of three years with mean annual temperatures around 8 3 c from these three years there is one nival event and four pluvial events interestingly the largest of the over threshold events for the year with the largest annual temperature is a nival event see the upper rug plot of fig 8c fig 9 presents example logistic regression plots based on amo for the same four sites presented in figs 2 5 and 8 the results from amo as the climate index included in the logistic regression were selected for display since burn whitfield 2017 found the phase of amo to have an effect on flood events in an analysis based on a subset of the stations used in this work fig 9 reveals that while all sites presented show a decreasing tendency only the results for site 2 are significant and only at the 10 significance level for site 2 there is some grouping based on amo in the series of largest pluvial pot event in each year as can be seen from the rug plot on the lower part of fig 9b the results in fig 9 support the conclusion from table 2 that the changes in nival fraction related to climate indices are weaker than the temporal changes or the changes based on annual temperature 4 discussion the results of this study reveal a preponderance of sites in the study area with a mixture of flood generating processes i e 40 of the 46 sites have both nival and pluvial flood events and also a mix of nival and pluvial events that are the largest event in a year a mixture of flood generating processes has implications for flood frequency analysis since traditional approaches to the estimation of extreme flow quantiles assume that the data record consists of independent and identically distributed events which is generally not true for sites with mixed flood generating processes furthermore an increase in pluvial events was observed for many of the sites implying that not only are there mixed flood generating processes for these sites but also the relative portion of events arising from each process is changing when conducting flood frequency analysis it is thus important to consider both the existence of different flood generating processes as well as changes with time in the mixture and frequency of occurrence of flood generating processes dividing the flood events into subsets based on flood generating process however results in smaller data sets from which to estimate the flood distribution parameters which increases the uncertainty in the parameter estimates especially for cases where there is a small number of flood events from one flood generating process there is clearly a need for further research into methods that can address the complications in flood frequency analysis arising from both mixed flood generating processes and changes in the mix of flood generating processes the results presented demonstrate clear decreases in the nival fraction over time and with increases in annual temperature but the temperature trends do not completely explain the temporal pattern of changes in nival fraction this suggests that the temporal pattern reflects changes in precipitation and perhaps precipitation form that is not completely captured in the annual temperature analysis as noted earlier the spatial coverage of sites in the study area is sparse however the sparse network of sites ensures greater independence in the change responses identified an examination of the year of occurrence of large flood events at each site reveals that mesoscale events such as the driver for the 2013 calgary alberta flood are not behind the observed changes there have been other papers that have examined similar issues to those examined herein several of these studies considered a study area that overlaps with the us portion of the study area for this research there have been fewer studies that have examined similar issues for the canadian portion of this study in a study of watersheds in the western united states yu et al 2022 examined three flood generating processes rain rain on snow and snowmelt and found that combining flood estimates based on different flood generating mechanisms generally resulted in larger estimates of long return period events in comparison with estimates from considering the flood data to come from a single population this emphasizes the importance of considering the flood generating process of each flood event when estimating extreme flow quantiles hwang devineni 2022 used a water balance model to calculate an index of snow contribution to runoff that shows a similar pattern in their fig 1 to the nival fraction for the us part of this study as shown in fig 1 of this paper the snow contribution index displayed in hwang devineni 2022 contains only three categories and hence is more granular than the nival fraction from this paper this paper views the flood regime as a continuum huang et al 2022 examined watersheds in the western us that are part of the hcdn and found decreased frequency and magnitude of rain on snow driven events increased frequency and magnitude of convective storm driven events and a shift to earlier occurrence of snowmelt driven events huang et al 2022 used a pooled approach to estimate trends that combines information from all sites in determining the significance of a trend result the results from this paper are based on a classification of events as being nival or pluvial as opposed to the six flood generating processes considered by huang et al 2022 and is also based on separate change analysis at each site as oppose to a pooled or combined approach there are nonetheless similarities in the overall results in that this paper also found a decrease in the frequency of nival events and an increased frequency of pluvial events dhakal palmer 2020 examined changes in the seasonality of annual maximum flood events based on changes in the curricular density for the first and second half of the 60 year data record they found the emergence of flood events outside of the normal snowmelt season for a collection of sites in the northeast and midwest united states their study area overlaps with the us portion of the study area for this paper with the results being consistent with the findings herein for an increase in the contribution of pluvial events to the flood regime zaerpour et al 2021 explored changes in streamflow regimes for 105 rhbn sites in canada their approach involved applying fuzzy clustering to classify sites into six overlapping groups such that a site can have partial membership in more than one group they then looked at changes in the degree of membership of a site in a group using a moving decadal time window and used this as a measure of the change in the streamflow regime for a site the work of zaerpour et al 2021 is concerned with streamflow regimes as opposed to the focus of this paper on flood regimes and their study area encompasses a larger portion of canada which then requires the examination of a shorter time period zaerpour et al 2021 used a 60 year period versus an 80 year period in this work although direct comparison of results from the two studies is challenging due to the differences in the sites considered methodology and time period there are some commonalities zaerpour et al 2021 also found shifts to a more pluvial dominated response for areas where this study has found a strong signal of increases in rainfall contributions to flooding whitfield shook 2020 investigated changes in precipitation phase associated with autumn precipitation events in the rocky mountains of north america they found mainly increasing trends in rainfall events which they attributed to winter precipitation shifting to rain the precipitation shift is consistent with the results for this work although the focus of this work was not exclusively on autumn events whitfield pomeroy 2016 discuss the flood record for the bow river at banff site 20 in this work and considered flood events arising from snowmelt and from rain on snow while there were only a small number of rain on snow events they tended to be larger magnitude events while there is a decreasing trend in the flood event magnitudes for the series of all flood events there is not a trend in either the snowmelt flood events or the rain on snow flood events when considered separately the work of whitfield pomeroy 2016 highlights the importance of considering flood generation mechanism both for flood frequency analysis and for trend analysis many of the papers cited in this section used data from a reference hydrologic network rhn long good quality streamflow records from basins in an rhn that are minimally affected by regulation and landuse change are a fundamental need in the study of climate driven phenomenon leopold 1962 bard et al 2012 burn et al 2012 whitfield et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 dudley et al 2020 natural streamflow sites that have not met the criteria for inclusion in an rhn often present different trends in floods than do reference sites burn whitfield 2016 there have been many studies looking at the impacts of different climate modes on flooding climate modes reflect interannual variations in atmospheric and oceanic conditions that affect weather at a regional scale changes in these teleconnections then result in alterations to many aspects of flood events many of the studies on the effect of climate modes on flooding have looked at a specific watershed or a fairly small geographic region webb and betancourt 1992 while others encompass a country tan gan 2015 or continental scale hodgkins et al 2017 the impacts of climate modes on flooding vary with location with the climate mode considered and with the phase of the climate mode there are also cases of interactions between two climate modes gobena gan 2009 while some of these studies have found the influence of climate modes on floods to be greater than the temporal trend in flood attributes hodgkins et al 2017 in this study we found climate modes to be of lesser importance than the temporal trend in modelling flood regime changes 5 conclusions the results from this research indicate an increased influence of rainfall in flood regimes for gauging stations with long term records on relatively pristine watersheds located in the northern portion of the mid latitudes of north america the increased rainfall influence is demonstrated through comparisons of the fraction of flood events that are nival for different time periods and confirmed through the use of logistic regression to identify significant changes the increased rainfall influence is not completely attributable to increased temperature but rather precipitation changes are likely occurring as well the significant changes in nival fraction based on time were all decreasing implying increased influence of rainfall in flood generation an examination of four climate indices provided no evidence supporting climate modes as a mechanism causing the changes in flood regime mixed flood generating processes and changes in the mix of flood generating processes with time have implications for flood frequency analysis since the assumption of independent and identically distributed data is unlikely to be valid under these conditions there is a need for further research into appropriate techniques for flood frequency analysis in the presence of multiple

2283,climate change can result in changes to floods and flood regimes but the relationship between floods and climate change is complex and poorly understood the flood regime influences the nature severity and timing of flood events for any watershed flood regimes should be viewed as a continuum with completely nival snowmelt driven watersheds at one end of the continuum and purely pluvial rainfall driven watersheds at the other flood regimes are important for the operation of flood defenses and to better understand how changes in the flood regime can affect the magnitude of flood events data from 46 long term streamflow gauging stations from reference hydrologic networks rhns in canada 23 and the us 23 are examined to detect changes that have occurred or are continuing to occur in flood regimes from watersheds responding only to climate variations and changes peaks over threshold pot flood events are used to investigate changes in the timing of flood events seasonality measures using circular statistics illustrate changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing and regularity of flood threshold exceedences a nival fraction is determined for each watershed and for each year based on a clustering of the flood events into two groups representing nival and pluvial events changes to the flood regime over time and based on annual temperature are determined from logistic regression of the number of nival and pluvial events for each year while strongly nival watersheds show no changes roughly 15 of the stations exhibit significant changes that represent shifts towards the pluvial end of the flood regime continuum which has implications for design flood estimation and the operation of flood control infrastructure keywords floods shifting flood regimes climate change flood frequency analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in flood frequency analysis it is assumed that the flood series arises from a single distribution and the flood events are statistically independent this is not the case where there are multiple flood generating processes waylen woo 1982 or changes in the flood regime occur over time with either climate change or observed shifts in the climate system modes franks 2002 changes to the flood regime can result in a nonstationary flood series and or a mixture of flood generation processes both of which require special consideration in flood frequency analysis used to estimate design flood values flood frequency methods are predominantly based on event magnitude the method presented here uses circular statistics to separate flood events based upon their day of occurrence as a surrogate for flood generating process in cold regions nival processes such as snowmelt dominate flood occurrence and timing an indicator is introduced to identify basins that may be more sensitive to change flood regime shifts resulting from global warming occur because a warmer atmosphere has an increased capacity to redistribute water suggesting an increase in precipitation and heavy rains the risk of flooding increases with more intense precipitation trenberth 2005 in cold regions a warmer climate is expected to shift the form of precipitation towards rainfall and away from snow and as snow melts earlier in the year in continental and cold regions there is an increased risk of flooding in spring trenberth 2005 while there is evidence indicating increasing intensification of the water cycle flood data do not show widespread increasing trends in floods huntington 2006 sharma et al 2018 projections of floods in future climates involve complex issues that defy generalizations whitfield 2012 changes in flood attributes may result from changes occurring in the atmosphere the catchment landscape and river modifications such as reservoirs bertola et al 2019 the complexity of flood generating mechanisms in space and time demands careful assessment that needs to include considering the flood regime as a continuum from nival to pluvial with atmospheric changes particularly warming shifting many rivers towards the pluvial end of the continuum burn whitfield 2018 there have been numerous studies examining the effects of climate change on floods in cold regions where snow accumulation and melt are important in a catchment during the flood period the anticipated changes in flood seasonality are most pronounced köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2016 but changes in summer precipitation also affect the timing and annual regularity of floods this results in both the magnitude and frequency of events changing as rainfall becomes a more important flood generating process and the contribution of snowmelt to flooding decreases climate change will alter flood hazard by changing flood magnitudes and frequency although the nature of these changes varies by country and region in north america snowmelt floods are occurring earlier and decreasing in magnitude cunderlik ouarda 2009 however increases in fall flood event magnitudes cunderlik ouarda 2009 and frequency whitfield shook 2020 have been observed projections also show that snowpacks will be reduced leading to earlier peak flows and lower runoff volumes hamlet lettenmaier 1999 in the united states there is little evidence of changes in the magnitude of floods but evidence of increasing frequency mallakpour villarini 2015 due to increasing temperature and changes in seasonal rainfall while trends in magnitude frequency duration and volume of frequent floods show large changes few are statistically significant archfield et al 2016 the lack of spatial patterns of the trends indicates a complex fragmented pattern of changes in floods making generalizations difficult shifts in the time of occurrence may be indicative of an increasing frequency of events or of changes in flood generating processes floods in other cold regions have decreased or are unchanged while increased precipitation has increased floods in others changes in timing have been observed in europe but no consistent large scale signal in magnitudes has been observed blöschl et al 2017 mediero et al 2014 identified decreasing trends in flood magnitude and frequency in northwest spain with floods occurring later merz et al 2018 demonstrate spatial coherence amongst floods at 68 gauges in germany with flood rich and flood poor periods that are spatially coherent similarly changes in annual maximum flows oscillated between wet and dry periods but show no trends over the past 100 years in sweden arheimer lindström 2015 but there is an increased importance of rain in flood generation in the south with more frequent rain driven floods in finland the impacts of climate change on floods are not uniform due to regional differences in climate and geography veijalainen et al 2010 floods in snowmelt areas have decreased or are unchanged while increased precipitation has increased floods in other areas changes in floods related to climate change are not consistent across france lang et al 2006 renard et al 2008 but peaks have increased in the northeast and peaks decreased and were earlier in mountainous regions in switzerland the magnitudes of floods are expected to increase due to changes in both flood generating processes and extreme precipitation köplin et al 2014 hanus et al 2021 modelled future changes in magnitude and timing of annual extreme flows in six alpine catchments in austria suggesting earlier annual maxima by 9 to 31 days and a widening of the period for potential flooding in cold regions of asia there has been a downward trend in floods that is attributable to climate and human activities liu et al 2017 in cold arid regions of china floods increased on annual and seasonal time scales after the 1980 s following an increase in temperature and predominantly due to rainstorms and temperature induced melting of glaciers and snowpack zhang et al 2016 in coastal areas of china the pattern of changes in extreme precipitation and floods were similar zhang et al 2017 while the present focus is on the timing of floods in cold regions in other regions shifts in flood generating process have occurred ganguli et al 2020 report many sites show changes in the timing of floods and a mix of nonsignificant trends in the pluvial upper mahanadi basin india with increases in magnitude being pronounced in pot analysis along with a decrease in monsoonal maxima peak discharges warming will also affect other aspects of the water cycle beyond precipitation including evaporation water storage as snow and groundwater but also snowmelt ice cover and breakup and glacial melt ice jam floods in unregulated rivers in canada are occurring earlier rokaya et al 2018 however the magnitude of these events is decreasing in the north and increasing in the south this makes local effects very important in understanding future floods whitfield 2012 climate variability through climate change or climate modes atmosphere ocean oscillations are globally and regionally pertinent to flooding diverse regions of the world exhibit synchronous changes in flood attributes related to global climatic conditions burn arnell 1993 this synchrony may be attributable to changes in modes of the climate system the modes also referred to as teleconnections and climate modes may drive interannual and interdecadal variability of flood magnitude and frequency hodgkins et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2019 the nonstationary patterns of floods in relation to climate change and with low frequency climate modes are not well understood jain lall 2000 the role of teleconnections in relation to shifts in the time of flood occurrence is also assessed as expected for an increased prevalence of rainfall and a decreased prevalence of snowmelt contributions an increase in the number of flood events exceeding a threshold and a decrease in magnitude of the exceedences were observed based on all flood regimes for 23 long record reference sites in canada burn et al 2016 burn whitfield 2016 these changes are more commonly detected in the mixed portions of the continuum than in the most pluvial and nival extremes burn whitfield 2017 these shifts in generating processes cannot be detected from studies of event magnitude alone the present research explores a larger set 46 of long record streamflow data 80 years from reference hydrologic networks rhns in canada and the northern unites states for changes in the cold region flood regime specifically the nival fraction of the flood events for a station is used to indicate the sensitivity to change and these changes are related to potential causative factors this work thus directly tests for changes in flood generating mechanisms rather than examining changes in flood attributes such as the number of over threshold events or the magnitude of these events since flood regime is viewed as a continuum from fully nival sites to fully pluvial sites the novel methodology uses clustering of day of event occurrence using circular methods to separate the flood processes between nival snowmelt events and pluvial rainfall driven events this work contributes to a greater understanding of the changes occurring in flood events in cold regions and explores the implications of these process shifts for the estimation of design floods 2 methods 2 1 data used streamflow records for 46 reference sites from the northern portion of the mid latitudes of north america are used to examine flood regime changes over time with changes in annual temperature and with shifts between climate modes all stations are part of an rhn with 23 stations from the canadian reference hydrometric basin network rhbn brimley et al 1999 and 23 sites from the u s geological survey usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn lins 2012 choosing sites from an rhn ensures that the data are of good quality and are at most minimally impacted by regulation diversions or land use change sites that are part of an rhn have been specifically selected to evaluate the impacts of climate change on streamflow characteristics whitfield et al 2012 the sites selected have data available for the 80 year period from 1938 to 2017 table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of the stations used in this analysis including the station number from the water survey of canada canadian sites or the usgs us stations as well as the station name and drainage area each station is assigned a site number as shown in table 1 the site number is also displayed on fig 1 which shows the location of the stations sites 1 to 23 are from canada and sites 24 to 46 are from the united states the spatial coverage of sites in the study area is sparse especially for the canadian portion the sparse coverage is a direct consequence of the criteria used in selecting sites to include in the analysis first only stations with at least 80 years of record were selected to ensure that long term tendencies are identified in the data records as opposed to short term fluctuations second all stations selected were part of an rhn which ensures that the data records are of good quality and are at most minimally affected by regulation or land use changes hence changes identified can be attributed to climate factors there are unfortunately comparatively few sites with long term data records that also reflect totally pristine conditions peaks over threshold pot data were extract for all sites using the graphical approach described in burn et al 2016 the pot extraction approach follows recommendations by lang et al 1999 to ensure independence of over threshold events pot flood data were selected in this work rather than only annual maximum flood events to provide a more complete characterization of the flood events for a station by including all independent events above a prescribed threshold pot data generally result in more flood events than for annual maximum data with the potential for multiple events in a year as well as no events in years where the maximum event for the year does not exceed the threshold pan et al 2022 provide a recent review of the literature on pot flood data indicating the superiority of pot data in comparison with annual maximum flood data particularly in the context of flood frequency analysis 2 2 methodology multiple measures of changes in the flood regime for a watershed are considered based on changes in the nival fraction of flood events for a station nival fraction is the focus of the analysis since this is an understudied aspect of flood response particularly in the context of flood regime as a continuum it is recognized that flood regimes are not completely characterized by the nival fraction of flood events changes in the nival fraction between different subsets of the data record are first examined a more formal measure of the statistical significance of changes in the nival fraction is estimated using logistic regression details on each element of the methodology are provided below in cold regions the timing of flood events and the flood regime of a watershed are strongly interlinked hence seasonality measures for flood timing defined using circular statistics pewsey et al 2014 form the starting point for the methodology seasonality measures allow each station to be plotted on a polar plot where the mean flood date plots as an angle measured clockwise relative to 1 january january 1 plots at the six o clock position the regularity of the flood events plots as the distance from the center of the plot flood regularity can vary from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less spread in the timing of the flood events such that the regularity is 1 if every flood event occurs on the same day in each year seasonality measures calculated using circular statistics are used herein to display the results and are also a part of the process used to partition the flood events for a station into nival and pluvial events seasonality measures were calculated using the r package circular agostinelli lund 2017 the nival fraction for a station is determined by first clustering the flood events using circular clustering clustering of seasonal events is described in whitfield 2018 clustering of the flood events provides a data driven approach to identifying nival and pluvial events in the data record the over threshold events were clustered based on the date of the maximum flow in an event the date of the maximum flow during an over threshold event was converted to a day of the year i e 1 365 and this was then converted to an angle using 1 θ i doy i 2 π lenyr where θ i is the angle in radians for event i doyi is the day of the year for event i and lenyr is the length of the year in days 365 or 366 the x and y coordinates for the event are then found from 2 x i s i n θ i 3 y i c o s θ i these x and y coordinates provide the positions of the pot events on the unit circle for each site the points defined by a matrix of these x and y coordinates were separated into 2 clusters using partitioning around mediods pam a more robust version of k means clustering reynolds et al 2006 with euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure the pam algorithm was implemented using the r package cluster maechler et al 2019 the clustering of the events into nival and pluvial events for each station yields a vector giving the number of nival events for each year and a vector giving the number of pluvial events for each year the nival fraction for a station is then calculated as the number of nival events divided by the total number of events for the station it should be noted that in this work the nival events can include both snowmelt events and rain on snow events the nival fraction for each station is displayed and changes in the nival fraction for different subsets of the data record are determined the data were divided into subsets based on time years giving early mid and late periods with lengths of 27 26 and 27 years respectively changes in the nival fraction between early and mid early and late and mid and late periods are then determined as a form of exploratory data analysis that allows a visualization of the types of changes that are occurring between these periods choosing a different number of periods can alter these results hence this analysis is a qualitative exploratory analysis that motivates the quantitative analysis of logistic regression a more formal measure of changes in the nival fraction is obtained using logistic regression frei schär 2001 logistic regression is used when the independent variable is binary in the present case either a nival event or a pluvial event arbitrarily nival events are a 1 and pluvial events are a 0 the input for the independent variable is the counts of nival and pluvial events for each year and the model predicts the probability of a nival event as a function of the predictor variable the fit of the model to the data allows the significance of any change in the nival fraction with changes in the predictor variable to be determined for a full description of logistic regression see agresti 2013 logistic regression analysis was conducted using glm in the stats r package r core team 2021 the impacts of climate change on floods are complex and thus any selected predictor or explanatory variable is a surrogate for the complex array of impacts of climate change on flood events the first predictor variable in the logistic regression analysis is the year providing a temporal analysis the temporal analysis is directly analogous to trend analysis of a continuous flood variable such as flood magnitude the second predictor variable used was annual temperature in an attempt to provide a more direct linkage between warming conditions and flood impacts annual temperature data were obtained using climatena v7 10 to extract the data from 1930 to 2020 for the locations of each of the 46 sites climatena https www climatena ca is described in wang et al 2012 2016 the final predictor variables were one of four climate indices where values for each climate index are determined for each year climate modes carry the signal of low frequency variations in the atmosphere that modify precipitation and flood potential at a local scale sankarasubramanian lall 2003 the variability of climate modes has been widely reported in the literature and recently reviewed by kundzewicz et al 2019 each of these modes affects floods in different regions and with different effects the climate indices used herein are the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the north atlantic oscillation nao the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the southern oscillation index soi these climate indices were selected since they have been reported to have impacts on streamflow at locations within the study area for each climate index annual values are used for the current year and for the previous year since some climate indices have been noted to have a lagged impact on flooding resulting in eight analyses in total while the primary focus is on changes in flood regime with time annual temperature is also included to evaluate the relative predictive capability of annual temperature relative to time additionally there are two reasons for considering teleconnections with dominant climate indices first if both a trend over time and a trend in a climate index over time are detected the time trends may be due to the trend in the index which is common for long persistent teleconnections such as amo and pdo second there are cases in the literature where floods and local climate have been linked to phases of climate indices particularly soi and nao and there is interest in how the present results compare 3 results the circular clustering approach was used to identify two clusters for each site consisting of nival and pluvial events respectively there are three sites that contain only nival events sites 20 36 and 37 and three sites that contain only pluvial events sites 22 39 and 46 these sites were considered to have only one cluster the remaining 40 sites have varying mixes of nival and pluvial events with nival fractions ranging from 0 97 site 19 to 0 17 site 40 for site 29 the clustering revealed three evident clusters three clusters were extracted for this site and clusters 1 and 2 were combined resulting in two clusters that were treated the same as was done for the other sites fig 2 provides example polar plots of the pot events for four sites with the sites displayed having decreasing nival fractions from fig 2a to 2d also shown on the polar plots in fig 2 is a kernel density estimate for the circular distribution of the timing of flood events calculated using the r package circular agostinelli lund 2017 the circular density is provided to validate the clustering results the clustering of flood events should group together portions of the unit circle with high density estimates and the dividing points between clusters should correspond to density values close to zero fig 3 is a polar plot showing the mean timing and regularity of flood events for each of the 46 sites the nival fraction for each site is indicated by the colour inside the symbol strongly nival stations such as sites 19 20 36 and 37 are highly regular 1 0 have a high nival fraction 1 00 and have a mean flood occurrence in june pluvial stations such as sites 22 39 40 and 46 have low regularity 0 5 a low nival fraction 0 20 and have a mean flood occurrence in november to january mixed stations experience a combination of nival and pluvial events with the nival fraction determined by whether the dominant number of events is nival e g sites 13 14 and 17 or pluvial e g sites 3 4 5 6 and 7 noteworthy from fig 3 is the general decrease in nival fraction when moving from the upper left of the polar plot to the lower right the histogram in fig 3 shows the number of sites for different values of nival fraction to qualitatively investigate changes in the nival fraction at each site the 80 year data record was divided into three approximately 27 year segments defined as the early mid and late sections of the data record the nival fraction was calculated for each segment for each site and the change in nival fraction between each segment was calculated by subtracting the nival fraction for the earlier segment from the nival fraction for the later segment such that positive nival fraction changes indicate an increased number of nival events in the more recent period fig 4 displays changes in the nival fraction for the sites changes from the early to the mid segment early to late segment and mid to late segment are shown in fig 4a to 4c respectively neither the strongly nival sites nor the strongly pluvial sites show differences between the time periods while the mixed sites show a predominance of negative changes fewer nival events in the more recent segment comparison of the three plots shows that the changes in nival fraction are not uniform over time with the early segment corresponding to the most nival events there are also notable differences in the changes in nival fraction for specific sites between the data segments as illustrated in fig 4d which summarizes the nival fraction changes for each site note that the sites are displayed in fig 4d with nival fraction decreasing from top to bottom site 41 shows a modest decrease in nival fraction from the early to the mid segment but larger decreases in nival fraction from the early to the late and from the mid to late segments conversely site 23 shows a large decrease from early to mid and also from early to late but a more modest change from mid to late there are also sites for which the sign of the change in nival fraction is different for different segment comparisons an example is site 9 that has a large decrease in nival fraction from the early to the mid segment little change from early to late and an increase from mid to late a different sign of nival fraction change for different segment comparisons is also apparent for other sites see fig 4d with sites 2 27 32 and 34 all indicating a later onset of nival fraction decrease logistic regression was used to provide a more quantitative assessment of the change characteristics of the nival fraction for each site that complements the results from fig 4 while alleviating the ambiguity that results from conflicting nival fraction change outcomes for different data segments as noted above example plots of the logistic regression results are in fig 5 which shows results for the same four sites displayed in fig 2 plots for all sites are in fig s1 in the supplemental material the logistic regression plots show the pot events as gray circles stacked either at nival event probability of 1 0 nival events or 0 0 pluvial events and the line of the logistic regression which is colour coded to indicate the significance of the change in the nival fraction solid red p 0 05 dashed red 0 05 p 0 10 gray p 0 10 the largest pot event from each year is also shown in the form of rug plots at the top nival events in blue or at the bottom pluvial events in red of each plot the series of the largest pot event from each year is not necessarily the same as the traditional annual maximum series since some annual maximum events may not exceed the threshold for the pot data hence the series of the largest pot event from each year may be a subset of the annual maximum series the example plots show a site with a significant decreasing change at the 5 significance level fig 5a a decreasing change that is significant at the 10 level fig 5d and sites with insignificant increasing and decreasing changes fig 5b and 5c respectively site 14 shown in fig 5a has a large nival fraction with pluvial events first occurring in the late 1960s and becoming more frequent in the latter part of the record notice that for this site there are two years for which the largest pot event is a pluvial event as indicated by the rug plot on the lower axis red tick marks in contrast to site 14 site 40 fig 5d has a much smaller nival fraction and the change in the nival fraction over time seems to be driven by the increased frequency of pluvial events with the frequency of nival events being low but somewhat consistent throughout the period of record sites 2 and 4 shown in fig 5b and 5c respectively have a mixture of nival and pluvial events both sites have non significant changes in the nival fraction with time based on logistic regression with a decreasing tendency for site 4 and an increasing tendency for site 2 the latter outcome is consistent with the results displayed in fig 4d fig 6 is a map showing the change in nival fraction for each of the sites shown are the sites with a significant decreasing change in nival fraction at the 5 or 10 significance level sites that have a non significant increasing or decreasing change as well as the six sites that exhibit no change note that the six sites with no change are those with all nival or all pluvial events and hence the nival fraction is always 1 or always 0 respectively for all values of the explanatory variable for display purposes the symbols only show the greatest level of significance such that the sites shown as having a decreasing change at the 10 significance level do not include the sites with a decreasing change at the 5 significance level this convention is followed elsewhere in the paper as well note that there are no sites with significant increasing changes there is a grouping of sites with significant decreasing changes in the east central part of the study area as well as a further two sites on the west coast the sites with a non significant increasing change are all located in the eastern part of the study area and all are in canada fig 7 provides a similar breakdown of the change status for each site on a plot of nival event fraction versus the fraction of nival maximum pot events fig 7 uses the same symbols and colours that are used in fig 6 to denote change status the three sites that have only nival events plot in the upper right corner of fig 7 at the point 1 0 1 0 and the three sites with only pluvial events plot in the lower left corner at the point 0 0 0 0 for clarity the three points in each of these corners are separated slightly to emphasize that there are three points in each corner each with the coordinates of 1 0 1 0 or 0 0 0 0 for nival and pluvial sites respectively the remaining 40 sites have a mix of nival and pluvial pot events and all have a fraction of nival maximum pot events that is less than one and greater than zero hence each of these sites has at least one year with a nival maximum pot event and at least one year with a pluvial maximum pot event as can also be seen from the rug plots of the logistic regression results in fig s1 in the supplemental material this suggests that the changes that are occurring in the mix of nival and pluvial events is not limited to events that are close to the pot extraction threshold but rather that at least some of these changes involve substantial events many of the sites with a high nival fraction have a very small number of years for which the maximum pot event for the year is pluvial and hence these sites plot close to 1 0 on the y axis fig 7 reveals that most of the sites with significant changes in nival fraction are sites with a high nival fraction all but one of the significant changes correspond to sites with a nival fraction in excess of around 0 7 the exception is site 40 which has the lowest non zero nival fraction the five sites with non significant increases in nival fraction show no particular pattern on fig 7 table 2 summarizes the results from logistic regression when applied on a temporal basis based on annual temperature and based on each of the four climate indices as well as climate indices lagged by one year note that the categories in table 2 are non overlapping and include all possible outcomes hence the sum of the entries in each column must equal the number of sites which is 46 table 2 reveals that the number of significant changes are very similar for the temporal analysis and for the analysis based on annual temperature with the sole difference being one increasing significant change 5 significance level for annual temperature whereas there are no significant increasing changes for the temporal analysis there are also more decreasing changes that are not significant and fewer increasing non significant changes for the temporal analysis relative to the annual temperature results in comparison with the temporal and annual temperature analyses the climate indices have fewer significant changes and also more of a mix of increasing and decreasing significant changes a larger percentage of the non significant changes are decreasing changes for the temporal analysis and to a lesser extent the annual temperature analysis than for the analyses based on climate indices these results suggest that the observed temporal and annual temperature based decreases in nival fraction are not a chance occurrence but rather a response to climate change leading to changes in flood generating processes example logistic regression plots are presented in fig 8 for the analysis based on annual temperature the sites presented are the four sites used in figs 2 and 5 plots for all sites are in fig s2 in the supplemental material all four sites reveal a decreasing tendency with increasing annual temperature although only site 40 demonstrates a significant change in contrast to the even distribution of the predictor variable for the temporal analysis the annual temperature values are unevenly spaced with a much higher density of values in the central part of the x axis and isolated values at the low and high extremes this is particularly noteworthy for site 4 where there is a grouping of three years with mean annual temperatures around 8 3 c from these three years there is one nival event and four pluvial events interestingly the largest of the over threshold events for the year with the largest annual temperature is a nival event see the upper rug plot of fig 8c fig 9 presents example logistic regression plots based on amo for the same four sites presented in figs 2 5 and 8 the results from amo as the climate index included in the logistic regression were selected for display since burn whitfield 2017 found the phase of amo to have an effect on flood events in an analysis based on a subset of the stations used in this work fig 9 reveals that while all sites presented show a decreasing tendency only the results for site 2 are significant and only at the 10 significance level for site 2 there is some grouping based on amo in the series of largest pluvial pot event in each year as can be seen from the rug plot on the lower part of fig 9b the results in fig 9 support the conclusion from table 2 that the changes in nival fraction related to climate indices are weaker than the temporal changes or the changes based on annual temperature 4 discussion the results of this study reveal a preponderance of sites in the study area with a mixture of flood generating processes i e 40 of the 46 sites have both nival and pluvial flood events and also a mix of nival and pluvial events that are the largest event in a year a mixture of flood generating processes has implications for flood frequency analysis since traditional approaches to the estimation of extreme flow quantiles assume that the data record consists of independent and identically distributed events which is generally not true for sites with mixed flood generating processes furthermore an increase in pluvial events was observed for many of the sites implying that not only are there mixed flood generating processes for these sites but also the relative portion of events arising from each process is changing when conducting flood frequency analysis it is thus important to consider both the existence of different flood generating processes as well as changes with time in the mixture and frequency of occurrence of flood generating processes dividing the flood events into subsets based on flood generating process however results in smaller data sets from which to estimate the flood distribution parameters which increases the uncertainty in the parameter estimates especially for cases where there is a small number of flood events from one flood generating process there is clearly a need for further research into methods that can address the complications in flood frequency analysis arising from both mixed flood generating processes and changes in the mix of flood generating processes the results presented demonstrate clear decreases in the nival fraction over time and with increases in annual temperature but the temperature trends do not completely explain the temporal pattern of changes in nival fraction this suggests that the temporal pattern reflects changes in precipitation and perhaps precipitation form that is not completely captured in the annual temperature analysis as noted earlier the spatial coverage of sites in the study area is sparse however the sparse network of sites ensures greater independence in the change responses identified an examination of the year of occurrence of large flood events at each site reveals that mesoscale events such as the driver for the 2013 calgary alberta flood are not behind the observed changes there have been other papers that have examined similar issues to those examined herein several of these studies considered a study area that overlaps with the us portion of the study area for this research there have been fewer studies that have examined similar issues for the canadian portion of this study in a study of watersheds in the western united states yu et al 2022 examined three flood generating processes rain rain on snow and snowmelt and found that combining flood estimates based on different flood generating mechanisms generally resulted in larger estimates of long return period events in comparison with estimates from considering the flood data to come from a single population this emphasizes the importance of considering the flood generating process of each flood event when estimating extreme flow quantiles hwang devineni 2022 used a water balance model to calculate an index of snow contribution to runoff that shows a similar pattern in their fig 1 to the nival fraction for the us part of this study as shown in fig 1 of this paper the snow contribution index displayed in hwang devineni 2022 contains only three categories and hence is more granular than the nival fraction from this paper this paper views the flood regime as a continuum huang et al 2022 examined watersheds in the western us that are part of the hcdn and found decreased frequency and magnitude of rain on snow driven events increased frequency and magnitude of convective storm driven events and a shift to earlier occurrence of snowmelt driven events huang et al 2022 used a pooled approach to estimate trends that combines information from all sites in determining the significance of a trend result the results from this paper are based on a classification of events as being nival or pluvial as opposed to the six flood generating processes considered by huang et al 2022 and is also based on separate change analysis at each site as oppose to a pooled or combined approach there are nonetheless similarities in the overall results in that this paper also found a decrease in the frequency of nival events and an increased frequency of pluvial events dhakal palmer 2020 examined changes in the seasonality of annual maximum flood events based on changes in the curricular density for the first and second half of the 60 year data record they found the emergence of flood events outside of the normal snowmelt season for a collection of sites in the northeast and midwest united states their study area overlaps with the us portion of the study area for this paper with the results being consistent with the findings herein for an increase in the contribution of pluvial events to the flood regime zaerpour et al 2021 explored changes in streamflow regimes for 105 rhbn sites in canada their approach involved applying fuzzy clustering to classify sites into six overlapping groups such that a site can have partial membership in more than one group they then looked at changes in the degree of membership of a site in a group using a moving decadal time window and used this as a measure of the change in the streamflow regime for a site the work of zaerpour et al 2021 is concerned with streamflow regimes as opposed to the focus of this paper on flood regimes and their study area encompasses a larger portion of canada which then requires the examination of a shorter time period zaerpour et al 2021 used a 60 year period versus an 80 year period in this work although direct comparison of results from the two studies is challenging due to the differences in the sites considered methodology and time period there are some commonalities zaerpour et al 2021 also found shifts to a more pluvial dominated response for areas where this study has found a strong signal of increases in rainfall contributions to flooding whitfield shook 2020 investigated changes in precipitation phase associated with autumn precipitation events in the rocky mountains of north america they found mainly increasing trends in rainfall events which they attributed to winter precipitation shifting to rain the precipitation shift is consistent with the results for this work although the focus of this work was not exclusively on autumn events whitfield pomeroy 2016 discuss the flood record for the bow river at banff site 20 in this work and considered flood events arising from snowmelt and from rain on snow while there were only a small number of rain on snow events they tended to be larger magnitude events while there is a decreasing trend in the flood event magnitudes for the series of all flood events there is not a trend in either the snowmelt flood events or the rain on snow flood events when considered separately the work of whitfield pomeroy 2016 highlights the importance of considering flood generation mechanism both for flood frequency analysis and for trend analysis many of the papers cited in this section used data from a reference hydrologic network rhn long good quality streamflow records from basins in an rhn that are minimally affected by regulation and landuse change are a fundamental need in the study of climate driven phenomenon leopold 1962 bard et al 2012 burn et al 2012 whitfield et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 harrigan et al 2018 dudley et al 2020 natural streamflow sites that have not met the criteria for inclusion in an rhn often present different trends in floods than do reference sites burn whitfield 2016 there have been many studies looking at the impacts of different climate modes on flooding climate modes reflect interannual variations in atmospheric and oceanic conditions that affect weather at a regional scale changes in these teleconnections then result in alterations to many aspects of flood events many of the studies on the effect of climate modes on flooding have looked at a specific watershed or a fairly small geographic region webb and betancourt 1992 while others encompass a country tan gan 2015 or continental scale hodgkins et al 2017 the impacts of climate modes on flooding vary with location with the climate mode considered and with the phase of the climate mode there are also cases of interactions between two climate modes gobena gan 2009 while some of these studies have found the influence of climate modes on floods to be greater than the temporal trend in flood attributes hodgkins et al 2017 in this study we found climate modes to be of lesser importance than the temporal trend in modelling flood regime changes 5 conclusions the results from this research indicate an increased influence of rainfall in flood regimes for gauging stations with long term records on relatively pristine watersheds located in the northern portion of the mid latitudes of north america the increased rainfall influence is demonstrated through comparisons of the fraction of flood events that are nival for different time periods and confirmed through the use of logistic regression to identify significant changes the increased rainfall influence is not completely attributable to increased temperature but rather precipitation changes are likely occurring as well the significant changes in nival fraction based on time were all decreasing implying increased influence of rainfall in flood generation an examination of four climate indices provided no evidence supporting climate modes as a mechanism causing the changes in flood regime mixed flood generating processes and changes in the mix of flood generating processes with time have implications for flood frequency analysis since the assumption of independent and identically distributed data is unlikely to be valid under these conditions there is a need for further research into appropriate techniques for flood frequency analysis in the presence of multiple and changing flood generation processes conditions that are likely to occur in many other parts of the world credit authorship contribution statement donald h burn conceptualization methodology

2284,performing beerkan infiltration runs with different heights of water pouring could help to obtain saturated soil sorptivity s and hydraulic conductivity ks data usable to explain and simulate hydrological processes however most of the available information on the l low height of water pouring nearly 3 cm h high height 1 2 m methodology refers to runs making use of a relatively limited number of water volumes and there is some sign that a few water volumes could yield an incomplete description of soil alteration phenomena induced by wetting for a loam soil the objective of this investigation was to determine water pouring height effects on the s and ks values obtained in different sampling dates with more than usual amounts of applied water soil alteration due to the mechanical impact of the applied water appeared almost completed by the end of the runs in all cases but in a more advanced stage when the soil was initially more sorptive and conductive overall the h runs yielded 2 3 2 8 times smaller s values and 8 5 14 5 times smaller ks values than the l runs but differences between the l and h methodologies varied during the sampling period in particular these differences were smallest when the soil was initially relatively wet and little sorptive and conductive s and ks values differing with the experiment by no more than two times and largest in the opposite conditions s and ks values differing by 3 and 17 21 times respectively the l runs yielded coefficients of variations cv of 14 60 for s and 45 171 for ks depending on the sampling date and a ratio between the highest and the lowest mean of 2 5 for s and 11 8 for ks with the h runs the corresponding cv values were 14 38 for s and 35 107 for ks and two means differed at the most by 1 3 times for s and 2 2 times for ks therefore the h runs described a soil that was less sorptive less conductive more spatially homogeneous and more temporally stable than the l runs less runs could be enough to parameterize the soil in a disturbed condition as compared with the undisturbed one further testing the l h methodology in other environmental conditions is recommended in the perspective to develop simple field methods to determine the hydrodynamic properties of both a nearly undisturbed soil and an intensively disturbed soil keywords soil hydrodynamic parameters surface hydrological processes beerkan infiltration runs water application procedure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction saturated soil sorptivity s l t0 5 and hydraulic conductivity ks l t are the necessary soil hydrodynamic parameters to describe infiltration with physically based models e g touma et al 2007 rahmati et al 2020 sorptivity defines the ability of a soil to conduct water by capillarity and it varies with the initial and the final soil water content and when present the ponded depth of water on the soil surface the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity represents the flow rate due solely to gravity in a saturated soil both parameters depend on soil structure and consequently they often show an appreciable dynamics at different time scales as a consequence for example of tillage freezing and thawing or wetting and drying cycles root growth and release of exudates c turnover and biological activity scott et al 1994 emmerich 2003 temporal changes of soil hydrodynamic parameters have been widely investigated e g prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 angulo jaramillo et al 1997 bagarello and sgroi 2004 2007 bodner et al 2013 kargas et al 2016 biddoccu et al 2017 but trying to generalize the results of different investigations is not easy a reason is that the applied experimental methods change with the investigation and different methods can yield dissimilar results reynolds et al 2000 moreover characterizing temporal variations of soil hydrodynamic parameters is experimentally onerous and the data that can be collected with the available economic instrumental and personnel resources could not include all factors actually affecting the studied phenomenon nonetheless insisting on sampling in different environments and conditions appears necessary even in the perspective to develop as simple as possible predictive methods of temporal variability of soil hydrodynamic parameters usable for simulating hydrological processes determining the hydrodynamic properties of the upper soil layer is particularly important and complicated at the same time the importance is obviously linked to the circumstance that the upper layer represents the zone through which water enters the soil therefore understanding and simulating water infiltration into the soil and any related process require an appropriate hydraulic characterization of this layer assouline and mualem 2002 touma et al 2007 the complexity of such a hydrodynamic characterization is linked to the extraordinarily dynamic nature of the upper soil layer given that surface soil properties can be expected to change even at very short temporal scales such as during a rainfall event or between closely spaced rainstorms morin and benyamini 1977 levy et al 1986 le bissonnais and singer 1992 fohrer et al 1999 king and bjorneberg 2012 mügler et al 2019 ndiaye et al 2005 hortonian surface runoff occurs as a consequence of prolonged and intense rainfall events assouline and mualem 2002 2006 wu et al 2019 and mualem and assouline 1989 concluded that the surface seal layer induced by direct impact of raindrops on bare soil should be treated as a disturbed zone where all hydraulic parameters differ from those of the undisturbed zone below seal formation is a dynamic process that depends on the initial soil mechanical and hydraulic properties as well as the physical characteristics of rainfall or applied irrigation assouline and mualem 1997 other investigations have offered a perhaps even more complex description of short term temporal dynamics of the upper soil layer in particular neave and rayburg 2007 concluded that seal development will always represent a balance between processes that promote seals and those that actively disrupt seals in other terms raindrop impact can be both a formative and a disruptive agent in the process of seal development a short term instability of soil hydrodynamic properties is not limited to the wetting stage but it is also perceivable during the subsequent drying stage for example in an investigation by bagarello et al 2020 a reorganization of soil structure yielding increasing ks values was detected four days after an intentionally soil disturbing beerkan infiltration run lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014a temporal variability of surface soil hydrodynamic properties could be smaller for a disturbed soil than a non disturbed soil since in the former case at least ks can be expected to frequently fall in a rather narrow range of small values ramos et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 bagarello and david 2020 however little is known at this purpose for both s and ks even if the issue is relevant the reason is that less temporal changes could imply less experimental efforts to characterize a disturbed soil as compared with the undisturbed one in the context of a phenomenologically complex problem obtaining realistic s and ks data by cheap simple parsimonious and rapid experimental field methods and application methodologies appears a still unresolved issue ponding single ring infiltration methods are suitable for performing simple and generally rapid experiments in the field reynolds 2008 and several widely used data analysis procedures are based on robust theories this is the case of the so called best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters method of soil hydraulic characterization lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 bagarello et al 2014b angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 which estimates s and ks by a three dimensional field infiltration experiment at theoretically zero pressure head and the infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 however literature raises doubts about the general usability of ring infiltration methods to explain surface hydrological processes since a tendency of these methods to yield excessively high infiltration rates or ks values has been reported several times e g ben hur et al 1987 cerdà 1996 1999 van de giesen et al 2000 morbidelli et al 2017 picciafuoco et al 2019 recently concluded that the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device emphasis is generally put on the fact that obtaining reliable soil data by an infiltration method requires avoiding or at least reducing as much as possible any soil alteration due to the run reynolds 2008 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2019 however bagarello et al 2014a proposed an alternative reasoning based on the concept that the infiltration experiment could be performed in such a way to induce a soil disturbance possibly similar to that caused by intense and prolonged rainfall events in particular these authors suggested that performing beerkan infiltration runs by changing the height of water pouring and using the best methodologies of data analysis can help to detect the effects of mechanical disturbance of the infiltration surface on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters low runs l height of water pouring hw 0 03 m are expected to yield representative data for a nearly undisturbed soil whereas high runs h hw 1 0 2 0 m could yield representative data for a disturbed soil condition alagna et al 2016 2018 castellini et al 2021 the usability of the h methodology to obtain soil data specifically representative of an altered surface soil layer was supported by di prima et al 2017 di prima et al 2018 and alagna et al 2019 therefore the proposed l h methodology could in principle be used to obtain with a rather simple experiment two estimates of the soil hydrodynamic properties one representative of the undisturbed soil condition e g before a rainfall event and the other expressive of the overall effect of soil wetting including mechanical disturbance e g after the rainfall event most of the available information on the l h methodology was collected by a standard protocol that yields an experimental cumulative infiltration curve by pouring a sequence of 15 water volumes each establishing an initial water depth of nearly 1 cm on the infiltration surface this protocol that is frequently applied angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 lassabatere et al 2019 castellini et al 2021 was introduced in the first best paper lassabatere et al 2006 probably because it was considered a reasonable compromise between the need to reach a near steady state infiltration rate by the end of the run and that to use as small water volumes as possible for field campaigns applying the l h methodology by performing longer runs i e using more water volumes is advisable for at least two reasons i a longer run can favor a closer attainment of steady state infiltration rates elrick and reynolds 1992a and ii it can reveal differences between soils that are not detected with the classical protocol auteri et al 2020 however a long run can also induce progressive weakening of the interparticle bonds and mobilization of soil particles dikinya et al 2008 bagarello and david 2020 a greater influence of vertical gradients in antecedent soil water content and soil hydrodynamic parameters on the measured infiltration can also be expected vandervaere et al 2000 therefore testing the l h methodology with more water volumes than previously used is necessary the general objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performances of a l h beerkan run methodology making use of more water than that corresponding to the standard protocol in different initial conditions of a loam soil in particular the soil was sampled on six dates to i verify height of water pouring effects on the established infiltration process ii determine if these effects changed with the sampling date and hence the antecedent soil conditions iii compare soil hydrodynamic properties estimated with infiltration runs differing by the height of water application iv establish if soil disturbance had an impact on temporal changes of soil hydrodynamic parameters and v test sensitivity of the l and h experiments to the used water volume 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the agricultural food and forest sciences department of the university of palermo italy in a citrus orchard under conventional tillage with trees spaced 4 m 4 m apart coordinates 33s 355511e 4218990 n the soil at the field site typic rhodoxeralf has a relatively high gravel content and it is mostly sandy loam or loam down to a depth of at least 0 30 m bagarello et al 2014a concialdi et al 2020 this investigation was performed in an area of approximately 200 m2 in which the soil had mainly a loam texture according to the usda classification system clay 15 4 silt 36 2 sand 48 4 and a soil organic carbon content equal to 3 1 auteri et al 2020 the soil structural stability index calculated according to pieri 1992 was equal to 10 5 suggesting a stable structure reynolds et al 2009 the soil surface was gently leveled and smoothed by manual implements before sampling to sample a bare area the superficial herbaceous vegetation was cut with a knife when it was present while the roots remained in situ 2 2 field experiment small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the rings were particularly small to more clearly detect possible effects of soil disturbance due to water application on a given sampling date a total of 20 infiltration runs were carried out at randomly selected locations for each run 30 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface for each water volume 1st 2nd 30th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2021 ten runs were carried out by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height hw of 0 03 m water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application low l runs water was applied from hw 1 5 m at the other 10 sampling points high h runs the soil surface was not shielded to maximize possible disruptive effects of water impact to ensure flow verticality and prevent wind effects the device developed by bagarello et al 2014a and alagna et al 2016 was used in this case at least one l and one h run were carried out in a given day at a distance of no 1 5 2 0 m from each other in an intermediate position between the two sampling points for infiltration two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θi the soil porosity f was calculated from ρb assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm3 according to other investigations the field saturated soil water content θs was assumed to coincide with f mubarak et al 2009 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the data were averaged over the two depths to obtain the θi and θs values for the subsequent calculations these values were associated with the couple of l and h runs performed in the vicinity of the soil sampling location since small scale variability of θi and θs can be expected not to influence appreciably calculations with the best methods di prima et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2019 sampling was performed on six dates during a period of nearly three years november 2017 april may and september 2018 april 2019 july 2020 denoted in the following as nov17 apr18 may18 sep18 apr19 and jul20 respectively to develop a dataset including a wide range of initial conditions in compliance with the application limits of the best methodology of data analysis lassabatere et al 2006 only nine h runs were performed on sep18 due to some adverse meteorological conditions during this field campaign on the last sampling date 45 water volumes were used instead of 30 volumes to also test water volume effects on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters by the two experimental methodologies part of the developed dataset was also used for other investigations auteri et al 2020 iovino et al 2021 2 3 calculations and data analysis initially the experiments performed with 30 water volumes were considered infiltration data were reported on cumulative infiltration i l vs time t t and infiltration rate ir l t vs i plots to take an initial look at the general response of the two types of experiments l and h for each sampling date the ir vs i plot was considered since durations changed from run to run making presentation of all data on a single ir vs t plot confuse for both the complete dataset all data together regardless of the sampling date and separately for each sampling campaign the mean infiltration time of each applied water volume 1st 2nd 30th was calculated for both the low δt l t and the high δt h t runs for a given applied water volume δt l was expressive of the overall effect on infiltration rate of different factors such as hydraulic potential gradient wetting induced swelling mobilization of soil particles released by slaking and weakening of the interparticle bonds the δt h value expressed the effect of the same factors in combination with water mechanical impact on the soil surface the δt h δt l ratio was plotted against the number of the applied water volumes nv to establish a quantitative comparison between the l and h runs with the same added water volume total duration of the infiltration run dtot t and saturated soil sorptivity s l t0 5 and hydraulic conductivity ks l t were determined for each run total duration was considered since it is a synthetic quantitative indicator of water infiltration and it is easier to compare than curves lassabatere et al 2019 the best steady algorithm bagarello et al 2014b was applied to calculate s and ks from the experimentally determined intercept and slope of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot best steady was preferred over best slope lassabatere et al 2006 and best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 because it was the only algorithm that in another investigation allowed a successful treatment of runs involving soil alteration and led to ks values close to those obtained by rainfall simulation di prima et al 2018 moreover possible approximations in the attainment of steady state flow could not be eliminated by using another algorithm since all best methods presuppose that flow has stabilized by the end of the run the analysis of the dtot s and ks values was performed by both considering the complete dataset and distinguishing between sampling dates preliminarily the distribution of the data obtained with the l dtot l s l ks l respectively and h dtot h s h ks h runs was checked with the lilliefors 1967 test considering both a normal no and a ln normal ln distribution with reference to the complete dataset only the ln distribution hypothesis was not rejected for dtot and ks and the two experimental methods for s only the no and only the ln distribution hypotheses were not rejected with the l and h runs respectively implying that a parametric test with the untransformed or the ln transformed s data was not usable to compare the l and h results therefore the non parametric mann whitney u test spiegel and stephens 2008 was applied to compare s l and s h and the same approach was applied for the other two variables dtot l vs dtot h and ks l vs ks h to perform a methodologically homogeneous comparison by considering separately the six sampling dates the no distribution hypothesis was never rejected for the 12 dtot datasets 6 dates 2 experimental methodologies consequently parametric two tailed t tests were applied with the untransformed dtot values the arithmetic mean and the associated coefficient of variation cv were used to summarize these data as well as the ρb and θi data in accordance with other investigation e g mubarak et al 2009 for the two calculated hydrodynamic parameters s ks the no distribution hypothesis was rejected once whereas the ln distribution hypothesis was never rejected therefore s and ks comparisons were performed by a parametric two tailed t test with the ln transformed data and the data were summarized by the geometric mean and the associated cv lee et al 1985 a pairwise approach was applied to compare l and h runs on a given date but also to establish comparisons between two sampling dates for given variable and experimental method this choice was made in accordance with other investigations focused on sampling soil properties at different dates mubarak et al 2009 unpaired t tests were used to compare two datasets since the infiltration runs were performed at different locations of the field site for the jul20 sampling campaign a comparison was also established between the results obtained with 30 and 45 volumes but a two tailed paired t test was applied in this case a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of a fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 all statistical tests including calculation of confidence intervals ci for both the intercept and the slope of a linear regression line were carried out at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry soil bulk density and antecedent soil water content dry soil bulk density increased during the sampling period table 1 in particular the smallest means of ρb 0 96 0 98 g cm3 were obtained in the first three sampling dates from nov17 to may18 and the highest means 1 04 1 08 g cm3 were detected in the last three sampling dates from sep18 to jul20 the increase of ρb was gradual as suggested by the similarity of the ρb values from apr18 to sep18 in any case ρb was generally small suggesting that the soil had a good structure with a well developed macroporosity with reference to θi the experiments were carried out in four different conditions table 1 in particular the soil was wettest at the beginning of the sampling period that is on nov17 and apr18 0 199 0 215 m3 m3 and driest on the last sampling date of jul20 0 068 m3 m3 the soil was relatively wet on may18 and apr19 0 137 0 158 m3 m3 and relatively dry on sep18 0 103 m3 m3 the dry soil bulk density decreased in wetter conditions according to a statistically significant r 2 0 114 r 0 sample size n 60 but weak relationship fig 1 the mean of the θi θs ratios was equal to 0 237 cv 37 6 denoting that on average the constraint by lassabatere et al 2006 that θi should be smaller than 0 25 θs to apply the best methods of infiltration data analysis was satisfied 3 2 infiltration considering all runs performed with 30 water volumes infiltration was measured for a total of nearly 168 h both the cumulative infiltration i vs t fig 2 and the infiltration rate ir vs i fig 3 curves signaled that the experimental infiltration processes were generally consistent with theory since the concavity of the i vs t curves was faced downwards and the infiltration rates decreased during the run in some cases however the i vs t relationship appeared nearly linear or it was a little concave upwards a linear relationship denoted a steady state process from the beginning of the run whereas upwards concavity and hence increasing ir values during at least a part of the run was likely a consequence of some soil hydrophobicity lassabatere et al 2010 alagna et al 2019 infiltration rates were generally greater for the l runs than the h runs considering the complete dataset total duration of the established infiltration processes was on average 0 65 h n 60 cv 125 0 for the l runs dtot l and 2 19 h n 59 cv 59 0 for the h runs dtot h table 2 depending on the considered measure of central tendency arithmetic mean geometric mean median the h runs were 3 3 5 3 times longer than the l runs and the difference between the two dtot datasets was statistically significant the spread of the data was larger for the h runs than the l runs but relative variability of dtot was smaller for the h runs than the l runs suggesting an overall more homogeneous response of the sampled soil with the more perturbing runs run durations dtot l dtot h were not significantly correlated with dry soil bulk density but they increased significantly with the antecedent soil water content fig 4 the fitted dtot θi relationship was stronger for the l runs r 2 0 405 than the h runs r 2 0 222 the relationships between the mean infiltration time δt h of a given water volume and the number of the applied water volumes nv for the two types of runs n 60 and 59 for the l and h runs respectively revealed differences between the two water application methods fig 5 a in particular the mean of δt increased with nv in both cases as theoretically expected elrick and reynolds 1992a but mean infiltration times increased at an appreciably higher rate for the h runs than the l ones therefore the slowdown of the infiltration process during the run was more marked when water was poured from a high height differences between the two application methods were perceived starting from the beginning of the process the means of δt h appeared to approach a nearly stable value by the end of the run last three or four water volumes while those of δt l continued to increase till the end of the run the δt h δt l ratio calculated by considering all runs was always greater than one since it varied between 1 3 and 4 1 fig 5 b this ratio increased with the number of the applied water volumes during a little more than the first half of the run and it nearly stabilized around a value of 3 7 4 1 in an advanced stage of the process mean 3 9 cv 3 2 for the last 12 δt h δt l values therefore water impact effects i started immediately that is from the first applied water volume ii increased with the overall applied water amount during the first stage of the experiment and iii were almost complete after applying a little more than half of the total used water volume which corresponds to the standard beerkan run protocol lassabatere et al 2006 in other words all possible soil deterioration due to a high height of water pouring occurred by the end of the run otherwise the δt h δt l vs nv relationship should have shown a persistent increasing trend also with reference to the applied water volumes in the final phase of the experiment a statistically significant relationship r 2 0 770 was detected between the means of dtot obtained on the six sampling dates with the l and h runs fig 6 but the linear regression line did not coincide with the identity line since the 95 confidence intervals for the intercept and the slope were 0 86 2 13 and 0 25 1 83 respectively moreover the h runs yielded significantly longer dtot values than the l ones on each date table 3 however the differences between the two water application methods varied during the experimental period since they were relatively small in the first two sampling dates mean dtot h mean dtot l 2 0 2 3 when the infiltration process with the non perturbing run was slower and appreciably higher in the subsequent sampling campaigns 4 2 7 6 characterized by more rapid l runs the mean dtot l values differed according to the sequence apr18 nov17 sep18 apr19 may18 jul20 table 3 instead the means of dtot h differed according to the sequence apr18 nov17 apr19 may18 jul20 sep18 nine of the 15 established comparisons suggested different durations when water was applied from a low height but only two differences were statistically significant by pouring water from a high height therefore a more soil perturbing run made total durations during the sampling period more similar with the l runs the mean δt vs nv relationship differed with the sampling date fig 7 a in particular δt appeared to steadily and appreciably increase with nv in the first two campaigns while it increased at an appreciably smaller rate in the last four dates the h runs yielded in general greater δt values than the l runs from the beginning of the process in all sampling dates suggesting that soil perturbation generally started to occur when water was applied for the first time even with the h runs the highest δt values were detected for all nv values during the first two campaigns with reference to both types of runs a final stabilization of the last δt values appeared perceivable at least approximately in some cases e g l and h runs on apr18 but not in other cases e g l and h runs on jul20 the δt h δt l ratios stabilized by the end of the run with 30 water volumes on each sampling date but the final δt h δt l values differed appreciably with the date fig 7 b in particular the smallest values close to 2 were obtained on the first two sampling campaigns when the l runs were slowest table 3 while the highest value equal to 11 was detected on the last campaign characterized by the most rapid non perturbing runs the final δt h δt l value was of nearly 7 on may18 and sep18 and 9 on apr19 the smaller the final value of δt h δt l the sooner this value was reached in particular stabilization occurred after pouring 9 10 water volumes in the first two campaigns 17 20 volumes in the two subsequent dates and 25 26 volumes in the last two dates 3 3 soil hydrodynamic parameters overall positive s and ks values were obtained for 56 l runs and 56 h runs that is for the 93 95 of the infiltration experiments the individual s values varied by one order of magnitude 22 8 223 1 mm h0 5 whereas ks was much more variable since it varied by more than two orders of magnitude 665 times 2 5 1637 mm h table 2 depending on the considered measure of central tendency the h runs yielded 2 3 2 8 times smaller s values and 8 5 14 5 times smaller ks values than the l runs and the differences between the l and h data were statistically significant for both parameters table 2 the spread of the s and ks data decreased from the l to h runs and also relative variability was smaller for the latter runs therefore the applied experimental methodology to perform a beerkan infiltration run had a noticeable impact on determination on the two considered soil hydrodynamic parameters changes were particularly appreciable for ks in agreement with previous findings somaratne and smettem 1993 bagarello et al 2014a and further denoting that ks represents a sentinel soil property also because it shows a wide range of variation and a high sensitivity to the applied measurement method elrick and reynolds 1992b reynolds et al 2000 performing a more soil perturbing run also reduced variability of the hydrodynamic parameters of the sampled soil volume apparently suggesting a more homogeneous field in accordance with other investigations ben hur et al 1987 assouline and mualem 2002 regardless of the height of water pouring neither s nor ks were significantly correlated with ρb since the r 2 values ranged between 0 026 and 0 036 r 0 fig 8 a b a statistically significant effect of θi on both s r 2 0 518 r 0 and ks r 2 0 404 r 0 was detected for the l runs fig 8 c d in particular both parameters decreased as θi increased with the h runs soil sorptivity decreased significantly as θi increased fig 8 c but the r 2 value equal to 0 145 r 0 was appreciably smaller than that obtained with the l runs instead the ks vs θi relationship was not significant r 2 0 009 r 0 fig 8 d the impact of the detected differences between the s and ks values obtained with the l and h runs table 2 was checked for three practical situations in the supplementary material both s and ks were found to vary during the experimental period table 3 but changes differed with the applied experimental method in particular the mean s l values differed according to the sequence jul20 sep18 may18 apr19 apr18 nov17 and they varied at the most by 2 5 times instead the means of s h differed according to the sequence may18 sep18 jul20 nov17 apr18 apr19 and the ratio between the highest and the lowest mean was equal to 1 3 ten of the 15 established comparisons suggested different sorptivity values when water was applied from a low height but only one difference was significant by pouring water from a high height the mean ks l values differed according to the sequence may18 jul20 sep18 apr19 apr18 nov17 and the highest ratio between two means was equal to 11 8 instead the means of ks h differed according to the sequence may18 apr18 jul20 sep18 nov17 apr19 and they varied at the most by 2 2 times eight of the 15 established comparisons suggested different ks values when water was applied from a low height but only one difference was significant by pouring water from a high height for both s and ks the means obtained with the h runs were not significantly correlated with those obtained with the l runs since r 2 was equal to 0 45 for the s h vs s l relationship and to 0 07 for the ks h vs ks l relationship n 6 and r 0 in both cases with a single exception ks measured on nov17 the l experiments yielded significantly higher s and ks values than the h experiments at each sampling date table 3 in particular the ratio between two corresponding means of s was lowest in the first two sampling dates 1 5 1 8 intermediate in the two central dates of the sampling period 2 4 2 6 and highest in the last two dates 3 0 3 2 also for ks this ratio appeared to overall increase during the experimental period starting from a non significant value of 2 0 on nov17 in particular it was equal to 2 7 and 14 2 on the second and third dates respectively and it fell in the 17 4 20 9 range in the last three dates for both soil hydrodynamic parameters relative variability of the data was generally greater with the l runs than the h runs table 3 in particular this result was obtained in four sampling dates for s taking into account that the cv values for the jul20 datasets were essentially equal and in five dates for ks therefore the applied experimental method to perform a beerkan infiltration run had a relevant impact on the determined soil hydrodynamic parameters and on their spatial and temporal variability the h runs described a soil that was less sorptive less conductive more spatially homogeneous and more temporally stable as compared with the l runs height effects were smaller when the soil was wetter and both s l and ks l were lowest 3 4 applied water volume performing on jul20 a beerkan run with 45 water volumes itot 510 3 mm instead of 30 volumes itot 340 2 mm implied that total duration of infiltration nearly doubled for both the l and h methodologies fig 9 and table 4 smaller s and ks values were obtained with more water however the water volume effect was statistically significant with the l runs for which s and ks decreased by 1 2 and 3 0 times respectively but not with the h runs for which the decrease was by a factor of 1 1 for s and 1 3 for ks total duration of the l and h runs differed significantly regardless of the fact that the experiments were performed with 30 or 45 volumes table 4 however using more water implied detecting a little larger differences since dtot l and dtot h differed by 8 8 times with 45 volumes and 7 6 times with 30 volumes differences were also significant for both water volumes between the soil hydrodynamic parameters estimated with the l and h runs however with less water 30 volumes the h runs yielded 3 2 and 17 4 times smaller s and ks values respectively than the l runs with more water 45 volumes these ratios decreased to 2 9 for s and 7 3 for ks therefore using more water implied obtaining smaller values of the soil hydrodynamic parameters but the water volume effect differed with the applied experimental methodology the decrease of s and ks was greater and also significant with the non perturbing runs whereas it was smaller and non significant with the soil perturbing runs consequently the water volume effect was appreciable for the l runs but not for the h runs moreover using more water implied reducing the detectable differences between the l and h experimental methodologies in other words the applied experimental methodology had a smaller impact on the estimated soil properties as the used water volume increased 4 discussion three dimensional infiltration rates and soil sorptivity are theoretically expected to decrease as the antecedent soil water content increases since capillarity effects are smaller in wetter soil reynolds and elrick 1990 lassabatere et al 2006 alagna et al 2018 moody et al 2009 from a theoretical point of view ks does not depend on θi however an inverse relationship between these two variables has frequently been reported e g jabro 1996 bodner et al 2013 jirků et al 2013 kargas et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 hardie et al 2012 and it was also obtained in another investigation at the sampled field site bagarello and sgroi 2007 these last authors suggested that ks was smaller in wetter soil conditions since more water in the soil induced moderate swelling phenomena and weakening of the inter particle bonds that affected adversely macropore flow effects on total water transport in other terms smaller ks values can be expected in wetter soil conditions as a consequence of swelling individual particles remain undetached by the flowing water weakening of inter particle bonds the soil does not swell or a combination of these phenomena the soil swells and individual particles are detached therefore relationships that were theoretically expected or explained in the light of the non rigid nature of the field soil were detected with the l infiltration runs that preserved the soil structure as much as possible during the experiment but not or only weakly with the h runs that induced more mechanical soil disturbance as a consequence of water impact on the soil surface le bissonnais 1996 figs 4 and 8 in other words a consequence of mechanical impact of water can be disappearance of otherwise expected relationships between the antecedent soil water content and soil hydrodynamic parameters soil disturbance had a particularly large impact on ks since ks values were generally high with the l runs 4 0 ks 1637 0 mm h median 87 4 mm h and generally low with the h runs 2 5 ks 65 0 mm h median 8 4 mm h table 2 therefore the medians differed by nearly an order of magnitude high or very high ks values are typical of macroporous soils and the macropores that dominate flow at saturation are known to be fragile and less stable than matrix pores kutílek et al 2006 jarvis et al 2013 likely changing the experimental method to perform the field infiltration run implied that the established flow process in the soil moved from a process mainly governed by the unstable structural macroporosity watson and luxmoore 1986 jarvis and messing 1995 jarvis et al 2013 to a process that was more predominantly controlled by the more stable soil matrix consequently soil perturbing runs yielded smaller and less variable ks values than the non perturbing runs the impact of the run type was also perceivable with reference to s because according to stewart et al 2013 sorptivity also depends in addition on soil capillarity representing the driving force on soil hydraulic conductivity that expresses the dissipation however differences were smaller for s than ks since the l runs yielded 30 7 s 223 1 mm h0 5 with a median of 121 5 mm h0 5 whereas with the h runs 22 8 s 104 7 mm h0 5 and a median of 43 6 mm h0 5 was obtained table 2 therefore the medians of s differed approximately by a factor of three the finding that with 30 water volumes δt h δt l nearly stabilized by the end of the run for both the complete dataset fig 5 b and each individual sampling date fig 7 b suggested that the h run had a finite capacity to induce a mechanical alteration of the soil and also that the applied l h methodology was appropriate to describe the effects of the disturbance processes in different circumstances in most sampling dates the disturbance process was not completed with 15 water volumes since δt h δt l continued to increase during the second half of the run therefore using more water for the experiment yielded a more complete description of the soil alteration process as compared with the standard protocol disturbance effects of pouring water from a high height varied with the sampling date fig 7 and table 3 in particular these effects were small or moderate when the nearly undisturbed soil was relatively wet and both s and ks were rather small instead they were noticeable in drier more sorptive and more conductive soil conditions in accordance with other findings at the same field site alagna et al 2016 obtaining relatively small ks values with a non perturbing run indicates that macropores do not have a great impact on water transport this circumstance may suggest that on the first two sampling dates the soil was inherently less modifiable as compared with the subsequent steps of the sampling campaign to be clearer changes were relatively small on nov17 and apr18 since there were not many unstable macropores instead the dry soil had more or more hydraulically effective macropores as suggested by the high ks values obtained with the l runs in this situation the soil was more sensitive to the height of water pouring since there were more opportunities for aggregate breakdown compaction of the upper soil layer and macropore obstruction le bissonnais 1996 jarvis et al 2013 this interpretation appears consistent with other findings suggesting a particular propensity of the initially dry soil to alteration for example truman et al 1990 concluded that an increase in initial water content increased the resistance of the aggregates to raindrop forces fohrer et al 1999 reported that under continuous rainfall conditions an initially dry soil was compacted more than an initially moist soil martínez mena et al 1998 reported a higher aggregate stability in wetter conditions than in air dry conditions according to this investigation the soil perturbing effect of the h experiment is expected to be relatively small when the soil shows a reduced propensity to be altered by water impact and higher in the opposite situation therefore the h runs tend to yield relatively low and rather homogeneous s and ks values regardless of the antecedent soil conditions the detected effects of θi on the s and ks values obtained with the l runs suggested that the calculated soil hydrodynamic parameters were appropriate to characterize the soil at the time of sampling but it cannot be concluded that the data were representative of an absolutely undisturbed soil for at least two reasons not necessarily alternative to each other the l experiment was carried out with all possible attention to avoid intentional structural alteration phenomena but the occurrence of these phenomena cannot be completely excluded for example some soil slaking at the beginning of the runs on the initially dry soil could have occurred as well as some swelling or detachment and transport of soil particles during the run all modifying pore arrangement le bissonnais 1996 nor can the uncertainties regarding the attainment of steady state conditions by the end of the l run be omitted fig 5a and 7a it could be presumed that a run strictly followed theory and therefore it was perhaps interrupted before fully stabilizing however attainment of near steady state infiltration rate is expected to occur soon in many instances especially in coarse or relatively coarse textured soils elrick and reynolds 1992a b reynolds et al 2000 therefore another interpretation could be that the run was not too short but it was precisely a progressive structural alteration during infiltration with the l runs that impeded stabilization of the process bagarello and david 2020 according to this reasoning a contradiction seems to arise a short run makes detection of steady state infiltration rate more uncertain due to a possible overestimation but a long run does not solve the problem in any case since it can induce a gradual soil deterioration which moreover can start from the beginning of the run in other terms a fully undisturbed condition of the wetted soil is hard to guarantee even if the infiltration experiment is performed with the greatest possible attention reynolds 2008 however this seems more a semantic than a physically sound problem since in the field flow transport processes in an initially dry soil occurs since this porous medium is wetted in other terms speaking of a dry soil that remains fully undisturbed appears nearly impossible and perhaps even illogical in the perspective to describe how water moves in this porous medium should these alteration phenomena naturally occur then the l run that preserves as much as possible soil structure exactly captures them and their impact on estimation of soil hydrodynamic parameters on the other hand the need to preserve as far as possible the characteristics of the soil during the infiltration run contrasts to some extent with the fact that in natural or agricultural environments wetting induces stresses that modifying soil structural characteristics play a central role on several hydrological processes assouline and mualem 2002 2006 in these situations a non perturbing or little perturbing infiltration run can be expected to yield a non relevant information in the perspective to explain or simulate the hydrological process of interest e g ben hur et al 1987 cerdà 1996 1999 van de giesen et al 2000 instead a soil perturbing experiment that mimics to some extent the expected effects of long and intense rains could yield a more confidently usable information in a hydrological perspective e g auteri et al 2020 in this sense the h runs performed in this investigation could be considered a good candidate method to obtain a hydrologically relevant soil hydrodynamic characterization although the experiment is practically more demanding than the classical l experiment the number of runs required to characterize the soil could be relatively small in the light of the reduced spatial and temporal variability of both s and ks noticed in this investigation even in this case however there is at least a controversial aspect the infiltration model used to derive the soil hydrodynamic parameters haverkamp et al 1994 lassabatere et al 2006 is strictly usable in nearly ideal conditions that are those of a rigid isotropic and uniformly unsaturated soil but the h run aims to intentionally alter the structure at the soil surface for the aforementioned hydrological purposes therefore the h experiment can be expected to increase the discrepancy between theory and practice with reference to this aspect there is some encouraging sign in the literature since when the soil is layered and the upper layer is the less permeable water infiltration should be more representative of the upper layer lassabatere et al 2010 di prima et al 2018 mügler et al 2019 da silva ribas et al 2021 however this information is incomplete and further tests are needed perhaps by numerical modelling tools in any case it has to be taken into account that a discrepancy between theory and reality is the norm and hence it should also be expected when the l runs are performed at this purpose bagarello et al 2010 pragmatically suggested that the soil hydrodynamic parameters obtained with a given infiltration run could have a kind of equivalent meaning that is they represent those of a rigid homogeneous and isotropic porous medium characterized by infiltration rates that are those actually measured on the real soil a similar suggestion was recently given by kindred and reynolds 2020 since according to these authors the borehole permeameter method should be expected to produce a bulk average ks value of the wetted soil volume in heterogeneous soils the circumstance that the calculated s and ks values decreased with the applied water volume for the l runs but not for the h runs table 4 appeared consistent with a rapid soil deterioration with the perturbing runs and a more gradual process with the non perturbing runs this interpretation was developed considering the most relevant soil deterioration processes promoted by water le bissonnais 1996 majdalani et al 2008 in particular the reasoning was that i initial slaking possibly occurred regardless of the applied experimental methodology l h especially considering the dry soil conditions on jul20 table 1 since ponding at the start of the run was established rapidly in both cases ii although a longer infiltration run can imply more opportunities for soil swelling or mobilization of soil particles dikinya et al 2008 bagarello and david 2020 s and ks decreased with the applied water volume for the shorter l run but not for the longer h run table 4 and iii soil disturbance by the applied water was more appreciable for the latter runs than the former ones therefore a possible explanation of the water volume effects with the two types of runs was that mechanical impact by water determined a relatively rapid soil alteration and in this situation soil swelling and pore clogging phenomena had negligible or non detectable effects on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters the effects of these phenomena became perceivable when mechanical impact effects were absent or better limited as for the l runs a way to summarize the results of this investigation is that wetting the initially unsaturated soil for a field infiltration experiment induced some soil alteration and hence a decrease of the initial s and ks values whose rate varied with the water application method in particular with the h run deterioration was rapid and as compared with a non intentionally perturbing run it was nearly completed after overall applying a relatively small water volume although larger than that corresponding to the standard beerkan run in several instances lassabatere et al 2006 however deterioration also occurred with the non perturbing or less perturbing runs but it was slower and it was not completed even with a relatively large number of water volumes in this perspective a similarity could be expected between soil hydrodynamic parameters obtained with a h run and a limited number of applied water volumes and a l run and a large to very large number of water volumes this means that different kinds of soil deterioration e g mechanical impact or wetting induced weakening of interparticle bonds could be expected to have a similar impact on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters evidently however this interpretation requires additional investigations auteri et al 2020 suggested that the lowest possible s and ks values that can be obtained by a field infiltration experiment could be viewed as a sort of hydrologically relevant index since they describe the most favorable condition to runoff occurrence according to this investigation these data could be obtained with a long non perturbing run or a relatively short soil perturbing run the mean ks values obtained with the h runs on different sampling dates varied within the rather narrow range of 6 3 to 13 6 mm h table 3 and the check performed on jul20 did not allow to undoubtedly conclude that these were the lowest possible ks values since using 45 water volumes instead of 30 volumes yielded a 22 smaller mean of ks although differences were not statistically significant table 4 reported ks values for sealed disturbed soils are 1 0 5 4 mm h bagarello and david 2020 0 35 6 2 mm h ramos et al 2000 and 0 42 1 3 mm h assouline and mualem 2002 therefore this investigation yielded some support to the suggestion by bagarello and david 2020 that the saturated conductivity of different disturbed soils could tend to collapse towards a rather narrow range of small values 5 conclusions this investigation confirmed that a soil disturbance likely similar to that occurring when rainfall produces surface runoff can be induced by an adapted single ring beerkan infiltration run adaption simply consists of pouring water on the infiltration surface from a relatively high height h run this disturbance is expected to yield saturated soil sorptivity s and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks values that are smaller than those obtained with a standard beerkan run l run in which water is poured from a low height not to disturb the exposed soil surface and likely more representative of a soil condition to some extent close to the expected one when runoff is formed disturbance effects appear to depend on the initial soil moisture and structural conditions since they were relatively small when the soil was relatively little sorptive and conductive but they became noticeable in the opposite condition therefore the propensity of a particular soil to be altered should be expected to vary with time being greater in initially more conductive conditions likely because unstable and fragile macropores are more largely present in this case soil disturbance can be expected to impede detection of relationships between infiltration derived parameters and other soil physical properties that are expected in accordance with theory or in the light of the non rigid nature of the field soil performing infiltration runs with as much water as possible appears advisable since soil disturbance effects attributable to a high height of water pouring could not be completed soon especially if the soil is initially highly conductive soil perturbing runs can be expected to yield less spatially and temporally variable estimates of the soil hydrodynamic parameters as compared with the non perturbing runs therefore less runs could be enough to parameterize the soil in a disturbed condition than in the undisturbed one this conclusion could reinvigorate the interest for the single ring infiltration methods as practical means to obtain soil hydrodynamic data of hydrological interest even with reference to rainfall excess and surface runoff formation the l h methodology appears appropriate to yield two different s and ks values one representative of a nearly undisturbed soil and the other representing a more or less disturbed soil condition the few encouraging signs about the reliability of the proposed method to estimate soil hydraulic properties relevant for simulating surface runoff deserve stronger confirmation performing other investigations in other soils different initial conditions with different number of water volumes and heights of water pouring and perhaps also combining transient and steady state methods of analysis for the l and h runs respectively will probably help to better establish potential and limitations of the l h methodology in a hydrological perspective it seems that there could be the possibility to apply experimental data collection methods and data analysis procedures so that the condition of absolutely undisturbed soil and those of completely disturbed soil are if not reached at least still better approached according to this investigation these developments should not be excessively demanding from an experimental point of view the usability of the soil hydrodynamic data to numerically simulate surface soil hydrological process should also be verified credit authorship contribution statement v bagarello conceptualization

2284,performing beerkan infiltration runs with different heights of water pouring could help to obtain saturated soil sorptivity s and hydraulic conductivity ks data usable to explain and simulate hydrological processes however most of the available information on the l low height of water pouring nearly 3 cm h high height 1 2 m methodology refers to runs making use of a relatively limited number of water volumes and there is some sign that a few water volumes could yield an incomplete description of soil alteration phenomena induced by wetting for a loam soil the objective of this investigation was to determine water pouring height effects on the s and ks values obtained in different sampling dates with more than usual amounts of applied water soil alteration due to the mechanical impact of the applied water appeared almost completed by the end of the runs in all cases but in a more advanced stage when the soil was initially more sorptive and conductive overall the h runs yielded 2 3 2 8 times smaller s values and 8 5 14 5 times smaller ks values than the l runs but differences between the l and h methodologies varied during the sampling period in particular these differences were smallest when the soil was initially relatively wet and little sorptive and conductive s and ks values differing with the experiment by no more than two times and largest in the opposite conditions s and ks values differing by 3 and 17 21 times respectively the l runs yielded coefficients of variations cv of 14 60 for s and 45 171 for ks depending on the sampling date and a ratio between the highest and the lowest mean of 2 5 for s and 11 8 for ks with the h runs the corresponding cv values were 14 38 for s and 35 107 for ks and two means differed at the most by 1 3 times for s and 2 2 times for ks therefore the h runs described a soil that was less sorptive less conductive more spatially homogeneous and more temporally stable than the l runs less runs could be enough to parameterize the soil in a disturbed condition as compared with the undisturbed one further testing the l h methodology in other environmental conditions is recommended in the perspective to develop simple field methods to determine the hydrodynamic properties of both a nearly undisturbed soil and an intensively disturbed soil keywords soil hydrodynamic parameters surface hydrological

l t are the necessary soil hydrodynamic parameters to describe infiltration with physically based models e g touma et al 2007 rahmati et al 2020 sorptivity defines the ability of a soil to conduct water by capillarity and it varies with the initial and the final soil water content and when present the ponded depth of water on the soil surface the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity represents the flow rate due solely to gravity in a saturated soil both parameters depend on soil structure and consequently they often show an appreciable dynamics at different time scales as a consequence for

biddoccu et al 2017 but trying to generalize the results of different investigations is not easy a reason is that the applied experimental methods change with the investigation and different methods can yield dissimilar results reynolds et al 2000 moreover characterizing temporal variations of soil hydrodynamic parameters is experimentally onerous and the data that can be collected with the available economic instrumental and personnel resources could not include all factors actually affecting the studied phenomenon nonetheless insisting on sampling in different environments and conditions appears necessary even in the perspective to develop as simple as possible predictive methods of temporal variability of soil hydrodynamic parameters usable for simulating hydrological processes determining the hydrodynamic properties of the upper soil layer is particularly important and complicated at the same time the importance is obviously linked to the circumstance that the upper layer represents the zone through which water enters the soil therefore understanding and simulating water infiltration into the soil and any related process require an appropriate hydraulic characterization of this layer assouline and mualem 2002 touma et al 2007 the complexity of such a hydrodynamic characterization is linked to the extraordinarily dynamic nature of the upper soil layer given that surface soil properties can be expected to change even at very short temporal scales such as during a rainfall event or between closely spaced rainstorms morin and benyamini 1977 levy et al 1986 le bissonnais and singer 1992 fohrer et al 1999 king and bjorneberg 2012 mügler et al 2019 ndiaye et al 2005 hortonian surface runoff occurs as a consequence of prolonged and intense rainfall events assouline and mualem 2002 2006 wu et al 2019 and mualem and assouline 1989 concluded that the surface seal layer induced by direct impact of raindrops on bare soil should be treated as a disturbed zone where all hydraulic parameters differ from those of the undisturbed zone below seal formation is a dynamic process that depends on the initial soil mechanical and hydraulic properties as well as the physical characteristics of rainfall or applied irrigation assouline and mualem 1997 other investigations have offered a perhaps even more complex description of short term temporal dynamics of the upper soil layer in particular neave and rayburg 2007 concluded that seal development will always represent a balance between processes that promote seals and those that actively disrupt seals in other terms raindrop impact can be both a formative and a disruptive agent in the process of seal development a short term instability of soil hydrodynamic properties is not limited to the wetting stage but it is also perceivable during the subsequent drying stage for example in an investigation by bagarello et al 2020 a reorganization of soil structure yielding increasing ks values was detected four days after an intentionally soil disturbing beerkan infiltration run lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014a temporal variability of surface soil hydrodynamic properties could be smaller for a disturbed soil than a non disturbed soil since in the former case at least ks can be expected to frequently fall in a rather narrow range of small values ramos et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 bagarello and david 2020 however little is known at this purpose for both s and ks even if the issue is relevant the reason is that less temporal changes could imply less experimental efforts to characterize a disturbed soil as compared with the undisturbed one in the context of a phenomenologically complex problem obtaining realistic s and ks data by cheap simple parsimonious and rapid experimental field methods and application methodologies appears a still unresolved issue ponding single ring infiltration methods are suitable for performing simple and generally rapid experiments in the field reynolds 2008 and several widely used data analysis procedures are based on robust theories this is the case of the so called best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters method of soil hydraulic characterization lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 bagarello et al 2014b angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 which estimates s and ks by a three dimensional field infiltration experiment at theoretically zero pressure head and the infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 however literature raises doubts about the general usability of ring infiltration methods to explain surface hydrological processes since a tendency of these methods to yield excessively high infiltration rates or ks values has been reported several times e g ben hur et al 1987 cerdà 1996 1999 van de giesen et al 2000 morbidelli et al 2017 picciafuoco et al 2019 recently concluded that the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device emphasis is generally put on the fact that obtaining reliable soil data by an infiltration method requires avoiding or at least reducing as much as possible any soil alteration due to the run reynolds 2008 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2019 however bagarello et al 2014a proposed an alternative reasoning based on the concept that the infiltration experiment could be performed in such a way to induce a soil disturbance possibly similar to that caused by intense and prolonged rainfall events in particular these authors suggested that performing beerkan infiltration runs by changing the height of water pouring and using the best methodologies of data analysis can help to detect the effects of mechanical disturbance of the infiltration surface on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters low runs l height of water pouring hw 0 03 m are expected to yield representative data for a nearly undisturbed soil whereas high runs h hw 1 0 2 0 m could yield representative data for a disturbed soil condition alagna et al 2016 2018 castellini et al 2021 the usability of the h methodology to obtain soil data specifically representative of an altered surface soil layer was supported by di prima et al 2017 di prima et al 2018 and alagna et al 2019 therefore the proposed l h methodology could in principle be used to obtain with a rather simple experiment two estimates of the soil hydrodynamic properties one representative of the undisturbed soil condition e g before a rainfall event and the other expressive of the overall effect of soil wetting including mechanical disturbance e g after the rainfall event most of the available information on the l h methodology was collected by a standard protocol that yields an experimental cumulative infiltration curve by pouring a sequence of 15 water volumes each establishing an initial water depth of nearly 1 cm on the infiltration surface this protocol that is frequently applied angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 lassabatere et al 2019 castellini et al 2021 was introduced in the first best paper lassabatere et al 2006 probably because it was considered a reasonable compromise between the need to reach a near steady state infiltration rate by the end of the run and that to use as small water volumes as possible for field campaigns applying the l h methodology by performing longer runs i e using more water volumes is advisable for at least two reasons i a longer run can favor a closer attainment of steady state infiltration rates elrick and reynolds 1992a and ii it can reveal differences between soils that are not detected with the classical protocol auteri et al 2020 however a long run can also induce progressive weakening of the interparticle bonds and mobilization of soil particles dikinya et al 2008 bagarello and david 2020 a greater influence of vertical gradients in antecedent soil water content and soil hydrodynamic parameters on the measured infiltration can also be expected vandervaere et al 2000 therefore testing the l h methodology with more water volumes than previously used is necessary the general objective of this investigation was to evaluate the performances of a l h beerkan run methodology making use of more water than that corresponding to the standard protocol in different initial conditions of a loam soil in particular the soil was sampled on six dates to i verify height of water pouring effects on the established infiltration process ii determine if these effects changed with the sampling date and hence the antecedent soil conditions iii compare soil hydrodynamic properties estimated with infiltration runs differing by the height of water application iv establish if soil disturbance had an impact on temporal changes of soil hydrodynamic parameters and v test sensitivity of the l and h experiments to the used water volume 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the agricultural food and forest sciences department of the university of palermo italy in a citrus orchard under conventional tillage with trees spaced 4 m 4 m apart coordinates 33s 355511e 4218990 n the soil at the field site typic rhodoxeralf has a relatively high gravel content and it is mostly sandy loam or loam down to a depth of at least 0 30 m bagarello et al 2014a concialdi et al 2020 this investigation was performed in an area of approximately 200 m2 in which the soil had mainly a loam texture according to the usda classification system clay 15 4 silt 36 2 sand 48 4 and a soil organic carbon content equal to 3 1 auteri et al 2020 the soil structural stability index calculated according to pieri 1992 was equal to 10 5 suggesting a stable structure reynolds et al 2009 the soil surface was gently leveled and smoothed by manual implements before sampling to sample a bare area the superficial herbaceous vegetation was cut with a knife when it was present while the roots remained in situ 2 2 field experiment small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the rings were particularly small to more clearly detect possible effects of soil disturbance due to water application on a given sampling date a total of 20 infiltration runs were carried out at randomly selected locations for each run 30 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface for each water volume 1st 2nd 30th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2021 ten runs were carried out by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height hw of 0 03 m water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application low l runs water was applied from hw 1 5 m at the other 10 sampling points high h runs the soil surface was not shielded to maximize possible disruptive effects of water impact to ensure flow verticality and prevent wind effects the device developed by bagarello et al 2014a and alagna et al 2016 was used in this case at least one l and one h run were carried out in a given day at a distance of no 1 5 2 0 m from each other in an intermediate position between the two sampling points for infiltration two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θi the soil porosity f was calculated from ρb assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm3 according to other investigations the field saturated soil water content θs was assumed to coincide with f mubarak et al 2009 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 the data were averaged over the two depths to obtain the θi and θs values for the subsequent calculations these values were associated with the couple of l and h runs performed in the vicinity of the soil sampling location since small scale variability of θi and θs can be expected not to influence appreciably calculations with the best methods di prima et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2019 sampling was performed on six dates during a period of nearly three years november 2017 april may and september 2018 april 2019 july 2020 denoted in the following as nov17 apr18 may18 sep18 apr19 and jul20 respectively to develop a dataset including a wide range of initial conditions in compliance with the application limits of the best methodology of data analysis lassabatere et al 2006 only nine h runs were performed on sep18 due to some adverse meteorological conditions during this field campaign on the last sampling date 45 water volumes were used instead of 30 volumes to also test water volume effects on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters by the two experimental methodologies part of the developed dataset was also used for other investigations auteri et al 2020 iovino et al 2021 2 3 calculations and data analysis initially the experiments performed with 30 water volumes were considered infiltration data were reported on cumulative infiltration i l vs time t t and infiltration rate ir l t vs i plots to take an initial look at the general response of the two types of experiments l and h for each sampling date the ir vs i plot was considered since durations changed from run to run making presentation of all data on a single ir vs t plot confuse for both the complete dataset all data together regardless of the sampling date and separately for each sampling campaign the mean infiltration time of each applied water volume 1st 2nd 30th was calculated for both the low δt l t and the high δt h t runs for a given applied water volume δt l was expressive of the overall effect on infiltration rate of different factors such as hydraulic potential gradient wetting induced swelling mobilization of soil particles released by slaking and weakening of the interparticle bonds the δt h value expressed the effect of the same factors in combination with water mechanical impact on the soil surface the δt h δt l ratio was plotted against the number of the applied water volumes nv to establish a quantitative comparison between the l and h runs with the same added water volume total duration of the infiltration run dtot t and saturated soil sorptivity s l t0 5 and hydraulic conductivity ks l t were determined for each run total duration was considered since it is a synthetic quantitative indicator of water infiltration and it is easier to compare than curves lassabatere et al 2019 the best steady algorithm bagarello et al 2014b was applied to calculate s and ks from the experimentally determined intercept and slope of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot best steady was preferred over best slope lassabatere et al 2006 and best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 because it was the only algorithm that in another investigation allowed a successful treatment of runs involving soil alteration and led to ks values close to those obtained by rainfall simulation di prima et al 2018 moreover possible approximations in the attainment of steady state flow could not be eliminated by using another algorithm since all best methods presuppose that flow has stabilized by the end of the run the analysis of the dtot s and ks values was performed by both considering the complete dataset and distinguishing between sampling dates preliminarily the distribution of the data obtained with the l dtot l s l ks l respectively and h dtot h s h ks h runs was checked with the lilliefors 1967 test considering both a normal no and a ln normal ln distribution with reference to the complete dataset only the ln distribution hypothesis was not rejected for dtot and ks and the two experimental methods for s only the no and only the ln distribution hypotheses were not rejected with the l and h runs respectively implying that a parametric test with the untransformed or the ln transformed s data was not usable to compare the l and h results therefore the non parametric mann whitney u test spiegel and stephens 2008 was applied to compare s l and s h and the same approach was applied for the other two variables dtot l vs dtot h and ks l vs ks h to perform a methodologically homogeneous comparison by considering separately the six sampling dates the no distribution hypothesis was never rejected for the 12 dtot datasets 6 dates 2 experimental methodologies consequently parametric two tailed t tests were applied with the untransformed dtot values the arithmetic mean and the associated coefficient of variation cv were used to summarize these data as well as the ρb and θi data in accordance with other investigation e g mubarak et al 2009 for the two calculated hydrodynamic parameters s ks the no distribution hypothesis was rejected once whereas the ln distribution hypothesis was never rejected therefore s and ks comparisons were performed by a parametric two tailed t test with the ln transformed data and the data were summarized by the geometric mean and the associated cv lee et al 1985 a pairwise approach was applied to compare l and h runs on a given date but also to establish comparisons between two sampling dates for given variable and experimental method this choice was made in accordance with other investigations focused on sampling soil properties at different dates mubarak et al 2009 unpaired t tests were used to compare two datasets since the infiltration runs were performed at different locations of the field site for the jul20 sampling campaign a comparison was also established between the results obtained with 30 and 45 volumes but a two tailed paired t test was applied in this case a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of a fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 all statistical tests including calculation of confidence intervals ci for both the intercept and the slope of a linear regression line were carried out at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry soil bulk density and antecedent soil water content dry soil bulk density increased during the sampling period table 1 in particular the smallest means of ρb 0 96 0 98 g cm3 were obtained in the first three sampling dates from nov17 to may18 and the highest means 1 04 1 08 g cm3 were detected in the last three sampling dates from sep18 to jul20 the increase of ρb was gradual as suggested by the similarity of the ρb values from apr18 to sep18 in any case ρb was generally small suggesting that the soil had a good structure with a well developed macroporosity with reference to θi the experiments were carried out in four different conditions table 1 in particular the soil was wettest at the beginning of the sampling period that is on nov17 and apr18 0 199 0 215 m3 m3 and driest on the last sampling date of jul20 0 068 m3 m3 the soil was relatively wet on may18 and apr19 0 137 0 158 m3 m3 and relatively dry on sep18 0 103 m3 m3 the dry soil bulk density decreased in wetter conditions according to a statistically significant r 2 0 114 r 0 sample size n 60 but weak relationship fig 1 the mean of the θi θs ratios was equal to 0 237 cv 37 6 denoting that on average the constraint by lassabatere et al 2006 that θi should be smaller than 0 25 θs to apply the best methods of infiltration data analysis was satisfied 3 2 infiltration considering all runs performed with 30 water volumes infiltration was measured for a total of nearly 168 h both the cumulative infiltration i vs t fig 2 and the infiltration rate ir vs i fig 3 curves signaled that the experimental infiltration processes were generally consistent with theory since the concavity of the i vs t curves was faced downwards and the infiltration rates decreased during the run in some cases however the i vs t relationship appeared nearly linear or it was a little concave upwards a linear relationship denoted a steady state process from the beginning of the run whereas upwards concavity and hence increasing ir values during at least a part of the run was likely a consequence of some soil hydrophobicity lassabatere et al 2010 alagna et al 2019 infiltration rates were generally greater for the l runs than the h runs considering the complete dataset total duration of the established infiltration processes was on average 0 65 h n 60 cv 125 0 for the l runs dtot l and 2 19 h n 59 cv 59 0 for the h runs dtot h table 2 depending on the considered measure of central tendency arithmetic mean geometric mean median the h runs were 3 3 5 3 times longer than the l runs and the difference between the two dtot datasets was statistically significant the spread of the data was larger for the h runs than the l runs but relative variability of dtot was smaller for the h runs than the l runs suggesting an overall more homogeneous response of the sampled soil with the more perturbing runs run durations dtot l dtot h were not significantly correlated with dry soil bulk density but they increased significantly with the antecedent soil water content fig 4 the fitted dtot θi relationship was stronger for the l runs r 2 0 405 than the h runs r 2 0 222 the relationships between the mean infiltration time δt h of a given water volume and the number of the applied water volumes nv for the two types of runs n 60 and 59 for the l and h runs respectively revealed differences between the two water application methods fig 5 a in particular the mean of δt increased with nv in both cases as theoretically expected elrick and reynolds 1992a but mean infiltration times increased at an appreciably higher rate for the h runs than the l ones therefore the slowdown of the infiltration process during the run was more marked when water was poured from a high height differences between the two application methods were perceived starting from the beginning of the process the means of δt h appeared to approach a nearly stable value by the end of the run last three or four water volumes while those of δt l continued to increase till the end of the run the δt h δt l ratio calculated by considering all runs was always greater than one since it varied between 1 3 and 4 1 fig 5 b this ratio increased with the number of the applied water volumes during a little more than the first half of the run and it nearly stabilized around a value of 3 7 4 1 in an advanced stage of the process mean 3 9 cv 3 2 for the last 12 δt h δt l values therefore water impact effects i started immediately that is from the first applied water volume ii increased with the overall applied water amount during the first stage of the experiment and iii were almost complete after applying a little more than half of the total used water volume which corresponds to the standard beerkan run protocol lassabatere et al 2006 in other words all possible soil deterioration due to a high height of water pouring occurred by the end of the run otherwise the δt h δt l vs nv relationship should have shown a persistent increasing trend also with reference to the applied water volumes in the final phase of the experiment a statistically significant relationship r 2 0 770 was detected between the means of dtot obtained on the six sampling dates with the l and h runs fig 6 but the linear regression line did not coincide with the identity line since the 95 confidence intervals for the intercept and the slope were 0 86 2 13 and 0 25 1 83 respectively moreover the h runs yielded significantly longer dtot values than the l ones on each date table 3 however the differences between the two water application methods varied during the experimental period since they were relatively small in the first two sampling dates mean dtot h mean dtot l 2 0 2 3 when the infiltration process with the non perturbing run was slower and appreciably higher in the subsequent sampling campaigns 4 2 7 6 characterized by more rapid l runs the mean dtot l values differed according to the sequence apr18 nov17 sep18 apr19 may18 jul20 table 3 instead the means of dtot h differed according to the sequence apr18 nov17 apr19 may18 jul20 sep18 nine of the 15 established comparisons suggested different durations when water was applied from a low height but only two differences were statistically significant by pouring water from a high height therefore a more soil perturbing run made total durations during the sampling period more similar with the l runs the mean δt vs nv relationship differed with the sampling date fig 7 a in particular δt appeared to steadily and appreciably increase with nv in the first two campaigns while it increased at an appreciably smaller rate in the last four dates the h runs yielded in general greater δt values than the l runs from the beginning of the process in all sampling dates suggesting that soil perturbation generally started to occur when water was applied for the first time even with the h runs the highest δt values were detected for all nv values during the first two campaigns with reference to both types of runs a final stabilization of the last δt values appeared perceivable at least approximately in some cases e g l and h runs on apr18 but not in other cases e g l and h runs on jul20 the δt h δt l ratios stabilized by the end of the run with 30 water volumes on each sampling date but the final δt h δt l values differed appreciably with the date fig 7 b in particular the smallest values close to 2 were obtained on the first two sampling campaigns when the l runs were slowest table 3 while the highest value equal to 11 was detected on the last campaign characterized by the most rapid non perturbing runs the final δt h δt l value was of nearly 7 on may18 and sep18 and 9 on apr19 the smaller the final value of δt h δt l the sooner this value was reached in particular stabilization occurred after pouring 9 10 water volumes in the first two campaigns 17 20 volumes in the two subsequent dates and 25 26 volumes in the last two dates 3 3 soil hydrodynamic parameters overall positive s and ks values were obtained for 56 l runs and 56 h runs that is for the 93 95 of the infiltration experiments the individual s values varied by one order of magnitude 22 8 223 1 mm h0 5 whereas ks was much more variable since it varied by more than two orders of magnitude 665 times 2 5 1637 mm h table 2 depending on the considered measure of central tendency the h runs yielded 2 3 2 8 times smaller s values and 8 5 14 5 times smaller ks values than the l runs and the differences between the l and h data were statistically significant for both parameters table 2 the spread of the s and ks data decreased from the l to h runs and also relative variability was smaller for the latter runs therefore the applied experimental methodology to perform a beerkan infiltration run had a noticeable impact on determination on the two considered soil hydrodynamic parameters changes were particularly appreciable for ks in agreement with previous findings somaratne and smettem 1993 bagarello et al 2014a and further denoting that ks represents a sentinel soil property also because it shows a wide range of variation and a high sensitivity to the applied measurement method elrick and reynolds 1992b reynolds et al 2000 performing a more soil perturbing run also reduced variability of the hydrodynamic parameters of the sampled soil volume apparently suggesting a more homogeneous field in accordance with other investigations ben hur et al 1987 assouline and mualem 2002 regardless of the height of water pouring neither s nor ks were significantly correlated with ρb since the r 2 values ranged between 0 026 and 0 036 r 0 fig 8 a b a statistically significant effect of θi on both s r 2 0 518 r 0 and ks r 2 0 404 r 0 was detected for the l runs fig 8 c d in particular both parameters decreased as θi increased with the h runs soil sorptivity decreased significantly as θi increased fig 8 c but the r 2 value equal to 0 145 r 0 was appreciably smaller than that obtained with the l runs instead the ks vs θi relationship was not significant r 2 0 009 r 0 fig 8 d the impact of the detected differences between the s and ks values obtained with the l and h runs table 2 was checked for three practical situations in the supplementary material both s and ks were found to vary during the experimental period table 3 but changes differed with the applied experimental method in particular the mean s l values differed according to the sequence jul20 sep18 may18 apr19 apr18 nov17 and they varied at the most by 2 5 times instead the means of s h differed according to the sequence may18 sep18 jul20 nov17 apr18 apr19 and the ratio between the highest and the lowest mean was equal to 1 3 ten of the 15 established comparisons suggested different sorptivity values when water was applied from a low height but only one difference was significant by pouring water from a high height the mean ks l values differed according to the sequence may18 jul20 sep18 apr19 apr18 nov17 and the highest ratio between two means was equal to 11 8 instead the means of ks h differed according to the sequence may18 apr18 jul20 sep18 nov17 apr19 and they varied at the most by 2 2 times eight of the 15 established comparisons suggested different ks values when water was applied from a low height but only one difference was significant by pouring water from a high height for both s and ks the means obtained with the h runs were not significantly correlated with those obtained with the l runs since r 2 was equal to 0 45 for the s h vs s l relationship and to 0 07 for the ks h vs ks l relationship n 6 and r 0 in both cases with a single exception ks measured on nov17 the l experiments yielded significantly higher s and ks values than the h experiments at each sampling date table 3 in particular the ratio between two corresponding means of s was lowest in the first two sampling dates 1 5 1 8 intermediate in the two central dates of the sampling period 2 4 2 6 and highest in the last two dates 3 0 3 2 also for ks this ratio appeared to overall increase during the experimental period starting from a non significant value of 2 0 on nov17 in particular it was equal to 2 7 and 14 2 on the second and third dates respectively and it fell in the 17 4 20 9 range in the last three dates for both soil hydrodynamic parameters relative variability of the data was generally greater with the l runs than the h runs table 3 in particular this result was obtained in four sampling dates for s taking into account that the cv values for the jul20 datasets were essentially equal and in five dates for ks therefore the applied experimental method to perform a beerkan infiltration run had a relevant impact on the determined soil hydrodynamic parameters and on their spatial and temporal variability the h runs described a soil that was less sorptive less conductive more spatially homogeneous and more temporally stable as compared with the l runs height effects were smaller when the soil was wetter and both s l and ks l were lowest 3 4 applied water volume performing on jul20 a beerkan run with 45 water volumes itot 510 3 mm instead of 30 volumes itot 340 2 mm implied that total duration of infiltration nearly doubled for both the l and h methodologies fig 9 and table 4 smaller s and ks values were obtained with more water however the water volume effect was statistically significant with the l runs for which s and ks decreased by 1 2 and 3 0 times respectively but not with the h runs for which the decrease was by a factor of 1 1 for s and 1 3 for ks total duration of the l and h runs differed significantly regardless of the fact that the experiments were performed with 30 or 45 volumes table 4 however using more water implied detecting a little larger differences since dtot l and dtot h differed by 8 8 times with 45 volumes and 7 6 times with 30 volumes differences were also significant for both water volumes between the soil hydrodynamic parameters estimated with the l and h runs however with less water 30 volumes the h runs yielded 3 2 and 17 4 times smaller s and ks values respectively than the l runs with more water 45 volumes these ratios decreased to 2 9 for s and 7 3 for ks therefore using more water implied obtaining smaller values of the soil hydrodynamic parameters but the water volume effect differed with the applied experimental methodology the decrease of s and ks was greater and also significant with the non perturbing runs whereas it was smaller and non significant with the soil perturbing runs consequently the water volume effect was appreciable for the l runs but not for the h runs moreover using more water implied reducing the detectable differences between the l and h experimental methodologies in other words the applied experimental methodology had a smaller impact on the estimated soil properties as the used water volume increased 4 discussion three dimensional infiltration rates and soil sorptivity are theoretically expected to decrease as the antecedent soil water content increases since capillarity effects are smaller in wetter soil reynolds and elrick 1990 lassabatere et al 2006 alagna et al 2018 moody et al 2009 from a theoretical point of view ks does not depend on θi however an inverse relationship between these two variables has frequently been reported e g jabro 1996 bodner et al 2013 jirků et al 2013 kargas et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 hardie et al 2012 and it was also obtained in another investigation at the sampled field site bagarello and sgroi 2007 these last authors suggested that ks was smaller in wetter soil conditions since more water in the soil induced moderate swelling phenomena and weakening of the inter particle bonds that affected adversely macropore flow effects on total water transport in other terms smaller ks values can be expected in wetter soil conditions as a consequence of swelling individual particles remain undetached by the flowing water weakening of inter particle bonds the soil does not swell or a combination of these phenomena the soil swells and individual particles are detached therefore relationships that were theoretically expected or explained in the light of the non rigid nature of the field soil were detected with the l infiltration runs that preserved the soil structure as much as possible during the experiment but not or only weakly with the h runs that induced more mechanical soil disturbance as a consequence of water impact on the soil surface le bissonnais 1996 figs 4 and 8 in other words a consequence of mechanical impact of water can be disappearance of otherwise expected relationships between the antecedent soil water content and soil hydrodynamic parameters soil disturbance had a particularly large impact on ks since ks values were generally high with the l runs 4 0 ks 1637 0 mm h median 87 4 mm h and generally low with the h runs 2 5 ks 65 0 mm h median 8 4 mm h table 2 therefore the medians differed by nearly an order of magnitude high or very high ks values are typical of macroporous soils and the macropores that dominate flow at saturation are known to be fragile and less stable than matrix pores kutílek et al 2006 jarvis et al 2013 likely changing the experimental method to perform the field infiltration run implied that the established flow process in the soil moved from a process mainly governed by the unstable structural macroporosity watson and luxmoore 1986 jarvis and messing 1995 jarvis et al 2013 to a process that was more predominantly controlled by the more stable soil matrix consequently soil perturbing runs yielded smaller and less variable ks values than the non perturbing runs the impact of the run type was also perceivable with reference to s because according to stewart et al 2013 sorptivity also depends in addition on soil capillarity representing the driving force on soil hydraulic conductivity that expresses the dissipation however differences were smaller for s than ks since the l runs yielded 30 7 s 223 1 mm h0 5 with a median of 121 5 mm h0 5 whereas with the h runs 22 8 s 104 7 mm h0 5 and a median of 43 6 mm h0 5 was obtained table 2 therefore the medians of s differed approximately by a factor of three the finding that with 30 water volumes δt h δt l nearly stabilized by the end of the run for both the complete dataset fig 5 b and each individual sampling date fig 7 b suggested that the h run had a finite capacity to induce a mechanical alteration of the soil and also that the applied l h methodology was appropriate to describe the effects of the disturbance processes in different circumstances in most sampling dates the disturbance process was not completed with 15 water volumes since δt h δt l continued to increase during the second half of the run therefore using more water for the experiment yielded a more complete description of the soil alteration process as compared with the standard protocol disturbance effects of pouring water from a high height varied with the sampling date fig 7 and table 3 in particular these effects were small or moderate when the nearly undisturbed soil was relatively wet and both s and ks were rather small instead they were noticeable in drier more sorptive and more conductive soil conditions in accordance with other findings at the same field site alagna et al 2016 obtaining relatively small ks values with a non perturbing run indicates that macropores do not have a great impact on water transport this circumstance may suggest that on the first two sampling dates the soil was inherently less modifiable as compared with the subsequent steps of the sampling campaign to be clearer changes were relatively small on nov17 and apr18 since there were not many unstable macropores instead the dry soil had more or more hydraulically effective macropores as suggested by the high ks values obtained with the l runs in this situation the soil was more sensitive to the height of water pouring since there were more opportunities for aggregate breakdown compaction of the upper soil layer and macropore obstruction le bissonnais 1996 jarvis et al 2013 this interpretation appears consistent with other findings suggesting a particular propensity of the initially dry soil to alteration for example truman et al 1990 concluded that an increase in initial water content increased the resistance of the aggregates to raindrop forces fohrer et al 1999 reported that under continuous rainfall conditions an initially dry soil was compacted more than an initially moist soil martínez mena et al 1998 reported a higher aggregate stability in wetter conditions than in air dry conditions according to this investigation the soil perturbing effect of the h experiment is expected to be relatively small when the soil shows a reduced propensity to be altered by water impact and higher in the opposite situation therefore the h runs tend to yield relatively low and rather homogeneous s and ks values regardless of the antecedent soil conditions the detected effects of θi on the s and ks values obtained with the l runs suggested that the calculated soil hydrodynamic parameters were appropriate to characterize the soil at the time of sampling but it cannot be concluded that the data were representative of an absolutely undisturbed soil for at least two reasons not necessarily alternative to each other the l experiment was carried out with all possible attention to avoid intentional structural alteration phenomena but the occurrence of these phenomena cannot be completely excluded for example some soil slaking at the beginning of the runs on the initially dry soil could have occurred as well as some swelling or detachment and transport of soil particles during the run all modifying pore arrangement le bissonnais 1996 nor can the uncertainties regarding the attainment of steady state conditions by the end of the l run be omitted fig 5a and 7a it could be presumed that a run strictly followed theory and therefore it was perhaps interrupted before fully stabilizing however attainment of near steady state infiltration rate is expected to occur soon in many instances especially in coarse or relatively coarse textured soils elrick and reynolds 1992a b reynolds et al 2000 therefore another interpretation could be that the run was not too short but it was precisely a progressive structural alteration during infiltration with the l runs that impeded stabilization of the process bagarello and david 2020 according to this reasoning a contradiction seems to arise a short run makes detection of steady state infiltration rate more uncertain due to a possible overestimation but a long run does not solve the problem in any case since it can induce a gradual soil deterioration which moreover can start from the beginning of the run in other terms a fully undisturbed condition of the wetted soil is hard to guarantee even if the infiltration experiment is performed with the greatest possible attention reynolds 2008 however this seems more a semantic than a physically sound problem since in the field flow transport processes in an initially dry soil occurs since this porous medium is wetted in other terms speaking of a dry soil that remains fully undisturbed appears nearly impossible and perhaps even illogical in the perspective to describe how water moves in this porous medium should these alteration phenomena naturally occur then the l run that preserves as much as possible soil structure exactly captures them and their impact on estimation of soil hydrodynamic parameters on the other hand the need to preserve as far as possible the characteristics of the soil during the infiltration run contrasts to some extent with the fact that in natural or agricultural environments wetting induces stresses that modifying soil structural characteristics play a central role on several hydrological processes assouline and mualem 2002 2006 in these situations a non perturbing or little perturbing infiltration run can be expected to yield a non relevant information in the perspective to explain or simulate the hydrological process of interest e g ben hur et al 1987 cerdà 1996 1999 van de giesen et al 2000 instead a soil perturbing experiment that mimics to some extent the expected effects of long and intense rains could yield a more confidently usable information in a hydrological perspective e g auteri et al 2020 in this sense the h runs performed in this investigation could be considered a good candidate method to obtain a hydrologically relevant soil hydrodynamic characterization although the experiment is practically more demanding than the classical l experiment the number of runs required to characterize the soil could be relatively small in the light of the reduced spatial and temporal variability of both s and ks noticed in this investigation even in this case however there is at least a controversial aspect the infiltration model used to derive the soil hydrodynamic parameters haverkamp et al 1994 lassabatere et al 2006 is strictly usable in nearly ideal conditions that are those of a rigid isotropic and uniformly unsaturated soil but the h run aims to intentionally alter the structure at the soil surface for the aforementioned hydrological purposes therefore the h experiment can be expected to increase the discrepancy between theory and practice with reference to this aspect there is some encouraging sign in the literature since when the soil is layered and the upper layer is the less permeable water infiltration should be more representative of the upper layer lassabatere et al 2010 di prima et al 2018 mügler et al 2019 da silva ribas et al 2021 however this information is incomplete and further tests are needed perhaps by numerical modelling tools in any case it has to be taken into account that a discrepancy between theory and reality is the norm and hence it should also be expected when the l runs are performed at this purpose bagarello et al 2010 pragmatically suggested that the soil hydrodynamic parameters obtained with a given infiltration run could have a kind of equivalent meaning that is they represent those of a rigid homogeneous and isotropic porous medium characterized by infiltration rates that are those actually measured on the real soil a similar suggestion was recently given by kindred and reynolds 2020 since according to these authors the borehole permeameter method should be expected to produce a bulk average ks value of the wetted soil volume in heterogeneous soils the circumstance that the calculated s and ks values decreased with the applied water volume for the l runs but not for the h runs table 4 appeared consistent with a rapid soil deterioration with the perturbing runs and a more gradual process with the non perturbing runs this interpretation was developed considering the most relevant soil deterioration processes promoted by water le bissonnais 1996 majdalani et al 2008 in particular the reasoning was that i initial slaking possibly occurred regardless of the applied experimental methodology l h especially considering the dry soil conditions on jul20 table 1 since ponding at the start of the run was established rapidly in both cases ii although a longer infiltration run can imply more opportunities for soil swelling or mobilization of soil particles dikinya et al 2008 bagarello and david 2020 s and ks decreased with the applied water volume for the shorter l run but not for the longer h run table 4 and iii soil disturbance by the applied water was more appreciable for the latter runs than the former ones therefore a possible explanation of the water volume effects with the two types of runs was that mechanical impact by water determined a relatively rapid soil alteration and in this situation soil swelling and pore clogging phenomena had negligible or non detectable effects on the estimated soil hydrodynamic parameters the effects of these phenomena became perceivable when mechanical impact effects were absent or better limited as for the l runs a way to summarize the results of this investigation is that wetting the initially unsaturated soil for a field infiltration experiment induced some soil alteration and hence a decrease of the initial s and ks values whose rate varied with the water application method in particular with the h run deterioration was rapid and as compared with a non intentionally perturbing run it was nearly completed after overall applying a relatively small water volume although larger than that corresponding to the standard beerkan run in several instances lassabatere et al 2006 however deterioration also occurred with the non perturbing or less perturbing runs but it was slower and it was not completed even with a relatively large number of water volumes in this perspective a similarity could be expected between soil hydrodynamic parameters obtained with a h run and a limited number of applied water volumes and a l run and a large to very large number of water volumes this means that different kinds of soil deterioration e g mechanical impact or wetting induced weakening of interparticle bonds could be expected to have a similar impact on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters evidently however this interpretation requires additional investigations auteri et al 2020 suggested that the lowest possible s and ks values that can be obtained by a field infiltration experiment could be viewed as a sort of hydrologically relevant index since they describe the most favorable condition to runoff occurrence according to this investigation these data could be obtained with a long non perturbing run or a relatively short soil perturbing run the mean ks values obtained with the h runs on different sampling dates varied within the rather narrow range of 6 3 to 13 6 mm h table 3 and the check performed on jul20 did not allow to undoubtedly conclude that these were the lowest possible ks values since using 45 water volumes instead of 30 volumes yielded a 22 smaller mean of ks although differences were not statistically significant table 4 reported ks values for sealed disturbed soils are 1 0 5 4 mm h bagarello and david 2020 0 35 6 2 mm h ramos et al 2000 and 0 42 1 3 mm h assouline and mualem 2002 therefore this investigation yielded some support to the suggestion by bagarello and david 2020 that the saturated conductivity of different disturbed soils could tend to collapse towards a rather narrow range of small values 5 conclusions this investigation confirmed that a soil disturbance likely similar to that occurring when rainfall produces surface runoff can be induced by an adapted single ring beerkan infiltration run adaption simply consists of pouring water on the infiltration surface from a relatively high height h run this disturbance is expected to yield saturated soil sorptivity s and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks values that are smaller than those obtained with a standard beerkan run l run in which water is poured from a low height not to disturb the exposed soil surface and likely more representative of a soil condition to some extent close to the expected one when runoff is formed disturbance effects appear to depend on the initial soil moisture and structural conditions since they were relatively small when the soil was relatively little sorptive and conductive but they became noticeable in the opposite condition therefore the propensity of a particular soil to be altered should be expected to vary with time being greater in initially more conductive conditions likely because unstable and fragile macropores are more largely present in this case soil disturbance can be expected to impede detection of relationships between infiltration derived parameters and other soil physical properties that are expected in accordance with theory or in the light of the non rigid nature of the field soil performing infiltration runs with as much water as possible appears advisable since soil disturbance effects attributable to a high height of water pouring could not be completed soon especially if the soil is initially highly conductive soil perturbing runs can be expected to yield less spatially and temporally variable estimates of the soil hydrodynamic parameters as compared with the non perturbing runs therefore less runs could be enough to parameterize the soil in a disturbed condition than in the undisturbed one this conclusion could reinvigorate the interest for the single ring infiltration methods as practical means to obtain soil hydrodynamic data of hydrological interest even with reference to rainfall excess and surface runoff formation the l h methodology appears appropriate to yield two different s and ks values one representative of a nearly undisturbed soil and the other representing a more or less disturbed soil condition the few encouraging signs about the reliability of the proposed method to estimate soil hydraulic properties relevant for simulating surface runoff deserve stronger confirmation performing other investigations in other soils different initial conditions with different number of water volumes and heights of water pouring and perhaps also combining transient and steady state methods of analysis for the l and h runs respectively will probably help to better establish potential and limitations of the l h methodology in a hydrological perspective it seems that there could be the possibility to apply experimental data collection methods and data analysis procedures so that the condition of absolutely undisturbed soil and those of completely disturbed soil are if not reached at least still better approached according to this investigation these developments should not be excessively demanding from an experimental point of view the usability of the soil hydrodynamic data to numerically simulate surface soil hydrological process should also be verified credit authorship contribution statement v bagarello conceptualization
