8760,for decades which treatment process is the best has been the primary question for many researchers worldwide therefore this study aims to optimize the treatment models using the imperialist competitive algorithm ica to achieve a techno economical comparison of biological adsorption electrocoagulation ec and bio adsorption processes as examples in acid orange 7 ao 7 and acid red 18 ar 18 removal membrane sequencing batch reactor msbr granular activated carbon gac and gac msbr were selected as biological adsorbent and biological adsorption processes respectively msbr was the cheapest 0 02 0 08 us m3 followed by gac 0 03 0 63 us m3 although msbr permeates may not be of desirable quality gac and gac msbr permeate offer the best quality in addition to high operating costs in ec 1 us m3 the electrodes should be changed after several usages which cost approximately 550 us m3 in this research gac msbr as an effective process had 80 100 ar 18 removal efficiency 0 14 0 16 us m3 graphical abstract image 1 keywords acid orange 7 ao 7 acid red 18 ar 18 activated carbon adsorption electrocoagulation membrane bioreactor mbr data availability the sources of data are mentioned in the paper 1 introduction in any phenomenon there exist many environmental economic and social challenges 1 from an environmental and economic perspective physicochemical biological and combined processes are usually applied for pollutant removal 1 2 comparison between treatment methods can be accomplished by conventional comparison 3 4 article review 5 modeling 6 7 life cycle assessment 8 9 and evaluating strategies and decision support systems 10 11 during the last decade the ever increasing difficulty and complexity of real world problems such as pollution control strategies have further highlighted the necessity of optimization algorithms 12 13 removal of 4 5 106 metric tons of dyes and byproducts yearly is a socio economic and environmental challenge because of its mutagenic and carcinogenic risks 14 azo dyes were selected in the present study as the most popular group of dyes resistant to aerobic degradation needing both aerobic and aerobic conditions 15 this group of dyes constitutes nine million metric tons 70 of the global demand as the largest production capacity of chemical dyes 14 hence azo dyes are good examples for pollutant removal optimization modeling because azo dyes removal percentages differ from one dye to another 16 and from one process to another 15 figure a 1 shows the applications of acid orange 7 ao 7 and acid red 18 ar 18 as two selected azo dyes 17 as demonstrated one of their applications is in the textile industry textile industries contribute to more than 50 of wastewater containing dyes 15 according to our knowledge there is currently no research comparing treatment methods using multi objective optimization algorithms in addition there is also no research available on units of us m3 and us kg removed dye as operating cost units except for a previous study by ref 18 furthermore the other significant advantage of the present study is considering economic inflation by evaluating prices in 2015 and 2022 the novelty of this research is that it is the first study that compares adsorption by granular activated carbon gac electrocoagulation ec and membrane sequencing batch reactor msbr as representatives of physicochemical and biological methods with a combination of msbr containing gac gac msbr treatment strategies were also evaluated to calculate initial costs and other assessment criteria such as social considerations the current study is accomplished according to previous works including ec 19 msbr 15 and msbr containing gac 20 although some of the data is presented in previous works other data such as operating costs especially for biological processes are new to this research in addition for the biological treatment of ao 7 the data in the literature were used 9 21 the current research is composed of two stages the first stage assesses the initial costs and non calculable criteria such as social considerations while the second stage evaluates removal efficiencies with operating costs this research is needed as the initial phase of studies before manufacturing and installing the equipment for any industry in other words it would be of great interest to those involved with evaluating optimizing and decision making regarding technologies and strategies in any industry in addition the paper will be interesting for environmental managers because it considers operating cost units and economic inflation over the years therefore this study aims to conduct a techno economical comparison of biological adsorption ec and combined processes to remove ao 7 and ar 18 dyes 2 materials and methods 2 1 systems and primary assumptions the current study is accomplished according to previous works including electrocoagulation 19 msbr 15 and msbr containing gac 20 in other words the present work is the conclusion of previous works by adding data to assist the decision making of environmental managers table a 1 shows the references for each part of the paper although some of the data is presented in previous works other data such as operating costs especially for biological processes are new to this research the systems for ec and msbr are depicted in refs 15 22 without coagulant and adsorbent respectively activated carbon was selected after evaluating different adsorbents including natural adsorbents accomplished by previous works by nitrate 23 and nickel 24 removal therefore the authors preferred to use activated carbon because 1 it does not need any special preparation caveats washing with acid weighed with a ratio of hno3 20 and water 3 followed by washing with distilled water was carried out before every test 20 2 it is cost effective 25 and 3 it is the most popular adsorbent with satisfactory performance 25 the average cost of activated carbon and biochar was 5 6 and 5 respectively 26 therefore there is a 12 cost difference between these two materials some researchers report biochar as a cost effective adsorbent 27 in addition a high specific surface area of 723 m2 g is a good value compared to 640 m2 g for biochar 27 28 the authors also examined other low cost adsorbents such as pure kaolinite and montmorillonite without any preparation nonetheless they were not effective and produced significant turbidity other researchers expressed that dredging sediment containing mainly clay minerals had a relatively high surface area of 39 m2 g 29 data for ao7 removal in the msbr process were extracted from other biological processes 21 30 gac msbr system is described 20 with the assumption that the dose of gac is linearly related to the initial dye concentration the adsorption tests were done only on ar 18 but were also conducted for ao 7 according to refs 31 32 table 1 shows the ranges of the independent factors table 1 presents the three batch systems applied in this study in addition the combination of the two systems namely gac msbr was also assessed this process assessment was accomplished based on the operating costs in 2022 and 2017 in addition the calculations were considered for msbr systems with and without food prices the operating costs were also expressed in two units us m3 and us kg removed the dye which each one can be important in practice based on the industry 2 2 details and other assumptions gac had pore volume pore diameter and a high specific surface area of 0 456 ml g and 2 522 nm and 723 m2 g respectively 27 other properties and details are presented in the authors previous work 20 the adsorption test was carried out in a beaker using a mixer and was repeated in an erlenmeyer flask using a shaker on 100 ml synthetic wastewater containing the dye and distilled water in ec treatment 2 g nacl was added to a 2 5 l reactor of synthetic wastewater to provide electrical conductivity the synthetic wastewater in this stage was ar 18 and distilled water like the gac stage in the ec process the ph of solutions made by distillate water was adjusted to 7 in the present work despite taheri et al 2022a and many recent works 33 the stirring cost 34 was calculated for ec costs to provide a comparison with other treatment processes the effective and total volumes of the biological treatment reactors are 14 l and 20 l respectively food including glucose urea and mkp was added to the synthetic wastewater which for msbr and gac msbr was dye and tap water air pump for biological treatment was considered in the operating and initial costs and aeration time was half the mixing in the anaerobic phase an air pump is necessary to eliminate intermediates in the biological treatment of dye although it is ineffective in azo dye removal 15 the depicted experimental system in ref 15 had two air pumps and two mixers but only one mixer was considered in the calculations to avoid excess costs in msbr srt was changed from 20 to 50 d to 20 30 d in gac msbr to calculate the daily gac value sludge retention time srt is an essential factor in membrane fouling but we have not discussed it in this paper because fouling has no decisive influence on costs in the mentioned range of srt low srt values also cause more waste sludge that should be managed correctly to avoid spreading pollution 2 3 modeling and calculations mixing air pumping suction food supply dose of gac as adsorbent aluminum mass depletion and electrical consumption were considered operating costs some costs or incomes such as worker wages washing the adsorbent gas production and sludge disposal were neglected in modeling although they were compared qualitatively some costs were not considered because they were almost the same for all the processes such as manufacturing the treatment tank and purchasing mixers therefore the costs of air diffusers membranes and aluminum plates were compared as the initial costs the two objective imperialist competitive algorithm ica 35 was used for dye removal and operating costs functions to optimize all the processes in msbr for 18 h and more biological reactions including 12 h anaerobic and 6 h aerobic according to the second step of 15 and the authors experience in biological treatment of msbr the foods are industrial glucose 1 5 kg m3 medical urea 0 16 kg m3 and wholesale mono potassium phosphate 0 067 kg m3 which is also named kmp with the chemical formula of kh2po4 all the biological prices are calculated per cycle for 9 h and less mixing by mixer and aeration as the biological reaction the amounts of glucose urea and mkp are halved therefore costfood is a function of the total process time costfood us m3 a cglucose b curea c ckmp where cglucose curea and ckmp are mentioned as the quantities of consumption of each food as concentration units kg m3 the coefficients a b and c in 2022 are 2 84 us kg glucose 1 14 us kg urea and 4 17 us kg kmp respectively in gac msbr the operating costs is operating costgac msbr us m3 d tmixers e tair pumps f csuction i cgac where tmixers tair pumps csuction and cgac are mixing time h aeration time h suction time h and gac dosage kg m3 respectively aeration time in this study is half the mixing time gac dosage is 0 284 kg m3 and 0 0568 kg m3 for 500 mg l and 100 mg l ar 18 dyeing wastewater respectively coefficients of d e f and i are 0 0023 us h m3 0 0015 us h m3 0 0057 us h m3 and 2 27 us kg gac respectively in 2022 in 2017 d e f and i are 0 0099 us h m3 0 0066 us h m3 0 02475 us h m3 and 2 25 us kg gac respectively for msbr the last term the amount of added gac instead of discharged gac was zero in the calculations of this study suction time is 2 h m3 for all the treatment methods although it can be faster in ec due to not using the membrane in adsorption operating costs are calculated as follows operating costsgac us m3 d tmixers f csuction i cgac where tmixers is constant 4 h in the adsorption process due to vigorous stirring d is double compared to the d coefficient in gac msbr in ec the operating costs is operating costs ec us m3 d t mixers k c

al respectively in 2022 in 2017 k and m were 0 0165 us kwh and 5 us kg al respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening and initial costs assessment table 2 shows the main drawbacks of the treatment technologies final ph and turbidity of the treated solution after significant dye removal efficiency 49 was used as standard in table 2 meets standard in table 2 means that when the system operations are according to the conditions set in table 1 whether the system can or cannot achieve the related standards after complete treatment remaining aluminum cod turbidity and ph high values for smp will result in high cod values it is noteworthy that biological processes are eco friendly when managed correctly for example produced gas can be helpful in another industry the best treated wastewater quality belongs to gac msbr and gac adsorption of the selected dyes adsorption causes massive waste despite its fast simple straightforward process with high quality discharge on the other hand gac msbr is slower than adsorption and produces less water quality but meets standards and as an important positive point results in less waste adsorption has the lowest price according to the depicted order adsorption 500 us m3 electrocoagulation 552 us m3 msbr 800 us m3 figure a 2 compares initial costs for different treatment technologies in 2022 for 1 m3 volume facilities gac msbr results in an 18 us increase in the initial costs of gac added on the first day of operation the value of 18 us is lower than msbr s initial costs so gac msbr s initial costs are not mentioned in fig a 2 as a separate column and its initial costs are similar to msbr s initial costs added gac operating costs according to srt were considered in the operating costs calculations ec did not require filtration because sludge tends to float on the treated solution and turbidity is acceptable after 30 min of sedimentation therefore only aluminum plates were depicted in ec s initial costs the crushed gac does not sediment using a stirrer so a membrane is necessary for adsorption a membrane is also crucial in msbr and combined msbr because sludge and additives cannot leave the reactor which results in added system stability and permeates quality air pumps cause high initial costs 35 however the initial costs of air pumps and membranes are usually sufficient for several years unfortunately as mentioned in table 2 for ec aluminum plates are replaced after ten times usage so as a notable disadvantage they incur high initial costs in ec treatment 3 2 operating costs optimization fig 1 depicts optimized dye removals and operating costs for different treatment technologies expressed as a us m3 in 2022 b us m3 in 2017 c us m3 including food costs in msbr treatments in 2022 and d us kg removed dye in 2022 in addition table a 2 and table 3 present the selected answers of fig 1a and d respectively air pumps incur approximately 25 of operation costs and 35 of initial costs although aerating does not contribute to dye removal therefore operating costs will be reduced by approximately 50 or 25 if a pollutant can be removed by only aeration or mixing the initial costs will also be reduced substantially due to eliminating the mixers or air diffusers according to fig 1a the lowest operating costs is for biological processes according to table a 2 adsorption and ec are the most expensive methods in this study as illustrated in fig 1d there is a big difference between ao 7 and ar 18 pareto curves in ec in addition there is a big difference between ec and other methods fig 1d rising inflation and devaluation of the iranian rial resulted in changes depicted in fig 1b a inflation has made biological processes the cheapest processes on the pareto chart excluding food over five years in addition by increasing the price of materials the slope of the adsorption pareto line is steeper in fig 1a compared to fig 1b according to fig 1c there is a meaningful difference when the wastes can be used as food without any costs or food to be purchased as wholesale material dyes are pollutants to the environment and can be food or toxic food for microorganisms therefore mixed with dye solutions microorganisms produce enzymes capable of degrading dyes after a short time e g one day this phase is called inoculation which adapts the microorganism to the pollutant dye other parameters such as srt can also be set in the inoculation phase dyes even nontoxic dyes cannot provide adequate food for microorganisms hence they need more substances especially more carbon some dyes such as the two selected dyes food dyes or medical dyes are considered edible dyes fig a 1 consequently although eaten by organisms dyes even oral dyes are practically not food in this study dyes are pollutants foods are industrial glucose medical urea and wholesale kh2po4 and the amount of each one is according to previous works 15 20 36 in addition as depicted in fig 1c food costs in a cycle for gac msbr are less than msbr the food costs will differ in different time intervals however both gac msbr and msbr food costs are equal in a specific time interval therefore for long cycles the food costs are twice and gac msbr has a short cycle time which results in less food costs as mentioned in fig 1d and table 3 there is a separate limited set of answers as the optimum point for gac msbr optimum points will dominate other possible answers because they have lower removal efficiency or higher operating costs regarding us kg removed dye therefore lower costs cannot be mentioned for gac msbr in addition similar to fig 1a msbr for ar 18 removal and ao 7 are the most cost effective solutions the other important point in fig 1d and table 3 is the meaningful difference between ec removal of ao 7 and ar 18 table 3 shows that the initial ar 18 concentration will be decreased by increasing ar 18 ec s removal efficiency which does not agree with ao 7 therefore fig 1d and table 3 prove ec cannot be recommended for ar 18 solution treatment with high initial dye concentration and aiming for more than 70 removal efficiency among other processes according to fig 1d and table 3 gac msbr can remove high and low dye concentrations at approximately the same price this work is an example therefore any process can be enhanced using different methods such as using waste as an electrode taheri et al 202 fig or changing operating modes 50 to solve the sacrificial anode problem 38 and anode cathode passivation 51 which affect both operational and initial costs different modes of operation such as alternating current ac or direct current dc have always been a challenge for researchers from the cost benefit point of view 52 53 4 conclusion this study compared techno economical screening and optimization of biological adsorption and electrocoagulation processes in two azo dyes removal the following conclusions can be drawn the best treated wastewater quality belongs to gac msbr and gac adsorption of the selected dyes because they can achieve the required standards from the cod point of view the highest initial costs are associated with msbr 800 us m3 and gac msbr 818 us m3 but because of the need to replace expensive aluminum plates 550 us m3 in the ec process after several usages ec has higher initial costs from 2017 to 2022 materials costs increased more than electricity which caused a big difference between biological processes and adsorption and ec processes in addition food costs in biological treatment can be very high depending on the expression of operating costs and dye type ec can be the best or worst for wastewater treatment a maximum value of 15 63 us kg removed ar 18 dye is reported compared with 2 21 us kg removed ao 7 dye while in terms of us m3 the difference between ao 7 1 09 us m3 and ar 18 1 56 us m3 is reduced gac msbr 5 74 us kg removed dye can be the best process for both the selected dyes from the treated wastewater quality and operating costs perspectives in summary the current study s techno economical evaluation showed that decision making for selection between different processes depending on desirables pollutants time facilities and the country is unique in any industry funding this study was funded by the islamic republic of iran biotechnology development

optimization fig 1 depicts optimized dye removals and operating costs for different treatment technologies expressed as a us m3 in 2022 b us m3 in 2017 c us m3 including food costs in msbr treatments in 2022 and d us kg removed dye in 2022 in addition table a 2 and table 3 present the selected answers of fig 1a and d respectively air pumps incur approximately 25 of operation costs and 35 of initial costs although aerating does not contribute to dye removal therefore operating costs will be reduced by approximately 50 or 25 if a pollutant can be removed by only aeration or mixing the initial costs will also be reduced substantially due to eliminating the mixers or air diffusers according to fig 1a the lowest operating costs is for biological processes according to table a 2 adsorption and ec are the most expensive methods in this study as illustrated in fig 1d there is a big difference between ao 7 and ar 18 pareto curves in ec in addition there is a big difference between ec and other methods fig 1d rising inflation and devaluation of the iranian rial resulted in changes depicted in fig 1b a inflation has made biological processes the cheapest processes on the pareto chart excluding food over five years in addition by increasing the price of materials the slope of the adsorption pareto line is steeper in fig 1a compared to fig 1b according to fig 1c there is a meaningful difference when the wastes can be used as food without any costs or food to be purchased as wholesale material dyes are pollutants to the environment and can be food or toxic food for microorganisms therefore mixed with dye solutions microorganisms produce enzymes capable of degrading dyes after a short time e g one day this phase is called inoculation which adapts the microorganism to the pollutant dye other parameters such as srt can also be set in the inoculation phase dyes even nontoxic dyes cannot provide adequate food for microorganisms hence they need more substances especially more carbon some dyes such as the two selected dyes food dyes or medical dyes are considered edible dyes fig a 1 consequently although eaten by organisms dyes even oral dyes are practically not food in this study dyes are pollutants foods are industrial glucose medical urea and wholesale kh2po4 and the amount of each one is according to previous works 15 20 36 in addition as depicted in fig 1c food costs in a cycle for gac msbr are less than msbr the food costs will differ in different time intervals however both gac msbr and msbr food costs are equal in a specific time interval therefore for long cycles the food costs are twice and gac msbr has a short cycle time which results in less food costs as mentioned in fig 1d and table 3 there is a separate limited set of answers as the optimum point for gac msbr optimum points will dominate other possible answers because they have lower removal efficiency or higher operating costs regarding us kg removed dye therefore lower costs cannot be mentioned for gac msbr in addition similar to fig 1a msbr for ar 18 removal and ao 7 are the most cost effective solutions the other important point in fig 1d and table 3 is the meaningful difference between ec removal of ao 7 and ar 18 table 3 shows that the initial ar 18 concentration will be decreased by increasing ar 18 ec s removal efficiency which does not agree with ao 7 therefore fig 1d and table 3 prove ec cannot be recommended for ar 18 solution treatment with high initial dye concentration and aiming for more than 70 removal efficiency among other processes according to fig 1d and table 3 gac msbr can remove high and low dye concentrations at approximately the same price this work is an example therefore any process can be enhanced using different methods such as using waste as an electrode taheri et al 202 fig or changing operating modes 50 to solve the sacrificial anode problem 38 and anode cathode passivation 51 which affect both operational and initial costs different modes of operation such as alternating current ac or direct current dc have always been a challenge for researchers from the cost benefit point of view 52 53 4 conclusion this study compared techno economical screening and optimization of biological adsorption and electrocoagulation processes in two azo dyes removal the following conclusions can be drawn the best treated wastewater quality belongs to gac msbr and gac adsorption of the selected dyes because they can achieve the required standards from the cod point of view the highest initial costs are associated with msbr 800 us m3 and gac msbr 818 us m3 but because of the need to replace expensive aluminum plates 550 us m3 in the ec process after several usages ec has higher initial costs from 2017 to 2022 materials costs increased more than electricity which caused a big difference between biological processes and adsorption and ec processes in addition food costs in biological treatment can be very high depending on the expression of operating costs and dye type ec can be the best or worst for wastewater treatment a maximum value of 15 63 us kg removed ar 18 dye is reported compared with 2 21 us kg removed ao 7 dye while in terms of us m3 the difference between ao 7 1 09 us m3 and ar 18 1 56 us m3 is reduced gac msbr 5 74 us kg removed dye can be the best process for both the selected dyes from the treated wastewater quality and operating costs perspectives in summary the current study s techno economical evaluation showed that decision making for selection between different processes depending on desirables pollutants time facilities and the country is unique in any industry funding this study was funded by the islamic republic of iran biotechnology development

8761,water sector planning and policy making in arid and semi arid regions are challenging because many drivers and decision criteria require consideration in this study a multi period mixed integer linear programming model was developed to integrate and economically evaluate water management options for water supply in arid regions the applicability of the proposed approach was demonstrated through a case study in the emirate of abu dhabi ead united arab emirates the model was programmed in general algebraic modeling system gams and solved using the cplex solver the model determined the optimal economic and environmental costs capacity expansion of treatment plants and water transmission systems and other environmental aspects including the carbon footprint and brine discharge results show that the capacity contribution of reverse osmosis for desalination is expected to increase from 5 1 in 2021 to 18 1 in 2050 based on the model s results for the case study it was concluded that even with moderate consideration of environmental aspects desalination plants in the ead need a major technology transformation from thermal desalination to reverse osmosis the proposed model is proved to be effective for integrated water resources management and infrastructure planning in the ead and has the potential for effective application in other arid or semi arid countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords mixed integer linear programming gams capacity expansion water optimization model sustainability water resource management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction several countries face water supply challenges to meet ever growing demands due to economic and population growth 1 4 the situation is exacerbated in arid and semi arid countries which also face a decline in the availability of renewable water resources 4 7 therefore the key challenge for water policymakers in arid and semi arid countries is to assess all the various components of water system while objectively balancing the water supply requirements to available resources within the constraints of sustainability cost and stakeholder satisfaction in most countries increasing water demand is managed by augmenting the water supply by increasing the capacity of existing water treatment and supply facilities or the construction of new facilities 1 6 therefore forecasting future changes in demand is critical for planning an optimum capacity expansion or building new facilities 8 10 however the optimal planning of water resources to meet demand is challenging because of the complexity involved in choosing from numerous available alternatives mathematical programming and optimization techniques have been used to solve complex water problems such as water supply planning water resource allocation industrial water management irrigation management and capacity planning 11 17 water planners develop models using approaches such as mixed integer programming mip 18 quadratic programming 16 dynamic programming dp 19 mixed integer nonlinear programming 20 and mixed integer linear programming 21 several recent studies have implemented mixed integer linear programming milp to optimize the water supply by considering various technical economic and environmental parameters 22 24 however few studies have considered the decision variables relevant to the operational and capacity constraints of various conventional and nonconventional sources available for water supply 25 26 instead studies have focused on assisting decision makers with planning and developing policies for optimal water resource allocation at the regional level with specific objectives 21 27 30 it is enormously challenging task to figure out how to provide effective water management decision support given the multitude of practical economic and environmental constraints that need to be considered in water scarce countries in such studies the focus has been on identifying various alternatives to the water supply for the study area to meet the steady increase in demand the alternatives were then optimized by considering long term sustainability cost and energy requirements in one study 21 researchers used the milp to address the problem of integrated water resources management in two greek islands in this study potable and non potable systems of water supply were integrated into the model to determine minimized annualized total capital and operating costs by taking decision variables such as the location of desalination wastewater ww treatment as well as pipelines and storage tanks for desalinated water ww and reclaimed water into consideration in another study 29 to optimize a system comprising water supply and distribution to an island with water shortages the researchers considered both technical and environmental parameters related to supply sources required infrastructure projects water production cost and values for water resource exploitation one study in egypt 30 followed a technical model approach to manage the growing water demand in the tourism sector and used dp to optimize the capacity expansion schedule of reverse osmosis ro desalination plants the economic engineering optimization of water management was studied using calvin an optimization model to explore and economically integrate water supply options such as ww reuse desalination and other water supply options 22 31 finally in a study on gw monitoring applications a dss was developed to obtain appropriate decisions regarding crop selection sowing time irrigation fertilization and harvesting of crops in the hilly regions of india 32 several multiperiod optimization models have focused on expanding existing water supply assets 11 15 23 33 a study in kuwait 11 optimized the desalinated water supply to users by developing a multiperiod optimization model that considered the co generation of water using power the milp considered the capacity expansion options of both desalination and power plants to meet the demand for a planning horizon of 37 years another study 23 introduced a novel optimization approach to scenario based planning for the optimal design of regional scale water supply infrastructure to minimize the economic costs of projects some researchers have formulated the optimization problem of water supply as a supply chain optimization problem 15 34 for example one study 15 developed a desalination supply chain optimization life cycle framework and applied life cycle assessment to analyze the economic and environmental impacts of different desalination supply planning scenarios the study considered the trade offs between different environmental impact indicators for desalination plants of various sizes and pipeline infrastructure another study 34 solved a milp supply chain problem for desalinated water supply in the united arab emirates uae by determining optimal capacity and location of various desalination supply chain infrastructures over a long planning horizon recent studies have focused on comparative single objective and multi objective problem formulations and recommended multi objective approaches while making decisions on water resource management with greenhouse gas ghg emissions as an example 17 35 a few recent studies have deployed the milp to allocate water to various urban users and their model aimed to minimize the total water cost including the economic and environmental costs of treatment and distribution 36 37 in another recent study a multi objective model was developed to distribute water to multiple users from multiple sources which was created by assigning priorities and weights for all goals to be achieved in the optimization 38 the major goals considered in this study included meeting sector wise demands maximizing the use of treated sewage ts minimizing groundwater gw extraction minimizing desalinated water dw production and minimizing the overall cost of using water from different supply resources several studies on ww management using mip are available in the literature 39 40 in 2001 bakir 39 proposed an integrated approach for sustainable ww management whereas cunha et al 2009 40 developed an optimization model for integrated ww system planning to determine the best possible configuration of ww treatment plants the layout of sewer networks and the location of ww treatment plants considering economic environmental and technical criteria some of the developed optimization models 33 35 41 used water quality as a criterion for optimal capacity planning of ww systems the brief review provided earlier shows that most water supply optimization models developed to help water planners and decision makers have a specific scope and specific objectives and are applicable to a specific region or time period moreover many studies have not considered variables related to environmental impacts in the optimization model but considered only economic and political aspects 42 45 therefore there is room for improvement by developing a more general and sustainability focused water supply planning and optimization model moreover no comprehensive studies have focused on arid or semi arid areas in the middle east in particular no studies have considered the multi period multi regional management of water demands of multiple quality levels such a model is particularly important for sustainable water planning in arid and semi arid countries furthermore this research aims to meet various environmental targets while minimizing the overall cost of water it is clear from the above literature that mathematical models have been developed in order to select optimal water allocation or treatment strategies under given sets of criteria many of these are not easily adaptable and are not effective decision making tools for other geographic locations for comprehensive sustainable planning at the country or state level the complexity involved in foreseeing future water scenarios and finding a cost optimal planning solution are the two major challenges for decision makers this responsibility is daunting because decision makers must find an optimal balance between environmental sustainability financial budget and social aspects optimal planning by governments is essential for sustainable development as budgets become increasingly constrained and many stakeholders get involved 46 dynamic water budget models that can simulate future water scenarios are helpful for decision makers in indicating water balance in terms of deficit or surplus 47 this modelling involves an understanding of water demand s drivers and available water resources relevant to the study area the growing water demand is typically managed by the increased production of water from available sources the key question then is what is the best or optimal method for supplying water to satisfy multiple quality water demands in a sustainable manner this is one of the many questions that decision makers must answer when planning for an arid region s water sector in this context optimal planning of water production to meet water demand is challenging this is because there is complexity involved in choosing from the large number of options available a capacity planning model is necessary to find the optimal mix of water supply alternatives to meet current and future water demand this should be done while reducing carbon dioxide emissions groundwater gw extractions and brine disposal based on related environmental costs and the overall cost of water production and transmission to meet different quality levels water demand to the best of our knowledge no literature work so far has considered a comprehensive long term integrated management plan of water resources and capacity expansion planning of infrastructures the in arid countries like those in the middle east the specific goals of this study were as follows i to formulate a multi period milp model for arid and semi arid regions that can realize an optimal mix of water supply sources to meet current and future water demand co2 emission targets gw extraction limits and brine disposal limits as well as lower the overall cost of water supply ii to apply the model to a typical large arid region in the middle east the case study which is divided into multiple sub regions with multiple demand types and to find an optimal capacity planning solution for a selected planning period i e 2021 2050 iii to highlight values of environmental parameters on the solution of the case study iv to conduct an economic analysis of the optimization solution and v to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of variations in various economic and environmental costs on the optimal solution in order to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach the study seeks to provide an evidence based system to support water resources management in the arid environment of the emirate of abu dhabi uae this is required in the ead due to 1 the growing population 2 diminishing groundwater resources 3 adverse environmental impact of desalination processes and 4 a requirement to balance the competing pressures and stakeholder views whilst taking into a long term view the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the statement in which the entire problem is defined section 3 describes the development of the milp model for the defined problem section 4 applies the proposed model to a case study of the emirate of abu dhabi ead uae section 5 discusses the case study results finally section 6 presents the study conclusions 2 problem statement this section provides the description of the optimization problem of the multiperiod water supply problem over the planning period 2021 2050 to assist the integrated management of water resources and the capacity planning of water infrastructures the study considers a large geographical area in arid or semi arid climatic zones that can be divided into several regions based on population distribution and terrain a schematic representation of the problem is shown in fig 1 each region r has demand types d requiring water of different quality levels and it originates from population centers located within each region the demand types are classified as potable pot non potable np and irrigation ir collectively representing the annual water demands those demands are satisfied by various water supply sources s within or outside the region namely dw ts from wastewater and limited gw potable water systems refer to dw supply systems with the highest purity of water that can be used to meet all types of demands including those of residential industrial commercial and other domestic users requiring potable quality non potable water demands could be satisfied by tertiary treated ww ts these include irrigating non agricultural lands such as forests landscapes public places with lawns and other recreational sites however irrigation demand is a special case of non potable demand as ts water quality is considered not suitable for irrigation on aesthetic grounds therefore the irrigation demand is satisfied by two sources dw and gw there are several locations l representing the locations of water production in addition there are several technology sets k for production of dw and ts and n number of plants on k technology are possible at any plant location l in any region r the gw is considered to be used without any treatment the model considers that dw is produced by desalinating seawater using various technologies in desalination plants located within or outside the region therefore the dw produced can be imported to any region by long distance pipelines the dw system at the regional level comprises dw plants interregional pipelines external dw plants and pipelines connecting the subregions and external plants the distribution of dw from distribution centers to the end users is not included due to the complexity of determining the distribution networks and their relatively low contribution to the overall cost of dw infrastructure and operation treated sewage supply systems otherwise called as non potable systems comprise the collection and transport of ww from population centers to the respective treatment plants to produce ts and a distribution network of ts to the users however the study focused only on the production of ts from ww at treatment plants without considering the transportation of ww and distribution of ts this was omitted because the study assumes that a sewer system and ts distribution already exist in all major population centers and that expanding these systems costs less than the initial installation cost the goal of the model is to optimize the water allocation of these water sources based on their corresponding qualities to satisfy the demands all the demand types in each region are considered to vary annually the annual demand depends on population growth and governmental strategies and policies therefore the study period was divided into several periods each representing a year and a planning horizon of t years was divided into t yearly periods of demand seasonal variations within one year were not considered in this study this means that the average daily demand for and production of water were assumed to be the same throughout the year the model structure and assumptions can be summarized as follows the water demand in each year of the planning horizon of t is individually satisfied for all regions and demand types the processes of expansion of water infrastructure by constructing new assets or retrofitting and decommissioning of retiring infrastructures that complete their lifetime are included in the model to account for the available capacity for each year considering the related costs on environmental and sustainability grounds environmental targets are set for carbon emissions to the atmosphere brine discharge to the sea and gw extraction the detailed composition of the water sector at the beginning of the planning horizon predicted water demand over the planning horizon prices technological and economical parameters concerned with all water production technologies are model inputs these parameters are assigned with values for the case study discussed under section 4 the following are the main decision variables to be determined from the optimization problem optimal capacity planning of treatment plants for dw and ts selection of optimal technologies for capacity increase of dw and ts plants optimal retrofit of existing pipeline routes connecting regional distribution centers and dw plants year of retrofit expansion of capacities of plants in the planning horizon optimal production and use of dw and ts water at all production locations in every region and optimal extraction of gw to meet demands sustainably 3 mathematical formulation of the model objective function and key constraints of the model are presented in this section the physical meanings of the variables and parameters are presented in the nomenclature 3 1 objective function the objective function is to minimize the npv of the costs of meeting the water demand while satisfying a co2 reduction target minimizing brine disposal into the sea and gw usage target over a specified planning horizon the components associated with the objective function include the capital cost for new treatment plants and pipelines fixed and variable operating and maintenance costs cost of brine discharge into the sea from all desalination technologies and environmental costs expressed in monetary terms for carbon emissions from all operations and gw depletion the objective function is defined as eq 1 1 min t o t a l c o s t c a p c o s t t o t a l o m c o s t t o t a l e n v c o s t t o t a l the first term is the total annualized capital calculated using the capital recovery rate crr for the nominal discount rate i to be recovered over the entire planning horizon t in the capital cost the terms c a p c o s t p l a n t and c a p c o s t d w p i p e are included as follows 2 c a p c o s t p l a n t c r r 1 1 i t c l t r k l n t c a p n e w r k l n t p l a n t r k l n t c a p e x p a n d e d r k l n t p l a n t u n i t c a p c o s t k p l a n t the capital cost of pipelines includes the costs incurred in installing pipelines for the entire length between two points the plant location and distribution point in the adjacent region 3 c a p c o s t p i p e d w p i r r t y r e t r o p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w l r r p i p e d w c a p u n i t c o s t p i p i p e d w c r r s 1 1 i t c l t where crr is given by eq 4 4 c r r i 1 i t 1 i t 1 the model assumes that the annual om cost for production of any type of water is proportional to its production in that year therefore the total operating cost can be calculated as follows 5 o m c o s t p l a n t r l k n t p r l k n t p l a n t u n i t o m c o s t k p l a n t 1 1 i t 6 o m c o s t d w p i p e p i r t q e p i r r t d w p i p e o m u n i t c o s t d

fig 1 are presented the physical meanings of the parameters and variables used in formulating the milp model are included in the nomenclature key constraints are categorized into various modules 3 2 1 regional water demand supply constraints this section discusses all the equations to establish how regional water demand types are satisfied with the respective water supply sources in terms of quality and quantity all the demand and capacity terms in the following equations are annual values expressed in mm3 yr regional potable demands are met by either regional production of dw inter regional transmission or a combination of both this constraint is expressed by eq 10 10 d r t p o t l k n q p o t r l k n t d w p i r q i p i r r t d w p i p e p i r q e p i r r t d w p i p e r t d r t p o t is the potable demand in region r in year t the first term on the right hand side rhs denotes the summation of the supply of all dw plants in a region the second and third terms on rhs denote the dw imports and exports between region r and adjacent regions r respectively non potable demand can be supplied with gw and ts depending on availability and governments sustainability policies and priorities however dw is also an option for the non potable sector if surplus dw production capacity is available therefore the non potable demand supply equation can be written as eq 11 11 d r t n p l k n p r l k n t t s q n p r t g w q n p r t d w l k n q s e a r l k n t t s r t where l k n p r l k n t t s represents the overall ts produced in a region and q n p r t g w and q n p r t d w are the gw and dw supplied to the non potable sector respectively the last term on the rhs shows the quantity of unused ts discharged into the sea finally the annual irrigation demand in any region r in year t should be equal to the supply of gw for irrigation q i r r t g w and the supply of dw for irrigation q i r r t d w as shown by the eq 12 12 d r t i r q i r r t g w q i r r t d w r t in any region the withdrawal of gw is for non potable and irrigational use but is limited by the allowable abstraction rate based on the number of years that the gw reserve is likely to exist it is also assumed that the gw is applicable only for use within a region therefore the interregional components export and import are not included water sources namely seawater and ww should be treated at treatment plants to achieve the required quality gw is not subjected to any treatment facility and is used directly by pumping from the wells gw abstracted p r t g w in a region is supplied to agricultural lands for the irrigation and non potable sectors this mass balance is given by eq 13 13 p r t g w q i r r t g w q n p r t g w r t 3 2 2 capacity planning and operation constraints water treatment plants produce treated water ts and dw and the production in a treatment plant is limited by its installed capacity this is implemented by the constraint given in eq 14 14 p r l k n t p l a n t c a p r l k n t p l a n t r l k n t similarly the export and import of dw for a region occur through separate pipelines across the region which also connect treatment plant locations in adjacent regions the capacity of a pipeline depends on the pipe diameter velocity of water in the pipeline and daily hours of operation the pipeline capacity is a parameter of the model and can be calculated heuristically for all diameter sizes considered in the model assuming a velocity v dw pipe and daily hours of operation h r o p d w p i p e excluding the required maintenance time therefore the carrying capacity of a pipeline can be calculated based on the basic flowrate equation the volume of water exported or imported through a pipeline should always be less than its carrying capacity this is represented by eq 15 15 q e p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e p i t 16 q i p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e p i t where c a p p i r r t p i p e d w is the carrying capacity of the dw pipelines with pipe diameter pi connecting regions r and r plant capacity expansion planning is an important component of water supply planning and management the overall supply capacity of a region c a p r t p l a n t is defined as the sum of the capacities of the respective types dw and ts of plants within it as given by eq 17 this verifies the capacity constraints for all the regions at every t 17 c a p r t p l a n t r k l n c a p r k l n t p l a n t r t in the model it is considered that the capacity of dw and ts plants can be increased in two different ways 1 by expanding retrofitting the already existing treatment plants with the same technology and 2 by installing new plants based on any of the technologies already in use in the locality or any new technology that has been identified to be feasible for use in the region furthermore the capacity of an existing plant also depends on the age of the plant and at the end of its life span it has to be retired or decommissioned its capacity must then be deducted from the plant s total available capacity therefore this was also considered in the model therefore the capacity c a p r k l n t p l a n t of the nth production plant at any location in year t is given by eq 18 18 c a p r k l n t p l a n t c a p r k l n t 1 p l a n t c a p e x p a n d e d r k l n t p l a n t c a p n e w r k l n t p l a n t c a p d e c o m m r k l n t p l a n t n t c l t the first term on the rhs represents the plant s capacity in the previous year the second and third terms represent the increments in the site using existing technologies k and new installations based on new technologies k the final term represents the capacity decommissioned in the preceding year any expansion or new installation requires construction lead time clt therefore this equation also ensures that new capacity is added to the available capacity only after the completion of the plant construction or expansion in the model the option of retrofitting existing pipeline routes with pipelines from a set of discrete values of diameters for any time period t is included the same pipelines are not used for import and export but the pipelines for importation and exportation are different for each region this is included in the model for instance the capacity of any route for importing dw to a region r from another region r in year t is the capacity of all existing pipelines between the two regions plus the retrofitted pipelines in year t minus the decommissioned pipelines all diameters capacities in year t this is given by eq 19 19 c a p r r t d w p i p e p i c a p p i r r t 1 d w p i p e p i c a p p i p e r e t r o p i r r t d w p i p e p i c a p p i p e d e c o m m p i r r t d w p i p e r t c l t for a region the total interregional import is the sum of the capacities of all the interregional routes bringing water from all possible regions the capacity limit for import to a region is given by eq 20 20 c a p i m p o r t r t d w p i p e r p i c a p p i r r t d w p i p e r t therefore similar to the import equations the export equation with respect to a region is given by eq 21 21 c a p e x p o r t r t d w p i p e r p i c a p p i r r t d w p i p e r t the import or export volume through a pipe q i p i r r t p i p e d w or q e p i r r t p i p e d w for a region and the direction of flow are determined by the following equations eqs 22 24 the flow directions are determined by introducing binary variables y f l o w p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w and y f l o w p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w 22 q e p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e p i r r t d w p i p e 23 q i p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e p i r r t d w p i p e 24 y f l o w p i p e d i r p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e d i r p i r r t d w p i p e 1 the multiperiod water model should consider the bounds of capacity increase and lead time for installing or retrofitting new assets this is needed to set a limit to the possible expansion of a single stretch at a plant location subject to technology and space moreover as a plant s capacity is nonlinear with the cost function it is essential to linearize the capacity cost relation across certain capacity intervals this study considers expansion and installation with bounded values to use a constant unit cost value for incremented capacity thus lower and upper bounds for each technology are required eq 25 defines the lower and upper bound limits of each capacity expansion during the planning period similarly capacity limits are applicable for the

targets 3 2 3 1 cap on co2 emissions the annual co2 emissions from various water production processes and transport are estimated by using the eq 37 and their limited is set by the constraint developed in eq 38 this constraint specifies that the annual co2 emissions emitted by all existing and newly constructed water infrastructure must be less than or equal to the specified annual co 2 target co2 emissions are related to the power consumption per unit volume of water produced or transported by each process 37 q c o 2 t r l k n p r l k n t d w c o 2 e m i k d w r l k n p r l k n t t

production of highly saline water termed brine is a major environmental challenge associated with desalination technology brine has adverse environmental impacts and its disposal is expensive therefore to assess the volume of brine produced at each desalination plant the feed water type desalination technology plant capacity m3 day and water recovery ratios rr associated with various technologies were considered brine production from the plants was calculated as follows 39 q b r i n e r k l n t d w r k l n p r l k n t d w 1 r r k d w r r k d w t where q b r i n e r k l n t d w is the volume of brine produced m3 day and r r k d w is the recovery ratio for the respective technologies therefore to reduce the impact of brine disposal a constraint is set to limit its disposal from all production plants to an annual limit as follows 40 q b r i n e t d w a n n u a l l i m i t t d w b r i n e t 3 2 3 3 cap on gw abstraction gw is considered non renewable in regions with arid or semi arid climatic conditions therefore a constraint is required to limit the annual extraction of gw based on recharge rate government policies and strategies for sustainability this is given by 41 r p r t g w a n n u a l l i m i t t g w t 3 2 4 other logical constraints unlike dw plants where feed water is from an infinite source ts plants are designed to treat a predictable volume of ww generated within population centers eq 42 limits the production of ts in order to not exceed the ww generated in a population center furthermore the capacities of ts plants for a population center should always be greater than the ww generated in the location as there can be more than one ts plant at one plant location l the sum of all ts capacities should always be greater than the ww generated for all years as per eq 43 42 k n p r l k n t t s g e n r l t w w r l t 43 k n c a p r l k n t t s p l a n t g e n l t w w r l t 4 case study in this study the ead in the uae is divided into three sub regions of population settlements each with a total population of more than 1 million inhabitants the ead is divided into the western abu dhabi and al ain regions fig 2 all three regions have population centers where the demand and supply of water are based on population size economic development and other local climatic and geographical conditions the developed milp model is applied to tackle the issue of capacity expansion planning of existing water treatment facilities and inter regional pipeline transmission systems in the ead a plausible scenario for the ead s business as usual bau future as presented in ref 48 is selected and the optimal water supply solution is sought using the developed model for the planning period considered for the study i e 2021 2050 the implementation of the model in abu dhabi s water sector will elucidate the role of different supply options in typical arid and semi arid countries and their impact on the overall cost and environment although this case study aimed to optimize abu dhabi s future water supply it can also be readily applied to other arid or semi arid countries in the model the seven water demand sectors identified in the ead were incorporated residential municipal commercial industrial amenities agricultural and forestry all these demand sectors are classified as either potable non potable or irrigational based on the water resources supplying them potable demand sectors are those that depend purely on dw the only source of potable water in the ead for their water needs the demand for potable water in each region is satisfied exclusively by dw produced at seawater dw plants located at strategic locations within the ead territory and outside the ead where dw is imported through transmission lines non potable demand sectors can depend on any non potable source gw ts or dw in ead all population centers in each region are connected to a sewerage system and the ww is treated to reusable quality ts at the respective ww treatment plants dw is supplied to non potable sectors only if a surplus is available shallow aquifers store gw from which water is abstracted by digging boreholes the ead has gw wells near al ain city in the al ain region and in liwa in the western region table 1 summarizes the existing water demand supply settings in each region 4 1 model inputs for the case study model parameters for the case study include the data describing the water supply system of the ead for which the model scenario is constructed key data used and heuristic assumptions to conduct the case study are presented in this part the demand for the whole planning horizon was estimated using the dynamic water budget model for abu dhabi 47 the projected demands are shown in appendix a all existing infrastructure in abu dhabi for water production and pipeline transmission was considered three prominent technologies for dw production in the middle east are multiple effect distillation med multistage flash distillation msf and ro in ead major ts plants work on a conventional biological process namely the activated sludge process asp other possible options include sequential biological reactors moving bed bioreactors mbbrs and membrane bioreactors mbrs data for all existing dw and ts plants were compiled from the statistics published by refs 49 51 and are presented in appendix b in the ead only dw was imported from outside the boundary a long distance water transmission system is in place to transport dw from the western region of uae to abu dhabi region al ain region a land locked region in the ead imports dw from the adjacent region abu dhabi region as well as from dw plants located outside abu dhabi s boundary fujairah however the exact distance along the pipeline route is unknown therefore the shortest distance between the supply origin dw plants and the key distribution point in the water supplied region is considered an approximation of the pairwise distance to calculate the pumping distance moreover it was assumed that no significant difference existed in the elevations of the connecting points this study considers that water in the pipelines flows only in one direction although in reality the option of reverse flow exists for an emergency in most recently installed pipelines ductile iron di pipes have been used to connect regions with diameters ranging from 800 mm to 1600 mm therefore in this optimization the model was given the option of selecting pipe sizes from the diameter sizes of 1000 1200 1400 and 1600 mm during the optimization process the maximum capacity of each pipe diameter was calculated based on the assumption of a velocity of 2 m s and an operation time of 20 h daily which is consistent with the requirements of the addc 50 a list of existing pipeline networks within the regions and those connecting external dw plants to al ain is shown in appendix c 4 2 capital costs of water treatment processes in this study most of the cost data were obtained from the available literature or estimated from publicly available sources while a few were estimated based on heuristics the unit cost was measured in us dollars and converted to the corresponding value of 2020 unit capital cost is the cost of a new construction or expansion of infrastructure per unit m3 capacity the cost data of dw plants were obtained from several sources 52 53 deep desalination economic evaluation program deep 54 and wtcost software 55 were also used to verify the cost parameters of the dw plants the capital costs of the plants vary based on their capacity however the nonlinear capacity relation was linearized to determine the unit costs for plants of different sizes considered in the case study the unit capital cost of ww treatment plants depends on the plant capacity treatment process and design criteria several studies have developed cost functions for various treatment processes data from various sources were combined to estimate the average unit costs of the various treatment processes and sizes of plants considered in this case study 36 56 57 the capital costs of the various technologies of the dw and ts plants considered in the case study are presented in appendix d because cost of water transportation from one location to another is dependent on many factors such as pumping distance pumping head and soil type it is difficult to compare the cost of pipeline construction from one location to another considering this previous studies have focused on developing cost relations for long distance water pipelines based on data from different long distance pipeline projects capital costs are correlated to the transportation distance and capacity the unit capital costs of installing pipelines with di pipes and their associated fittings and equipment were estimated from cost functions 58 62 appendix e presents the estimated costs for various diameter sizes considered in the current case study 4 3 om costs of water treatment processes the operation and maintenance om cost is a function of plant capacity and the plant operating levels several correlation plots have been reported in previous studies 63 71 in addition the simulation of various process conditions in deep software was used to estimate and compile the unit om costs of the various desalination technologies considered in this study the major ww processes used in the region for municipal ww treatment are the conventional asp and mbrs the cost curve for the conventional system of ww treatment using asp is available from refs 36 56 57 the om cost data function was linearized to estimate the average om cost for the ts plants for the installation sizes considered in this case study the unit om cost of various dw and ts plant types are presented in appendix f the unit cost of transporting 1 m3 of water per kilometer was determined from various correlations 36 72 it was found to be approximately 5 per 100 km of transportation 4 4 environmental impact costs of water treatment processes environmental costs are included to quantify environmental impacts arising from the use of various water supply sources and the costs incurred in environmental compliance monitoring the environmental cost is a monetized measure of environmental damage caused by production technologies through ghg emissions waste disposal and depletion of natural resources in this case study environmental costs were estimated in terms of m3 of water produced the carbon costs for ghg emission at the treatment plants of ds and ts and during the transportation of water were used to measure global warming potential as co2 emissions are directly dependent on the fuel used the co2 emissions from dw plants in abu dhabi are considered in terms of the carbon footprint for each type of technology and process the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the amount of ghgs emitted into the atmosphere and is expressed in kilograms of co2 equivalents kg co2 e several authors have used the monetary cost for this emission 73 75 in this study 0 025 kg e co2 was used as the base value considering that gw in abu dhabi is a non renewable source of water with less than 4 of the gw used recharged an environmental cost in terms of m3 for gw used is assigned which is consistent with the economic value for gw reserves in abu dhabi 76 the economic evaluation considers various aspects such as sustainability and cost benefit analysis by applying the hydro economic model this has been identified as a meaningful metric for policy frameworks if policymakers are interested in setting a price for the gw to reflect the scarcity value and encourage the efficient use of available water resources an estimated value of 1 15 m3 was used in this study furthermore an abstraction limit of 1333 mcm yr was assumed to be ensure the sustainability of existing gw resource for 150 years another environmental aspect included in the model is brine disposal from dw plants and its handling there are numerous impacts of brine discharge from dw plants to the sea such as an increase in salinity levels and metals contribution to global warming increase in the temperature of the receiving water body and impact on aquatic life however no equivalent monetary costs are available for quantifying the impact of brine disposal therefore in this study we used the per unit cost incurred in operating brine disposal facilities the unit cost in m3 of brine discharge was obtained from ref 34 and its implementation in the model allowed the optimization of the overall brine disposal the brine disposal rates considered in this study were 0 0015 m3 0 0015 m3 and 0 04 m3 of brine discharged from the med msf and ro plants respectively 4 5 capacity expansion criteria for infrastructures capacity expansion at a production site is subject to space availability technological limitations and other factors for assets without available data on expansion limits a heuristic assumption was made to set the bounds the lower limit for increased capacity at a production site was set to 20 of the initial capacity whereas the upper limit was set at 50 during expansion another limit set was the length in years of the time gap between two successive expansions or installations at a site it was set at eight years as a heuristic assumption in addition the maximum number of times an asset can undergo expansion was limited by assigning a value of 3 for the entire planning horizon a clt of two years was applied for all construction works 5 results and discussion based on the mathematical formulation presented in section 3 and the data input for the base scenario presented in section 4 the optimal development pathway of abu dhabi s water sector under the base scenario setting was obtained the multi period multi regional optimization problem of water supply planning in abu dhabi was programmed into the general algebraic modelling system 23 1 gams 23 1 and solved using the solver cplex 12 1 the solution strategy allows for the identification of an optimal solution that simultaneously considers the two environmental target constraints eqs 38 40 and 41 and economic objective function eq 1 the formulated scenario has 7655 equations 5277 continuous variables and 1350 binary variables the optimal solution was obtained after a cpu time of approximately 650 s while running on a core i7 computer based on the model run the optimal solutions required for water sector planning in abu dhabi included the composition of the water supply source the technology mix for producing different types of water the capacity of each type of plant for each year decisions on the installation of assets for both plants and pipeline networks yearly emissions of co2 yearly brine discharge and yearly gw abstractions the model results showed that switching desalination technology from thermal processes to ro would be more cost effective and environment friendly for the ead the best option for treating ww in ead is the conventional asp process moreover gw will continue to be the major water source for irrigation in abu dhabi assigning a high environmental cost to the economic value of gw will affect the dw capacity as more dw would be utilized for irrigation under such conditions the model indicated that om costs and capital costs of treatment plants of various technologies would have a relatively low impact on the total cost for the technology mix for water supply the environmental costs namely the carbon cost and gw economic value had a high impact on the overall cost and selection of desalination technologies the optimization results are analyzed and discussed in detail in the following subsections 5 1 optimal cost for the planning period the optimized solution of the base case for the objective function provides the minimized total cost for the entire planning period the total cost of using water from different sources was estimated to be 123 12 billion as the npv a breakdown of the total cost of this scenario is shown in fig 3 the environmental costs were the major costs accounting for approximately 47 of the total cost a high environmental cost is incurred because of the carbon footprint and depletion value for gw it can be observed that the majority of the environmental cost is for gw utilization because of assigning an economic value to the stock this environmental indicator is very significant especially in places such as abu dhabi as the gw reserve is non renewable in addition the high environmental impact cost is mainly attributed to the co2 emissions from desalination plants included in the optimal solution it can be noted that med and msf plants have higher carbon emission rates than any other desalination technology implemented in ead as can be observed in the optimal future expansion pathway in the ead ro and msf technologies dominate over the planning time horizon of these ro has low carbon emissions compared to msf however msf is still a preferred technology because of the low capital and om costs along with other site specific constraints to be implemented therefore the environmental costs of msf are high because of its high contribution to the overall production capacity 5 2 the optimal development pathway of abu dhabi s water sector under bau scenario the model reveals the optimal capacities of water treatment plants dw and ts dw transportation pipelines and gw utilization required to meet the water demand rise until 2050 in addition the model selects a combination of desalination and ww treatment technologies along with non treated gw that satisfy the constraints while minimizing the total cost fig 4 shows the expansion pathway of all dw plants supplying water to various regions in the ead as developed by the model all dw plant sites will undergo an optimal capacity increase by satisfying all the constraints in the model for the selected scenario choosing from available technology options the capacity of a plant is considered to be a non decreasing function however at some locations a decline in capacity can be noted in the planning horizon because of the decommissioning of retiring plants for the location in shuweihat as shown in fig 4 a and fig 2 msf plants will have to undergo capacity expansion in 2023 2030 and 2037 the plant units at this site are expected to undergo decommissioning in 2025 which will cause a decrease in production at this site but would not affect the overall supply as the decommissioned capacity can be supplied from other nearby plant locations until the year 2030 similarly at mirfa fig 2 where both ro and msf technologies are in place the capacity expansion plan developed by the model has opted for more ro than msf it can be seen that the capacity of msf at mirfa has to decrease to 61 290 m3 day from 102 150 m3 day while the ro will increase to 681 000 m3 day in 2050 from 136 200 m3 day in 2020 fig 4 b at umm al nar fig 2 where there was a choice of using msf and med technologies for building new plants capacity expansion the model opted for msf technology it can be seen that the med capacity would be almost halved while the msf capacity would increase by approximately five times by 2050 fig 4 c at the taweelah dw plant location fig 2 where the available expansion options are for med and msf plants a trend in which msf is chosen over med is evident fig 4 d at the fujairah site fig 2 the options for technology selection for capacity expansion were ro msf and med the model opted for ro over both the med and msf this means that the ro capacity will increase significantly but med and msf capacities will be reduced after the planned decommissioning of the existing units fig 4 e the overall capacities for the entire abu dhabi potable water dw demand in 2020 and 2050 in relation to the technologies as determined by the model are presented in table 2 in terms of the technologies the contribution of capacity in 2050 will be as follows msf 9 5 million cubic meters per day mcmd ro 2 2 mcmd med 0 43 mcmd another key observation is that the contribution of ro is expected to increase from 5 1 in 2021 to 18 1 in 2050 it can be seen that the model opted for capacity expansion using ro the relatively low selection of msf and med is due to their high capital costs and carbon footprints naturally the model selects ro as the first option because it is the least expensive in addition med and msf consume less energy but have a higher carbon footprint and lower recovery rate in contrast ro is energy expensive but has a higher recovery rate therefore the model selects more ro desalination plants to satisfy all model constraints while minimizing the total cost although all sites need plant capacity expansion over the planning horizon the optimal solution suggests that the installation of new pipelines between regions in the ead is essential to support potable water demand in different regions individually table 3 lists the capacity expansion trajectory for all dw pipelines over the planning horizon the existing pipelines are expanded to different sizes by selecting from available diameter sizes for some pipelines multiple expansion values exist the optimal solution suggests that new installations are required between the regions shuweihat abu dhabi umm al nar al ain taweelah al ain and fujairah al ain at different times of the planning period other results from the model were related to the ww treatment plants the required year wise capacities of the ww treatment plants at all plant locations as simulated by the model are shown in fig 5 for ww treatment the expansion of ts plants based on asp is the optimal option at all sites probably due to the large capital costs associated with mbr and mbbr plants appendix d although the unit om costs are comparable to those of conventional asp appendix f in addition asp had a lower carbon footprint than the other two technologies included in the model naturally the model selected asp because it is the least expensive of the available processes and has low carbon emissions the optimal contribution of gw in meeting water demand is shown in fig 6 the gw in ead was used without further treatment therefore the capacity of gw production is not limited by the treatment facilities however gw abstraction was set to the maximum yearly limit in the model simulation this limit is set to sustain the life of the available gw reserves in the ead the model identified gw as the best option for irrigation and non potable demand the use of gw selected by the model is constant for most years except for few years when there is maximum use because some dw plants will be decommissioned and the surplus dw being supplied to irrigation will be interrupted the model compensates for this in the optimal solution by increasing gw usage for such years gw extraction was the best choice for irrigation demand even after adding the environmental cost owing to the large investment and environmental costs associated with all types of dw technology 5 3 optimal environmental impact parameters environmental objectives were included in the model to reflect environmental regulations and achieve sustainability the emission reduction targets considered in the scenario refer to the direct carbon emissions from all water supply processes and operations as well as brine discharges from desalination plants therefore the model resolved the issue of capacity expansion by considering these constraints along with cost minimization the model achieved an optimal carbon emission solution by selecting optimal capacities for technologies and the operation of the water system in abu dhabi that would minimize carbon emissions the trajectory of carbon emissions from various operations during the planning period is shown in fig 7 the optimal solution showed that the minimum overall carbon emissions would reach 250 million kg co2 e in 2050 if no carbon capture technologies were implemented the discharge of highly saline brine from desalination plants is an environmental concern in ead brine from the dw plants supplying water to the ead is discharged into two different water bodies the dw plants in the western and abu dhabi regions discharge brine to the arabian gulf whereas dw plants located in fujairah outside the ead discharge brine into the gulf of oman therefore the optimal solution should reduce brine discharge into both water bodies the brine discharge from the different technologies is shown in fig 8 the results show that most brine comes from msf because of a lower recovery rate and a high percentage of capacity contribution to dw production in the uae therefore an improved recovery rate is required for all plants to reduce brine discharge and minimize the impact on the marine environment 5 4 sensitivity analysis for key parameters of the model a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effects of varying the values of the various parameters such as unit gw cost m3 carbon emission cost kg co2 e and capital and om costs of all operations on the obtained optimal solution the data for the case study scenario referred to as the base case along with the model outputs for various sensitivity analysis cases are included in table 4 the model assigned an environmental cost of 1 15 m3 to the gw for the base case run however for the sensitivity analysis the range of the environmental costs considered was 0 1 25 m3 the results showed that while no cost was assigned for gw the total cost was reduced to 60 74 11 billion compared with the baseline cost of 126 76 billion table 4 implying that allocating the environmental cost affects the total cost in addition other observations varying the gw environmental cost occur in the selection of technologies for dw plants for costs of 0 5 m3 or less med technology was excluded from the solution and replaced with msf thus a cost of more than 0 5 m3 affects the process of selection of optimal dw technology the impact of allocating carbon taxes or costs based on carbon emissions during various water production and supply stages was studied allocating a monetary cost to ghgs is a recognized yet controversial practice in the base run a marginal cost of 0 025 kg co2 e was assigned however to understand how this affected the optimal solution a range of costs from 0 025 kg co2 e to 0 25 kg co2 e was selected which is consistent with the value ranges used by refs 34 77 the overall cost varies between 99 19 billion and 378 5 billion for this range this shows the significance of assigning the carbon cost as the total cost more than tripled in the range studied table 4 thus the sensitivity study indicated that the various environmental costs and values play a significant role in the optimal solution the sensitivity analysis values showed that assigning a lower economic value for gw less than 0 3 m3 has no significant impact on the overall cost of water planning and infrastructure expansion however when the gw was given a value of more than 0 3 m3 the results showed that dw was also selected to satisfy irrigation demand this is because the overall cost of the dw becomes comparable to the gw cost when assigned a value greater than 0 1 kg co2 e the carbon cost showed a high impact on the overall cost and the selection of desalination technologies this indicates that when the carbon cost assigned is increased technologies with high carbon emissions are the least preferred therefore it is essential to choose an appropriate environmental cost value for both the gw economic value and carbon footprint for all water technologies the impact of the change in the capital cost of various process technologies was studied by changing the base run value of capital costs table 4 a range of 10 to 10 variation was studied the results showed that the total cost did not vary significantly over the studied range and only a change of approximately 3 was noted thus a change in capital cost does not affect the optimal solution in addition it does not affect the selection of technologies as capital cost variation was implemented for all technologies therefore the unit capital cost for treatment plants of various technologies has less impact on the technology mix for the water supply similar to capital costs variations in om costs in the range of 10 to 10 change from the base run value of om costs were studied table 4 the results showed a low impact on the total cost for instance an increase of less than 2 for a 10 increase in the unit om cost moreover this change had insignificant impact on the selection of water treatment technologies thus the sensitivity study indicated that various environmental costs play a significant role in the optimal solution therefore it is essential to choose an appropriate environmental cost for both the gw economic value and carbon footprint for all water technologies the model can accommodate additional environmental costs to assist in decision making and environmental valuation 6 conclusions in this paper a multiperiod milp model was built to optimize the planning of water systems in semi arid or arid regions with various water supply considerations the superstructure of the model provided the basis for a decision support system in which all types of water demand and use were included co2 emissions and brine disposal were minimized the optimal capacity for water treatment plants and water transmission systems were estimated and the optimal allocation of natural water resources was determined the model was applied to the case study of the emirate of abu dhabi uae as part of the integrated management of water resources and the capacity planning of water infrastructures a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the impact of various parameters on the optimal model solution results show that the optimal scenario obtained by the model provides significant benefit to the water resource managers by identifying the optimal combination of sources to meet present and future water needs of in the emirate the proposed model is among the first to be developed for an arid or semi arid environment of the middle east for long term integrated water management and planning this model can be very useful for achieving sustainability by decision makers as it incorporated both cost and environmental aspects into the decision making process declaration of

8761,water sector planning and policy making in arid and semi arid regions are challenging because many drivers and decision criteria require consideration in this study a multi period mixed integer linear programming model was developed to integrate and economically evaluate water management options for water supply in arid regions the applicability of the proposed approach was demonstrated through a case study in the emirate of abu dhabi ead united arab emirates the model was programmed in general algebraic modeling system gams and solved using the cplex solver the model determined the optimal economic and environmental costs capacity expansion of treatment plants and water transmission systems and other environmental aspects including the carbon footprint and brine discharge results show that the capacity contribution of reverse osmosis for desalination is expected to increase from 5 1 in 2021 to 18 1 in 2050 based on the model s results for the case study it was concluded that even with moderate consideration of environmental aspects desalination plants in the ead need a major technology transformation from thermal desalination to reverse osmosis the proposed model is proved to be effective for integrated water resources management and infrastructure planning in the ead and has the potential for effective application in other arid or semi arid countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords mixed integer linear programming gams capacity expansion water optimization model sustainability water resource management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction several countries face water supply challenges to meet ever growing demands due to economic and population growth 1 4 the situation is exacerbated in arid and semi arid countries which also face a decline in the availability of renewable water resources 4 7 therefore the key challenge for water policymakers in arid and semi arid countries is to assess all the various components of water system while objectively balancing the water supply requirements to available resources within the constraints of sustainability cost and stakeholder satisfaction in most countries increasing water demand is managed by augmenting the water supply by increasing the capacity of existing water treatment and supply facilities or the construction of new facilities 1 6 therefore forecasting future changes in demand is critical for planning an optimum capacity expansion or building new facilities 8 10 however the optimal planning of water resources to meet demand is challenging because of the complexity involved in choosing from numerous available alternatives mathematical programming and optimization techniques have been used to solve complex water problems such as water supply planning water resource allocation industrial water management irrigation management and capacity planning 11 17 water planners develop models using approaches such as mixed integer programming mip 18 quadratic programming 16 dynamic programming dp 19 mixed integer nonlinear programming 20 and mixed integer linear programming 21 several recent studies have implemented mixed integer linear programming milp to optimize the water supply by considering various technical economic and environmental parameters 22 24 however few studies have considered the decision variables relevant to the operational and capacity constraints of various conventional and nonconventional sources available for water supply 25 26 instead studies have focused on assisting decision makers with planning and developing policies for optimal water resource allocation at the regional level with specific objectives 21 27 30 it is enormously challenging task to figure out how to provide effective water management decision support given the multitude of practical economic and environmental constraints that need to be considered in water scarce countries in such studies the focus has been on identifying various alternatives to the water supply for the study area to meet the steady increase in demand the alternatives were then optimized by considering long term sustainability cost and energy requirements in one study 21 researchers used the milp to address the problem of integrated water resources management in two greek islands in this study potable and non potable systems of water supply were integrated into the model to determine minimized annualized total capital and operating costs by taking decision variables such as the location of desalination wastewater ww treatment as well as pipelines and storage tanks for desalinated water ww and reclaimed water into consideration in another study 29 to optimize a system comprising water supply and distribution to an island with water shortages the researchers considered both technical and environmental parameters related to supply sources required infrastructure projects water production cost and values for water resource exploitation one study in egypt 30 followed a technical model approach to manage the growing water demand in the tourism sector and used dp to optimize the capacity expansion schedule of reverse osmosis ro desalination plants the economic engineering optimization of water management was studied using calvin an optimization model to explore and economically integrate water supply options such as ww reuse desalination and other water supply options 22 31 finally in a study on gw monitoring applications a dss was developed to obtain appropriate decisions regarding crop selection sowing time irrigation fertilization and harvesting of crops in the hilly regions of india 32 several multiperiod optimization models have focused on expanding existing water supply assets 11 15 23 33 a study in kuwait 11 optimized the desalinated water supply to users by developing a multiperiod optimization model that considered the co generation of water using power the milp considered the capacity expansion options of both desalination and power plants to meet the demand for a planning horizon of 37 years another study 23 introduced a novel optimization approach to scenario based planning for the optimal design of regional scale water supply infrastructure to minimize the economic costs of projects some researchers have formulated the optimization problem of water supply as a supply chain optimization problem 15 34 for example one study 15 developed a desalination supply chain optimization life cycle framework and applied life cycle assessment to analyze the economic and environmental impacts of different desalination supply planning scenarios the study considered the trade offs between different environmental impact indicators for desalination plants of various sizes and pipeline infrastructure another study 34 solved a milp supply chain problem for desalinated water supply in the united arab emirates uae by determining optimal capacity and location of various desalination supply chain infrastructures over a long planning horizon recent studies have focused on comparative single objective and multi objective problem formulations and recommended multi objective approaches while making decisions on water resource management with greenhouse gas ghg emissions as an example 17 35 a few recent studies have deployed the milp to allocate water to various urban users and their model aimed to minimize the total water cost including the economic and environmental costs of treatment and distribution 36 37 in another recent study a multi objective model was developed to distribute water to multiple users from multiple sources which was created by assigning priorities and weights for all goals to be achieved in the optimization 38 the major goals considered in this study included meeting sector wise demands maximizing the use of treated sewage ts minimizing groundwater gw extraction minimizing desalinated water dw production and minimizing the overall cost of using water from different supply resources several studies on ww management using mip are available in the literature 39 40 in 2001 bakir 39 proposed an integrated approach for sustainable ww management whereas cunha et al 2009 40 developed an optimization model for integrated ww system planning to determine the best possible configuration of ww treatment plants the layout of sewer networks and the location of ww treatment plants considering economic environmental and technical criteria some of the developed optimization models 33 35 41 used water quality as a criterion for optimal capacity planning of ww systems the brief review provided earlier shows that most water supply optimization models developed to help water planners and decision makers have a specific scope and specific objectives and are applicable to a specific region or time period moreover many studies have not considered variables related to environmental impacts in the optimization model but considered only economic and political aspects 42 45 therefore there is room for improvement by developing a more general and sustainability focused water supply planning and optimization model moreover no comprehensive studies have focused on arid or semi arid areas in the middle east in particular no studies have considered the multi period multi regional management of water demands of multiple quality levels such a model is particularly important for sustainable water planning in arid and semi arid countries furthermore this research aims to meet various environmental targets while minimizing the overall cost of water it is clear from the above literature that mathematical models have been developed in order to select optimal water allocation or treatment strategies under given sets of criteria many of these are not easily adaptable and are not effective decision making tools for other geographic locations for comprehensive sustainable planning at the country or state level the complexity involved in foreseeing future water scenarios and finding a cost optimal planning solution are the two major challenges for decision makers this responsibility is daunting because decision makers must find an optimal balance between environmental sustainability financial budget and social aspects optimal planning by governments is essential for sustainable development as budgets become increasingly constrained and many stakeholders get involved 46 dynamic water budget models that can simulate future water scenarios are helpful for decision makers in indicating water balance in terms of deficit or surplus 47 this modelling involves an understanding of water demand s drivers and available water resources relevant to the study area the growing water demand is typically managed by the increased production of water from available sources the key question then is what is the best or optimal method for supplying water to satisfy multiple quality water demands in a sustainable manner this is one of the many questions that decision makers must answer when planning for an arid region s water sector in this context optimal planning of water production to meet water demand is challenging this is because there is complexity involved in choosing from the large number of options available a capacity planning model is necessary to find the optimal mix of water supply alternatives to meet current and future water demand this should be done while reducing carbon dioxide emissions groundwater gw extractions and brine disposal based on related environmental costs and the overall cost of water production and transmission to meet different quality levels water demand to the best of our knowledge no literature work so far has considered a comprehensive long term integrated management plan of water resources and capacity expansion planning of infrastructures the in arid countries like those in the middle east the specific goals of this study were as follows i to formulate a multi period milp model for arid and semi arid regions that can realize an optimal mix of water supply sources to meet current and future water demand co2 emission targets gw extraction limits and brine disposal limits as well as lower the overall cost of water supply ii to apply the model to a typical large arid region in the middle east the case study which is divided into multiple sub regions with multiple demand types and to find an optimal capacity planning solution for a selected planning period i e 2021 2050 iii to highlight values of environmental parameters on the solution of the case study iv to conduct an economic analysis of the optimization solution and v to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of variations in various economic and environmental costs on the optimal solution in order to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach the study seeks to provide an evidence based system to support water resources management in the arid environment of the emirate of abu dhabi uae this is required in the ead due to 1 the growing population 2 diminishing groundwater resources 3 adverse environmental impact of desalination processes and 4 a requirement to balance the competing pressures and stakeholder views whilst taking into a long term view the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the statement in which the entire problem is defined section 3 describes the development of the milp model for the defined problem section 4 applies the proposed model to a case study of the emirate of abu dhabi ead uae section 5 discusses the case study results finally section 6 presents the study conclusions 2 problem statement this section provides the description of the optimization problem of the multiperiod water supply problem over the planning period 2021 2050 to assist the integrated management of water resources and the capacity planning of water infrastructures the study considers a large geographical area in arid or semi arid climatic zones that can be divided into several regions based on population distribution and terrain a schematic representation of the problem is shown in fig 1 each region r has demand types d requiring water of different quality levels and it originates from population centers located within each region the demand types are classified as potable pot non potable np and irrigation ir collectively representing the annual water demands those demands are satisfied by various water supply sources s within or outside the region namely dw ts from wastewater and limited gw potable water systems refer to dw supply systems with the highest purity of water that can be used to meet all types of demands including those of residential industrial commercial and other domestic users requiring potable quality non potable water demands could be satisfied by tertiary treated ww ts these include irrigating non agricultural lands such as forests landscapes public places with lawns and other recreational sites however irrigation demand is a special case of non potable demand as ts water quality is considered not suitable for irrigation on aesthetic grounds therefore the irrigation demand is satisfied by two sources dw and gw there are several locations l representing the locations of water production in addition there are several technology sets k for production of dw and ts and n number of plants on k technology are possible at any plant location l in any region r the gw is considered to be used without any treatment the model considers that dw is produced by desalinating seawater using various technologies in desalination plants located within or outside the region therefore the dw produced can be imported to any region by long distance pipelines the dw system at the regional level comprises dw plants interregional pipelines external dw plants and pipelines connecting the subregions and external plants the distribution of dw from distribution centers to the end users is not included due to the complexity of determining the distribution networks and their relatively low contribution to the overall cost of dw infrastructure and operation treated sewage supply systems otherwise called as non potable systems comprise the collection and transport of ww from population centers to the respective treatment plants to produce ts and a distribution network of ts to the users however the study focused only on the production of ts from ww at treatment plants without considering the transportation of ww and distribution of ts this was omitted because the study assumes that a sewer system and ts distribution already exist in all major population centers and that expanding these systems costs less than the initial installation cost the goal of the model is to optimize the water allocation of these water sources based on their corresponding qualities to satisfy the demands all the demand types in each region are considered to vary annually the annual demand depends on population growth and governmental strategies and policies therefore the study period was divided into several periods each representing a year and a planning horizon of t years was divided into t yearly periods of demand seasonal variations within one year were not considered in this study this means that the average daily demand for and production of water were assumed to be the same throughout the year the model structure and assumptions can be summarized as follows the water demand in each year of the planning horizon of t is individually satisfied for all regions and demand types the processes of expansion of water infrastructure by constructing new assets or retrofitting and decommissioning of retiring infrastructures that complete their lifetime are included in the model to account for the available capacity for each year considering the related costs on environmental and sustainability grounds environmental targets are set for carbon emissions to the atmosphere brine discharge to the sea and gw extraction the detailed composition of the water sector at the beginning of the planning horizon predicted water demand over the planning horizon prices technological and economical parameters concerned with all water production technologies are model inputs these parameters are assigned with values for the case study discussed under section 4 the following are the main decision variables to be determined from the optimization problem optimal capacity planning of treatment plants for dw and ts selection of optimal technologies for capacity increase of dw and ts plants optimal retrofit of existing pipeline routes connecting regional distribution centers and dw plants year of retrofit expansion of capacities of plants in the planning horizon optimal production and use of dw and ts water at all production locations in every region and optimal extraction of gw to meet demands sustainably 3 mathematical formulation of the model objective function and key constraints of the model are presented in this section the physical meanings of the variables and parameters are presented in the nomenclature 3 1 objective function the objective function is to minimize the npv of the costs of meeting the water demand while satisfying a co2 reduction target minimizing brine disposal into the sea and gw usage target over a specified planning horizon the components associated with the objective function include the capital cost for new treatment plants and pipelines fixed and variable operating and maintenance costs cost of brine discharge into the sea from all desalination technologies and environmental costs expressed in monetary terms for carbon emissions from all operations and gw depletion the objective function is defined as eq 1 1 min t o t a l c o s t c a p c o s t t o t a l o m c o s t t o t a l e n v c o s t t o t a l the first term is the total annualized capital calculated using the capital recovery rate crr for the nominal discount rate i to be recovered over the entire planning horizon t in the capital cost the terms c a p c o s t p l a n t and c a p c o s t d w p i p e are included as follows 2 c a p c o s t p l a n t c r r 1 1 i t c l t r k l n t c a p n e w r k l n t p l a n t r k l n t c a p e x p a n d e d r k l n t p l a n t u n i t c a p c o s t k p l a n t the capital cost of pipelines includes the costs incurred in installing pipelines for the entire length between two points the plant location and distribution point in the adjacent region 3 c a p c o s t p i p e d w p i r r t y r e t r o p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w l r r p i p e d w c a p u n i t c o s t p i p i p e d w c r r s 1 1 i t c l t where crr is given by eq 4 4 c r r i 1 i t 1 i t 1 the model assumes that the annual om cost for production of any type of water is proportional to its production in that year therefore the total operating cost can be calculated as follows 5 o m c o s t p l a n t r l k n t p r l k n t p l a n t u n i t o m c o s t k p l a n t 1 1 i t 6 o m c o s t d w p i p e p i r t q e p i r r t d w p i p e o m u n i t c o s t d

fig 1 are presented the physical meanings of the parameters and variables used in formulating the milp model are included in the nomenclature key constraints are categorized into various modules 3 2 1 regional water demand supply constraints this section discusses all the equations to establish how regional water demand types are satisfied with the respective water supply sources in terms of quality and quantity all the demand and capacity terms in the following equations are annual values expressed in mm3 yr regional potable demands are met by either regional production of dw inter regional transmission or a combination of both this constraint is expressed by eq 10 10 d r t p o t l k n q p o t r l k n t d w p i r q i p i r r t d w p i p e p i r q e p i r r t d w p i p e r t d r t p o t is the potable demand in region r in year t the first term on the right hand side rhs denotes the summation of the supply of all dw plants in a region the second and third terms on rhs denote the dw imports and exports between region r and adjacent regions r respectively non potable demand can be supplied with gw and ts depending on availability and governments sustainability policies and priorities however dw is also an option for the non potable sector if surplus dw production capacity is available therefore the non potable demand supply equation can be written as eq 11 11 d r t n p l k n p r l k n t t s q n p r t g w q n p r t d w l k n q s e a r l k n t t s r t where l k n p r l k n t t s represents the overall ts produced in a region and q n p r t g w and q n p r t d w are the gw and dw supplied to the non potable sector respectively the last term on the rhs shows the quantity of unused ts discharged into the sea finally the annual irrigation demand in any region r in year t should be equal to the supply of gw for irrigation q i r r t g w and the supply of dw for irrigation q i r r t d w as shown by the eq 12 12 d r t i r q i r r t g w q i r r t d w r t in any region the withdrawal of gw is for non potable and irrigational use but is limited by the allowable abstraction rate based on the number of years that the gw reserve is likely to exist it is also assumed that the gw is applicable only for use within a region therefore the interregional components export and import are not included water sources namely seawater and ww should be treated at treatment plants to achieve the required quality gw is not subjected to any treatment facility and is used directly by pumping from the wells gw abstracted p r t g w in a region is supplied to agricultural lands for the irrigation and non potable sectors this mass balance is given by eq 13 13 p r t g w q i r r t g w q n p r t g w r t 3 2 2 capacity planning and operation constraints water treatment plants produce treated water ts and dw and the production in a treatment plant is limited by its installed capacity this is implemented by the constraint given in eq 14 14 p r l k n t p l a n t c a p r l k n t p l a n t r l k n t similarly the export and import of dw for a region occur through separate pipelines across the region which also connect treatment plant locations in adjacent regions the capacity of a pipeline depends on the pipe diameter velocity of water in the pipeline and daily hours of operation the pipeline capacity is a parameter of the model and can be calculated heuristically for all diameter sizes considered in the model assuming a velocity v dw pipe and daily hours of operation h r o p d w p i p e excluding the required maintenance time therefore the carrying capacity of a pipeline can be calculated based on the basic flowrate equation the volume of water exported or imported through a pipeline should always be less than its carrying capacity this is represented by eq 15 15 q e p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e p i t 16 q i p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e p i t where c a p p i r r t p i p e d w is the carrying capacity of the dw pipelines with pipe diameter pi connecting regions r and r plant capacity expansion planning is an important component of water supply planning and management the overall supply capacity of a region c a p r t p l a n t is defined as the sum of the capacities of the respective types dw and ts of plants within it as given by eq 17 this verifies the capacity constraints for all the regions at every t 17 c a p r t p l a n t r k l n c a p r k l n t p l a n t r t in the model it is considered that the capacity of dw and ts plants can be increased in two different ways 1 by expanding retrofitting the already existing treatment plants with the same technology and 2 by installing new plants based on any of the technologies already in use in the locality or any new technology that has been identified to be feasible for use in the region furthermore the capacity of an existing plant also depends on the age of the plant and at the end of its life span it has to be retired or decommissioned its capacity must then be deducted from the plant s total available capacity therefore this was also considered in the model therefore the capacity c a p r k l n t p l a n t of the nth production plant at any location in year t is given by eq 18 18 c a p r k l n t p l a n t c a p r k l n t 1 p l a n t c a p e x p a n d e d r k l n t p l a n t c a p n e w r k l n t p l a n t c a p d e c o m m r k l n t p l a n t n t c l t the first term on the rhs represents the plant s capacity in the previous year the second and third terms represent the increments in the site using existing technologies k and new installations based on new technologies k the final term represents the capacity decommissioned in the preceding year any expansion or new installation requires construction lead time clt therefore this equation also ensures that new capacity is added to the available capacity only after the completion of the plant construction or expansion in the model the option of retrofitting existing pipeline routes with pipelines from a set of discrete values of diameters for any time period t is included the same pipelines are not used for import and export but the pipelines for importation and exportation are different for each region this is included in the model for instance the capacity of any route for importing dw to a region r from another region r in year t is the capacity of all existing pipelines between the two regions plus the retrofitted pipelines in year t minus the decommissioned pipelines all diameters capacities in year t this is given by eq 19 19 c a p r r t d w p i p e p i c a p p i r r t 1 d w p i p e p i c a p p i p e r e t r o p i r r t d w p i p e p i c a p p i p e d e c o m m p i r r t d w p i p e r t c l t for a region the total interregional import is the sum of the capacities of all the interregional routes bringing water from all possible regions the capacity limit for import to a region is given by eq 20 20 c a p i m p o r t r t d w p i p e r p i c a p p i r r t d w p i p e r t therefore similar to the import equations the export equation with respect to a region is given by eq 21 21 c a p e x p o r t r t d w p i p e r p i c a p p i r r t d w p i p e r t the import or export volume through a pipe q i p i r r t p i p e d w or q e p i r r t p i p e d w for a region and the direction of flow are determined by the following equations eqs 22 24 the flow directions are determined by introducing binary variables y f l o w p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w and y f l o w p i p e p i r r t p i p e d w 22 q e p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e p i r r t d w p i p e 23 q i p i r r t d w p i p e c a p p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e p i r r t d w p i p e 24 y f l o w p i p e d i r p i r r t d w p i p e y f l o w p i p e d i r p i r r t d w p i p e 1 the multiperiod water model should consider the bounds of capacity increase and lead time for installing or retrofitting new assets this is needed to set a limit to the possible expansion of a single stretch at a plant location subject to technology and space moreover as a plant s capacity is nonlinear with the cost function it is essential to linearize the capacity cost relation across certain capacity intervals this study considers expansion and installation with bounded values to use a constant unit cost value for incremented capacity thus lower and upper bounds for each technology are required eq 25 defines the lower and upper bound limits of each capacity expansion during the planning period similarly capacity limits are applicable for the

targets 3 2 3 1 cap on co2 emissions the annual co2 emissions from various water production processes and transport are estimated by using the eq 37 and their limited is set by the constraint developed in eq 38 this constraint specifies that the annual co2 emissions emitted by all existing and newly constructed water infrastructure must be less than or equal to the specified annual co 2 target co2 emissions are related to the power consumption per unit volume of water produced or transported by each process 37 q c o 2 t r l k n p r l k n t d w c o 2 e m i k d w r l k n p r l k n t t

production of highly saline water termed brine is a major environmental challenge associated with desalination technology brine has adverse environmental impacts and its disposal is expensive therefore to assess the volume of brine produced at each desalination plant the feed water type desalination technology plant capacity m3 day and water recovery ratios rr associated with various technologies were considered brine production from the plants was calculated as follows 39 q b r i n e r k l n t d w r k l n p r l k n t d w 1 r r k d w r r k d w t where q b r i n e r k l n t d w is the volume of brine produced m3 day and r r k d w is the recovery ratio for the respective technologies therefore to reduce the impact of brine disposal a constraint is set to limit its disposal from all production plants to an annual limit as follows 40 q b r i n e t d w a n n u a l l i m i t t d w b r i n e t 3 2 3 3 cap on gw abstraction gw is considered non renewable in regions with arid or semi arid climatic conditions therefore a constraint is required to limit the annual extraction of gw based on recharge rate government policies and strategies for sustainability this is given by 41 r p r t g w a n n u a l l i m i t t g w t 3 2 4 other logical constraints unlike dw plants where feed water is from an infinite source ts plants are designed to treat a predictable volume of ww generated within population centers eq 42 limits the production of ts in order to not exceed the ww generated in a population center furthermore the capacities of ts plants for a population center should always be greater than the ww generated in the location as there can be more than one ts plant at one plant location l the sum of all ts capacities should always be greater than the ww generated for all years as per eq 43 42 k n p r l k n t t s g e n r l t w w r l t 43 k n c a p r l k n t t s p l a n t g e n l t w w r l t 4 case study in this study the ead in the uae is divided into three sub regions of population settlements each with a total population of more than 1 million inhabitants the ead is divided into the western abu dhabi and al ain regions fig 2 all three regions have population centers where the demand and supply of water are based on population size economic development and other local climatic and geographical conditions the developed milp model is applied to tackle the issue of capacity expansion planning of existing water treatment facilities and inter regional pipeline transmission systems in the ead a plausible scenario for the ead s business as usual bau future as presented in ref 48 is selected and the optimal water supply solution is sought using the developed model for the planning period considered for the study i e 2021 2050 the implementation of the model in abu dhabi s water sector will elucidate the role of different supply options in typical arid and semi arid countries and their impact on the overall cost and environment although this case study aimed to optimize abu dhabi s future water supply it can also be readily applied to other arid or semi arid countries in the model the seven water demand sectors identified in the ead were incorporated residential municipal commercial industrial amenities agricultural and forestry all these demand sectors are classified as either potable non potable or irrigational based on the water resources supplying them potable demand sectors are those that depend purely on dw the only source of potable water in the ead for their water needs the demand for potable water in each region is satisfied exclusively by dw produced at seawater dw plants located at strategic locations within the ead territory and outside the ead where dw is imported through transmission lines non potable demand sectors can depend on any non potable source gw ts or dw in ead all population centers in each region are connected to a sewerage system and the ww is treated to reusable quality ts at the respective ww treatment plants dw is supplied to non potable sectors only if a surplus is available shallow aquifers store gw from which water is abstracted by digging boreholes the ead has gw wells near al ain city in the al ain region and in liwa in the western region table 1 summarizes the existing water demand supply settings in each region 4 1 model inputs for the case study model parameters for the case study include the data describing the water supply system of the ead for which the model scenario is constructed key data used and heuristic assumptions to conduct the case study are presented in this part the demand for the whole planning horizon was estimated using the dynamic water budget model for abu dhabi 47 the projected demands are shown in appendix a all existing infrastructure in abu dhabi for water production and pipeline transmission was considered three prominent technologies for dw production in the middle east are multiple effect distillation med multistage flash distillation msf and ro in ead major ts plants work on a conventional biological process namely the activated sludge process asp other possible options include sequential biological reactors moving bed bioreactors mbbrs and membrane bioreactors mbrs data for all existing dw and ts plants were compiled from the statistics published by refs 49 51 and are presented in appendix b in the ead only dw was imported from outside the boundary a long distance water transmission system is in place to transport dw from the western region of uae to abu dhabi region al ain region a land locked region in the ead imports dw from the adjacent region abu dhabi region as well as from dw plants located outside abu dhabi s boundary fujairah however the exact distance along the pipeline route is unknown therefore the shortest distance between the supply origin dw plants and the key distribution point in the water supplied region is considered an approximation of the pairwise distance to calculate the pumping distance moreover it was assumed that no significant difference existed in the elevations of the connecting points this study considers that water in the pipelines flows only in one direction although in reality the option of reverse flow exists for an emergency in most recently installed pipelines ductile iron di pipes have been used to connect regions with diameters ranging from 800 mm to 1600 mm therefore in this optimization the model was given the option of selecting pipe sizes from the diameter sizes of 1000 1200 1400 and 1600 mm during the optimization process the maximum capacity of each pipe diameter was calculated based on the assumption of a velocity of 2 m s and an operation time of 20 h daily which is consistent with the requirements of the addc 50 a list of existing pipeline networks within the regions and those connecting external dw plants to al ain is shown in appendix c 4 2 capital costs of water treatment processes in this study most of the cost data were obtained from the available literature or estimated from publicly available sources while a few were estimated based on heuristics the unit cost was measured in us dollars and converted to the corresponding value of 2020 unit capital cost is the cost of a new construction or expansion of infrastructure per unit m3 capacity the cost data of dw plants were obtained from several sources 52 53 deep desalination economic evaluation program deep 54 and wtcost software 55 were also used to verify the cost parameters of the dw plants the capital costs of the plants vary based on their capacity however the nonlinear capacity relation was linearized to determine the unit costs for plants of different sizes considered in the case study the unit capital cost of ww treatment plants depends on the plant capacity treatment process and design criteria several studies have developed cost functions for various treatment processes data from various sources were combined to estimate the average unit costs of the various treatment processes and sizes of plants considered in this case study 36 56 57 the capital costs of the various technologies of the dw and ts plants considered in the case study are presented in appendix d because cost of water transportation from one location to another is dependent on many factors such as pumping distance pumping head and soil type it is difficult to compare the cost of pipeline construction from one location to another considering this previous studies have focused on developing cost relations for long distance water pipelines based on data from different long distance pipeline projects capital costs are correlated to the transportation distance and capacity the unit capital costs of installing pipelines with di pipes and their associated fittings and equipment were estimated from cost functions 58 62 appendix e presents the estimated costs for various diameter sizes considered in the current case study 4 3 om costs of water treatment processes the operation and maintenance om cost is a function of plant capacity and the plant operating levels several correlation plots have been reported in previous studies 63 71 in addition the simulation of various process conditions in deep software was used to estimate and compile the unit om costs of the various desalination technologies considered in this study the major ww processes used in the region for municipal ww treatment are the conventional asp and mbrs the cost curve for the conventional system of ww treatment using asp is available from refs 36 56 57 the om cost data function was linearized to estimate the average om cost for the ts plants for the installation sizes considered in this case study the unit om cost of various dw and ts plant types are presented in appendix f the unit cost of transporting 1 m3 of water per kilometer was determined from various correlations 36 72 it was found to be approximately 5 per 100 km of transportation 4 4 environmental impact costs of water treatment processes environmental costs are included to quantify environmental impacts arising from the use of various water supply sources and the costs incurred in environmental compliance monitoring the environmental cost is a monetized measure of environmental damage caused by production technologies through ghg emissions waste disposal and depletion of natural resources in this case study environmental costs were estimated in terms of m3 of water produced the carbon costs for ghg emission at the treatment plants of ds and ts and during the transportation of water were used to measure global warming potential as co2 emissions are directly dependent on the fuel used the co2 emissions from dw plants in abu dhabi are considered in terms of the carbon footprint for each type of technology and process the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the amount of ghgs emitted into the atmosphere and is expressed in kilograms of co2 equivalents kg co2 e several authors have used the monetary cost for this emission 73 75 in this study 0 025 kg e co2 was used as the base value considering that gw in abu dhabi is a non renewable source of water with less than 4 of the gw used recharged an environmental cost in terms of m3 for gw used is assigned which is consistent with the economic value for gw reserves in abu dhabi 76 the economic evaluation considers various aspects such as sustainability and cost benefit analysis by applying the hydro economic model this has been identified as a meaningful metric for policy frameworks if policymakers are interested in setting a price for the gw to reflect the scarcity value and encourage the efficient use of available water resources an estimated value of 1 15 m3 was used in this study furthermore an abstraction limit of 1333 mcm yr was assumed to be ensure the sustainability of existing gw resource for 150 years another environmental aspect included in the model is brine disposal from dw plants and its handling there are numerous impacts of brine discharge from dw plants to the sea such as an increase in salinity levels and metals contribution to global warming increase in the temperature of the receiving water body and impact on aquatic life however no equivalent monetary costs are available for quantifying the impact of brine disposal therefore in this study we used the per unit cost incurred in operating brine disposal facilities the unit cost in m3 of brine discharge was obtained from ref 34 and its implementation in the model allowed the optimization of the overall brine disposal the brine disposal rates considered in this study were 0 0015 m3 0 0015 m3 and 0 04 m3 of brine discharged from the med msf and ro plants respectively 4 5 capacity expansion criteria for infrastructures capacity expansion at a production site is subject to space availability technological limitations and other factors for assets without available data on expansion limits a heuristic assumption was made to set the bounds the lower limit for increased capacity at a production site was set to 20 of the initial capacity whereas the upper limit was set at 50 during expansion another limit set was the length in years of the time gap between two successive expansions or installations at a site it was set at eight years as a heuristic assumption in addition the maximum number of times an asset can undergo expansion was limited by assigning a value of 3 for the entire planning horizon a clt of two years was applied for all construction works 5 results and discussion based on the mathematical formulation presented in section 3 and the data input for the base scenario presented in section 4 the optimal development pathway of abu dhabi s water sector under the base scenario setting was obtained the multi period multi regional optimization problem of water supply planning in abu dhabi was programmed into the general algebraic modelling system 23 1 gams 23 1 and solved using the solver cplex 12 1 the solution strategy allows for the identification of an optimal solution that simultaneously considers the two environmental target constraints eqs 38 40 and 41 and economic objective function eq 1 the formulated scenario has 7655 equations 5277 continuous variables and 1350 binary variables the optimal solution was obtained after a cpu time of approximately 650 s while running on a core i7 computer based on the model run the optimal solutions required for water sector planning in abu dhabi included the composition of the water supply source the technology mix for producing different types of water the capacity of each type of plant for each year decisions on the installation of assets for both plants and pipeline networks yearly emissions of co2 yearly brine discharge and yearly gw abstractions the model results showed that switching desalination technology from thermal processes to ro would be more cost effective and environment friendly for the ead the best option for treating ww in ead is the conventional asp process moreover gw will continue to be the major water source for irrigation in abu dhabi assigning a high environmental cost to the economic value of gw will affect the dw capacity as more dw would be utilized for irrigation under such conditions the model indicated that om costs and capital costs of treatment plants of various technologies would have a relatively low impact on the total cost for the technology mix for water supply the environmental costs namely the carbon cost and gw economic value had a high impact on the overall cost and selection of desalination technologies the optimization results are analyzed and discussed in detail in the following subsections 5 1 optimal cost for the planning period the optimized solution of the base case for the objective function provides the minimized total cost for the entire planning period the total cost of using water from different sources was estimated to be 123 12 billion as the npv a breakdown of the total cost of this scenario is shown in fig 3 the environmental costs were the major costs accounting for approximately 47 of the total cost a high environmental cost is incurred because of the carbon footprint and depletion value for gw it can be observed that the majority of the environmental cost is for gw utilization because of assigning an economic value to the stock this environmental indicator is very significant especially in places such as abu dhabi as the gw reserve is non renewable in addition the high environmental impact cost is mainly attributed to the co2 emissions from desalination plants included in the optimal solution it can be noted that med and msf plants have higher carbon emission rates than any other desalination technology implemented in ead as can be observed in the optimal future expansion pathway in the ead ro and msf technologies dominate over the planning time horizon of these ro has low carbon emissions compared to msf however msf is still a preferred technology because of the low capital and om costs along with other site specific constraints to be implemented therefore the environmental costs of msf are high because of its high contribution to the overall production capacity 5 2 the optimal development pathway of abu dhabi s water sector under bau scenario the model reveals the optimal capacities of water treatment plants dw and ts dw transportation pipelines and gw utilization required to meet the water demand rise until 2050 in addition the model selects a combination of desalination and ww treatment technologies along with non treated gw that satisfy the constraints while minimizing the total cost fig 4 shows the expansion pathway of all dw plants supplying water to various regions in the ead as developed by the model all dw plant sites will undergo an optimal capacity increase by satisfying all the constraints in the model for the selected scenario choosing from available technology options the capacity of a plant is considered to be a non decreasing function however at some locations a decline in capacity can be noted in the planning horizon because of the decommissioning of retiring plants for the location in shuweihat as shown in fig 4 a and fig 2 msf plants will have to undergo capacity expansion in 2023 2030 and 2037 the plant units at this site are expected to undergo decommissioning in 2025 which will cause a decrease in production at this site but would not affect the overall supply as the decommissioned capacity can be supplied from other nearby plant locations until the year 2030 similarly at mirfa fig 2 where both ro and msf technologies are in place the capacity expansion plan developed by the model has opted for more ro than msf it can be seen that the capacity of msf at mirfa has to decrease to 61 290 m3 day from 102 150 m3 day while the ro will increase to 681 000 m3 day in 2050 from 136 200 m3 day in 2020 fig 4 b at umm al nar fig 2 where there was a choice of using msf and med technologies for building new plants capacity expansion the model opted for msf technology it can be seen that the med capacity would be almost halved while the msf capacity would increase by approximately five times by 2050 fig 4 c at the taweelah dw plant location fig 2 where the available expansion options are for med and msf plants a trend in which msf is chosen over med is evident fig 4 d at the fujairah site fig 2 the options for technology selection for capacity expansion were ro msf and med the model opted for ro over both the med and msf this means that the ro capacity will increase significantly but med and msf capacities will be reduced after the planned decommissioning of the existing units fig 4 e the overall capacities for the entire abu dhabi potable water dw demand in 2020 and 2050 in relation to the technologies as determined by the model are presented in table 2 in terms of the technologies the contribution of capacity in 2050 will be as follows msf 9 5 million cubic meters per day mcmd ro 2 2 mcmd med 0 43 mcmd another key observation is that the contribution of ro is expected to increase from 5 1 in 2021 to 18 1 in 2050 it can be seen that the model opted for capacity expansion using ro the relatively low selection of msf and med is due to their high capital costs and carbon footprints naturally the model selects ro as the first option because it is the least expensive in addition med and msf consume less energy but have a higher carbon footprint and lower recovery rate in contrast ro is energy expensive but has a higher recovery rate therefore the model selects more ro desalination plants to satisfy all model constraints while minimizing the total cost although all sites need plant capacity expansion over the planning horizon the optimal solution suggests that the installation of new pipelines between regions in the ead is essential to support potable water demand in different regions individually table 3 lists the capacity expansion trajectory for all dw pipelines over the planning horizon the existing pipelines are expanded to different sizes by selecting from available diameter sizes for some pipelines multiple expansion values exist the optimal solution suggests that new installations are required between the regions shuweihat abu dhabi umm al nar al ain taweelah al ain and fujairah al ain at different times of the planning period other results from the model were related to the ww treatment plants the required year wise capacities of the ww treatment plants at all plant locations as simulated by the model are shown in fig 5 for ww treatment the expansion of ts plants based on asp is the optimal option at all sites probably due to the large capital costs associated with mbr and mbbr plants appendix d although the unit om costs are comparable to those of conventional asp appendix f in addition asp had a lower carbon footprint than the other two technologies included in the model naturally the model selected asp because it is the least expensive of the available processes and has low carbon emissions the optimal contribution of gw in meeting water demand is shown in fig 6 the gw in ead was used without further treatment therefore the capacity of gw production is not limited by the treatment facilities however gw abstraction was set to the maximum yearly limit in the model simulation this limit is set to sustain the life of the available gw reserves in the ead the model identified gw as the best option for irrigation and non potable demand the use of gw selected by the model is constant for most years except for few years when there is maximum use because some dw plants will be decommissioned and the surplus dw being supplied to irrigation will be interrupted the model compensates for this in the optimal solution by increasing gw usage for such years gw extraction was the best choice for irrigation demand even after adding the environmental cost owing to the large investment and environmental costs associated with all types of dw technology 5 3 optimal environmental impact parameters environmental objectives were included in the model to reflect environmental regulations and achieve sustainability the emission reduction targets considered in the scenario refer to the direct carbon emissions from all water supply processes and operations as well as brine discharges from desalination plants therefore the model resolved the issue of capacity expansion by considering these constraints along with cost minimization the model achieved an optimal carbon emission solution by selecting optimal capacities for technologies and the operation of the water system in abu dhabi that would minimize carbon emissions the trajectory of carbon emissions from various operations during the planning period is shown in fig 7 the optimal solution showed that the minimum overall carbon emissions would reach 250 million kg co2 e in 2050 if no carbon capture technologies were implemented the discharge of highly saline brine from desalination plants is an environmental concern in ead brine from the dw plants supplying water to the ead is discharged into two different water bodies the dw plants in the western and abu dhabi regions discharge brine to the arabian gulf whereas dw plants located in fujairah outside the ead discharge brine into the gulf of oman therefore the optimal solution should reduce brine discharge into both water bodies the brine discharge from the different technologies is shown in fig 8 the results show that most brine comes from msf because of a lower recovery rate and a high percentage of capacity contribution to dw production in the uae therefore an improved recovery rate is required for all plants to reduce brine discharge and minimize the impact on the marine environment 5 4 sensitivity analysis for key parameters of the model a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effects of varying the values of the various parameters such as unit gw cost m3 carbon emission cost kg co2 e and capital and om costs of all operations on the obtained optimal solution the data for the case study scenario referred to as the base case along with the model outputs for various sensitivity analysis cases are included in table 4 the model assigned an environmental cost of 1 15 m3 to the gw for the base case run however for the sensitivity analysis the range of the environmental costs considered was 0 1 25 m3 the results showed that while no cost was assigned for gw the total cost was reduced to 60 74 11 billion compared with the baseline cost of 126 76 billion table 4 implying that allocating the environmental cost affects the total cost in addition other observations varying the gw environmental cost occur in the selection of technologies for dw plants for costs of 0 5 m3 or less med technology was excluded from the solution and replaced with msf thus a cost of more than 0 5 m3 affects the process of selection of optimal dw technology the impact of allocating carbon taxes or costs based on carbon emissions during various water production and supply stages was studied allocating a monetary cost to ghgs is a recognized yet controversial practice in the base run a marginal cost of 0 025 kg co2 e was assigned however to understand how this affected the optimal solution a range of costs from 0 025 kg co2 e to 0 25 kg co2 e was selected which is consistent with the value ranges used by refs 34 77 the overall cost varies between 99 19 billion and 378 5 billion for this range this shows the significance of assigning the carbon cost as the total cost more than tripled in the range studied table 4 thus the sensitivity study indicated that the various environmental costs and values play a significant role in the optimal solution the sensitivity analysis values showed that assigning a lower economic value for gw less than 0 3 m3 has no significant impact on the overall cost of water planning and infrastructure expansion however when the gw was given a value of more than 0 3 m3 the results showed that dw was also selected to satisfy irrigation demand this is because the overall cost of the dw becomes comparable to the gw cost when assigned a value greater than 0 1 kg co2 e the carbon cost showed a high impact on the overall cost and the selection of desalination technologies this indicates that when the carbon cost assigned is increased technologies with high carbon emissions are the least preferred therefore it is essential to choose an appropriate environmental cost value for both the gw economic value and carbon footprint for all water technologies the impact of the change in the capital cost of various process technologies was studied by changing the base run value of capital costs table 4 a range of 10 to 10 variation was studied the results showed that the total cost did not vary significantly over the studied range and only a change of approximately 3 was noted thus a change in capital cost does not affect the optimal solution in addition it does not affect the selection of technologies as capital cost variation was implemented for all technologies therefore the unit capital cost for treatment plants of various technologies has less impact on the technology mix for the water supply similar to capital costs variations in om costs in the range of 10 to 10 change from the base run value of om costs were studied table 4 the results showed a low impact on the total cost for instance an increase of less than 2 for a 10 increase in the unit om cost moreover this change had insignificant impact on the selection of water treatment technologies thus the sensitivity study indicated that various environmental costs play a significant role in the optimal solution therefore it is essential to choose an appropriate environmental cost for both the gw economic value and carbon footprint for all water technologies the model can accommodate additional environmental costs to assist in decision making and environmental valuation 6 conclusions in this paper a multiperiod milp model was built to optimize the planning of water systems in semi arid or arid regions with various water supply considerations the superstructure of the model provided the basis for a decision support system in which all types of water demand and use were included co2 emissions and brine disposal were minimized the optimal capacity for water treatment plants and water transmission systems were estimated and the optimal allocation of natural water resources was determined the model was applied to the case study of the emirate of abu dhabi uae as part of the integrated management of water resources and the capacity planning of water infrastructures a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the impact of various parameters on the optimal model solution results show that the optimal scenario obtained by the model provides significant benefit to the water resource managers by identifying the optimal combination of sources to meet present and future water needs of in the emirate the proposed model is among the first to be developed for an arid or semi arid environment of the middle east for long term integrated water management and planning this model can be very useful for achieving sustainability by decision makers as it incorporated both cost and environmental aspects into the decision making process declaration of

subsurface waters differ in total dissolved solids tds there are sweet waters that contain less than 1000 mg dm3 mineral substances and mineral waters containing more than 1000 mg dm3 mineral substances 1 both types can be exploited and bottled their distinction in the industry is based on a separate classification not coinciding strictly with the systematics used in hydrogeology the definitions of natural mineral waters differ from country to country in the eu in accordance with directive 2009 54 ec 2 and regulations in the eu member states implementing this regulation 3 e g the regulation of the minister of health of march 31 2011 on natural mineral waters spring waters and table waters in poland 4 there are natural mineral waters spring waters and table waters the directive defines natural mineral water it is microbiologically safe water derived from an underground reservoir or aquifer and extracted from these sources by one or more natural intakes or bored wells natural mineral water is characterized by the content of minerals trace elements or other components in some cases by specific impacts and its original purity these properties must be kept intact according to us regulations natural mineral waters are water containing not less than 250 parts per million ppm tds coming from a source at one or more boreholes or springs originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source 5 1 1 research on changes in the composition of mineral waters the temporal stability variability of elements chemical compounds has been analysed in many hydrogeological 6 7 and environmental e g refs 8 11 studies where archival data supported new research insights the stability of the chemical composition of mineral waters was tested as part of monitoring programs including muntean et al 2006 12 and barut et al 2004 13 negrel et al 1997 14 determined changes in the concentrations of dissolved mineral waters part of the research was based on comparing data from separate periods of time 15 a series of studies on the variability of physicochemical parameters of medicinal waters occurring in the outer carpathians and the carpathian foredeep as well as geothermal waters of the podhale basin were conducted the analysis of changes in the chemistry of mineral waters of piwnicznej zdroju 6 16 muszyny spring antoni 17 wysowej zdroju 18 iwonicza 19 krzeszowic 20 21 buska zdroju 22 salt mine wieliczka 23 and geothermal waters from the bańska pgp 1 well 24 25 were performed in the majority of analyses mineral waters are characterized by the stable chemical composition which does not endanger their healing properties the assessment of changes in the chemical composition stability of waters from the zdrój główny in krzeszowice including hydrogen sulphide was conducted based on the methodology of ciężkowski et al 26 they showed that concentrations of the main components sulphates calcium and magnesium as well as hydrogen sulphides giving the therapeutic character of water are stable 20 21 similar results were obtained in the case of the variability study of physicochemical parameters of medicinal waters extracted in wysowa zdrój comparison of the values of pharmacodynamic coefficients with acceptable fluctuation limits showed that the therapeutic properties of these waters are not at risk the analysis of changes in sulphur ii content in the waters from the michał intake in busko zdrój showed that most of the results are within the warning limits which suggests the stability of sulphur ii concentrations over time 22 research on the variability of the chemical composition of geothermal waters from the podhale trough area confirmed that these waters are characterized by a stable chemical composition and hydrogeochemical type 25 27 however due to the intensive exploitation of the geothermal waters of the podhale trough it is anticipated that in the long term the tds of these waters may decrease and the concentrations of individual chemical components may change 24 27 research on carbonated waters and waters containing carbon dioxide extracted from intakes and springs in the poprad valley muszyna piwniczna zdrój showed that their tds and content of specific components bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide show a downward trend lowering the content of these parameters may indicate that these waters are being irrigated due to the launch of new carbon dioxide migration routes and or increased infiltration of waters that do not contain this gas these changes may be caused by increased exploitation of mineral waters or by anthropogenic disturbance of water and gas conditions in the case of waters exploited by the antoni spring there was a direct relationship between the volume of exploitation and the concentration of bicarbonate ions 28 29 research on selected operational and physicochemical parameters of sorrel intakes exploited under the conditions of cooperation in the town of zubrzyk the analysis showed that depression specific electrolytic conductivity carbon dioxide content and instantaneous efficiency varied within the acceptable range guaranteeing the correct operation of the intake and minimizing the demineralization risk of water 30 1 2 methods of testing the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters the physicochemical properties of natural mineral waters are determined by the content of specific chemical components dissolved in these waters these amounts according to directive 2009 54 ec may fluctuate within the limits of natural fluctuations but should not change in case of increasing water production the physicochemical composition of groundwater fluctuates these fluctuations may be geological or related to the manner and mode of operation studies of changes in the chemical composition of mineral waters over time indicate that the range of changes should not be arbitrarily assumed e g 10 or 20 of the average value of the parameter 26 31 at a level of 10 may be acceptable for high tds water but not for low tds water for components with concentrations of approximately 1 mg l or dissolved gases e g co2 the tolerance of 10 may be lower than analytical uncertainties the range of natural fluctuations in individual chemical components of mineral waters is determined based on the analysis of changes in their concentrations over time in the method used by the ffsa the stability criterion s of individual water components is calculated which is the quotient of the double coefficient of the variation in a given chemical component by the laboratory coefficient of analytical uncertainty of the parameter at the level of the measured concentration within laboratory variability if s is greater than 2 the component content is stable over time if it is less it is unstable when the s criterion for two essential water components is above 2 it is assumed that the water composition is stable when more than half of the components have s criteria above 2 the water is unstable and its composition changes over time 31 a separate approach was used by ciężkowski et al 2007 they assumed that the values of parameters characterizing healing waters fluctuate within certain limits that describe their natural variability it was assumed that the range of permissible fluctuations for all parameters of medicinal waters is within the limits x 2 s x x 2 s x and that the average value of the parameter minus the double standard deviation must be at least equal to the limit value of the therapeutic component the lowest limit values of chemical parameters of water were adopted by the authors based on the binding regulations of the council of ministers 2006 26 the evaluation of changes in the chemical composition of mineral waters used various methods mainly based on selected elements of statistical analysis descriptive statistics 28 29 trend analysis 20 32 and control charts 21 33 only in the case of the variability of the chemical composition of therapeutic waters exploited in wysowa zdrój was the assessment made by comparing the range of parameter values pharmacodynamic coefficients with acceptable fluctuation limits and by studying trends in their variability 18 dusan s team proposed criteria 1 5 iqr interquartile range together with conditions for the number of elements in the dataset time factor for assessing the stability of the chemical composition of natural mineral waters 15 ciężkowski et al 26 proposed a method allowing us to determine the acceptable ranges of fluctuations in the qualitative tds content of major components of water and specific components as well as temperature and quantitative intake yield parameters of medicinal waters shewart cards were used to assess the variability of these parameters 1 3 the importance of the discussed issues the interest in using mineral waters is growing this is mainly due to their increasing use in bottling groundwater resources unlike solid mineral resources are partially renewable but their management should be rational water management should consider technical conditions the demand for mineral waters and hydrogeological conditions conductivity influencing intake yield is an important hydrogeological factor improper exploitation of mineral waters e g with too high efficiency may contribute to the occurrence of changes in their physical properties and or chemical composition resulting in deterioration of their quality or even a change in the chemical type of water exploitation of groundwater may cause changes in its chemical composition which may be the result of hydrodynamic changes in the natural circulation system of waters or the transformation of hydrogeochemical conditions in the inflow of water to the intake these changes may cause deterioration of the exploited waters quality and in extreme cases limit the volume of exploitation or lead to the closure of the intake 34 37 hydrodynamic changes associated with the exploitation of groundwater can result in both positive and negative changes in water quality positive changes occur when the hydrogeochemical conditions in the region of supply of the intake are more favourable than at the location of the intake or in the case of more intensive circulation of water during the exploitation of groundwater their quality may also decrease the size of changes in water quality depends on the volume of water intake and hydrogeochemical conditions in the recharge area of the intake changes do not occur or are small when the intake is small enough such that it does not affect the flow of water circulation or when the hydrogeochemical conditions in the recharge area of the intake are homogeneous major changes in the quality of groundwater are found in the case of heterogeneous hydrogeochemical conditions in the area of recharge of the intake exploitation of water from open water bearing reservoirs or in the case of groundwater extraction that is too large 36 to date no methodology for assessing the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters has been developed various statistical methods as well as methods used in production quality control are used this article presents a method of managing the production of mineral waters based on the analysis of the variability of the content of selected chemical components of these waters in the form of cusum cards the proposed methodology allows us to determine whether there is a threat to the quality of mineral waters understood as the presence of specific chemical components in the water at an appropriate concentration related to their overexploitation the application of this method is presented as an example of the analysis of changes in the content of selected chemical components co2 of waters exploited in the eastern part of the outer carpathians 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the methodology for assessing the variability of specific chemical components was tested based on selected operational extraction and chemical co2 content parameters of mineral waters from intakes in one of the health resorts located in southeastern poland the analysed mineral waters occur in the flysch formations of the outer carpathians silesian napkin in a folded structure the anticline is partially isolated from the environment natural mineral waters in this structure occur within four series of sandstone isolated by clay shales water bearing sandstones occur on the surface to the east of the analysed area 38 in the analysed area common and mineral waters coexist on the surface or in the subsurface zone there is vertical hydrochemical zoning here mineralization increases with depth 39 40 the exchange of water between the levels in the individual series of sandstone practically does not occur some of the analysed waters occur in the active zone waters from intakes 1 2 and 6 occurring in the shallower sandstone level the lower sandstone horizons are not recharged by infiltration waters or from aquifers in the overburden water from intakes 3 and 4 one intake uses water from both zones intake 5 due to the complexity of the geological structure the determination of the recharged zone for these levels is very difficult 19 38 the analysed waters represent two chemical types cl hco3 na and hco3 cl na 19 38 40 they contain specific components such as iodine in the amount from 2 31 to 9 84 mg dm3 and carbon dioxide from 620 to 1170 g dm3 table 1 the content of total dissolved solids varies from 6 03 to 19 25 g dm3 39 2 2 methodology for the evaluation of the mineral water exploitation process mineral water extraction is significantly different from typical production plants where the entire manufacturing process is largely controlled and the source of defects might be easily detected when analysing changes in product quality water exploitation is influenced by natural factors that cannot always be easily identified among them the influence of weather conditions climate geological conditions or defects of the water extraction installation can be distinguished moreover underground water intakes are plants designed from the perspective of decades so the determination of certain rules related to water extraction should also refer to long term changes determining the amount of water extraction must be based on continuous analysis of operating data mainly the water extraction being used a methodology for monitoring the operating parameters and chemistry of mineral waters was proposed enabling the extraction of these waters without deterioration in their quality decreased co2 content the methodology assumes that the amount of mineral water exploitation measured on the surface changes the chemical composition of the water tds or concentrations of specific components exploitation of mineral waters can be seen as a production process that should be controlled no process is perfectly stable due to random and special disturbances the limits within which a process should fit when it is affected by random processes can be defined the process exceeding these limits proves the occurrence of a special disturbance which can be identified and eliminated 11 16 17 random disturbances are factors of relatively little importance usually occurring in large numbers they lead to volatility and must necessarily be identified special disturbances are factors usually systematic that can be detected and identified as causing quality changes or process variability 15 different tools are used to control the quality control of the production process one of them being control charts which are a graphical method of detecting disturbances occurring during the process charts are the sheets on which changes in a selected statistical parameter are applied 42 43 the control chart allows the detection of significant deviations from the target statistical variables such deviations testify to irregularities in the production process ultimately affecting its quality production control gives the opportunity to adjust in the production process in a very short time e g adjustments of the water extraction due to the characteristics of the data the control cards were considered as applicable in the case of the exploitation of mineral waters the data values depends on time and there is a disruption of the exploitation process related to a constant continuous change of the average value of the process the cusum card indicates deviation from the area of satisfactory operation so that corrective actions can be commenced e g change in the amount of water exploited the use of cusum cards is justified when the components of the production process in the analysed case the mineral water deposit are used for a long time or when a change in the average value of data or measurements can be expected the developed long term model of changes in water consumption based on changes in mean values reflects the general trends of changes taking place in the water deposit expressed in increases or decreases in tds or the content of a specific chemical component of mineral water this methodology uses statistical methods to monitor deviations of diagnostic variables from nominal values there is a possibility to detect the causes of random and special disturbances occurring in the production process the methods for optimization of water extraction were developed on the basis of the cumulative sum chart cusum which was first introduced by page 44 it is an analytical tool used in quality control e g control of measurements analyses technological processes the cusum chart is based on the differences between average values taken at regular intervals of the series and the reference value it allows the detection of even small deviations from the average because even small changes in the process lead to a large value of the sum of deviations 45 the value of the cumulative sum is calculated according to the formula 46 1 c i j 1 i x j μ where x j average of n measurements for the j th sample μ reference value i sample number i 1 m if the production process is correct the values of the cumulative sums are in the range upper and lower limits determined based on the value of the standard deviation fig 1 the use of cusum charts for production control has three basic advantages 46 deviations from the target value can be easily detected on the basis of a visual assessment of the control chart distribution of the charts value of the point where significant deviations from the normative value appear can be easily located which is beneficial from the point of view of diagnosing the causes of production defects i e undesirable deviations from the target values control efficiency increases compared to standard control charts e g shewhart charts when using cusum it is possible to detect deviations from the target values at the level of 0 5σ to 2σ where σ stands for standard deviations this means that compared to standard control charts changes can be detected approximately twice as fast or during the same period a methodology consisting of the following steps was proposed for managing the exploitation of natural mineral waters 1 the cumulative sums for co2 content and mineral water extraction were determined by calculating the lower and upper cumulative sums as follows 2 c i m a x 0 x i μ k c i 1 3 c i m i n 0 x i μ k c i 1 where c 0 and c 0 are equal to zero the value of k is usually called the reference value and is related to the shift parameter delta expressed in standard deviation units these cumulative sums are used to discover an increase and a decrease in the process mean shift acceptable process mean 20 2 prepare cusum cards for co2 content and mineral water extraction by drawing points in the chart by choosing for each sample i one of the values c i and c i depending on which of two quantities c i and c i is more extreme 3 normalization of the cumulative sum values for co2 content and mineral water fields mutual comparison of values for both counted variables by performing variable normalization z standardization can be expressed by the following formula 4 z x μ σ where x non standardized variable μ population mean σ population standard deviation as a result of the standardization used the variable obtains the mean expected value of zero and the standard deviation equal to one 4 summary of cumulative sum charts for co2 content and cumulative sums for expenditure from sample number for individual intakes 5 selecting in the charts for individual approaches the areas in which mutually opposite trends in the values of cumulative sums were observed and in which there was a sufficiently high correlation 0 4 0 6 is a significant correlation relationship 0 6 0 8 is a significant correlation relationship 47 when selecting the areas the provisions of the iso 7870 control charts standard were followed these are exactly parts iso 7870 1 2014 part 1 general guidelines 48 iso 7870 2 2013 part 2 shewhart control chart 49 and iso 7870 3 2012 part 3 acceptance control charts 50 according to which the process is disturbed when at least 6 consecutive points are in a downward or upward trend six consecutive points continuously increasing or decreasing the areas where water intake and co2 content show instability with a mutually opposite trend are indicated co2 content upward trend water extraction downward trend 6 determination of a linear equation for selected areas around the intersection point marked with a green area in figs 2 7 for raw data enables the determination of the amount of water abstraction 3 results and discussions for waters exploited from the 7 intakes in accordance with the methodology described above the cumulative sums of carbon dioxide content and water intake were determined data from the period of 20 years 1963 2020 were analysed the 20 year periods were selected to maintain the continuity of analyses year on year basic statistical data on selected parameters of mineral waters from the analysed intakes are presented in table 2 cusum cards were deleted for the determined accumulated sums to determine the areas where mutually opposite trends in the value of cumulative sums were observed compilations of the cusum cards of co2 content and water consumption were prepared figs 2 7 the green hatched fields mark the areas in which the process of exploitation of mineral waters showed disturbances the use of cusum cards to monitor the mineral water exploitation process resulted in the specificity of this tool in studies of the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters various mathematical and statistical methods are used such as descriptive statistics 6 7 trend analysis 3 8 and control charts 4 9 these methods enable tracing of the variability of individual chemical components these methods allow us to monitor changes in only one parameter cusum cards are used for relatively quick and early recognition of systematic process changes the advantage of the cusum card is the use of accumulated sums as a result cusum cards are much more sensitive to even a slight shift in relation to the reference values thanks to this property it was possible to use them to analyse the exploitation of mineral waters the disadvantage of the cusum card is its time consumption and computational complexity which requires the use of computer techniques cusum cards are used to monitor the process of exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits they are used to detect changes in the concentration of selected ions causing scaling in exploitation wells 51 52 for the indicated areas where disturbances in the mineral water exploitation process were found the relationships between carbon dioxide concentration and water consumption were analysed figs 8 13 for all the intakes there was a correlation between the analysed parameters r from 0 79 to 0 97 at all intakes large fluctuations in the carbon dioxide content were observed by an order of magnitude from approximately 100 to over 1000 mg dm3 in terms 3 4 and 5 co2 fluctuations in the periods analysed in the cusum cards were approximately 9 times in the remaining shots the fluctuations are 2 3 times the temporal and spatial variability of the chemistry of the analysed waters has been the subject of research by other authors 19 38 the analysis of the tds time series and the content of chloride and bicarbonate ions in the years 1963 1997 showed that in waters from all intakes there is a tendency to decrease mineralization over time with relatively small changes in the values of ionic ratios which may indicate the process of sweetening these waters the greatest fluctuations in mineralization and chemical composition were observed in the intakes exploiting the combined horizons of mineralized waters intake 5 as well as horizons poorly insulated from each other or under the diversified influence of atmospheric waters intake 1 and 2 19 these observations are confirmed by studies conducted by the team of rajchel et al 2011 which shows that water from intakes isolated from the influence of filtration waters e g water from intakes 3 5 and 6 is characterized by slight fluctuations however in waters from other intakes a decrease in mineralization has been observed since the 1970s neither study analysed the dependence of changes in chemistry on the expenditure and their authors emphasized the possibility of changes in the chemistry of these waters in the event of intensification of their extraction the relationship between mineralization and the amount of water extraction in the analysed waters in 1990 2010 was analysed by chowaniec and operacz 2013 they found that water extraction in this area is decreasing as is the mineralization of these waters to determine the optimal amounts of water extraction for selected areas linear relations between the carbon dioxide contents and water extraction were obtained table 3 for individual intakes linear equations were determined to which the value of co2 concentration was assigned 250 mg dm3 minimum carbon dioxide content in carbonic acid waters the obtained water intake values should guarantee the maintenance of the gas content at a level exceeding 250 mg dm3 4 conclusions improper exploitation of mineral waters may lead to a decrease in the value of water and even a change in the chemical type of water in the event of large changes in the content of chemical components of main and specific water in industrial practice constant monitoring of the mineral water exploitation process is not conducted the authors proposed a tool in the form of cumus cards for this purpose the analysis showed for all intakes of mineral waters the occurrence of mutual dysregulation of processes co2 content and water intake in a similar time interval the cards made it possible to indicate the relationship between the amount of extraction and the concentration of carbon dioxide in mineral waters determining the relationship between these parameters may enable the control of the volume of production to maintain an appropriate chemical composition of the exploited water this paper proposes linear process control models that can support the selection of the upper limit of mineral water extraction the obtained results confirm the previous literatures assertion the unfavourable influence of excessive water exploitation on their chemical composition the control of the mineral water exploitation process proposed in the article may allow reacting to changes in water chemistry by making corrections in the extraction process however this requires an increase in the frequency of physicochemical tests of waters which were conducted once a year at the analysed intakes the frequency of tests determines the potential length of the forecasting period for the parameters of mineral water exploitation funding this work was supported by the agh university of science and technology research subvention no 16 16 190 779 credit

wysowa zdrój comparison of the values of pharmacodynamic coefficients with acceptable fluctuation limits showed that the therapeutic properties of these waters are not at risk the analysis of changes in sulphur ii content in the waters from the michał intake in busko zdrój showed that most of the results are within the warning limits which suggests the stability of sulphur ii concentrations over time 22 research on the variability of the chemical composition of geothermal waters from the podhale trough area confirmed that these waters are characterized by a stable chemical composition and hydrogeochemical type 25 27 however due to the intensive exploitation of the geothermal waters of the podhale trough it is anticipated that in the long term the tds of these waters may decrease and the concentrations of individual chemical components may change 24 27 research on carbonated waters and waters containing carbon dioxide extracted from intakes and springs in the poprad valley muszyna piwniczna zdrój showed that their tds and content of specific components bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide show a downward trend lowering the content of these parameters may indicate that these waters are being irrigated due to the launch of new carbon dioxide migration routes and or increased infiltration of waters that do not contain this gas these changes may be caused by increased exploitation of mineral waters or by anthropogenic disturbance of water and gas conditions in the case of waters exploited by the antoni spring there was a direct relationship between the volume of exploitation and the concentration of bicarbonate ions 28 29 research on selected operational and physicochemical parameters of sorrel intakes exploited under the conditions of cooperation in the town of zubrzyk the analysis showed that depression specific electrolytic conductivity carbon dioxide content and instantaneous efficiency varied within the acceptable range guaranteeing the correct operation of the intake and minimizing the demineralization risk of water 30 1 2 methods of testing the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters the physicochemical properties of natural mineral waters are determined by the content of specific chemical components dissolved in these waters these amounts according to directive 2009 54 ec may fluctuate within the limits of natural fluctuations but should not change in case of increasing water production the physicochemical composition of groundwater fluctuates these fluctuations may be geological or related to the manner and mode of operation studies of changes in the chemical composition of mineral waters over time indicate that the range of changes should not be arbitrarily assumed e g 10 or 20 of the average value of the parameter 26 31 at a level of 10 may be acceptable for high tds water but not for low tds water for components with concentrations of approximately 1 mg l or dissolved gases e g co2 the tolerance of 10 may be lower than analytical uncertainties the range of natural fluctuations in individual chemical components of mineral waters is determined based on the analysis of changes in their concentrations over time in the method used by the ffsa the stability criterion s of individual water components is calculated which is the quotient of the double coefficient of the variation in a given chemical component by the laboratory coefficient of analytical uncertainty of the parameter at the level of the measured concentration within laboratory variability if s is greater than 2 the component content is stable over time if it is less it is unstable when the s criterion for two essential water components is above 2 it is assumed that the water composition is stable when more than half of the components have s criteria above 2 the water is unstable and its composition changes over time 31 a separate approach was used by ciężkowski et al 2007 they assumed that the values of parameters characterizing healing waters fluctuate within certain limits that describe their natural variability it was assumed that the range of permissible fluctuations for all parameters of medicinal waters is within the limits x 2 s x x 2 s x and that the average value of the parameter minus the double standard deviation must be at least equal to the limit value of the therapeutic component the lowest limit values of chemical parameters of water were adopted by the authors based on the binding regulations of the council of ministers 2006 26 the evaluation of changes in the chemical composition of mineral waters used various methods mainly based on selected elements of statistical analysis descriptive statistics 28 29 trend analysis 20 32 and control charts 21 33 only in the case of the variability of the chemical composition of therapeutic waters exploited in wysowa zdrój was the assessment made by comparing the range of parameter values pharmacodynamic coefficients with acceptable fluctuation limits and by studying trends in their variability 18 dusan s team proposed criteria 1 5 iqr interquartile range together with conditions for the number of elements in the dataset time factor for assessing the stability of the chemical composition of natural mineral waters 15 ciężkowski et al 26 proposed a method allowing us to determine the acceptable ranges of fluctuations in the qualitative tds content of major components of water and specific components as well as temperature and quantitative intake yield parameters of medicinal waters shewart cards were used to assess the variability of these parameters 1 3 the importance of the discussed issues the interest in using mineral waters is growing this is mainly due to their increasing use in bottling groundwater resources unlike solid mineral resources are partially renewable but their management should be rational water management should consider technical conditions the demand for mineral waters and hydrogeological conditions conductivity influencing intake yield is an important hydrogeological factor improper exploitation of mineral waters e g with too high efficiency may contribute to the occurrence of changes in their physical properties and or chemical composition resulting in deterioration of their quality or even a change in the chemical type of water exploitation of groundwater may cause changes in its chemical composition which may be the result of hydrodynamic changes in the natural circulation system of waters or the transformation of hydrogeochemical conditions in the inflow of water to the intake these changes may cause deterioration of the exploited waters quality and in extreme cases limit the volume of exploitation or lead to the closure of the intake 34 37 hydrodynamic changes associated with the exploitation of groundwater can result in both positive and negative changes in water quality positive changes occur when the hydrogeochemical conditions in the region of supply of the intake are more favourable than at the location of the intake or in the case of more intensive circulation of water during the exploitation of groundwater their quality may also decrease the size of changes in water quality depends on the volume of water intake and hydrogeochemical conditions in the recharge area of the intake changes do not occur or are small when the intake is small enough such that it does not affect the flow of water circulation or when the hydrogeochemical conditions in the recharge area of the intake are homogeneous major changes in the quality of groundwater are found in the case of heterogeneous hydrogeochemical conditions in the area of recharge of the intake exploitation of water from open water bearing reservoirs or in the case of groundwater extraction that is too large 36 to date no methodology for assessing the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters has been developed various statistical methods as well as methods used in production quality control are used this article presents a method of managing the production of mineral waters based on the analysis of the variability of the content of selected chemical components of these waters in the form of cusum cards the proposed methodology allows us to determine whether there is a threat to the quality of mineral waters understood as the presence of specific chemical components in the water at an appropriate concentration related to their overexploitation the application of this method is presented as an example of the analysis of changes in the content of selected chemical components co2 of waters exploited in the eastern part of the outer carpathians 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the methodology for assessing the variability of specific chemical components was tested based on selected operational extraction and chemical co2 content parameters of mineral waters from intakes in one of the health resorts located in southeastern poland the analysed mineral waters occur in the flysch formations of the outer carpathians silesian napkin in a folded structure the anticline is partially isolated from the environment natural mineral waters in this structure occur within four series of sandstone isolated by clay shales water bearing sandstones occur on the surface to the east of the analysed area 38 in the analysed area common and mineral waters coexist on the surface or in the subsurface zone there is vertical hydrochemical zoning here mineralization increases with depth 39 40 the exchange of water between the levels in the individual series of sandstone practically does not occur some of the analysed waters occur in the active zone waters from intakes 1 2 and 6 occurring in the shallower sandstone level the lower sandstone horizons are not recharged by infiltration waters or from aquifers in the overburden water from intakes 3 and 4 one intake uses water from both zones intake 5 due to the complexity of the geological structure the determination of the recharged zone for these levels is very difficult 19 38 the analysed waters represent two chemical types cl hco3 na and hco3 cl na 19 38 40 they contain specific components such as iodine in the amount from 2 31 to 9 84 mg dm3 and carbon dioxide from 620 to 1170 g dm3 table 1 the content of total dissolved solids varies from 6 03 to 19 25 g dm3 39 2 2 methodology for the evaluation of the mineral water exploitation process mineral water extraction is significantly different from typical production plants where the entire manufacturing process is largely controlled and the source of defects might be easily detected when analysing changes in product quality water exploitation is influenced by natural factors that cannot always be easily identified among them the influence of weather conditions climate geological conditions or defects of the water extraction installation can be distinguished moreover underground water intakes are plants designed from the perspective of decades so the determination of certain rules related to water extraction should also refer to long term changes determining the amount of water extraction must be based on continuous analysis of operating data mainly the water extraction being used a methodology for monitoring the operating parameters and chemistry of mineral waters was proposed enabling the extraction of these waters without deterioration in their quality decreased co2 content the methodology assumes that the amount of mineral water exploitation measured on the surface changes the chemical composition of the water tds or concentrations of specific components exploitation of mineral waters can be seen as a production process that should be controlled no process is perfectly stable due to random and special disturbances the limits within which a process should fit when it is affected by random processes can be defined the process exceeding these limits proves the occurrence of a special disturbance which can be identified and eliminated 11 16 17 random disturbances are factors of relatively little importance usually occurring in large numbers they lead to volatility and must necessarily be identified special disturbances are factors usually systematic that can be detected and identified as causing quality changes or process variability 15 different tools are used to control the quality control of the production process one of them being control charts which are a graphical method of detecting disturbances occurring during the process charts are the sheets on which changes in a selected statistical parameter are applied 42 43 the control chart allows the detection of significant deviations from the target statistical variables such deviations testify to irregularities in the production process ultimately affecting its quality production control gives the opportunity to adjust in the production process in a very short time e g adjustments of the water extraction due to the characteristics of the data the control cards were considered as applicable in the case of the exploitation of mineral waters the data values depends on time and there is a disruption of the exploitation process related to a constant continuous change of the average value of the process the cusum card indicates deviation from the area of satisfactory operation so that corrective actions can be commenced e g change in the amount of water exploited the use of cusum cards is justified when the components of the production process in the analysed case the mineral water deposit are used for a long time or when a change in the average value of data or measurements can be expected the developed long term model of changes in water consumption based on changes in mean values reflects the general trends of changes taking place in the water deposit expressed in increases or decreases in tds or the content of a specific chemical component of mineral water this methodology uses statistical methods to monitor deviations of diagnostic variables from nominal values there is a possibility to detect the causes of random and special disturbances occurring in the production process the methods for optimization of water extraction were developed on the basis of the cumulative sum chart cusum which was first introduced by page 44 it is an analytical tool used in quality control e g control of measurements analyses technological processes the cusum chart is based on the differences between average values taken at regular intervals of the series and the reference value it allows the detection of even small deviations from the average because even small changes in the process lead to a large value of the sum of deviations 45 the value of the cumulative sum is calculated according to the formula 46 1 c i j 1 i x j μ where x j average of n measurements for the j th sample μ reference value i sample number i 1 m if the production process is correct the values of the cumulative sums are in the range upper and lower limits determined based on the value of the standard deviation fig 1 the use of cusum charts for production control has three basic advantages 46 deviations from the target value can be easily detected on the basis of a visual assessment of the control chart distribution of the charts value of the point where significant deviations from the normative value appear can be easily located which is beneficial from the point of view of diagnosing the causes of production defects i e undesirable deviations from the target values control efficiency increases compared to standard control charts e g shewhart charts when using cusum it is possible to detect deviations from the target values at the level of 0 5σ to 2σ where σ stands for standard deviations this means that compared to standard control charts changes can be detected approximately twice as fast or during the same period a methodology consisting of the following steps was proposed for managing the exploitation of natural mineral waters 1 the cumulative sums for co2 content and mineral water extraction were determined by calculating the lower and upper cumulative sums as follows 2 c i m a x 0 x i μ k c i 1 3 c i m i n 0 x i μ k c i 1 where c 0 and c 0 are equal to zero the value of k is usually called the reference value and is related to the shift parameter delta expressed in standard deviation units these cumulative sums are used to discover an increase and a decrease in the process mean shift acceptable process mean 20 2 prepare cusum cards for co2 content and mineral water extraction by drawing points in the chart by choosing for each sample i one of the values c i and c i depending on which of two quantities c i and c i is more extreme 3 normalization of the cumulative sum values for co2 content and mineral water fields mutual comparison of values for both counted variables by performing variable normalization z standardization can be expressed by the following formula 4 z x μ σ where x non standardized variable μ population mean σ population standard deviation as a result of the standardization used the variable obtains the mean expected value of zero and the standard deviation equal to one 4 summary of cumulative sum charts for co2 content and cumulative sums for expenditure from sample number for individual intakes 5 selecting in the charts for individual approaches the areas in which mutually opposite trends in the values of cumulative sums were observed and in which there was a sufficiently high correlation 0 4 0 6 is a significant correlation relationship 0 6 0 8 is a significant correlation relationship 47 when selecting the areas the provisions of the iso 7870 control charts standard were followed these are exactly parts iso 7870 1 2014 part 1 general guidelines 48 iso 7870 2 2013 part 2 shewhart control chart 49 and iso 7870 3 2012 part 3 acceptance control charts 50 according to which the process is disturbed when at least 6 consecutive points are in a downward or upward trend six consecutive points continuously increasing or decreasing the areas where water intake and co2 content show instability with a mutually opposite trend are indicated co2 content upward trend water extraction downward trend 6 determination of a linear equation for selected areas around the intersection point marked with a green area in figs 2 7 for raw data enables the determination of the amount of water abstraction 3 results and discussions for waters exploited from the 7 intakes in accordance with the methodology described above the cumulative sums of carbon dioxide content and water intake were determined data from the period of 20 years 1963 2020 were analysed the 20 year periods were selected to maintain the continuity of analyses year on year basic statistical data on selected parameters of mineral waters from the analysed intakes are presented in table 2 cusum cards were deleted for the determined accumulated sums to determine the areas where mutually opposite trends in the value of cumulative sums were observed compilations of the cusum cards of co2 content and water consumption were prepared figs 2 7 the green hatched fields mark the areas in which the process of exploitation of mineral waters showed disturbances the use of cusum cards to monitor the mineral water exploitation process resulted in the specificity of this tool in studies of the variability of the chemical composition of mineral waters various mathematical and statistical methods are used such as descriptive statistics 6 7 trend analysis 3 8 and control charts 4 9 these methods enable tracing of the variability of individual chemical components these methods allow us to monitor changes in only one parameter cusum cards are used for relatively quick and early recognition of systematic process changes the advantage of the cusum card is the use of accumulated sums as a result cusum cards are much more sensitive to even a slight shift in relation to the reference values thanks to this property it was possible to use them to analyse the exploitation of mineral waters the disadvantage of the cusum card is its time consumption and computational complexity which requires the use of computer techniques cusum cards are used to monitor the process of exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits they are used to detect changes in the concentration of selected ions causing scaling in exploitation wells 51 52 for the indicated areas where disturbances in the mineral water exploitation process were found the relationships between carbon dioxide concentration and water consumption were analysed figs 8 13 for all the intakes there was a correlation between the analysed parameters r from 0 79 to 0 97 at all intakes large fluctuations in the carbon dioxide content were observed by an order of magnitude from approximately 100 to over 1000 mg dm3 in terms 3 4 and 5 co2 fluctuations in the periods analysed in the cusum cards were approximately 9 times in the remaining shots the fluctuations are 2 3 times the temporal and spatial variability of the chemistry of the analysed waters has been the subject of research by other authors 19 38 the analysis of the tds time series and the content of chloride and bicarbonate ions in the years 1963 1997 showed that in waters from all intakes there is a tendency to decrease mineralization over time with relatively small changes in the values of ionic ratios which may indicate the process of sweetening these waters the greatest fluctuations in mineralization and chemical composition were observed in the intakes exploiting the combined horizons of mineralized waters intake 5 as well as horizons poorly insulated from each other or under the diversified influence of atmospheric waters intake 1 and 2 19 these observations are confirmed by studies conducted by the team of rajchel et al 2011 which shows that water from intakes isolated from the influence of filtration waters e g water from intakes 3 5 and 6 is characterized by slight fluctuations however in waters from other intakes a decrease in mineralization has been observed since the 1970s neither study analysed the dependence of changes in chemistry on the expenditure and their authors emphasized the possibility of changes in the chemistry of these waters in the event of intensification of their extraction the relationship between mineralization and the amount of water extraction in the analysed waters in 1990 2010 was analysed by chowaniec and operacz 2013 they found that water extraction in this area is decreasing as is the mineralization of these waters to determine the optimal amounts of water extraction for selected areas linear relations between the carbon dioxide contents and water extraction were obtained table 3 for individual intakes linear equations were determined to which the value of co2 concentration was assigned 250 mg dm3 minimum carbon dioxide content in carbonic acid waters the obtained water intake values should guarantee the maintenance of the gas content at a level exceeding 250 mg dm3 4 conclusions improper exploitation of mineral waters may lead to a decrease in the value of water and even a change in the chemical type of water in the event of large changes in the content of chemical components of main and specific water in industrial practice constant monitoring of the mineral water exploitation process is not conducted the authors proposed a tool in the form of cumus cards for this purpose the analysis showed for all intakes of mineral waters the occurrence of mutual dysregulation of processes co2 content and water intake in a similar time interval the cards made it possible to indicate the relationship between the amount of extraction and the concentration of carbon dioxide in mineral waters determining the relationship between these parameters may enable the control of the volume of production to maintain an appropriate chemical composition of the exploited water this paper proposes linear process control models that can support the selection of the upper limit of mineral water extraction the obtained results confirm the previous literatures assertion the unfavourable influence of excessive water exploitation on their chemical composition the control of the mineral water exploitation process proposed in the article may allow reacting to changes in water chemistry by making corrections in the extraction process however this requires an increase in the frequency of physicochemical tests of waters which were conducted once a year at the analysed intakes the frequency of tests determines the potential length of the forecasting period for the parameters of mineral water exploitation funding this work was supported by the agh university of science and technology research subvention no 16 16 190 779 credit

8763,this research combines tio2 nanopowder photocatalyst tnp with micro nano bubble aeration mnba to enhance the dye degradation of the photocatalytic process treating synthetic dye wastewater the experimental synthetic dyes were indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva and with mnba tnp uva mnba under various initial dye concentrations were evaluated the results showed that given the initial ic and rb5 dye concentrations of 2 μm the degradation efficiency of tnp uva and tnp uva mnba were 100 with higher dye concentrations 4 10 μm the degradation efficiency of tnp uva and tnp uva mnba were between 84 05 98 20 and 90 64 100 the kinetics of the photodegradation reaction of both dyes were described by the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of the photocatalytic process with mnba were 1 44 and 1 66 times higher than those without mnba for ic and rb5 graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved oxygen indigo carmine langmuir hinshelwood photooxidation reactive black 5 1 introduction during the recent decades considerable attempts have been made to improve the pollutant degradation performance of advanced oxidation processes aops the aim is to reduce the investment outlay and operating costs of the wastewater treatment system while still effectively treating the influent containing highly toxic substances and complex structure compounds 1 2 evidence shows that higher oxygen concentrations enhance oxidation reaction in the wastewater treatment system 3 5 specifically micro nano bubble aeration mnba is a technique to deliver oxygen into the wastewater treatment system in order to increase the dissolved oxygen do levels in the system the increased do levels enhance the oxidation reaction and subsequently wastewater treatment efficiency unlike in the conventional fine bubble aerated system the aqueous system aerated with micro nano sized bubbles mnb is supersaturated with dissolved oxygen do 6 7 the advantages of mnb over the conventional system include higher do stability larger surface volume ratio and higher mass transfer efficiency 5 besides the mnba generated ultra fine bubbles could remain in the aqueous system for hours or days i e longer service time subsequently promoting the proliferation of reactive oxygen species ross including singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 8 9 the mnba technology is adopted in various applications such as cleaning and descaling solid surfaces degrading organic pollutants removing micropollutants disinfecting water and improving photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants 10 13 highly colored wastewater from the textile dyeing industry contains dyes of large molecular size and complex structure making it highly biodegradation resistant besides the dye wastewater is highly toxic and can contaminate natural waterways if improperly treated 14 16 as a result several attempts have been made to improve the oxidation capability of aops the aops including the photocatalytic process are shown to be effective in degrading pollutants of various groups 17 19 the degradation effectiveness is nevertheless dependent upon the oxygen mass transfer rate which influences the extent to which the photodegradation reaction proceeds and the types of final products especially when reacting with highly complex structure and or highly degradation resistant compounds 20 as a result the combination of mnba with aop specifically the photocatalytic process is expected to enhance the degradation efficiency of the wastewater treatment system specifically this research proposes a technique that combines tio2 nanopowder photocatalyst tnp with mnba to enhance the dye degradation of the photocatalytic process the experimental synthetic dyes included indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 and the initial dye concentrations were varied between 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva and with mnba tnp uva mnba were compared the changes in the molecular structure of degraded dyes into various intermediate products were monitored throughout the experiment besides the langmuir hinshelwood lh kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanisms of tnp and mnba were also investigated the novelty of this research lies in the use of mnba in combination with tnp and uva to effectively enhance the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic oxidation process 2 experimental setup 2 1 materials in this research tnp was purchased from us research nanomaterials inc code us3490 mnba was generated by the high voltage plasma rmutt mnb generator 12 kvp a locally made machine with the maximum water flow rate of 0 1 l min 1 and pressure of 200 270 kpa fig 1 2 2 characterization of tnp and mnba the morphology and particle size of tnp were determined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 1400 tem instrument and the elemental composition analysis was carried out by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf bruker model s8 tiger the pore size distribution and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area were obtained from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms by the bet instrument belsorpmax bel japan inc meanwhile the particle size size distribution and concentration of mnb in the aqueous system was measured by nanosight ns300 malvern panalytical japan the average do concentration in the aqueous system was measured by a dissolved oxygen meter do 110 hand held eutech instruments 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of dye the enhanced degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with mnba tnp mnba with uva irradiation was measured by dye decolorization and gradation into intermediate products in batch reactor a 2 000 ml beaker was used as the photoreactor reaction chamber irradiated with uva light given the average light intensity of 1 580 μw cm 2 fig 2 a uv light meter uv 340 lutron electronic enterprise co ltd was used to measure the average light intensity the ic and rb5 synthetic dye wastewater were separately prepared and the initial dye concentrations were varied between 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm the photoreactor was independently filled with 1 000 ml of ic and rb5 synthetic dye wastewater before applying 0 1 g tnp and mnba of 0 1 l min 1 flow rate prior to the experiment samples were taken for measurement of initial dye concentrations before exposure to the uva light the dye concentrations were periodically measured throughout the 90 min experiment due to the water loss through evaporation of approximately 5 of the total volume of water in the photoreactor the evaporated water was compensated by adding an equal amount of water to the photoreactor before the collection of samples the dye concentrations were analyzed by a spectrophotometer libra s12 visible and uv and the toxic intermediate products by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms model gc 6890 n agilent with agilent g1888 headspace sampler as the injection source agilent hp 5ms as the capillary column and msd 5973 n ionsource ei single quat as the detector to investigate the dye degradation enhancement of the photocatalytic process with mnba i e tnp uva mnba this research compares the ic and rb5 dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with mnba with those of the photocatalytic system without mnba tnp uva under variable initial dye concentrations the kinetics were subsequently determined based on the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with and without mnba table 1 tabulates the experimental conditions carried out in this research and there are seven experimental conditions 3 results and discussions 3 1 tnp and mnba characterization the xrd results of tnp fig 3 were from the website of the manufacturer of the nanoparticles us research nanomaterials inc with the anatase crystalline phase of 99 5 and particle size of 10 25 nm the tem images indicate that the morphology of tnp is of high quality lattice fringes without distortion fig 4 with the average particle diameter of 15 20 nm table 2 tabulates the xrf and bet analysis results of tnp the bet surface area of tnp was determined by the n2 adsorption desorption of tnp fig 5 shows the characteristics of mnb in the aqueous system in this research the mnbs were generated by circulating water in the rmutt mnb generator as shown in fig 5 the majority of mnb bubbles were smaller than 100 nm with the size distribution between 10 and 579 nm the concentration in the aqueous system of 106 bubbles ml 1 and the average do concentration of 25 8 mg l 1 3 2 photocatalytic activity test the dye degradation efficiency under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba at termination i e after 90 min given the initial dye concentrations of 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm were 99 32 100 00 and 92 96 100 00 for ic and rb5 respectively under experimental condition 2 tnp uva the ic and rb5 dye degradation efficiency were 86 73 100 00 and 84 05 100 00 respectively table 3 compares the ic and rb5 dye degradation performance under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba and 2 tnp uva and the results show that mnba significantly increased the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process especially for wastewater containing high initial dye concentrations as shown in fig 5 under experimental conditions 3 tnp mnba without uva irradiation and 4 uva mnba without tnp there was no photocatalytic activity due to the absence of photocatalyst i e tnp or uva light source the results showed that the dye adsorption of tnp were very low with 18 97 and 26 00 for ic and rb5 respectively at the initial concentration of 2 μm meanwhile experimental conditions 5 uva 6 mnba and 7 tnp were operationally unsuitable for dye degradation due to low degradation efficiency fig 5 as shown in table 3 and fig 6 with low initial dye concentrations the ic and rb5 dye degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva were operationally satisfactory essentially the initial dye concentration c 0 is the determinant of the dye degradation efficiency specifically higher initial dye concentrations obscure the transmission of light energy onto the surface of the active site of photocatalyst 21 22 besides higher dye concentrations reduce the generation of oh and o2 on the reactive catalyst surface 23 26 the mnba enhanced the dye degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic process i e tnp uva mnba especially for higher initial ic and rb5 dye concentrations besides mnba shortened the dye degradation time of the treatment system as evidenced by the rapid degradation of ic and rb5 during the first 5 min through to 30 min fig 7 the experimental results showed that mnba significantly improve the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process i e tnp uva mnba the oxygen molecules on tnp act as electron acceptors to form o2 which traps photoelectrons and reduces electron hole recombination 13 27 29 the mnba enhanced the photocatalytic process whereby o2 was first formed through the reduction reaction between e cb and o2 as shown in eq 1 the intermediate product o2 then undergoes a continuous chain reaction as shown in eqs 2 5 resulting in the following ross o2 h2o2 and oh 30 32 1 e cb o2 o2 2 o2 h ho2 3 2 ho2 h2o2 o2 4 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 5 e cb h2o2 oh oh 6 h2o2 hv 2 ho where e cb is the electron in the conduction band cb and hv is the photon energy under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba the micro and nano sized air bubbles mnb were constantly generated throughout the experiment besides the size of mnb is positively correlated with the speed of mnb delivered into the system the smaller mnb are more preferable as they can persist in the water for a much longer time resulting in higher do levels 33 34 in addition higher do levels are also conducive to the formation and abundance of ross such as 1o2 h2o2 oh and o2 specifically the formation of the reactive free radicals is attributable to increasing do levels in the photocatalytic degradation process 9 35 36 the photocatalytic degradation process promoted oxidation as evidenced by the rapid degradation of both dyes during the first 5 min of the photocatalytic reaction afterward the dye degradation rates gradually decreased as the incompletely degraded dyes in the form of dissolved organic matters dom started to build up and accumulate on the surface of the photocatalyst 37 38 the photocatalytic process is normally capable of oxidizing organic compounds to the most stable oxidation state and eventually to co2 and h2o in this research although the reaction was incomplete the transformation of dyes into simpler structure by products indicated that the ross under high do conditions induced the cleavage mechanism for aromatic rings in the dye structure and destroyed the chromophore causing the color to fade rapidly and the toxicity of the reaction products to decrease 39 40 figs 8 and 9 show the complex structure and chromophore of ic and rb5 and their respective transformation during the photocatalytic degradation the transformation patterns of ic and rb5 from gc ms showed that the complex structure and chromophore of ic and rb5 were degraded into various products in 41 43 the photocatalytic process without mnb has been reported to break up the bonds at the junctions between fragile molecular structures or attack the bonds that are highly responsive to the ross resulting in the intermediate products whose the molecular complexity remained relatively unchanged the dye molecules were mainly attacked by hole in valence band h vb and ross in the photocatalytic process inducing the oxidation of ring opening reactions which resulted in the transformation of complex structure products into less complex structure products 44 45 in this current research mnba accelerated the dye degradation in the photocatalytic process as evidenced by the rapid dye removal during the first 5 min of the experiment both the fragile and complex molecular structures especially the aromatic ring structures were destroyed resulting in reduced molecular complexity and molecular size in addition differences in the structure complexity and size of the molecules of both dyes also affected the degradation efficiency rb5 has a larger molecular size and more complex chemical structure than ic resulting in the former s lower degradation efficiency

8763,this research combines tio2 nanopowder photocatalyst tnp with micro nano bubble aeration mnba to enhance the dye degradation of the photocatalytic process treating synthetic dye wastewater the experimental synthetic dyes were indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva and with mnba tnp uva mnba under various initial dye concentrations were evaluated the results showed that given the initial ic and rb5 dye concentrations of 2 μm the degradation efficiency of tnp uva and tnp uva mnba were 100 with higher dye concentrations 4 10 μm the degradation efficiency of tnp uva and tnp uva mnba were between 84 05 98 20 and 90 64 100 the kinetics of the photodegradation reaction of both dyes were described by the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of the photocatalytic process with mnba were 1 44 and 1 66 times higher than those without mnba for ic and rb5 graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved oxygen indigo carmine langmuir hinshelwood photooxidation reactive black 5 1 introduction during the recent decades considerable attempts have been made to improve the pollutant degradation performance of advanced oxidation processes aops the aim is to reduce the investment outlay and operating costs of the wastewater treatment system while still effectively treating the influent containing highly toxic substances and complex structure compounds 1 2 evidence shows that higher oxygen concentrations enhance oxidation reaction in the wastewater treatment system 3 5 specifically micro nano bubble aeration mnba is a technique to deliver oxygen into the wastewater treatment system in order to increase the dissolved oxygen do levels in the system the increased do levels enhance the oxidation reaction and subsequently wastewater treatment efficiency unlike in the conventional fine bubble aerated system the aqueous system aerated with micro nano sized bubbles mnb is supersaturated with dissolved oxygen do 6 7 the advantages of mnb over the conventional system include higher do stability larger surface volume ratio and higher mass transfer efficiency 5 besides the mnba generated ultra fine bubbles could remain in the aqueous system for hours or days i e longer service time subsequently promoting the proliferation of reactive oxygen species ross including singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 8 9 the mnba technology is adopted in various applications such as cleaning and descaling solid surfaces degrading organic pollutants removing micropollutants disinfecting water and improving photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants 10 13 highly colored wastewater from the textile dyeing industry contains dyes of large molecular size and complex structure making it highly biodegradation resistant besides the dye wastewater is highly toxic and can contaminate natural waterways if improperly treated 14 16 as a result several attempts have been made to improve the oxidation capability of aops the aops including the photocatalytic process are shown to be effective in degrading pollutants of various groups 17 19 the degradation effectiveness is nevertheless dependent upon the oxygen mass transfer rate which influences the extent to which the photodegradation reaction proceeds and the types of final products especially when reacting with highly complex structure and or highly degradation resistant compounds 20 as a result the combination of mnba with aop specifically the photocatalytic process is expected to enhance the degradation efficiency of the wastewater treatment system specifically this research proposes a technique that combines tio2 nanopowder photocatalyst tnp with mnba to enhance the dye degradation of the photocatalytic process the experimental synthetic dyes included indigo carmine ic and reactive black 5 rb5 and the initial dye concentrations were varied between 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva and with mnba tnp uva mnba were compared the changes in the molecular structure of degraded dyes into various intermediate products were monitored throughout the experiment besides the langmuir hinshelwood lh kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction mechanisms of tnp and mnba were also investigated the novelty of this research lies in the use of mnba in combination with tnp and uva to effectively enhance the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic oxidation process 2 experimental setup 2 1 materials in this research tnp was purchased from us research nanomaterials inc code us3490 mnba was generated by the high voltage plasma rmutt mnb generator 12 kvp a locally made machine with the maximum water flow rate of 0 1 l min 1 and pressure of 200 270 kpa fig 1 2 2 characterization of tnp and mnba the morphology and particle size of tnp were determined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 1400 tem instrument and the elemental composition analysis was carried out by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf bruker model s8 tiger the pore size distribution and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area were obtained from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms by the bet instrument belsorpmax bel japan inc meanwhile the particle size size distribution and concentration of mnb in the aqueous system was measured by nanosight ns300 malvern panalytical japan the average do concentration in the aqueous system was measured by a dissolved oxygen meter do 110 hand held eutech instruments 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of dye the enhanced degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with mnba tnp mnba with uva irradiation was measured by dye decolorization and gradation into intermediate products in batch reactor a 2 000 ml beaker was used as the photoreactor reaction chamber irradiated with uva light given the average light intensity of 1 580 μw cm 2 fig 2 a uv light meter uv 340 lutron electronic enterprise co ltd was used to measure the average light intensity the ic and rb5 synthetic dye wastewater were separately prepared and the initial dye concentrations were varied between 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm the photoreactor was independently filled with 1 000 ml of ic and rb5 synthetic dye wastewater before applying 0 1 g tnp and mnba of 0 1 l min 1 flow rate prior to the experiment samples were taken for measurement of initial dye concentrations before exposure to the uva light the dye concentrations were periodically measured throughout the 90 min experiment due to the water loss through evaporation of approximately 5 of the total volume of water in the photoreactor the evaporated water was compensated by adding an equal amount of water to the photoreactor before the collection of samples the dye concentrations were analyzed by a spectrophotometer libra s12 visible and uv and the toxic intermediate products by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms model gc 6890 n agilent with agilent g1888 headspace sampler as the injection source agilent hp 5ms as the capillary column and msd 5973 n ionsource ei single quat as the detector to investigate the dye degradation enhancement of the photocatalytic process with mnba i e tnp uva mnba this research compares the ic and rb5 dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with mnba with those of the photocatalytic system without mnba tnp uva under variable initial dye concentrations the kinetics were subsequently determined based on the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process with and without mnba table 1 tabulates the experimental conditions carried out in this research and there are seven experimental conditions 3 results and discussions 3 1 tnp and mnba characterization the xrd results of tnp fig 3 were from the website of the manufacturer of the nanoparticles us research nanomaterials inc with the anatase crystalline phase of 99 5 and particle size of 10 25 nm the tem images indicate that the morphology of tnp is of high quality lattice fringes without distortion fig 4 with the average particle diameter of 15 20 nm table 2 tabulates the xrf and bet analysis results of tnp the bet surface area of tnp was determined by the n2 adsorption desorption of tnp fig 5 shows the characteristics of mnb in the aqueous system in this research the mnbs were generated by circulating water in the rmutt mnb generator as shown in fig 5 the majority of mnb bubbles were smaller than 100 nm with the size distribution between 10 and 579 nm the concentration in the aqueous system of 106 bubbles ml 1 and the average do concentration of 25 8 mg l 1 3 2 photocatalytic activity test the dye degradation efficiency under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba at termination i e after 90 min given the initial dye concentrations of 2 4 6 8 and 10 μm were 99 32 100 00 and 92 96 100 00 for ic and rb5 respectively under experimental condition 2 tnp uva the ic and rb5 dye degradation efficiency were 86 73 100 00 and 84 05 100 00 respectively table 3 compares the ic and rb5 dye degradation performance under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba and 2 tnp uva and the results show that mnba significantly increased the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process especially for wastewater containing high initial dye concentrations as shown in fig 5 under experimental conditions 3 tnp mnba without uva irradiation and 4 uva mnba without tnp there was no photocatalytic activity due to the absence of photocatalyst i e tnp or uva light source the results showed that the dye adsorption of tnp were very low with 18 97 and 26 00 for ic and rb5 respectively at the initial concentration of 2 μm meanwhile experimental conditions 5 uva 6 mnba and 7 tnp were operationally unsuitable for dye degradation due to low degradation efficiency fig 5 as shown in table 3 and fig 6 with low initial dye concentrations the ic and rb5 dye degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic process without mnba tnp uva were operationally satisfactory essentially the initial dye concentration c 0 is the determinant of the dye degradation efficiency specifically higher initial dye concentrations obscure the transmission of light energy onto the surface of the active site of photocatalyst 21 22 besides higher dye concentrations reduce the generation of oh and o2 on the reactive catalyst surface 23 26 the mnba enhanced the dye degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic process i e tnp uva mnba especially for higher initial ic and rb5 dye concentrations besides mnba shortened the dye degradation time of the treatment system as evidenced by the rapid degradation of ic and rb5 during the first 5 min through to 30 min fig 7 the experimental results showed that mnba significantly improve the dye degradation performance of the photocatalytic process i e tnp uva mnba the oxygen molecules on tnp act as electron acceptors to form o2 which traps photoelectrons and reduces electron hole recombination 13 27 29 the mnba enhanced the photocatalytic process whereby o2 was first formed through the reduction reaction between e cb and o2 as shown in eq 1 the intermediate product o2 then undergoes a continuous chain reaction as shown in eqs 2 5 resulting in the following ross o2 h2o2 and oh 30 32 1 e cb o2 o2 2 o2 h ho2 3 2 ho2 h2o2 o2 4 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 5 e cb h2o2 oh oh 6 h2o2 hv 2 ho where e cb is the electron in the conduction band cb and hv is the photon energy under experimental condition 1 tnp uva mnba the micro and nano sized air bubbles mnb were constantly generated throughout the experiment besides the size of mnb is positively correlated with the speed of mnb delivered into the system the smaller mnb are more preferable as they can persist in the water for a much longer time resulting in higher do levels 33 34 in addition higher do levels are also conducive to the formation and abundance of ross such as 1o2 h2o2 oh and o2 specifically the formation of the reactive free radicals is attributable to increasing do levels in the photocatalytic degradation process 9 35 36 the photocatalytic degradation process promoted oxidation as evidenced by the rapid degradation of both dyes during the first 5 min of the photocatalytic reaction afterward the dye degradation rates gradually decreased as the incompletely degraded dyes in the form of dissolved organic matters dom started to build up and accumulate on the surface of the photocatalyst 37 38 the photocatalytic process is normally capable of oxidizing organic compounds to the most stable oxidation state and eventually to co2 and h2o in this research although the reaction was incomplete the transformation of dyes into simpler structure by products indicated that the ross under high do conditions induced the cleavage mechanism for aromatic rings in the dye structure and destroyed the chromophore causing the color to fade rapidly and the toxicity of the reaction products to decrease 39 40 figs 8 and 9 show the complex structure and chromophore of ic and rb5 and their respective transformation during the photocatalytic degradation the transformation patterns of ic and rb5 from gc ms showed that the complex structure and chromophore of ic and rb5 were degraded into various products in 41 43 the photocatalytic process without mnb has been reported to break up the bonds at the junctions between fragile molecular structures or attack the bonds that are highly responsive to the ross resulting in the intermediate products whose the molecular complexity remained relatively unchanged the dye molecules were mainly attacked by hole in valence band h vb and ross in the photocatalytic process inducing the oxidation of ring opening reactions which resulted in the transformation of complex structure products into less complex structure products 44 45 in this current research mnba accelerated the dye degradation in the photocatalytic process as evidenced by the rapid dye removal during the first 5 min of the experiment both the fragile and complex molecular structures especially the aromatic ring structures were destroyed resulting in reduced molecular complexity and molecular size in addition differences in the structure complexity and size of the molecules of both dyes also affected the degradation efficiency rb5 has a larger molecular size and more complex chemical structure than ic resulting in the former s lower degradation efficiency 18 46 47 in this research the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model lh model was used to describe the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic process which can be mathematically expressed as 48 49 7 r 0

8764,dyes are pollutants widely used in several industries that end up dumped as wastewater contributing to water pollution in the scope of improving water quality liquid liquid extraction is a separation technique widely used to remove pollutants from water due to the possibility of recovering all the involved agents in this work deep eutectic solvents dess based on mixtures of thymol with menthol coumarin octanoic acid and decanoic acid were applied as extraction agents to remove congo red from water among all the studied solvents those formed by thymol with organic acids showed extraction efficiencies higher than 90 for low initial concentrations of congo red using 1 5 v v des water proportion and 1 h of stirring time as extraction parameters the best results were achieved using thymol octanoic acid 1 1 solvent furthermore at the end of the process each reagent can be reused des reusability was checked for three extraction cycles keeping stable graphical abstract image 1 keywords azo dye deep eutectic solvent congo red liquid liquid extraction water remediation 1 introduction in 2018 european union eu along with china were in the top three of the leading exporter and importer of raw textile materials and finished textile goods in the world and their exports and imports have been growing year by year the textile sector is one of the most pollutant industries due to the production of large amount of waste as well as the use of high volumes of water that leads to dump wastewater which contain a different kind of pollutants metals and dyes 1 3 pollutant substances that are present in textile effluents produce an increase in the chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod in addition to a high concentration of total suspended solids total dissolved solids extreme values of ph and colour this colour is given by the presence of dyes both natural and synthetic which are used in textile industries to dying clothes 4 dye concentration in textile wastewater varies over a wide range of values some literature reported values in the range of 10 800 mg l 1 2 dyes are organic compounds that contain a chromophore group in their structure giving a visible colour to different products as textiles plastics leather paper or food the colour is produced due to the electronic transitions between two energetic states when a radiation quantum is absorbed and it depends on the number of double bonds that are present in the structure 5 6 the presence of this colour in water produce several drawbacks for aquatic life blocking the penetration of light and therefore hampering the photosynthetic activity it is known that some dyes are also carcinogenic mutagenic and recalcitrant substances 4 7 in 2017 benkhaya et al 8 indicated that around 5000 tons per year of dyes are discharged in the environment azo dyes are one of the most widely used artificial dyes in the textile industry representing the 70 of all synthetic used dyes they present high solubility in water and produce bright and high intensity colours compared with other dye families 8 the chromophore groups in azo dye family are nn azo group cc and co 9 10 this azo group form hydrogen bonds making it more difficult to be removed from water and causing their accumulation in the environment 11 with the aim of reducing the impact on water quality caused by the presence of colorants different techniques can be used to remove dyes from textile wastewater these techniques are classified in three groups physical physicochemical and biological but they are commonly used together 12 some methods such as degradation or membrane separation were successfully applied for reducing the presence of dye pollutants in textile industrial wastewater 13 18 as well as the use of adsorbents for example carbon nanotube and coal fly ash are adsorptive material developed for the treatment of aqueous streams 19 23 liquid liquid extraction is an efficient separation technique widely used for the extraction of pollutant substances from water the main advantage is that the extracted substance as well as the extraction solvent can be recovered 24 25 in these technique volatile organic compounds vocs are usually used as extraction solvents however their low vapour pressure and high toxicity make necessary to replace them by safer ones in the last years ionic liquids ils were presented as good replacement solvents for vocs with high extraction efficiencies when they were used to remove pollutant substance and or high value added compounds 26 33 some research works applied ils with the purpose of extracting dyes from water chen et al 10 used quaternary ammonium based ils for the removal of methyl orange mo and methylene blue mb from water obtaining extraction yields around 95 for mo while for mb extraction results did not exceed 64 in another work kermanioryani et al 31 improved mb extraction efficiencies using ils based on imidazolium cation the better results reached with the il 1 hexyl 2 phenyl imidazolium bis trifluoromethanesulfonyl amide hphim ntf2 were attributed to the presence of an aromatic ring in the cation structure that favoured ils dye π π interactions furthermore among the advantages of ils there is the possibility of functionalizing them in order to design novel ils with tuneable characteristics for specific applications 34 35 nevertheless the high cost and toxic properties for the environment that present some ils lead to the development of other extraction solvents with more desirable characteristics many studies showed that deep eutectic solvents dess could be the substitution substances for ils 36 dess are the resulting new substances from the combination of two or more compounds where the starting compounds are hydrogen bond donor hbd and hydrogen bond acceptor hba that mixed in specific molar ratios lead to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions between started compounds 36 37 due to these new created interactions these obtained solvents present a decrease in their melting temperature lower than the starting reagents and they keep in liquid state in a wide range of temperature 38 39 although hydrophobic dess were satisfactorily applied for the removal of some pollutants from water by liquid liquid extraction 40 42 to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of research in the field of dyes removal one study was found in the literature published in 2018 by kaur et al 43 in this work liquid liquid micro extraction llme technique was developed to remove eriochrome black t ebt azo dye from aqueous solutions using glycolic acid and choline chloride based des in this work nine different solvents based on menthol coumarin thymol octanoic acid and decanoic acid were prepared in order to obtain stable hydrophobic dess to remove one azo dye congo red cr from aqueous samples the starting compounds were chosen with the aim of enhancing interactions between extraction solvents and dye through the establishment of hydrogen bonds 44 moreover based on results obtained from kermanioryani et al 31 thymol and coumarin were selected due to their aromatic nature in the effort of removing cr by π π interactions between the aromatic rings present in both structures solvents and dye structures of starting compounds used to obtain the extraction solvents as well as cr structure are presented in fig 1 although the formed solvents are hydrophobic liquid liquid equilibrium lle of des water mixtures was performed to check their behaviour in water this study is done with the aim of knowing their suitability to use them in aqueous systems after that ternary systems extraction solvent cr water at 298 15 k and atmospheric pressure were studied in order to obtain information about the extraction efficiencies of the studied solvents 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemical reagents water used in this work to prepare aqueous samples was of milli q quality chemical name supplier purity and cas number of chemicals used in this work are indicated in table 1 2 2 formation of dess the nine dess used in this work were formed using the heating method following the bibliography 33 38 45 the starting compounds were added in a specific molar ratio by weighing using a mettler toledo excellent plus xp205 analytical balance which uncertainty is 3 10 4 g then they were stirred and heated at 343 15 k until a homogeneous liquid was obtained after their preparation dess were left 48 h prior to their use in order to check their stability these formed solvents were thymol menthol 1 1 thymol menthol 1 2 thymol coumarin 1 1 thymol coumarin 2 1 thymol octanoic acid 1 1 thymol octanoic acid 2 1 thymol decanoic acid 1 1 thymol decanoic acid 2 1 and thymol decanoic acid 3 1 des names prepared in this work with the molar ratios used and their abbreviation are summarized in table 2 the thermal behaviour of dess was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry dsc technique it was used a dsc q 1000 ta instruments and the measurements were carried out in hermetic aluminium capsules samples were heated from 193 15 k to 343 15 k with a rate of 10 k min 1 under inert atmosphere 50 ml min 1 of n2 the standard uncertainty for temperature measurements is 1 k 2 3 study of dess behaviour in water before using these solvents as extraction agents it is necessary to know their behaviour in water to develop this study binary mixtures of 50 v v des water were prepared in glass cells and these mixtures were stirred for 8 h at controlled temperature in order to allow the correct contact between both phases then they were left settling overnight this experimental procedure was carried out in a thermostatic bath with a poly science digital temperature controller 0 01 k coupled to a phoenix instrument rsm 03 0 1 k magnetic stirrer after this process water rich phases were analysed by 1h nmr at 400 mhz using a bruker dpx 400 nmr in order to check dess stability in water furthermore water content of des rich phases was measured with the aim of analysing des hydrophobicity using a mettler toledo c20 coulometric kf titrator 2 4 extraction procedure ternary mixtures of extraction solvent cr water were prepared by weighing in an analytical balance these samples were prepared in flask cells covered with silicon caps and they were placed for 1 h in a thermostatic bath at 298 15 k they were stirred in order to allow the correct contact between both phases after this time immiscible phases were separated by using a hettich universal 320 centrifuge finally a sample of aqueous phase was separated and analysed by uv vis spectrophotometry using jasco spectrophotometer v 750 with an uncertainty of 0 002 abs from 0 to 0 5 abs and 0 003 abs from 0 5 to 1 abs respectively before this analysis a calibration curve of cr at the maximum absorbance of the dye 498 nm was obtained the extraction capability was calculated by the difference between the initial concentration ci and the final concentration that remains in the aqueous phase after the extraction procedure cf following equation 1 1 e c i c f c i 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dess the prepared dess were obtained as it was previously described and they were left 48 h in order to ensure their stability after this time it was observed that thy c8 2 1 and thy c10 3 1 were not stable because a solid appeared within the liquid solution excluding their use as extraction agents the other seven solvents remained stable and their thermal behaviour was analysed by dsc from melting and glass transition temperatures of pure compounds and prepared dess listed in table si 1 it is possible to conclude that all des show lower melting points than the starting compounds consequently it can be confirmed the formation of seven dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 thy cum 2 1 thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 that were used along this work 3 2 study of stability and hydrophobicity the stability of the formed solvents in water as well as their hydrophobicity was studied following the methodology explained in experimental procedure section stability of these solvents is confirmed with the resulting 1h nmr spectra that can be found in fig si 1 where one water phase nmr spectrum is shown as example for all results only one peak corresponding to water signal is depicted therefore the seven studied dess are stable in water and can be used as extraction agents after being formed water content of pure solvents as well as hydrated solvents were measured in order to obtain hydrated dess mixtures of 50 v v with water were stirred and then separated by centrifugation a comparison of water content between pure and hydrated solvents is listed in table 3 it is possible to observe that pure solvents present low amount of water although des based on carboxylic acids show higher water content than the others regarding to hydrated solvents all of them gain a significant amount of water observing the same behaviour for those based on carboxylic acids similar results were determined by van osch et al 38 for the dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 and thy cum 2 1 in the same way hydrophobicity of pure and hydrated solvents at different temperatures was studied for that purpose the amount of water present in des rich phases after lle with water from 293 15 k to 343 15 k was measured with the aim of quantifying the increase of water content experimental data proved that while water content of pure dess rose steadily as temperature increases water content of previously hydrated dess stayed constant at all studied temperatures table si 2 and si 3 respectively consequently hydrated dess were chosen as extraction agents within this work in order to work with them in stable conditions and assure that water will not interfere in the extraction process 3 3 liquid liquid extraction ternary mixtures of extraction solvent cr water were prepared in order to compare the extraction capability of dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 thy cum 2 1 thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 the influence of the volume ratio of des water phase 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 v v and the stirring time 15 30 60 and 90 min in the extraction procedure were studied in order to reduce solvent consumption and operation time moreover the molar proportion of starting compounds of each dess and the initial concentration of cr in water solutions that influence the extraction capability are discussed in the next sections 3 3 1 study of the influence des water phases ratio with the aim of using the least amount of extraction solvent a study of des rich phase water rich phase ratio was carried out using thy c10 1 1 as extraction solvent to remove different initial concentrations of cr the studied ratios were 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 v v and the results are presented in fig 2 and table si 4 as it is possible to observe in the graph ratios 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 achieve comparable extraction efficiencies higher than 90 at low initial concentrations of cr however when ratios 1 10 and 1 20 were used a significant decrease in extraction yields was observed even though ratio 1 1 reach better results at high initial concentrations than the other used ratios ratio 1 5 was selected as the extraction proportion in this work this choice allows us to reduce the solvent consumption keeping high extraction percentage at low initial concentrations moreover for those initial concentrations which these high percentages are not reached maybe due to the saturation of the extraction solvent 46 adding more extraction cycles could be useful to increase extraction yields obtaining similar results comparable to ratio 1 1 this issue will be discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 2 study of the influence of stirring time the contact time between des and water phases is a key parameter in liquid liquid separation processes once stablished the volume ratio parameter of 1 5 v v of des water phases stirring times of 15 30 60 and 90 min were analysed for different initial concentrations of cr using thy c10 1 1 from the experimental results showed in fig 3 data listed in table si 5 it is possible to observe an increase in the extraction efficiency while stirring time rises from 15 to 60 min however there are no clear differences between 60 and 90 min of phase contact at any initial concentration studied in this work note that the reduction of the extraction efficiency at high initial concentrations is due to the saturation of the extraction agent as it was explained in the previous section hence 60 min of stirring time was selected as optimum parameter for extraction of cr 3 3 3 application of dess for the extraction of cr liquid liquid extraction procedure was applied for the extraction of cr using all hydrated dess presented in this work however extraction procedures carried out with thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 and thy cum 2 1 were not favourable remaining the initial concentration of dye in the aqueous phase experimental data obtained for the extraction of different initial concentrations of cr from 50 to 500 mg l 1 from water are shown in fig 4 and table si 6 the results are given in terms of extraction capability of those solvents that were successfully applied thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 it can be observed from the graph that all solvents used lead to a high extraction efficiency process especially at low initial concentrations reaching 90 extraction yields for the three agents used both dess thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 achieved similar results although the best were found for thy c8 1 1 solvent when comparing the results obtained with thy c8 1 1 and thy c10 1 1 the extraction efficiency decreases as alkyl chain increases this behaviour could be attributed to the disruption of π π interactions in between des and cr similar results were observed by kermanioryani et al 31 regarding the influence of the initial concentration of cr on the extraction efficiencies a deep decrease on the percentage is noticed for all the studied solvents at high initial concentrations this behaviour can be explained by the saturation of extraction agents 46 in order to confirm the saturation of the solvent the number of extraction steps needed to obtain a complete extraction was studied for the highest initial concentration of cr 500 mg l 1 using thy c10 1 1 as extraction solvent after the first extraction step a recovery of 46 of cr was achieved with a final concentration about 315 mg l 1 of cr in aqueous phase then the resulting aqueous phase was subjected to a second extraction step obtaining extraction yields of 77 remaining in aqueous phase 52 mg l 1 of cr in the same way a third extraction step was determined reaching the total removal of cr from water 99 5 of extraction yield the influence of the molar proportion used to obtain the studied dess into the extraction efficiency was assessed fig 5 the increase of thymol proportion between des thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 involve a slightly decrease in the extraction yield for low concentration being more remarkable this difference at high concentrations 3 4 recovery process after the whole procedure stirring and centrifugation steps there were clearly observed two immiscible phases des rich phase and water rich phase and an interphase between them in systems formed by thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 this behaviour could be caused by the surfactant action of the sulfonate groups of cr under the presence of des that promotes h type aggregation of cr molecules 47 48 at low initial concentrations under 100 mg l 1 the immiscible phases are colourless and a colour interphase that contains the dye become visible for higher initial concentrations it is observed the same behaviour but some colour is appreciated in the aqueous phase due to the solvent saturation in this case more extraction cycles improve the removal of cr from water acquiring a clear water phase which could be discharged as it was shown in section 3 3 3 the obtained interphase was dried and then redissolved in water resulting in a red coloured solution that proves the presence of cr the absence of cr in both water and des phases was confirmed by 1h nmr fig si 2 a and b belong to thy c10 1 1 pure and the des rich phase spectrum after recovery process where it can be observed the same signal peaks ensuring the recovery of the solvent in the same way fig si 3 guarantee that the water obtained after the extraction could be dischargeable physical properties and 1h nmr of all studied dess after three extraction cycles were determined in order to confirm the stability of the solvents table si 7 si 8 and si 9 evidence that no significant differences were found for density and viscosity values of pure and reused dess moreover no clear differences in 1h nmr spectra before and after their reuse ensure the stability of each solvent fig si 4 si 5 and si 6 with the aim of checking the extraction capability of the solvents three extraction cycles using recovered des were completed and the extraction percentages achieved in each cycle were the following 96 7 82 9 and 82 2 using thy c10 1 1 97 1 96 5 and 96 7 using thy c10 2 1 and 98 9 96 8 and 96 4 using thy c8 1 1 for the first second and third cycle respectively hence it is confirmed the reusability of all studied solvents for at least 3 extraction cycles to sum up in this work is not only described the extraction procedure of a pollutant from water but also the recovery of this dye and the reagents involved in the process 4 conclusions in this work a whole liquid liquid extraction procedure for the removal of cr from textile wastewater was reported firstly nine extraction solvents were prepared and dsc analysis corroborated that seven of them were correctly formed thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 thy cum 2 1 thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 their behaviour in water was studied with the aim of applying them for liquid liquid extraction in aqueous systems 1h nmr spectra showed that solubility of all these hydrophobic solvents in water is negligible since there was no signal of solvent in aqueous phases the study of the solubility of water in the selected solvents pure and hydrated demonstrated that hydrated ones allow to work in stable conditions with the aim of using the less amount of extraction solvent reaching high extraction efficiencies a study of ratio des water proportion v v was carried out results showed that ratio 1 5 keeps similar extraction yields than 1 1 and 1 3 ratios at low initial concentrations consequently the dess consumption was satisfactorily reduced moreover a study of the influence of the stirring time in the extraction efficiency of cr was carried out elucidating that high yields are achieved after 60 min of contact between immiscible phases the seven obtained solvents were applied for the extraction of cr from aqueous samples four of them were not able to extract cr experimental data reported in this work demonstrate that thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 can be used as extraction agents to remove the studied azo dye from water getting the better results with thy c8 1 1 moreover the results indicated that at high initial concentrations of cr the extraction agents become saturated but three extraction cycles are enough for total dye removal it is also confirmed the influence of molar proportion of the des components in the extraction yields increasing as thymol proportion decreases in the solvent in this work there were reached extraction efficiencies for cr up to 98 allowing the recovery of the dye and water and des could be dischargeable and reused respectively without further treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

8764,dyes are pollutants widely used in several industries that end up dumped as wastewater contributing to water pollution in the scope of improving water quality liquid liquid extraction is a separation technique widely used to remove pollutants from water due to the possibility of recovering all the involved agents in this work deep eutectic solvents dess based on mixtures of thymol with menthol coumarin octanoic acid and decanoic acid were applied as extraction agents to remove congo red from water among all the studied solvents those formed by thymol with organic acids showed extraction efficiencies higher than 90 for low initial concentrations of congo red using 1 5 v v des water proportion and 1 h of stirring time as extraction parameters the best results were achieved using thymol octanoic acid 1 1 solvent furthermore at the end of the process each reagent can be reused des reusability was checked for three extraction cycles keeping stable graphical abstract image 1 keywords azo dye deep eutectic solvent congo red liquid liquid extraction water remediation 1 introduction in 2018 european union eu along with china were in the top three of the leading exporter and importer of raw textile materials and finished textile goods in the world and their exports and imports have been growing year by year the textile sector is one of the most pollutant industries due to the production of large amount of waste as well as the use of high volumes of water that leads to dump wastewater which contain a different kind of pollutants metals and dyes 1 3 pollutant substances that are present in textile effluents produce an increase in the chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod in addition to a high concentration of total suspended solids total dissolved solids extreme values of ph and colour this colour is given by the presence of dyes both natural and synthetic which are used in textile industries to dying clothes 4 dye concentration in textile wastewater varies over a wide range of values some literature reported values in the range of 10 800 mg l 1 2 dyes are organic compounds that contain a chromophore group in their structure giving a visible colour to different products as textiles plastics leather paper or food the colour is produced due to the electronic transitions between two energetic states when a radiation quantum is absorbed and it depends on the number of double bonds that are present in the structure 5 6 the presence of this colour in water produce several drawbacks for aquatic life blocking the penetration of light and therefore hampering the photosynthetic activity it is known that some dyes are also carcinogenic mutagenic and recalcitrant substances 4 7 in 2017 benkhaya et al 8 indicated that around 5000 tons per year of dyes are discharged in the environment azo dyes are one of the most widely used artificial dyes in the textile industry representing the 70 of all synthetic used dyes they present high solubility in water and produce bright and high intensity colours compared with other dye families 8 the chromophore groups in azo dye family are nn azo group cc and co 9 10 this azo group form hydrogen bonds making it more difficult to be removed from water and causing their accumulation in the environment 11 with the aim of reducing the impact on water quality caused by the presence of colorants different techniques can be used to remove dyes from textile wastewater these techniques are classified in three groups physical physicochemical and biological but they are commonly used together 12 some methods such as degradation or membrane separation were successfully applied for reducing the presence of dye pollutants in textile industrial wastewater 13 18 as well as the use of adsorbents for example carbon nanotube and coal fly ash are adsorptive material developed for the treatment of aqueous streams 19 23 liquid liquid extraction is an efficient separation technique widely used for the extraction of pollutant substances from water the main advantage is that the extracted substance as well as the extraction solvent can be recovered 24 25 in these technique volatile organic compounds vocs are usually used as extraction solvents however their low vapour pressure and high toxicity make necessary to replace them by safer ones in the last years ionic liquids ils were presented as good replacement solvents for vocs with high extraction efficiencies when they were used to remove pollutant substance and or high value added compounds 26 33 some research works applied ils with the purpose of extracting dyes from water chen et al 10 used quaternary ammonium based ils for the removal of methyl orange mo and methylene blue mb from water obtaining extraction yields around 95 for mo while for mb extraction results did not exceed 64 in another work kermanioryani et al 31 improved mb extraction efficiencies using ils based on imidazolium cation the better results reached with the il 1 hexyl 2 phenyl imidazolium bis trifluoromethanesulfonyl amide hphim ntf2 were attributed to the presence of an aromatic ring in the cation structure that favoured ils dye π π interactions furthermore among the advantages of ils there is the possibility of functionalizing them in order to design novel ils with tuneable characteristics for specific applications 34 35 nevertheless the high cost and toxic properties for the environment that present some ils lead to the development of other extraction solvents with more desirable characteristics many studies showed that deep eutectic solvents dess could be the substitution substances for ils 36 dess are the resulting new substances from the combination of two or more compounds where the starting compounds are hydrogen bond donor hbd and hydrogen bond acceptor hba that mixed in specific molar ratios lead to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions between started compounds 36 37 due to these new created interactions these obtained solvents present a decrease in their melting temperature lower than the starting reagents and they keep in liquid state in a wide range of temperature 38 39 although hydrophobic dess were satisfactorily applied for the removal of some pollutants from water by liquid liquid extraction 40 42 to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of research in the field of dyes removal one study was found in the literature published in 2018 by kaur et al 43 in this work liquid liquid micro extraction llme technique was developed to remove eriochrome black t ebt azo dye from aqueous solutions using glycolic acid and choline chloride based des in this work nine different solvents based on menthol coumarin thymol octanoic acid and decanoic acid were prepared in order to obtain stable hydrophobic dess to remove one azo dye congo red cr from aqueous samples the starting compounds were chosen with the aim of enhancing interactions between extraction solvents and dye through the establishment of hydrogen bonds 44 moreover based on results obtained from kermanioryani et al 31 thymol and coumarin were selected due to their aromatic nature in the effort of removing cr by π π interactions between the aromatic rings present in both structures solvents and dye structures of starting compounds used to obtain the extraction solvents as well as cr structure are presented in fig 1 although the formed solvents are hydrophobic liquid liquid equilibrium lle of des water mixtures was performed to check their behaviour in water this study is done with the aim of knowing their suitability to use them in aqueous systems after that ternary systems extraction solvent cr water at 298 15 k and atmospheric pressure were studied in order to obtain information about the extraction efficiencies of the studied solvents 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemical reagents water used in this work to prepare aqueous samples was of milli q quality chemical name supplier purity and cas number of chemicals used in this work are indicated in table 1 2 2 formation of dess the nine dess used in this work were formed using the heating method following the bibliography 33 38 45 the starting compounds were added in a specific molar ratio by weighing using a mettler toledo excellent plus xp205 analytical balance which uncertainty is 3 10 4 g then they were stirred and heated at 343 15 k until a homogeneous liquid was obtained after their preparation dess were left 48 h prior to their use in order to check their stability these formed solvents were thymol menthol 1 1 thymol menthol 1 2 thymol coumarin 1 1 thymol coumarin 2 1 thymol octanoic acid 1 1 thymol octanoic acid 2 1 thymol decanoic acid 1 1 thymol decanoic acid 2 1 and thymol decanoic acid 3 1 des names prepared in this work with the molar ratios used and their abbreviation are summarized in table 2 the thermal behaviour of dess was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry dsc technique it was used a dsc q 1000 ta instruments and the measurements were carried out in hermetic aluminium capsules samples were heated from 193 15 k to 343 15 k with a rate of 10 k min 1 under inert atmosphere 50 ml min 1 of n2 the standard uncertainty for temperature measurements is 1 k 2 3 study of dess behaviour in water before using these solvents as extraction agents it is necessary to know their behaviour in water to develop this study binary mixtures of 50 v v des water were prepared in glass cells and these mixtures were stirred for 8 h at controlled temperature in order to allow the correct contact between both phases then they were left settling overnight this experimental procedure was carried out in a thermostatic bath with a poly science digital temperature controller 0 01 k coupled to a phoenix instrument rsm 03 0 1 k magnetic stirrer after this process water rich phases were analysed by 1h nmr at 400 mhz using a bruker dpx 400 nmr in order to check dess stability in water furthermore water content of des rich phases was measured with the aim of analysing des hydrophobicity using a mettler toledo c20 coulometric kf titrator 2 4 extraction procedure ternary mixtures of extraction solvent cr water were prepared by weighing in an analytical balance these samples were prepared in flask cells covered with silicon caps and they were placed for 1 h in a thermostatic bath at 298 15 k they were stirred in order to allow the correct contact between both phases after this time immiscible phases were separated by using a hettich universal 320 centrifuge finally a sample of aqueous phase was separated and analysed by uv vis spectrophotometry using jasco spectrophotometer v 750 with an uncertainty of 0 002 abs from 0 to 0 5 abs and 0 003 abs from 0 5 to 1 abs respectively before this analysis a calibration curve of cr at the maximum absorbance of the dye 498 nm was obtained the extraction capability was calculated by the difference between the initial concentration ci and the final concentration that remains in the aqueous phase after the extraction procedure cf following equation 1 1 e c i c f c i 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dess the prepared dess were obtained as it was previously described and they were left 48 h in order to ensure their stability after this time it was observed that thy c8 2 1 and thy c10 3 1 were not stable because a solid appeared within the liquid solution excluding their use as extraction agents the other seven solvents remained stable and their thermal behaviour was analysed by dsc from melting and glass transition temperatures of pure compounds and prepared dess listed in table si 1 it is possible to conclude that all des show lower melting points than the starting compounds consequently it can be confirmed the formation of seven dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 thy cum 2 1 thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 that were used along this work 3 2 study of stability and hydrophobicity the stability of the formed solvents in water as well as their hydrophobicity was studied following the methodology explained in experimental procedure section stability of these solvents is confirmed with the resulting 1h nmr spectra that can be found in fig si 1 where one water phase nmr spectrum is shown as example for all results only one peak corresponding to water signal is depicted therefore the seven studied dess are stable in water and can be used as extraction agents after being formed water content of pure solvents as well as hydrated solvents were measured in order to obtain hydrated dess mixtures of 50 v v with water were stirred and then separated by centrifugation a comparison of water content between pure and hydrated solvents is listed in table 3 it is possible to observe that pure solvents present low amount of water although des based on carboxylic acids show higher water content than the others regarding to hydrated solvents all of them gain a significant amount of water observing the same behaviour for those based on carboxylic acids similar results were determined by van osch et al 38 for the dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 and thy cum 2 1 in the same way hydrophobicity of pure and hydrated solvents at different temperatures was studied for that purpose the amount of water present in des rich phases after lle with water from 293 15 k to 343 15 k was measured with the aim of quantifying the increase of water content experimental data proved that while water content of pure dess rose steadily as temperature increases water content of previously hydrated dess stayed constant at all studied temperatures table si 2 and si 3 respectively consequently hydrated dess were chosen as extraction agents within this work in order to work with them in stable conditions and assure that water will not interfere in the extraction process 3 3 liquid liquid extraction ternary mixtures of extraction solvent cr water were prepared in order to compare the extraction capability of dess thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 thy cum 2 1 thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 the influence of the volume ratio of des water phase 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 v v and the stirring time 15 30 60 and 90 min in the extraction procedure were studied in order to reduce solvent consumption and operation time moreover the molar proportion of starting compounds of each dess and the initial concentration of cr in water solutions that influence the extraction capability are discussed in the next sections 3 3 1 study of the influence des water phases ratio with the aim of using the least amount of extraction solvent a study of des rich phase water rich phase ratio was carried out using thy c10 1 1 as extraction solvent to remove different initial concentrations of cr the studied ratios were 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 v v and the results are presented in fig 2 and table si 4 as it is possible to observe in the graph ratios 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 achieve comparable extraction efficiencies higher than 90 at low initial concentrations of cr however when ratios 1 10 and 1 20 were used a significant decrease in extraction yields was observed even though ratio 1 1 reach better results at high initial concentrations than the other used ratios ratio 1 5 was selected as the extraction proportion in this work this choice allows us to reduce the solvent consumption keeping high extraction percentage at low initial concentrations moreover for those initial concentrations which these high percentages are not reached maybe due to the saturation of the extraction solvent 46 adding more extraction cycles could be useful to increase extraction yields obtaining similar results comparable to ratio 1 1 this issue will be discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 2 study of the influence of stirring time the contact time between des and water phases is a key parameter in liquid liquid separation processes once stablished the volume ratio parameter of 1 5 v v of des water phases stirring times of 15 30 60 and 90 min were analysed for different initial concentrations of cr using thy c10 1 1 from the experimental results showed in fig 3 data listed in table si 5 it is possible to observe an increase in the extraction efficiency while stirring time rises from 15 to 60 min however there are no clear differences between 60 and 90 min of phase contact at any initial concentration studied in this work note that the reduction of the extraction efficiency at high initial concentrations is due to the saturation of the extraction agent as it was explained in the previous section hence 60 min of stirring time was selected as optimum parameter for extraction of cr 3 3 3 application of dess for the extraction of cr liquid liquid extraction procedure was applied for the extraction of cr using all hydrated dess presented in this work however extraction procedures carried out with thy mth 1 1 thy mth 1 2 thy cum 1 1 and thy cum 2 1 were not favourable remaining the initial concentration of dye in the aqueous phase experimental data obtained for the extraction of different initial concentrations of cr from 50 to 500 mg l 1 from water are shown in fig 4 and table si 6 the results are given in terms of extraction capability of those solvents that were successfully applied thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 it can be observed from the graph that all solvents used lead to a high extraction efficiency process especially at low initial concentrations reaching 90 extraction yields for the three agents used both dess thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 achieved similar results although the best were found for thy c8 1 1 solvent when comparing the results obtained with thy c8 1 1 and thy c10 1 1 the extraction efficiency decreases as alkyl chain increases this behaviour could be attributed to the disruption of π π interactions in between des and cr similar results were observed by kermanioryani et al 31 regarding the influence of the initial concentration of cr on the extraction efficiencies a deep decrease on the percentage is noticed for all the studied solvents at high initial concentrations this behaviour can be explained by the saturation of extraction agents 46 in order to confirm the saturation of the solvent the

extraction yields of 77 remaining in aqueous phase 52 mg l 1 of cr in the same way a third extraction step was determined reaching the total removal of cr from water 99 5 of extraction yield the influence of the molar proportion used to obtain the studied dess into the extraction efficiency was assessed fig 5 the increase of thymol proportion between des thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 involve a slightly decrease in the extraction yield for low concentration being more remarkable this difference at high concentrations 3 4 recovery process after the whole procedure stirring and centrifugation steps there were clearly observed two immiscible phases des rich phase and water rich phase and an interphase between them in systems formed by thy c8 1 1 thy c10 1 1 and thy c10 2 1 this behaviour could be caused by the surfactant action of the sulfonate groups of cr under the presence of des that promotes h type aggregation of cr molecules 47 48 at low initial concentrations under 100 mg l 1

moreover no clear differences in 1h nmr spectra before and after their reuse ensure the stability of each solvent fig si 4 si 5 and si 6 with the aim of checking the extraction capability of the solvents three extraction cycles using recovered des were completed and the extraction percentages achieved in each cycle were the following 96 7 82 9 and 82 2 using thy c10 1 1 97 1 96 5 and 96 7 using thy c10 2 1 and 98 9 96 8 and 96 4 using thy c8 1 1 for the first second and third cycle respectively hence it is confirmed the reusability of all studied solvents for at least 3 extraction
