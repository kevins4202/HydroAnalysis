22385,in this work we are focusing on the presentation and comparison of two parametric models used in the generation of marine propeller geometrical model instances their main function lies in their ability to automatically and quickly produce valid geometric representations of marine propellers blades and hub based on a small set of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters this functionality is one of the major prerequisites when dealing with the problem of design shape optimization of functional surfaces such as marine propeller wind turbine blades that possess complex geometry and geometrically sensitive performance further to this we are also aiming at the generation of smooth analysis suitable instances directly out of our parametric models which will eliminate the time consuming labor intensive and costly overhead of transforming a computer aided design cad model into an appropriate computer aided engineering cae model commonly through an approximate mesh model generation the final requirement posed on these parametric models is their capacity in accurately reconstructing and representing existing propeller models the two presented models employ a different basis for the representation of underlying free form model surfaces namely nurbs and t splines and these approaches are assessed and compared in detail with respect to the aforementioned parametric model requirements keywords parametric model nurbs t splines marine propellers representation 1 introduction the hydrodynamic performance of a marine propeller is tightly linked to the geometric characteristics and the shape of its blades the blade constitutes a so called functional free form surface of significant complexity and its design requires specialized procedures both with respect to its representation in a computer aided design cad package as well as its analysis using computer aided engineering cae tools see e g smith and slater 1988 kerwin and hadler 2010 carlton 2012 ye et al 1996 the need for parametric models that will facilitate the automatic generation of valid propeller model instances and enable the design optimization of blades has been identified by several researchers including pritchard 1985 jürgen et al 2004 and koini et al 2009 for turbomachinery blades epps et al 2009 epps and kimball 2013a calcagni et al 2010 mirjalili et al 2015 and herath et al 2015 for marine propellers however the number of parametric models specifically designed and used for design optimization of marine propellers are rather limited and are commonly build around the computational package used for the assessment of the propeller model and or the specific characteristic the researchers are trying to optimize furthermore the parameters employed in the parametric models found in literature e g kenji and osamu 1995 and pierret 1999 are mainly appealing to coordinates of control points and there are limited cases where all or most parameters have a physical meaning at the same time various commercial academic and open source software packages exist for the design and or design optimization propellers the commercial tools include psp 1 1 propeller series package and qprop 2 2 quaestor propeller package propeller design and analysis workflow solutions from marin maritime research institute netherlands marin maritime research institute netherlands propcad and propelements from hydrocomp inc inc 2018 and many others the list of academic open source software tools includes xrotor mark and harold 2011 javaprop martin 2018 jblade morgado 2016 silvestre et al 2013 openprop epps et al 2009 epps and kimball 2013a and prop design anthony 2018 xrotor is an interactive program for the design and analysis of ducted and free tip propellers and windmills javaprop is a relatively simple piece of code based on the blade element theory jblade is an open source propeller design and analysis code based on david marten s qblade and andré deperrois xflr5 software tools openprop is a free software for the design and analysis of marine propellers and horizontal axis turbines based on matlab and prop design is an open source public domain aircraft propeller design software allowing the design of ducted or unducted aircraft propellers with straight or swept blades and constant or elliptical chord distributions in all of above cases we are once again dealing with propeller models tightly linked to the computational procedure employed or assumed by the corresponding software tool and in no case these propeller models are the type of analysis suitable models required in the iga context i e smooth accurate geometric representations of propeller blades that can be directly used in analysis propeller blades are typically defined by a series of cross sectional profiles placed at a certain number of radial locations these sections are developed on concentric cylinders and their exact shape is determined by a number of distributions controlling the size placement with respect to propeller s reference lines and rotations a detailed description of this approach can be found in pérez arribas and pérez fernández 2018 in which the authors generate a b spline surface representation of propeller blades while at the same time securing a reduced number of employed control points this general approach is implemented by the presented models and the benchmark models we are using for comparison in this work we are presenting two parametric models that comprise standalone software tools and can generate a propeller blade model via a limited number of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters the employed parameters firstly define the main hydrofoil shape which is later appropriately reproduced and modified in the radial direction the shape modifications are performed on the basis of well known propeller specific geometrical characteristics that are fully defined by the parametric model s parameters an additional and significant design objective that has been set for these parametric models concerns their ability to produce smooth geometric instances that are suitable for direct analysis using isogeometric analysis hughes et al 2005 cottrell et al 2009 iga enabled computational packages the iga approach allows the exact cad model to be used without any required modification as the analysis model employed in the cae tool this allows us to eliminate the troublesome time consuming meshing process involved in the common engineering analysis paradigm and at the same time preserve the exact geometry no approximation via meshing is required while rendering possible the automatic data model transfer between cad cae packages this approach has been already successfully applied in shape optimization of hydrofoils politis et al 2014 kostas et al 2017 and ship hulls ginnis et al 2013 kostas et al 2015 kaklis et al 2017 our paper begins with a brief presentation of marine propellers geometry the corresponding terminology and employed definitions see section 2 the next section section 3 presents the different surface representations nurbs and t splines employed in our parametric models for the propeller s model generation at the same section the representations major advantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows section 4 describes the two parametric models and the construction process followed in each case for the generation of the propeller model instances the models presentation is then followed by a detailed comparison of their performance in producing an accurate approximation of a given propeller blade while at the same time generating a smooth analysis suitable surface model our paper concludes with a brief discussion on open issues and future enhancements that are prerequisites for materializing our long term goal of producing an iga based design optimization framework for marine propellers 2 geometry of marine propellers before we proceed with the description of the parametric models we need to include a brief discussion on propeller terminology and definitions this will allow the reader to appreciate the complexity of the propeller geometry and follow later with more ease the description of the parametric model construction approaches detailed descriptions of propellers blade s geometry can be found in several publications e g smith and slater 1988 kerwin and hadler 2010 and carlton 2012 but our intention here is to simply present the basic definitions which will facilitate the reader s understanding of parametric models presentation in section 4 a common three bladed marine propeller along with its major constituent parts is depicted in fig 1 a the propeller blade is defined about a line normal to the shaft axis called the propeller reference line or spindle axis see fig 1 a each blade has two sides the face and back side the face or pressure side corresponds to the surface area of the blade that experiences high pressure and faces the flow downstream on the other hand the back of the blade faces the flow upstream and experiences low pressure the root of the blade comprises the area of the blade that attaches to propeller s hub a filleted blade area that guarantees structural strength and smooth transition between the hub and the blade while the farthermost point of the propeller along the span wise radial direction is called the blade tip propellers are divided into right handed and left handed ones a right handed propeller rotating clockwise when viewed from stern rear of the ship will push water downstream and the vessel forward for this case the leading edge of each blade will be furthest edge along the hub when viewing the propeller from stern see fig 1 a on the other hand a left handed propeller rotating counterclockwise would push the water towards the vessel and therefore move the vessel in reverse a series of hydrofoil sections such as the one shown in fig 1 c are commonly used to generate the blade surfaces of a propeller the blade may be generated via a single hydrofoil appropriately transformed in the span wise direction or via multiple differently shaped hydrofoil profiles for different areas of the blade e g root mid and tip areas the mean line or camber line of a hydrofoil comprises the locus of equidistant points between the upper and lower sides the points where the camber line meets the hydrofoil coincide with the leading and trailing edge points of the hydrofoil and the straight line connecting these two edge points is called the chord line the maximum distance between the mean camber line and the chord line is called camber while the hydrofoil thickness is the maximum distance between its upper and lower side see fig 1 c each hydrofoil section forming the blade is located at a corresponding radius r i r where r is the propeller s radius and lies on a cylinder with the same r i radius and axis coincident to the propeller s shaft axis further to this hydrofoils are commonly rotated twisted about the reference line by the so called pitch angle and translated according to the skew and rake of the propeller pitch skew rake a blade section located at radius r i is rotated via a ϕ i angle about the reference line z axis see fig 1 b due to this rotation the section forms a helix around the shaft axis as the propeller rotates the distance along the shaft axis covered in one rotation is called the pitch see fig 1 b each section of the blade can have a different pitch angle ϕ i and therefore the pitch at r i r 0 7 where r is the propeller radius is commonly used as a representative value the nominal pitch finally each pitch angle can be easily computed by the following relation ϕ i arctan p i 2 π r i where p i is the corresponding section s pitch skew is defined to be the displacement of a section along its chord line direction see fig 1 b the corresponding skew angle θ s i of a particular section at r i is the angle between the reference line and the midchord point of the section on the transverse place y z plane finally rake corresponds to an aft or forward displacement of the section along the shaft axis see fig 1 b skew can obviously induce rake and hence we can split total rake into two components the skew induced rake and reference line rake the corresponding rake angle is measured on the x z plane 3 nurbs vs t splines parametric representations the iga approach we are planning to employ for future analysis does not explicitly demand any specific type of geometry representation and several different approaches have been already used in pertinent literature the geometrical representation that constitutes the de facto standard in cad industry is non uniform rational b splines nurbs piegl and tiller 1997 nurbs representation exhibits a wide range of benefits including the use of the control point paradigm which offers convenience in modeling of free form curves surfaces the existence of a rich body of literature well established methods and numerically stable algorithms for all pertaining geometric operations and capacity to accurately represent conic sections which commonly appear in engineering cad models further to this and from the analysis point of view nurbs can also address the requirements of smoothness exhibiting c d 1 continuity between adjacent spline segments where d is the spline s degree and refinability via knot insertion and or degree elevation a nurbs surface s u v is defined as 1 s u v i 0 n j 0 m b i j r i j k 1 k 2 u v u v i 1 i 2 r i j k 1 k 2 u v w i j n i k 1 u n j k 2 v i 0 n j 0 m w i j n i k 1 u n j k 2 v where k 1 k 2 are surface s order k d 1 in u and v direction respectively b i j w i j the control points and their corresponding weights and n i k 1 u n j k 2 v the i th and j th b spline bases of degrees k 1 1 and k 2 1 defined over knot vectors j 1 j 2 partitioning the parametric intervals i 1 i 2 respectively although nurbs have been already extensively and successfully used in the context of iga see e g ginnis et al 2013 simpson et al 2012 kaklis et al 2017 kostas et al 2017 2018 their use is not without problems their major drawbacks stem from the tensor product nature of nurbs and their rectangular topology specifically complex bodies such as propellers cannot be represented via a single quadrilateral nurbs surface patch and multi patch representations need to be employed leading to additional issues related to the reduced basis continuity at patch boundaries c 0 and increased possibility of gaps between edges that render the overall model a non watertight geometry further to this and due to their tensor product nature we are facing two additional difficulties superfluous control points i e redundant control points that carry no significant geometrical information and limitations in local refinement since entire rows and or columns of control points need to be inserted at each step over the whole surface such problems have been already identified and discussed in the computer aided ship design literature see e g sharma et al 2012 and ginnis et al 2014 several alternative representation have been suggested and used in pertinent literature including hierarchical splines forsey and bartels 1988 pht splines deng et al 2008 lr splines dokken et al 2013 t splines sederberg et al 2003a 2004 and subdivision surfaces lee et al 2004 greshake and bronsart 2018 t splines constitute a generalization of nurbs technology that removes most of the above mentioned nurbs deficiencies and has also very successfully used in conjunction with the iga approach see e g bazilevs et al 2010 scott et al 2013 lian et al 2013 ginnis et al 2014 kostas et al 2015 t splines permit representation of complex objects with a single t spline patch alleviating the problems with multi patch representations and since partial rows of control points 3 3 terminating in the so called t junctions are allowed in a t spline control grid local refinement is made possible without the need of redundant additions of control points t splines definition requires as a first step the introduction of the so called t mesh in the case of surfaces the t mesh is a polygonal mesh with its constituent polygons or faces being called elements e each element is a quadrilateral but t junctions i e vertices that are similar to hanging nodes in finite elements terminology are allowed on its edges each vertex on the t mesh corresponds to a control point b i and an accompanying control weight w i hence i runs through all t mesh vertices although not required in the definition of t splines extraordinary points i e interior vertices that are not t junctions and whose valence do not equal four may be also present in the t mesh for each vertex or equivalently control point we need to define a basis that requires the assignment of a non negative value on mesh s edges these values correspond to knot interval lengths 4 4 in the parametric space and will be used in forming the required knot vectors for each basis function although arbitrary values can be used in the assignment as it is the case with nurbs knot intervals there is an additional requirement in their configuration specifically knot intervals on opposite sides should sum up to the same value otherwise we do not have a valid knot interval configuration for the t mesh if we now consider that i runs through all basis functions on the t mesh e g i 1 n and b i j i are the corresponding control points and knot vectors we can locally construct the cubic 5 5 other degrees are also possible but when considering even degrees the arrangement of control points on the t mesh differs from what we have discussed here n i u v bases if we additionally consider weights on control points w i we get the rational t spline bases r i u v and finally our t spline surface is defined as 2 s u v i 1 n b i r i u v where r i u v w i n i u v j 1 n w j n j u v for additional details the interested reader is referred to sederberg et al 2003b a 2004 bazilevs et al 2010 and scott et al 2013 2012 4 propeller parametric models although the two parametric models presented in this section adopt a different representation for the propeller surfaces nurbs vs t splines the overall construction approach is similar specifically both models begin with the employment of a hydrofoil parametric model for constructing one or more required blade sections the t splines based propeller parametric model tspmodel uses the hydrofoil parametric model described in kostas et al 2017 while the nurbs based model npmodel employs an extended version of the same model described in section 4 1 1 in sequel both propeller parametric models define a series of parametric curves that control the way the blade section s is are transformed in the span wise direction these curves are defined via additional parameters and correspond to the propeller s blade thickness sectional chord length pitch skew and rake distributions however as we will present in the following two subsections the implementation details and the surface generation approaches differ significantly between the two parametric models leading to some different model properties and possible applications 4 1 nurbs based parametric model npmodel the nurbs based parametric model npmodel has been implemented in rhino3d robert mcneel associates 2018 with the aid of rhinoscripting programming environment npmodel s implementation is divided into two major sections the generation of the required template hydrofoil s constituting the employed blade profile s and the definition of the hydrofoil profile transformations in the span wise direction which allow the generation of the 3d blade geometry 4 1 1 propeller blade section the basis of propeller blade sections is a 2d hydrofoil profile which is defined with the aid of an additional parametric sub model described subsequently this sub model is an extension of the hydrofoil parametric model presented in kostas et al 2017 the parametric model generates a closed cubic b spline curve via a set of 11 parameters which define the shape of the upper and lower side of the hydrofoil independently all parameters are defined as appropriate non dimensional ratios lying always in 0 1 which allows the elimination of complex interdependent constraints and enhances the robustness of the model the employed parameters use hydrofoil s chord length for non dimensionalization and their definition along with the ranges of their dimensional counterparts are included in table 1 the assumed coordinate system s origin is at hydrofoil s leading edge point and the longitudinal axis coincides with the chord line with the positive direction towards the trailing edge hence the ordinates of hydrofoil s upper side will always be non negative numbers while the lower side values can be either negative or mixed depending on hydrofoil s camber a parametric model instance with chord length equal to one l 1 and design vector parameter values equal to v i v i 0 5 i 1 10 v 11 0 1 is depicted in fig 2 the hydrofoil model s construction is based on the definition of four simple cubic bézier curves that are employed in the compilation of the final cubic b spline curve representation the upper and lower part of the hydrofoil comprise two parts each one for the fore and aft part respectively see fig 2 for the fore part of the upper side the first control point b 0 is positioned at 0 0 while the last one b 3 is at x u max u max the first interior point lies on the line segment defined by 0 0 and tan a u max u max while the second one on the segment defined by tan a u max u max and x u max u max the exact position of these points is controlled by the tip u shape parameter that dictates the shape fullness of the leading edge specifically b 1 tan a u max u max tip u and b 2 x u max tip u x u max tan a u max u max the second part is another cubic bézier segment adjacent to the first one which terminates at the trailing edge point i e at b 6 l 0 its interior control points are positioned as follows b 4 x u max s u u max and 3 b 5 l u max tan a b u u max if l u max tan a b u x u max s u x u max s u tan a b u x u max s u otherwise the collinear placement of b 2 b 3 and b 4 ensures the geometric continuity between the two bézier segments and allows b 4 to assume the upper side s maximum thickness 6 6 with respect to chord position see fig 2 the construction of the lower side follows a similar procedure with the only differences pertaining to a different angle range for a b l a reverse sign for a and an appropriately 7 7 two cases need to be considered when a b l is above or below the chord line modified eq 3 for the corresponding point at the lower side the 4 segments can be finally merged into one b spline curve with the introduction of k 1 multiplicity at interior knots corresponding to segment joints specifically if we assume that the final b spline curve starts at the leading edge point and traverses the hydrofoil in a clockwise direction we will use the 13 control points as ordered in fig 2 and the corresponding knot vector will be u 0 0 0 0 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 1 1 1 1 hence every hydrofoil instance produced by this model is a closed cubic b spline curve with 13 control points the first and last one being coincident any required hydrofoil shape can be approximated by this parametric model either by interactively modifying the parameter values or alternatively by solving a minimization problem that minimizes the deviation of the generated b spline curve from a given point set belonging to the required hydrofoil shape specifically we find the parameter values which minimize the curve point set deviation defined as follows 4 m i n v i 1 n c u i v v p i 2 subject to 0 v i 1 i 1 11 where p i i 1 n are the given n input points and u i are the b spline instance s parametric values that correspond to the perpendicular projections of p i on c u v this minimization problem can be easily solved with the aid of matlab s optimization toolbox the mathworks inc 2016 and specifically a deterministic algorithm such as the interior point algorithm byrd et al 1999 implemented in matlab s fmincon function such a case is depicted in fig 3 where a set of naca65010 8 8 meanline type naca a 0 8 thickness type naca 65a010 points are approximated by the hydrofoil parametric model using the design vector v 0 7254 0 5315 0 2613 0 4600 0 2033 0 2909 0 4576 0 4187 0 5743 0 3785 0 6706 resulting in the following cubic nurbs representation b i 1 0 0 6653 0 1456 0

section i placed at radius r i can be constructed by projecting this 2d hydrofoil on its corresponding cylindrical surface sharing the same radius see relevant discussion in section 2 4 1 2 blade geometry construction the generation of the marine propeller blade geometry is based on the template hydrofoil s constructed in previous step and the distribution of its chord length thickness pitch skew and rake over a number of user defined positions in the span wise direction these distributions are parameterized with two simple quadratic bézier curves an example case of such distribution curve is depicted in fig 4 the endpoints of the distribution curve correspond to the value of the quantity in question at blade s root r r o o t i e on propeller s hub and blade s tip r t i p r radius respectively the coordinates of b 2 see fig 4 determine the max min magnitude of the quantity or an inflection point if one is required along with its position in the radial direction while the longitudinal coordinates of b 1 and b 2 determine the exact shape of the distribution obviously if all control points in fig 4 are collinear the corresponding distribution is a simple linear relationship the user specified parameters lie once again in 0 1 as it was the case for the hydrofoil parametric model fig 5 depicts a series of hydrofoil sections twisted rotated around the reference line according to pitch angle distribution and positioned along the blade s span wise direction skew and rake are everywhere zero if these hydrofoils are subsequently projected onto the corresponding cylindrical surface we derive the actual propeller s blade sections see fig 5 c the major part of propeller s blade surface can be generated by sweeping the created sections along two interpolated curves corresponding to the leading and trailing edge of the blade however the propeller tip area needs some additional construction before it can be included in the blade surface generation to this end two b spline curves interpolating the leading and trailing edges endpoints and the calculated propeller tip point are generated obviously the tangency information from the two blade edges is supplied to the interpolating scheme and further to this the tip point s tangency conditions are estimated by assuming a circle on the reference place passing through the tip point and matching the local pitch angle using these additional edge curve segments the blade surface can be generated via a single sweep with two guide curves obviously the remaining blades are just repeated in a circular pattern as shown for example in fig 14 a 4 2 t splines based parametric model tspmodel the tspmodel is implemented in grasshopper grasshopper development team 2018 a parametric modeling and visual programming plug in tool of rhinoceros 3d robert mcneel associates 2018 the generation of the t spline based propeller model is focused on the construction of the t splines t mesh or control cage and follows a 5 step process described below the process begins as in the case of the npmodel with the definition of the hydrofoil template and continues on the basis of parameterized distribution relations for sections chord length thickness pitch skew and rake 4 2 1 step 1 parametric model of a 2d hydrofoil the template hydrofoil is created using the generic 2d hydrofoil parametric model presented in kostas et al 2017 this model creates a closed cubic b spline curve that represents a hydrofoil using a set of 8 parameters see table 2 except of the chord s length parameter l all others are defined using non dimensional ratios lying in 0 1 the construction of the parametric model initiates with the definition of four simple bézier curves that are employed in the generation of the closed cubic b spline curve representing the hydrofoil the upper part of the hydrofoil comprises two parts a simple cubic bézier curve and a simple quadratic one for the fore and aft part respectively the first control point of the cubic curve is located at 0 0 while the last one is at x z m a x m a x z the positions of the two interior control points are controlled by the tip form factor parameter specifically the first point lies on the line segment defined by 0 0 and 0 m a x z while the second on the segment defined by 0 m a x z and x z m a x m a x z the camber curve is designed in a similar way using two quadratic simple bézier curves the construction of these two curves is equivalent to the curves referring to the hydrofoil suction side with x z m a x m a x z and a b being replaced by x c m a x m a x z and a b p in sequel the lower pressure side of the hydrofoil is constructed by mirroring the suction side about the camber curve a detailed description of this particular modeling approach for the parametric definition and generation of hydrofoils can be found in kostas et al 2017 the naca profile depicted in fig 3 can be approximated with a maximum deviation error of 1 of chord s length using the following parameters and control points parameters 0 4025 0 4192 0 7369 0 1468 0 6503 0 3343 0 2753 b i 1 0 0 8838 0 0044 0 6781 0 036 0 4462 0 0644 0 2388 0 0564 0 0673 0 0424 0 0281 0 0058 0 0451 0 0684 0 2216 0 1299 0 4439 0 1586 0 6899 0 1229 0 8946 0 0493 1 0 knots 0 000 4 0 500 1 000 1 3266 1 6533 1 9799 2 3159 2 6520 2 9880 3 5024 4 0168 4 finally the two b spline curves upper lower sides are merged see tai et al 2003 into one b spline curve which is subsequently approximated by a new b spline curve with 13 control points as shown in fig 6 the additional approximating step is employed to eliminate the triple knots resulting at the joints of the simple bézier curve segments 4 2 2 step 2 propeller blade parameters the next step in the process regards the provision of general propeller parameters see table 3 along with blade specific ones number sliders 9 9 a number slider is a special gui object that allows visual editing of numeric values have been implemented to facilitate interactive design and provision of parametric values the blade specific parameters presented collectively in fig 7 affect the blade s section in the span wise direction and are effectively modifying the shape of the template profile along the blade the sections distribution determines the placement of the n sections defined in table 3 in sequel the remaining distributions comprise transformations scales rotations and translations that are applied on the placed blade sections specifically the chord length and thickness distributions determine the size of each section while the skew rake and pitch distributions define the corresponding rotations and or translations typical distributions of these parameters are illustrated in fig 7 with the help of graph mapper components this grasshopper tool allows the user to define a function y f x where x corresponds to the radial direction 4 2 3 step 3 blade surface control cage a set of in house developed c codes are employed in the construction of blade s control cage the control cage is generated via a set of distribution controlled transformations applied on the control points of the template hydrofoil see section 4 2 1 positioned along the blade in fig 8 a the transformed sections control points for one propeller blade are depicted using small red squares while the corresponding control cage is depicted with blue solid lines for the compilation of the final blade cage additional control curves are required at the hub and tip area see fig 9 these additional control curves are used to accommodate the requirements for a a smooth joining area between the blade and the hub b the construction of the blade tip and c the accomplishment of a fully watertight model specifically for the hub connection on additional rectangular section is utilized we call this section the bounding section which corresponds to the rectangular shape thick solid line depicted in fig 9 its control points are adjusted so that they are placed on the hub see fig 10 a by splitting them into 5 groups and dragging them on their adjacent circle for the tip area the sections control polygon collapses to a single polygonal line see central dashed line in fig 9 this is used to close the upper area of the control cage and form a thin section edge that approximates the tip edge of the blade in both areas tip hub transition 4 extraordinary points are generated in the complete control cage with valence 3 and 5 respectively 4 2 4 step 4 hub s control cage subsequently the parametric model creates the hub cage which will be connected with the blade cage the hub is modeled through a linear array of five polygons connected to each other in the longitudinal sense these polygons along with their connecting control curves are depicted in fig 10 b and correspond to the circles depicted in fig 10 a the remaining polygons in fig 10 b red ones are scaled down versions of the initial ones and are used to form the smooth cap in front of the hub and close the hub at the other end the requirement of tangential continuity dictates that the helix defined by the blade pitch is mapped onto the hub hence the pitch angle at blade s root is used to twist the hub polygons accordingly 4 2 5 step 5 control cage of marine propeller the control cages of the hub and blades have been connected in the previous step as shown in fig 10 c and autodesk s t splines plug in autodesk inc 2015 command tsfromlines is used for the construction of the corresponding t spline surface the tsfromlines command uses the provided cage as the surface s t mesh generates the corresponding control polyhedron and generates the t spline representation of the model the resulting surface is illustrated in fig 1 a and is a watertight t spline marine propeller model with 848 control points this parametric model instance approximates a b3 60 wageningen b series propeller see van lammeren et al 1969 5 numerical examples and comparison results two prototype marine propellers have been selected as examples for demonstrating and benchmarking the developed parametric models the first one comprises the default 3d propeller model found in the openprop software package while the second example utilizes a common four bladed wageningen b series propeller 5 1 openprop propeller openprop software package as we have already mentioned in the introductory section is an open source software package used for the design and analysis of marine propellers and horizontal axis turbines see epps et al 2009 epps 2016 epps and kimball 2013b a the standard required input for generating a 3d marine propeller model in openprop includes the number of blades the propeller hub diameter the template hydrofoil s mean line and thickness along with distributions for chord length blade thickness pitch skew and rake along the radial direction see default openprop geometry input parameters in table 4 the openprop 3d model corresponding to this default set of parameters is depicted in fig 12 in sequel we demonstrate the use of both parametric models in approximating the default openprop 3d propeller model our comparison is limited to the propeller blade which is the most complex and decisive geometrical element for the propeller s performance the process followed in the two parametric models is similar and has as follows 1 the general parameter values diameter d and number of blades are set to 2 and 3 respectively for both parametric models as for the number of sections 10 are employed for the generation of np model and 16 for the tsp model 2 the parameters described in table 1 are used to approximate the naca65a010 hydrofoil profile for the npmodel similarly the parameters in table 3 are employed in tspmodel s approximation of the same hydrofoil 3 the distributions for chord length thickness and pitch angle depicted in fig 11 are approximated using the corresponding mechanisms built in the two parametric models specifically tspmodel uses the tools described in section 4 2 2 while for the npmodel the quadratic splines described in section 4 1 2 are utilized 4 the two corresponding 3d propeller models are then automatically generated see figs 14 16 the tspmodel generated propeller surface is a t spline surface comprising 884 control points including the hub component the npmodel generates a multi patch nurbs representation of the propeller where 1825 control points are used for each blade 5475 control points for all blades the npmodel s hub component is practically a trimmed cylindrical surface and has minimal contribution to model s complexity the first thing we would like to assess is the approximation level achieved by the two parametric models when compared to the openprop prototype surface blades to this end we generated points from 20 sections belonging to one openprop blade and compared them against the corresponding sections belonging to np tsp models in fig 14 we visualize the point surface deviation s using rhino s point set deviation command specifically in fig 14 a we can easily see that the npmodel generated blade has an average deviation of approximately 7 4 1 0 4 m and we can hardly find any surface point deviating more than 5 1 0 3 m 5 mm from the openprop point set in fig 14 b we present the corresponding results for the tspmodel generated blade it is easy to see that the overall deviation is larger and that there is a region red colored region in which the surface deviations exceed 1 cm this time the average deviation is around 3 8 1 0 3 m a detailed comparison of deviations in all generated sections are included in table 5 specifically for each section we present the average and max deviations achieved by each parametric model when compared to openprop s prototype blade deviations are presented both as distance values av d max d and percentages of the section s chord length av max finally each section s chord length as approximated by each model is also included in the comparison the same information is depicted in graphical form in fig 13 the second comparison between the two models concerns the smoothness of the generated blade surface to this end we have computed surface isophotes gaussian curvature mapping for the two blade models see fig 15 and fig 16 respectively both figures demonstrate that the tspmodel achieves a significantly smoother result avoiding totally the slightly wiggling behavior exhibited by the npmodel generated blade surface see fig 16 a this superiority in smoothness for the tspmodel generated model is also extended to the bases used for its representation specifically the single cubic t spline surface modeling the propeller geometry exhibits overall c 2 continuity limited to g 1 in the vicinity of extraordinary points 10 10 interior t mesh vertices that are not t junctions and whose valence do not equal four however although the npmodel generated cubic nurbs multi patch surface is also c 2 continuous within patches it is limited to only c 0 continuity at patch boundaries obviously from a geometrical point of view things can get even worse at the boundaries where gaps between edges might appear especially when trimmed parts are employed e g at the blade hub connection our final comparison relates to the suitability of these two parametric models for engineering analysis and performance evaluation of the underlying propeller model as we have already mentioned in the introductory section our ultimate aim is to employ these parametric models in a propeller design optimization environment powered by an isogeometric analysis boundary element method solver for the assessment of blades performance in this context the superior smoothness exhibited by the tspmodel with respect to both its representation bases and surface quality makes it certainly more attractive furthermore the small number of control points which normally leads to a small number of degrees of freedom number of unknowns for the linear system appearing in the context of the bem formulation is an additional and equally important benefit however its approximating accuracy at this point of development is not reaching the accuracy achieved by the npmodel finally the tspmodel requires existence of an environment supporting t splines representations which is not as popular as nurbs that are practically supported by every cad and cae software package or library as a last remark we need to mention here that the processing time i e the time required for producing a model instance is very short for npmodel s case i e around 1 2 secs on an entry level standard pc while tspmodel requires the same amount of time for building the control cage further to this an additional time of up to 30 secs might be required for the t spline surface construction especially if a smooth tessellation is required for visualization purposes 5 2 wageningen b series propeller wageningen b screw series van lammeren et al 1969 is one the most extensive oldest and commonly used propeller series worldwide b screw series was originally presented in a set of papers by troost 1938 1940 1951 referred to as the troost series the number of blades range from 3 to 7 the blade area ratios range from 0 30 to 1 05 while the pitch to diameter ratio values are between 0 6 and 1 4 the xy zz notation used in their naming stands for the series type e g x b for b series the number of blades e g y 3 for three bladed propellers and the blade area ratio ae a0 e g zz 70 for 70 blade area ratio for this example a b4 70 propeller oosterveld and oossanen 1975 has been approximated using both parametric models contrary to the first example this propeller possesses a more complicated geometry including skew and rake distributions and allows to demonstrate the parametric models performance in a more interesting case the results in this case are similar to the ones demonstrated for the first example i e npmodel achieves better accuracy at the expense of smoothness while tspmodel outperforms the nurbs parametric model in surface smoothness but lacks in the approximating accuracy the smoothness comparison between the two model instances using isophotes and gaussian curvature is depicted in figs 17 and 18 respectively finally regarding the model instances deviation from the actual propeller geometry we achieve almost identical results to the ones presented in the first example i e npmodel achieves on an average a deviation of around 1 mm while this raises to 1 cm for a significant part of tspmodel s instance 6 conclusions future work in this work we have presented and compared two geometric parametric models with respect to their performance in generating accurate surface approximations of existing marine propellers and their capacity in producing model instances suitable for engineering analysis following the isogeometric analysis paradigm it has been demonstrated that both models can quickly and automatically produce valid geometric representations of marine propellers mainly blade surfaces based on a small set of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters a subset of these parameters is firstly used in the construction of a template hydrofoil profile which is later copied and transformed in the span wise direction on the basis of a series of distribution laws defined by the remaining part of parameters these distribution laws describe the scaling rotation and translation of the template profile and specifically correspond to chord length thickness pitch rake and skew propeller distributions the models approximation capacity in reconstructing existing propeller models have been tested against openprop s default propeller model and b4 70 b series propeller in both cases a clear advantage has been demonstrated for the nurbs based parametric model npmodel on the other hand the superior smoothness and reduced number of required control points exhibited by tspmodel instances make it a better candidate for employment in isogeometric analysis empowered computations this result is not surprising since the npmodel employs an interpolating approach in the blade construction whereas the tspmodel adopts a more loose design centric paradigm finally both seem to possess the required properties i e robustness automatic and quick instance generation for their introduction to an automatic design optimization framework these parametric models constitute part of the work carried out in a research project entitled shape optimization of lift and thrust generating surfaces with the aid of isogeometric analysis and the ultimate test for the models will be performed via the project specific isogeometric analysis propeller solver which is currently under development and is scheduled to be delivered in the following year this computational solver will allow us to investigate in depth the appropriateness of the models for engineering analysis in an isogeometric context and simultaneously will give us the chance to further check their performance in covering the feasible design space in the context of shape optimization meanwhile we are planning to invest some effort in enhancing the presented models and alleviating some issues identified in section 5 specifically ways of enhancing the approximating accuracy of the tspmodel need to be investigated e g adoption of npmodel s hydrofoil generator while at the same time approaches that lead to npmodel s instances simplification control points number reduction and enhancement of resulting surface smoothness will be further pursued finally for both models we plan to introduce a parameter for direct control of blade s thickness at the trailing edge which is essential when considering manufacturing applications acknowledgment this work has received funding from nazarbayev university kazakhstan grant no 090118fd5328 shape

22385,in this work we are focusing on the presentation and comparison of two parametric models used in the generation of marine propeller geometrical model instances their main function lies in their ability to automatically and quickly produce valid geometric representations of marine propellers blades and hub based on a small set of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters this functionality is one of the major prerequisites when dealing with the problem of design shape optimization of functional surfaces such as marine propeller wind turbine blades that possess complex geometry and geometrically sensitive performance further to this we are also aiming at the generation of smooth analysis suitable instances directly out of our parametric models which will eliminate the time consuming labor intensive and costly overhead of transforming a computer aided design cad model into an appropriate computer aided engineering cae model commonly through an approximate mesh model generation the final requirement posed on these parametric models is their capacity in accurately reconstructing and representing existing propeller models the two presented models employ a different basis for the representation of underlying free form model surfaces namely nurbs and t splines and these approaches are assessed and compared in detail with respect to the aforementioned parametric model requirements keywords parametric model nurbs t splines marine propellers representation 1 introduction the hydrodynamic performance of a marine propeller is tightly linked to the geometric characteristics and the shape of its blades the blade constitutes a so called functional free form surface of significant complexity and its design requires specialized procedures both with respect to its representation in a computer aided design cad package as well as its analysis using computer aided engineering cae tools see e g smith and slater 1988 kerwin and hadler 2010 carlton 2012 ye et al 1996 the need for parametric models that will facilitate the automatic generation of valid propeller model instances and enable the design optimization of blades has been identified by several researchers including pritchard 1985 jürgen et al 2004 and koini et al 2009 for turbomachinery blades epps et al 2009 epps and kimball 2013a calcagni et al 2010 mirjalili et al 2015 and herath et al 2015 for marine propellers however the number of parametric models specifically designed and used for design optimization of marine propellers are rather limited and are commonly build around the computational package used for the assessment of the propeller model and or the specific characteristic the researchers are trying to optimize furthermore the parameters employed in the parametric models found in literature e g kenji and osamu 1995 and pierret 1999 are mainly appealing to coordinates of control points and there are limited cases where all or most parameters have a physical meaning at the same time various commercial academic and open source software packages exist for the design and or design optimization propellers the commercial tools include psp 1 1 propeller series package and qprop 2 2 quaestor propeller package propeller design and analysis workflow solutions from marin maritime research institute netherlands marin maritime research institute netherlands propcad and propelements from hydrocomp inc inc 2018 and many others the list of academic open source software tools includes xrotor mark and harold 2011 javaprop martin 2018 jblade morgado 2016 silvestre et al 2013 openprop epps et al 2009 epps and kimball 2013a and prop design anthony 2018 xrotor is an interactive program for the design and analysis of ducted and free tip propellers and windmills javaprop is a relatively simple piece of code based on the blade element theory jblade is an open source propeller design and analysis code based on david marten s qblade and andré deperrois xflr5 software tools openprop is a free software for the design and analysis of marine propellers and horizontal axis turbines based on matlab and prop design is an open source public domain aircraft propeller design software allowing the design of ducted or unducted aircraft propellers with straight or swept blades and constant or elliptical chord distributions in all of above cases we are once again dealing with propeller models tightly linked to the computational procedure employed or assumed by the corresponding software tool and in no case these propeller models are the type of analysis suitable models required in the iga context i e smooth accurate geometric representations of propeller blades that can be directly used in analysis propeller blades are typically defined by a series of cross sectional profiles placed at a certain number of radial locations these sections are developed on concentric cylinders and their exact shape is determined by a number of distributions controlling the size placement with respect to propeller s reference lines and rotations a detailed description of this approach can be found in pérez arribas and pérez fernández 2018 in which the authors generate a b spline surface representation of propeller blades while at the same time securing a reduced number of employed control points this general approach is implemented by the presented models and the benchmark models we are using for comparison in this work we are presenting two parametric models that comprise standalone software tools and can generate a propeller blade model via a limited number of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters the employed parameters firstly define the main hydrofoil shape which is later appropriately reproduced and modified in the radial direction the shape modifications are performed on the basis of well known propeller specific geometrical characteristics that are fully defined by the parametric model s parameters an additional and significant design objective that has been set for these parametric models concerns their ability to produce smooth geometric instances that are suitable for direct analysis using isogeometric analysis hughes et al 2005 cottrell et al 2009 iga enabled computational packages the iga approach allows the exact cad model to be used without any required modification as the analysis model employed in the cae tool this allows us to eliminate the troublesome time consuming meshing process involved in the common engineering analysis paradigm and at the same time preserve the exact geometry no approximation via meshing is required while rendering possible the automatic data model transfer between cad cae packages this approach has been already successfully applied in shape optimization of hydrofoils politis et al 2014 kostas et al 2017 and ship hulls ginnis et al 2013 kostas et al 2015 kaklis et al 2017 our paper begins with a brief presentation of marine propellers geometry the corresponding terminology and employed definitions see section 2 the next section section 3 presents the different surface representations nurbs and t splines employed in our parametric models for the propeller s model generation at the same section the representations major advantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows section 4 describes the two parametric models and the construction process followed in each case for the generation of the propeller model instances the models presentation is then followed by a detailed comparison of their performance in producing an accurate approximation of a given propeller blade while at the same time generating a smooth analysis suitable surface model our paper concludes with a brief discussion on open issues and future enhancements that are prerequisites for materializing our long term goal of producing an iga based design optimization framework for marine propellers 2 geometry of marine propellers before we proceed with the description of the parametric models we need to include a brief discussion on propeller terminology and definitions this will allow the reader to appreciate the complexity of the propeller geometry and follow later with more ease the description of the parametric model construction approaches detailed descriptions of propellers blade s geometry can be found in several publications e g smith and slater 1988 kerwin and hadler 2010 and carlton 2012 but our intention here is to simply present the basic definitions which will facilitate the reader s understanding of parametric models presentation in section 4 a common three bladed marine propeller along with its major constituent parts is depicted in fig 1 a the propeller blade is defined about a line normal to the shaft axis called the propeller reference line or spindle axis see fig 1 a each blade has two sides the face and back side the face or pressure side corresponds to the surface area of the blade that experiences high pressure and faces the flow downstream on the other hand the back of the blade faces the flow upstream and experiences low pressure the root of the blade comprises the area of the blade that attaches to propeller s hub a filleted blade area that guarantees structural strength and smooth transition between the hub and the blade while the farthermost point of the propeller along the span wise radial direction is called the blade tip propellers are divided into right handed and left handed ones a right handed propeller rotating clockwise when viewed from stern rear of the ship will push water downstream and the vessel forward for this case the leading edge of each blade will be furthest edge along the hub when viewing the propeller from stern see fig 1 a on the other hand a left handed propeller rotating counterclockwise would push the water towards the vessel and therefore move the vessel in reverse a series of hydrofoil sections such as the one shown in fig 1 c are commonly used to generate the blade surfaces of a propeller the blade may be generated via a single hydrofoil appropriately transformed in the span wise direction or via multiple differently shaped hydrofoil profiles for different areas of the blade e g root mid and tip areas the mean line or camber line of a hydrofoil comprises the locus of equidistant points between the upper and lower sides the points where the camber line meets the hydrofoil coincide with the leading and trailing edge points of the hydrofoil and the straight line connecting these two edge points is called the chord line the maximum distance between the mean camber line and the chord line is called camber while the hydrofoil thickness is the maximum distance between its upper and lower side see fig 1 c each hydrofoil section forming the blade is located at a corresponding radius r i r where r is the propeller s radius and lies on a cylinder with the same r i radius and axis coincident to the propeller s shaft axis further to this hydrofoils are commonly rotated twisted about the reference line by the so called pitch angle and translated according to the skew and rake of the propeller pitch skew rake a blade section located at radius r i is rotated via a ϕ i angle about the reference line z axis see fig 1 b due to this rotation the section forms a helix around the shaft axis as the propeller rotates the distance along the shaft axis covered in one rotation is called the pitch see fig 1 b each section of the blade can have a different pitch angle ϕ i and therefore the pitch at r i r 0 7 where r is the propeller radius is commonly used as a representative value the nominal pitch finally each pitch angle can be easily computed by the following relation ϕ i arctan p i 2 π r i where p i is the corresponding section s pitch skew is defined to be the displacement of a section along its chord line direction see fig 1 b the corresponding skew angle θ s i of a particular section at r i is the angle between the reference line and the midchord point of the section on the transverse place y z plane finally rake corresponds to an aft or forward displacement of the section along the shaft axis see fig 1 b skew can obviously induce rake and hence we can split total rake into two components the skew induced rake and reference line rake the corresponding rake angle is measured on the x z plane 3 nurbs vs t splines parametric representations the iga approach we are planning to employ for future analysis does not explicitly demand any specific type of geometry representation and several different approaches have been already used in pertinent literature the geometrical representation that constitutes the de facto standard in cad industry is non uniform rational b splines nurbs piegl and tiller 1997 nurbs representation exhibits a wide range of benefits including the use of the control point paradigm which offers convenience in modeling of free form curves surfaces the existence of a rich body of literature well established methods and numerically stable algorithms for all pertaining geometric operations and capacity to accurately represent conic sections which commonly appear in engineering cad models further to this and from the analysis point of view nurbs can also address the requirements of smoothness exhibiting c d 1 continuity between adjacent spline segments where d is the spline s degree and refinability via knot insertion and or degree elevation a nurbs surface s u v is defined as 1 s u v i 0 n j 0 m b i j r i j k 1 k 2 u v u v i 1 i 2 r i j k 1 k 2 u v w i j n i k 1 u n j k 2 v i 0 n j 0 m w i j n i k 1 u n j k 2 v where k 1 k 2 are surface s order k d 1 in u and v direction respectively b i j w i j the control points and their corresponding weights and n i k 1 u n j k 2 v the i th and j th b spline bases of degrees k 1 1 and k 2 1 defined over knot vectors j 1 j 2 partitioning the parametric intervals i 1 i 2 respectively although nurbs have been already extensively and successfully used in the context of iga see e g ginnis et al 2013 simpson et al 2012 kaklis et al 2017 kostas et al 2017 2018 their use is not without problems their major drawbacks stem from the tensor product nature of nurbs and their rectangular topology specifically complex bodies such as propellers cannot be represented via a single quadrilateral nurbs surface patch and multi patch representations need to be employed leading to additional issues related to the reduced basis continuity at patch boundaries c 0 and increased possibility of gaps between edges that render the overall model a non watertight geometry further to this and due to their tensor product nature we are facing two additional difficulties superfluous control points i e redundant control points that carry no significant geometrical information and limitations in local refinement since entire rows and or columns of control points need to be inserted at each step over the whole surface such problems have been already identified and discussed in the computer aided ship design literature see e g sharma et al 2012 and ginnis et al 2014 several alternative representation have been suggested and used in pertinent literature including hierarchical splines forsey and bartels 1988 pht splines deng et al 2008 lr splines dokken et al 2013 t splines sederberg et al 2003a 2004 and subdivision surfaces lee et al 2004 greshake and bronsart 2018 t splines constitute a generalization of nurbs technology that removes most of the above mentioned nurbs deficiencies and has also very successfully used in conjunction with the iga approach see e g bazilevs et al 2010 scott et al 2013 lian et al 2013 ginnis et al 2014 kostas et al 2015 t splines permit representation of complex objects with a single t spline patch alleviating the problems with multi patch representations and since partial rows of control points 3 3 terminating in the so called t junctions are allowed in a t spline control grid local refinement is made possible without the need of redundant additions of control points t splines definition requires as a first step the introduction of the so called t mesh in the case of surfaces the t mesh is a polygonal mesh with its constituent polygons or faces being called elements e each element is a quadrilateral but t junctions i e vertices that are similar to hanging nodes in finite elements terminology are allowed on its edges each vertex on the t mesh corresponds to a control point b i and an accompanying control weight w i hence i runs through all t mesh vertices although not required in the definition of t splines extraordinary points i e interior vertices that are not t junctions and whose valence do not equal four may be also present in the t mesh for each vertex or equivalently control point we need to define a basis that requires the assignment of a non negative value on mesh s edges these values correspond to knot interval lengths 4 4 in the parametric space and will be used in forming the required knot vectors for each basis function although arbitrary values can be used in the assignment as it is the case with nurbs knot intervals there is an additional requirement in their configuration specifically knot intervals on opposite sides should sum up to the same value otherwise we do not have a valid knot interval configuration for the t mesh if we now consider that i runs through all basis functions on the t mesh e g i 1 n and b i j i are the corresponding control points and knot vectors we can locally construct the cubic 5 5 other degrees are also possible but when considering even degrees the arrangement of control points on the t mesh differs from what we have discussed here n i u v bases if we additionally consider weights on control points w i we get the rational t spline bases r i u v and finally our t spline surface is defined as 2 s u v i 1 n b i r i u v where r i u v w i n i u v j 1 n w j n j u v for additional details the interested reader is referred to sederberg et al 2003b a 2004 bazilevs et al 2010 and scott et al 2013 2012 4 propeller parametric models although the two parametric models presented in this section adopt a different representation for the propeller surfaces nurbs vs t splines the overall construction approach is similar specifically both models begin with the employment of a hydrofoil parametric model for constructing one or more required blade sections the t splines based propeller parametric model tspmodel uses the hydrofoil parametric model described in kostas et al 2017 while the nurbs based model npmodel employs an extended version of the same model described in section 4 1 1 in sequel both propeller parametric models define a series of parametric curves that control the way the blade section s is are transformed in the span wise direction these curves are defined via additional parameters and correspond to the propeller s blade thickness sectional chord length pitch skew and rake distributions however as we will present in the following two subsections the implementation details and the surface generation approaches differ significantly between the two parametric models leading to some different model properties and possible applications 4 1 nurbs based parametric model npmodel the nurbs based parametric model npmodel has been implemented in rhino3d robert mcneel associates 2018 with the aid of rhinoscripting programming environment npmodel s implementation is divided into two major sections the generation of the required template hydrofoil s constituting the employed blade profile s and the definition of the hydrofoil profile transformations in the span wise direction which allow the generation of the 3d blade geometry 4 1 1 propeller blade section the basis of propeller blade sections is a 2d hydrofoil profile which is defined with the aid of an additional parametric sub model described subsequently this sub model is an extension of the hydrofoil parametric model presented in kostas et al 2017 the parametric model generates a closed cubic b spline curve via a set of 11 parameters which define the shape of the upper and lower side of the hydrofoil independently all parameters are defined as appropriate non dimensional ratios lying always in 0 1 which allows the elimination of complex interdependent constraints and enhances the robustness of the model the employed parameters use hydrofoil s chord length for non dimensionalization and their definition along with the ranges of their dimensional counterparts are included in table 1 the assumed coordinate system s origin is at hydrofoil s leading edge point and the longitudinal axis coincides with the chord line with the positive direction towards the trailing edge hence the ordinates of hydrofoil s upper side will always be non negative numbers while the lower side values can be either negative or mixed depending on hydrofoil s camber a parametric model instance with chord length equal to one l 1 and design vector parameter values equal to v i v i 0 5 i 1 10 v 11 0 1 is depicted in fig 2 the hydrofoil model s construction is based on the definition of four simple cubic bézier curves that are employed in the compilation of the final cubic b spline curve representation the upper and lower part of the hydrofoil comprise two parts each one for the fore and aft part respectively see fig 2 for the fore part of the upper side the first control point b 0 is positioned at 0 0 while the last one b 3 is at x u max u max the first interior point lies on the line segment defined by 0 0 and tan a u max u max while the second one on the segment defined by tan a u max u max and x u max u max the exact position of these points is controlled by the tip u shape parameter that dictates the shape fullness of the leading edge specifically b 1 tan a u max u max tip u and b 2 x u max tip u x u max tan a u max u max the second part is another cubic bézier segment adjacent to the first one which terminates at the trailing edge point i e at b 6 l 0 its interior control points are positioned as follows b 4 x u max s u u max and 3 b 5 l u max tan a b u u max if l u max tan a b u x u max s u x u max s u tan a b u x u max s u otherwise the collinear placement of b 2 b 3 and b 4 ensures the geometric continuity between the two bézier segments and allows b 4 to assume the upper side s maximum thickness 6 6 with respect to chord position see fig 2 the construction of the lower side follows a similar procedure with the only differences pertaining to a different angle range for a b l a reverse sign for a and an appropriately 7 7 two cases need to be considered when a b l is above or below the chord line modified eq 3 for the corresponding point at the lower side the 4 segments can be finally merged into one b spline curve with the introduction of k 1 multiplicity at interior knots corresponding to segment joints specifically if we assume that the final b spline curve starts at the leading edge point and traverses the hydrofoil in a clockwise direction we will use the 13 control points as ordered in fig 2 and the corresponding knot vector will be u 0 0 0 0 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 3 4 1 1 1 1 hence every hydrofoil instance produced by this model is a closed cubic b spline curve with 13 control points the first and last one being coincident any required hydrofoil shape can be approximated by this parametric model either by interactively modifying the parameter values or alternatively by solving a minimization problem that minimizes the deviation of the generated b spline curve from a given point set belonging to the required hydrofoil shape specifically we find the parameter values which minimize the curve point set deviation defined as follows 4 m i n v i 1 n c u i v v p i 2 subject to 0 v i 1 i 1 11 where p i i 1 n are the given n input points and u i are the b spline instance s parametric values that correspond to the perpendicular projections of p i on c u v this minimization problem can be easily solved with the aid of matlab s optimization toolbox the mathworks inc 2016 and specifically a deterministic algorithm such as the interior point algorithm byrd et al 1999 implemented in matlab s fmincon function such a case is depicted in fig 3 where a set of naca65010 8 8 meanline type naca a 0 8 thickness type naca 65a010 points are approximated by the hydrofoil

section i placed at radius r i can be constructed by projecting this 2d hydrofoil on its corresponding cylindrical surface sharing the same radius see relevant discussion in section 2 4 1 2 blade geometry construction the generation of the marine propeller blade geometry is based on the template hydrofoil s constructed in previous step and the distribution of its chord length thickness pitch skew and rake over a number of user defined positions in the span wise direction these distributions are parameterized with two simple quadratic bézier curves an example case of such distribution curve is depicted in fig 4 the endpoints of the distribution curve correspond to the value of the quantity in question at blade s root r r o o t i e on propeller s hub and blade s tip r t i p r radius respectively the coordinates of b 2 see fig 4 determine the max min magnitude of the quantity or an inflection point if one is required along with its position in the radial direction while the longitudinal coordinates of b 1 and b 2 determine the exact shape of the distribution obviously if all control points in fig 4 are collinear the corresponding distribution is a simple linear relationship the user specified parameters lie once again in 0 1 as it was the case for the hydrofoil parametric model fig 5 depicts a series of hydrofoil sections twisted rotated around the reference line according to pitch angle distribution and positioned along the blade s span wise direction skew and rake are everywhere zero if these hydrofoils are subsequently projected onto the corresponding cylindrical surface we derive the actual propeller s blade sections see fig 5 c the major part of propeller s blade surface can be generated by sweeping the created sections along two interpolated curves corresponding to the leading and trailing edge of the blade however the propeller tip area needs some additional construction before it can be included in the blade surface generation to this end two b spline curves interpolating the leading and trailing edges endpoints and the calculated propeller tip point are generated obviously the tangency information from the two blade edges is supplied to the interpolating scheme and further to this the tip point s tangency conditions are estimated by assuming a circle on the reference place passing through the tip point and matching the local pitch angle using these additional edge curve segments the blade surface can be generated via a single sweep with two guide curves obviously the remaining blades are just repeated in a circular pattern as shown for example in fig 14 a 4 2 t splines based parametric model tspmodel the tspmodel is implemented in grasshopper grasshopper development team 2018 a parametric modeling and visual programming plug in tool of rhinoceros 3d robert mcneel associates 2018 the generation of the t spline based propeller model is focused on the construction of the t splines t mesh or control cage and follows a 5 step process described below the process begins as in the case of the npmodel with the definition of the hydrofoil template and continues on the basis of parameterized distribution relations for sections chord length thickness pitch skew and rake 4 2 1 step 1 parametric model of a 2d hydrofoil the template hydrofoil is created using the generic 2d hydrofoil parametric model presented in kostas et al 2017 this model creates a closed cubic b spline curve that represents a hydrofoil using a set of 8 parameters see table 2 except of the chord s length parameter l all others are defined using non dimensional ratios lying in 0 1 the construction of the parametric model initiates with the definition of four simple bézier curves that are employed in the generation of the closed cubic b spline curve representing the hydrofoil the upper part of the hydrofoil comprises two parts a simple cubic bézier curve and a simple quadratic one for the fore and aft part respectively the first control point of the cubic curve is located at 0 0 while the last one is at x z m a x m a x z the positions of the two interior control points are controlled by the tip form factor parameter specifically the first point lies on the line segment defined by 0 0 and 0 m a x z while the second on the segment defined by 0 m a x z and x z m a x m a x z the camber curve is designed in a similar way using two quadratic simple bézier curves the construction of these two curves is equivalent to the curves referring to the hydrofoil suction side with x z m a x m a x z and a b being replaced by x c m a x m a x z and a b p in sequel the lower pressure side of the hydrofoil is constructed by mirroring the suction side about the camber curve a detailed description of this particular modeling approach for the parametric definition and generation of hydrofoils can be found in kostas et al 2017 the naca profile depicted in fig 3 can be approximated with a maximum deviation error of 1 of chord s length using the following parameters and control points parameters 0 4025 0 4192 0 7369 0 1468 0 6503 0 3343 0 2753 b i 1 0 0 8838 0 0044 0 6781 0 036 0 4462 0 0644 0 2388 0 0564 0 0673 0

spline curves upper lower sides are merged see tai et al 2003 into one b spline curve which is subsequently approximated by a new b spline curve with 13 control points as shown in fig 6 the additional approximating step is employed to eliminate the triple knots resulting at the joints of the simple bézier curve segments 4 2 2 step 2 propeller blade parameters the next step in the process regards the provision of general propeller parameters see table 3 along with blade specific ones number sliders 9 9 a number slider is a special gui object that allows visual editing of numeric values have been implemented to facilitate interactive design and provision of parametric values the blade specific parameters presented collectively in fig 7 affect the blade s section in the span wise direction and are effectively modifying the shape of the template profile along the blade the sections distribution determines the placement of the n sections defined in table 3 in sequel the remaining distributions comprise transformations scales rotations and translations that are applied on the placed blade sections specifically the chord length and thickness distributions determine the size of each section while the skew rake and pitch distributions define the corresponding rotations and or translations typical distributions of these parameters are illustrated in fig 7 with the help of graph mapper components this grasshopper tool allows the user to define a function y f x where x corresponds to the radial direction 4 2 3 step 3 blade surface control cage a set of in house developed c codes are employed in the construction of blade s control cage the control cage is generated via a set of distribution controlled transformations applied on the control points of the template hydrofoil see section 4 2 1 positioned along the blade in fig 8 a the transformed sections control points for one propeller blade are depicted using small red squares while the corresponding control cage is depicted with blue solid lines for the compilation of the final blade cage additional control curves are required at the hub and tip area see fig 9 these additional control curves are used to accommodate the requirements for a a smooth joining area between the blade and the hub b the construction of the blade tip and c the accomplishment of a fully watertight model specifically for the hub connection on additional rectangular section is utilized we call this section the bounding section which corresponds to the rectangular shape thick solid line depicted in fig 9 its control points are adjusted so that they are placed on the hub see fig 10 a by splitting them into 5 groups and dragging them on their adjacent circle for the tip area the sections control polygon collapses to a single polygonal line see central dashed line in fig 9 this is used to close the upper area of the control cage and form a thin section edge that approximates the tip edge of the blade in both areas tip hub transition 4 extraordinary points are generated in the complete control cage with valence 3 and 5 respectively 4 2 4 step 4 hub s control cage subsequently the parametric model creates the hub cage which will be connected with the blade cage the hub is modeled through a linear array of five polygons connected to each other in the longitudinal sense these polygons along with their connecting control curves are depicted in fig 10 b and correspond to the circles depicted in fig 10 a the remaining polygons in fig 10 b red ones are scaled down versions of the initial ones and are used to form the smooth cap in front of the hub and close the hub at the other end the requirement of tangential continuity dictates that the helix defined by the blade pitch is mapped onto the hub hence the pitch angle at blade s root is used to twist the hub polygons accordingly 4 2 5 step 5 control cage of marine propeller the control cages of the hub and blades have been connected in the previous step as shown in fig 10 c and autodesk s t splines plug in autodesk inc 2015 command tsfromlines is used for the construction of the corresponding t spline surface the tsfromlines command uses the provided cage as the surface s t mesh generates the corresponding control polyhedron and generates the t spline representation of the model the resulting surface is illustrated in fig 1 a and is a watertight t spline marine propeller model with 848 control points this parametric model instance approximates a b3 60 wageningen b series propeller see van lammeren et al 1969 5 numerical examples and comparison results two prototype marine propellers have been selected as examples for demonstrating and benchmarking the developed parametric models the first one comprises the default 3d propeller model found in the openprop software package while the second example utilizes a common four bladed wageningen b series propeller 5 1 openprop propeller openprop software package as we have already mentioned in the introductory section is an open source software package used for the design and analysis of marine propellers and horizontal axis turbines see epps et al 2009 epps 2016 epps and kimball 2013b a the standard required input for generating a 3d marine propeller model in openprop includes the number of blades the propeller hub diameter the template hydrofoil s mean line and thickness along with distributions for chord length blade thickness pitch skew and rake along the radial direction see default openprop geometry input parameters in table 4 the openprop 3d model corresponding to this default set of parameters is depicted in fig 12 in sequel we demonstrate the use of both parametric models in approximating the default openprop 3d propeller model our comparison is limited to the propeller blade which is the most complex and decisive geometrical element for the propeller s performance the process followed in the two parametric models is similar and has as follows 1 the general parameter values diameter d and number of blades are set to 2 and 3 respectively for both parametric models as for the number of sections 10 are employed for the generation of np model and 16 for the tsp model 2 the parameters described in table 1 are used to approximate the naca65a010 hydrofoil profile for the npmodel similarly the parameters in table 3 are employed in tspmodel s approximation of the same hydrofoil 3 the distributions for chord length thickness and pitch angle depicted in fig 11 are approximated using the corresponding mechanisms built in the two parametric models specifically tspmodel uses the tools described in section 4 2 2 while for the npmodel the quadratic splines described in section 4 1 2 are utilized 4 the two corresponding 3d propeller models are then automatically generated see figs 14 16 the tspmodel generated propeller surface is a t spline surface comprising 884 control points including the hub component the npmodel generates a multi patch nurbs representation of the propeller where 1825 control points are used for each blade 5475 control points for all blades the npmodel s hub component is practically a trimmed cylindrical surface and has minimal contribution to model s complexity the first thing we would like to assess is the approximation level achieved by the two parametric models when compared to the openprop prototype surface blades to this end we generated points from 20 sections belonging to one openprop blade and compared them against the corresponding sections belonging to np tsp models in fig 14 we visualize the point surface deviation s using rhino s point set deviation command specifically in fig 14 a we can easily see that the npmodel generated blade has an average deviation of approximately 7 4 1 0 4 m and we can hardly find any surface point deviating more than 5 1 0 3 m 5 mm from the openprop point set in fig 14 b we present the corresponding results for the tspmodel generated blade it is easy to see that the overall deviation is larger and that there is a region red colored region in which the surface deviations exceed 1 cm this time the average deviation is around 3 8 1 0 3 m a detailed comparison of deviations in all generated sections are included in table 5 specifically for each section we present the average and max deviations achieved by each parametric model when compared to openprop s prototype blade deviations are presented both as distance values av d max d and percentages of the section s chord length av max finally each section s chord length as approximated by each model is also included in the comparison the same information is depicted in graphical form in fig 13 the second comparison between the two models concerns the smoothness of the generated blade surface to this end we have computed surface isophotes gaussian curvature mapping for the two blade models see fig 15 and fig 16 respectively both figures demonstrate that the tspmodel achieves a significantly smoother result avoiding totally the slightly wiggling behavior exhibited by the npmodel generated blade surface see fig 16 a this superiority in smoothness for the tspmodel generated model is also extended to the bases used for its representation specifically the single cubic t spline surface modeling the propeller geometry exhibits overall c 2 continuity limited to g 1 in the vicinity of extraordinary points 10 10 interior t mesh vertices that are not t junctions and whose valence do not equal four however although the npmodel generated cubic nurbs multi patch surface is also c 2 continuous within patches it is limited to only c 0 continuity at patch boundaries obviously from a geometrical point of view things can get even worse at the boundaries where gaps between edges might appear especially when trimmed parts are employed e g at the blade hub connection our final comparison relates to the suitability of these two parametric models for engineering analysis and performance evaluation of the underlying propeller model as we have already mentioned in the introductory section our ultimate aim is to employ these parametric models in a propeller design optimization environment powered by an isogeometric analysis boundary element method solver for the assessment of blades performance in this context the superior smoothness exhibited by the tspmodel with respect to both its representation bases and surface quality makes it certainly more attractive furthermore the small number of control points which normally leads to a small number of degrees of freedom number of unknowns for the linear system appearing in the context of the bem formulation is an additional and equally important benefit however its approximating accuracy at this point of development is not reaching the accuracy achieved by the npmodel finally the tspmodel requires existence of an environment supporting t splines representations which is not as popular as nurbs that are practically supported by every cad and cae software package or library as a last remark we need to mention here that the processing time i e the time required for producing a model instance is very short for npmodel s case i e around 1 2 secs on an entry level standard pc while tspmodel requires the same amount of time for building the control cage further to this an additional time of up to 30 secs might be required for the t spline surface construction especially if a smooth tessellation is required for visualization purposes 5 2 wageningen b series propeller wageningen b screw series van lammeren et al 1969 is one the most extensive oldest and commonly used propeller series worldwide b screw series was originally presented in a set of papers by troost 1938 1940 1951 referred to as the troost series the number of blades range from 3 to 7 the blade area ratios range from 0 30 to 1 05 while the pitch to diameter ratio values are between 0 6 and 1 4 the xy zz notation used in their naming stands for the series type e g x b for b series the number of blades e g y 3 for three bladed propellers and the blade area ratio ae a0 e g zz 70 for 70 blade area ratio for this example a b4 70 propeller oosterveld and oossanen 1975 has been approximated using both parametric models contrary to the first example this propeller possesses a more complicated geometry including skew and rake distributions and allows to demonstrate the parametric models performance in a more interesting case the results in this case are similar to the ones demonstrated for the first example i e npmodel achieves better accuracy at the expense of smoothness while tspmodel outperforms the nurbs parametric model in surface smoothness but lacks in the approximating accuracy the smoothness comparison between the two model instances using isophotes and gaussian curvature is depicted in figs 17 and 18 respectively finally regarding the model instances deviation from the actual propeller geometry we achieve almost identical results to the ones presented in the first example i e npmodel achieves on an average a deviation of around 1 mm while this raises to 1 cm for a significant part of tspmodel s instance 6 conclusions future work in this work we have presented and compared two geometric parametric models with respect to their performance in generating accurate surface approximations of existing marine propellers and their capacity in producing model instances suitable for engineering analysis following the isogeometric analysis paradigm it has been demonstrated that both models can quickly and automatically produce valid geometric representations of marine propellers mainly blade surfaces based on a small set of geometrically and physically meaningful parameters a subset of these parameters is firstly used in the construction of a template hydrofoil profile which is later copied and transformed in the span wise direction on the basis of a series of distribution laws defined by the remaining part of parameters these distribution laws describe the scaling rotation and translation of the template profile and specifically correspond to chord length thickness pitch rake and skew propeller distributions the models approximation capacity in reconstructing existing propeller models have been tested against openprop s default propeller model and b4 70 b series propeller in both cases a clear advantage has been demonstrated for the nurbs based parametric model npmodel on the other hand the superior smoothness and reduced number of required control points exhibited by tspmodel instances make it a better candidate for employment in isogeometric analysis empowered computations this result is not surprising since the npmodel employs an interpolating approach in the blade construction whereas the tspmodel adopts a more loose design centric paradigm finally both seem to possess the required properties i e robustness automatic and quick instance generation for their introduction to an automatic design optimization framework these parametric models constitute part of the work carried out in a research project entitled shape optimization of lift and thrust generating surfaces with the aid of isogeometric analysis and the ultimate test for the models will be performed via the project specific isogeometric analysis propeller solver which is currently under development and is scheduled to be delivered in the following year this computational solver will allow us to investigate in depth the appropriateness of the models for engineering analysis in an isogeometric context and simultaneously will give us the chance to further check their performance in covering the feasible design space in the context of shape optimization meanwhile we are planning to invest some effort in enhancing the presented models and alleviating some issues identified in section 5 specifically ways of enhancing the approximating accuracy of the tspmodel need to be investigated e g adoption of npmodel s hydrofoil generator while at the same time approaches that lead to npmodel s instances simplification control points number reduction and enhancement of resulting surface smoothness will be further pursued finally for both models we plan to introduce a parameter for direct control of blade s thickness at the trailing edge which is essential when considering manufacturing applications acknowledgment this work has received funding from nazarbayev university kazakhstan grant no 090118fd5328 shape

22386,plate bending with double curvature is an essential procedure in shipbuilding which is also a bottleneck problem to restrict the fabrication schedule and dimensional accuracy with the induction heating technology plate bending with double curvature as saddle and sail types was conducted experimentally meanwhile due to the rated output power of induction heating heat input as well as moving speed of induction heating coil has a significant influence on maximal temperature and final bending deformation in addition out of plane bending deformation with different patterns can be observed and their magnitudes were also measured by three coordinate measuring machine tmm computational analysis with thermal elastic plastic tep and elastic fe approaches was then employed to investigate processing parameters of induction heating computed out of plane bending deformations have a good agreement with measurement about not only deformed shape but also magnitudes elastic fe computation with bending moment as input loading has much more obvious efficiency comparing to conventional tep fe computation without loss of computational accuracy moreover generation mechanism of bending deformation with different patterns was also examined and clarified with in plane plastic strains caused by induction heating which will be converted to shrinkage force and bending moment for plate bending keywords induction heating plate bending with double curvature bending moment processing parameters fe computation 1 introduction in advanced ship design and construction curved hull structures are usually employed to enhance the hydrodynamic performance and plate bending procedure plays an important role to ensure dimensional accuracy and fabrication schedule moreover some particular ship structures such as bulbous bow and stern sections are assembled by curved plates with double curvature generally plate bending during the fabrication of curved hull structure is practiced by cold bending with rolling and mechanical pressing thermal bending such as oxygen acetylene flame heating laser heating and induction heating with the advantage of precision controlling high level of automation and others induction heating technology is increasing applied for plate bending with double curvature to guarantee required fabrication quality in shipbuilding up to now jang et al 2002 carried out a series of induction heating experiments considering the influence of plate thickness heating speed and power on bending deformation lee et al 2013 later examined high frequency induction heating on plate bending behavior of an ss400 thick plate experimentally and they pointed out that permanent out of plane bending deformation is determined by rated output power of induction heating regardless of the deformed shape with dual curvature according to the experimental test park et al 2015 concluded that the angular distortion behavior of heated plates with high frequency induction heating can be clarified with the function of heat intensity and the rigidity of heated plate as well as the size of test specimen lee and hwang 2014 employed an automatic high frequency induction heating hfih with triangular heating process for thick steel plate bending and the influence of heating patterns on out of plane bending deformation of an ss400 thick plate was examined zhang et al 2019 investigated the non dimensional relation between processing parameters and thermal bending behavior of ship hull plate with induction heating and orthogonal testing experiment was conducted to validate the critical value of processing parameters with the computational approach as well as finite element method induction heating procedure was represented for mechanism clarification of physical behavior and its processing parameters were also examined to ensure fabrication level and accuracy shen et al 2006 developed a mathematical tool to examine the temperature field during high frequency induction heating while the influences of heating parameters such as the distance between plate and induction coil frequency of induction current and the turns of induction coil on temperature profiles were also discussed zhang et al 2011 employed finite element analysis for hull plate bending with high frequency induction heating and computed results were validated by experiments with triangle heating technique bae et al 2012 examined the steel plate bending process with high frequency induction heating while computed bending deformations have good agreement with experiments in order to improve the computational efficiency elastic fe analysis with bending moment was proposed to consider the flame heating with different line heating patterns wang et al 2017 in application of shipyard park et al 2016 presented an automated thermal forming system with induction heating for shipbuilding which consists of scanning devices for measurement of plates high frequency induction heater for plate forming a computational unit for heating information and a gantry robot with six axes from the above mentioned literatures some investigations with experiment and computation on plate bending with induction heating were already achieved and presented although thermal and mechanical behaviors during the induction heating procedure were also examined holistic investigation on plate bending to objective shape of hull structure in particular curved hull structure with double curvature was still not carried out with experiment or computation by multi linear induction heating in this research hull structures with double curvature such as saddle and sail pattern were considered as research object advanced induction heating equipment with high frequency was employed for plate bending with double curvature transient temperature was measured and the relationship between moving speed of induction heating coil and maximal temperature was also established after cooling down three coordinate measuring machine tmm was then employed for bending deformation measurement in detail q235 plate with 6 mm thickness was linearly heated by six parallel induction heating lines with different moving speed and saddle type deformed shape was observed ah36 plate with 8 mm thickness was heated by five transverse and four longitudinal induction heating lines to be deformed as sail shape practical computational approach with thermal elastic plastic tep fe analysis was employed in particular elastic fe analysis with shrinkage force and bending moment as mechanical load was also proposed to efficiently predict the bending deformation without precision loss by comparing with experimental results in addition comparison of computational efficiency between conventional tep and proposed elastic fe analyses was then demonstrated 2 theorem of investigation in order to examine the plate bending with double curvature by high frequency induction heating it is desired to systematically clarify the relevant physical behavior measuring method and computational approach for mechanism understanding and processing parameters optimization the following theory and method were then introduced 2 1 behavior and principle of induction heating in nature some metals such as iron and steel has electric magnetic characteristic and induction heat will be generated as physical response when high frequency oscillatory current appears nearby due to their best magnetic hysteresis rudnev et al 2017 generally hysteresis heating occurs when the temperature is lower than curie temperature and magnetic materials will remain their electric magnetic characteristic and induction heating behavior this physical mechanism can be clarified with high permeability which is beneficial for induction heating in magnetic materials and appears when temperature is lower than curie temperature therefore induction heating is a physical process of heat generation and conduction on magnetic metals with electromagnetic induction behavior rudnev et al 2017 in detail induction heat is generated inside of steel workpiece itself due to the eddy current which is the result of high frequency oscillatory current of induction heating coil and rapidly alternating magnetic field then steel workpiece can be heated without any external heat source the heat amount generated by induction heating is significantly influenced by the distance between induction heating coil and steel workpiece meanwhile heat losses will occur due to the physical behaviors of thermal convection and radiation in addition the frequency of oscillatory current dominantly determines the penetrated depth as well as the ron of induction eddy current exists in the thickness direction of heated steel workpiece see fig 1 2 2 fe computational approach to examine mechanical response during induction heating process the thermal elastic plastic fe computation can be carried out by two steps with thermal analysis and mechanical analysis in detail temperature distribution at each time step can be easily computed with heat transfer analysis by employing a body heat source model of induction heating and then computed temperature data is applied as thermal loading for mechanical analysis while temperature dependent material properties as well as material non linear feature were considered in both analyses wang et al 2014a ma et al 2016 meanwhile mechanical analysis solves the equation of momentum conservation at the end of each time step to predict the deformed shape and magnitude of bending deformation in which initial stress is usually assumed to be zero and rigid body motion of considered steel workpiece is prevented to be boundary condition during the heating and cooling processes the plastic strain will be remained after cooling down and plastic strain is often considered as the mechanism cause of in plane shrinkage and bending deformation based on the physical behavior plastic strains close to induction heating ron can be converted to shrinkage force in longitudinal direction with eq 1 and bending moment in transverse direction with eq 2 respectively wang et al 2015 2016 when shrinkage force and bending moment generated by induction heating were obtained the mechanical response as well as bending deformation can be easily examined and represented with an elastic fe analysis wang et al 2013a 2018 1 f s h r i n k a g e e ε x p l a s t i c d y d z 2 d m z h 2 d f z h 2 e ε y p l a s t i c d a m b e n d i n g z h 2 e ε y p l a s t i c d y d z where ε x p l a s t i c and ε y p l a s t i c are the plastic strains generated by induction heating in the longitudinal and the transverse directions e is the young s modules h is the thickness of the plate with induction heating and x y z are the induction heating direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively 2 3 bending deformation mechanism with processing parameter during induction heating procedure heat is generated and temperature of steel workpiece in the local ron of eddy currents field will rapidly elevate thermal strain will be generated due to the nature of expanding with heat and contracting with cold as well as the constrain of surrounding cold metal and then elastic plastic behavior will occur and compressive plastic strain will be produced and remained after cooling down when the elevated temperature is higher than yield temperature as demonstrated in fig 2 luo et al 1997 the residual plastic strain is determined by compressive plastic strain generated during heating and tensile plastic strain generated during cooling down to ambient temperature since the geometrical features of induction heating coil and procedure parameters will influence the penetration depth distribution and magnitude of temperature through thickness direction of steel workpiece will vary the non uniform distribution of compressive plastic strain on cross section in transverse direction will cause plastic strain gradient and bending moment as well as out of plane bending deformation meanwhile compressive plastic strain along the induction heating direction will generate shrinkage force to be elementary cause of buckling behavior 3 experimental procedure and measurement for plate bending with double curvature in shipbuilding an experiment with ship steel plate was carried out by induction heating system which consists of induction heating coil water cooling recycle unit and an electronic oscillator which will generate high frequency alternating current and magnetic field as the basic setup alternating current power supply will provide electricity with low voltage but large current and high frequency meanwhile induction heating coil is usually made of copper tubing with water cooling while its diameter shape and the number of turns will together determine the efficiency of induction heating temperature field pattern and bending moment in this experiment an advanced induction heating equipment as shown in fig 3 with high frequency 30 khz 100 khz was employed which rated working power output current output voltage are 25 kw 1060 a and 24 v respectively meanwhile an additional water cooling system with 12 kw of rated power 50 000 kcal h of cooling capacity and 12 5 m3 h of circulating water quantity was also applied to make sure induction heating procedure with stable moving speed during plate bending experiment a portable moving car with fixed track was also used in order to examine the temperature profile during induction heating transient temperature and thermal cycle with moving of induction heating coil were measured by means of k type thermal couple in real time which will be used to establish the relationship between induction heating velocity and heated maximal temperature after cooling down to ambient temperature three coordinate measuring machine was employed to obtain the geometrical profile and out of plane bending deformation 3 1 temperature measurement during induction heating during the induction heating for plate bending heat is generated due to the alternating current and corresponding magnetic field and temperature distribution as well as temperature gradient in thickness direction then will be caused with thermal transfer which is generally considered as the reason of bending moment and bending deformation therefore it is necessary to measure and analysis the feature of induction heating temperature during experiment of plate bending by induction heating in advance in detail transient temperature measuring device with k type thermal couple platinum rhodium alloy was employed to obtain thermal cycles of several measured points as shown in fig 4 thermal couple as a kind of temperature sensor consists of two dissimilar electrical conductors with a forming of electrical junction which can generate a temperature dependent voltage as the result of thermal electrical effect or thermal electromotance before the experiment k type thermal couple with platinum rhodium was fixed to the accurate location of plate by special tack welding machine and then transient temperature measuring device can simultaneously obtain and save temperature data of connected thermal couples by measuring frequency with 16 hz sec during the induction heating based on the electric magnetic behavior and curie temperature 8 cases with different moving speeds of induction heating coil as summarized in table 1 were carried out with the moving car and its fixed track since the rated power of high frequency induction heating equipment as mentioned above is 25 kw energy per length with different moving speed of induction heating coil then can be calculated as summarized in table 1 meanwhile the relationship between linear energy of induction heating and measured maximal temperature during induction heating can be established as shown in fig 5 in detail the horizontal direction means linear energy which is determined by rated output power and moving speed of induction heating coil and the upright direction means measured maximal temperature with different linear energy as well as moving speed of induction heating coil it can be obviously concluded that maximal temperature of measured point will increase according to the increasing of linear energy as well as the decreasing of moving speed of induction heating coil in theory the maximal temperature of heated ship steel plate will keep constant value when it approximates to the curie temperature 3 2 bending deformation measurement in general advanced measurement approach of out of plane bending deformation can be divided into coordinate measuring and optical scanning approaches three coordinate measuring approach is usually employed to measure the geometrical characteristic of examined structure with high precision while probe as mechanical sensor controlled by computer will touch structure surface hocken and pereira 2016 as a measuring result point cloud which describes the geometrical characteristic of measured surface can be obtained while this point cloud has a regular distance and topological feature and will be used to establish the geometrical profile with numerical algorithms in post processing in detail after cooling down and with surface cleaning to avoid the measuring disturbance rust removal procedure was carried out on the measuring surface beforehand then three coordinate measuring machine tmm as shown in fig 6 was employed to obtain the coordinate of measured point cloud which was then used to establish the geometrical profile with measured data analysis meanwhile the measured ship steel plate should be fixed to the measuring platform with fixture or clamping which will make sure the measuring precision and completion of measuring procedure as shown in fig 7 furthermore fig 7 also shows the measuring procedure with computer controlling in which referenced coordinate system should be confirmed before measuring the number and locations of measured points can be fixed due to the balance of measuring cost and required measuring precision thus the distance between each adjacent point is eventually 15 mm with about 2 μm tolerance with analysis of measured data out of plane bending deformation can be visualized with contour plotting by means of post process and magnitude of out of plane bending deformations at each measured points also can be obtained for computer results validation later 3 3 plate bending experiment with saddle type with experiment of plate bending by single linear induction heating mentioned above mechanical response was observed and examined hull plate with double curvature for shipbuilding was then considered in detail as the typical designed geometry of ship hull plate plate bending experiment for saddle shape opposite curvatures was carried out by means of multiple induction heating lines a ship steel plate with 300 mm in length 200 mm in width and 6 mm in thickness was examined while its yield stress is about 235 mpa processing parameters during plate bending with six induction heating lines were indicated in fig 8 which were practiced sequentially in addition moving speed of induction heating coil was about 13 75 mm s for line 1 4 and 23 58 mm s for line 5 6 after cooling down geometrical profile of deformed plate was measured with advanced three coordinates measuring machine with high precision global classis sr series with 2 μm tolerance in detail operation of plate surface clearance was firstly carried out to ensure the measured accuracy and bending plate was then fixed on the platform as shown in fig 9 later three points were selected and marked to create a referenced plane coordinate of examined bending plate and magnitude of bending deformation were obtained while graphical visualization with contour plotting was demonstrated in fig 10 it can be seen that the examined ship steel plate bends upward in heating line direction while bends downward in the direction perpendicular to heating line meanwhile the bending curvatures in length and width directions have the opposite sign which is considered as the mechanical feature and cause to be saddle type of bending plate moreover out of plane bending deformation of points on line 1 and line 2 as indicated in fig 11 was examined and drawn in fig 12 due to plate bending with saddle shape it can be obviously concluded that bending tendency of points on line 1 longitudinal direction is overall upward and bending tendency of points on line 2 transverse direction is contrary downward 3 4 plate bending experiment with sail type furthermore a ship steel plate with high tensile strength steel ah36 which yield stress is about 360 mpa was then examined for plate bending with above employed induced heating equipment and geometrical profile of examined ship steel plate is 300 mm in length 200 mm in width and 8 mm in thickness as shown in fig 13 the route and sequence of multi induction heating lines were indicated while moving speeds of induced heating coil for all heating lines in both length and width directions are all about 15 mm s with same procedure comparing to above measurement of bending deformation three coordinated measurement machine tmm was employed to obtain the geometrical profile of examined ah36 ship steel plate after cooling down to ambient temperature and plate surface clearance operation while bending plate was also fixed on the platform as shown in fig 14 with measured data analysis deformed shape of bending plate with sail type by means of induction heating procedure as mentioned in fig 13 was established with contour plotting as shown in fig 15 fig 15 also obviously shows that bending plate with sail type bends downward in both longitudinal and transverse directions and has a geometry feature with positive riemann space due to thermal mechanical response of induction heating in both length and width directions moreover points on line 1 and line 2 as indicated in fig 11 was examined again their out of plane bending deformations were demonstrated in fig 16 it also can be seen that out of plane bending distortions bend downward together and directions of bending curvature are identical 4 computational analysis for plate bending due to experimental cost and time consumption computational analysis with high performance computer and advanced numerical approach was accepted and widely employed for out of plane bending deformation prediction during plate bending with induction heating in general there are two elementary computation approaches one is thermal elastic plastic fe analysis to represent the entire thermal transfer behavior and its generated mechanical response and the other is elastic fe analysis concentrating on residual bending deformation with bending moment and shrinkage force caused by induction heating 4 1 tep fe analysis for saddle type bending from above mentioned experiments there are two examined bending plates which are q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness and ah36 high tensile strength steel plate with 8 mm in thickness solid brick elements model as shown in fig 17 was made for thermal elastic plastic fe computation and geometrical profile is identical with experiment specimen of q235 ship steel plate mesh size in thickness direction is 0 5 mm and which is 5 mm in both length and width directions therefore the total number of node and element are 32 513 and 28 800 as indicated in fig 17 respectively in addition non linear temperature dependent material properties as shown in fig 18 were employed during thermal analysis body heat source with uniform flux density was employed to model the induction heating while the complex electric magnetic physical behavior can be avoided considering the rated output power and moving speed of induction heating coil in the previous experiments the heat input per length can be calculated and applied to the heated ron which is determined by the size of induction heating coil and penetration depth meanwhile rigid body motion as show in fig 17 was prevented to be boundary condition to predict the out of plane bending deformation according to the actual experiment an in house code programmed with the theory mentioned above was employed for thermal elastic plastic fe computation fig 19 shows the transient temperature distribution during the induction heating it can be seen that proposed body heat

induction heating coil as demonstrated in fig 20 and this maximal temperature approximates to the curie point but never exceeds the temperature of curie point after cooling down to ambient temperature out of plane bending deformation as well as displacement in thickness direction can be computed as shown in fig 21 while the computed bending plate with convex curvature in length direction and concave curvature in width direction was represented this kind of bending type was generated by means of compressive shrinkage force along the induction heating direction and the examined q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness lose its stability with buckling behavior as saddle type the comparison of magnitude of out of plane bending deformation comparing with measurement will be achieved later moreover residual plastic strain in the direction perpendicular to induction heating was also obtained which contour plotting distribution is demonstrated in fig 22 4 2 tep fe analysis for sail

while the ron with maximal transient temperature above 700 c is consistent with the applied procedure parameters of induction heating after cooling down to ambient temperature out of plane bending deformation as well as displacement in thickness direction can be computed as shown in fig 25 which has a geometrical feature with upward bending in both length and width directions as well as positive riemann space as sail type bending plate curvatures with same sign is caused by bending moment in the direction perpendicular to induction heating line moreover residual plastic strains in both length and width directions were also obtained which contour plotting distributions are demonstrated in fig 26 4 3 evaluation of bending moment and shrinkage force although thermal elastic plastic fe computation can be carried out to represent mechanical response of plate bending with induction heating and predict magnitude of out of plane bending deformation it still requires lots of computer resource and computing time elastic fe computation was proposed and then employed to effectively predict deformed shape and magnitude of out of plane bending deformation when shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating as input loading can be evaluated beforehand wang et al 2013a 2016 zhou and wang 2019 with thermal analysis and mechanical analysis for plate bending with one induction heating line fig 27 shows contour plotting of plastic strains in both induction heating direction and direction perpendicular to induction heating line based on integration method with computed plastic strains the shrinkage force generated by induction heating can be evaluated by eq 1 meanwhile distribution of transverse plastic strains was also obtained as shown in fig 27 since plastic strains have gradient in the thickness direction wang et al 2017 the bending moment was generated and its magnitude then can be evaluated with eq 2 as well as the bending radius can be

v e r s e based on the computed plastic strains of thermal elastic plastic fe analyses in previous sections shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating with different material properties plate thickness and moving speed of induction heating coil can be evaluated as summarized in table 2 later they will be applied for elastic fe analysis as mechanical loading 4 4 elastic fe analysis and validation for saddle type bending when shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating were obtained and applied as the mechanical loading elastic fe analysis with shell elements model as shown in fig 28 was carried out to examine q235 ship steel plate bending with induction heating while different colors are used to mark the location of induction heating and there will be an induction heating line between adjacent parts with different colors meanwhile the examined q235 ship steel plate can be meshed with coarse shell element regardless of induction heating ron for fewer requirements of computer memory and computing time the total number of nodes and elements are 2501 and 2400 in shell elements model of q235 ship steel plate for elastic fe analysis respectively rigid body motion as shown in fig 28 was also constrained to be boundary condition during elastic fe analysis after the completion of elastic fe analysis fig 29 shows the contour plotting of out of plane bending deformation due to induction heating procedure in addition black straight line indicates the position of induction heating line which has identical position comparing to experimental observation buckling bending plate with saddle type was represented while the direction of induction heating line has a convex bending curvature and the direction perpendicular to induction heating line has a concave bending curvature wang et al 2013b wang and yi 2019 it can be concluded that the examined q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness will be buckled due to the compressive shrinkage force in direction of induction heating line caused by induction heating as well as bending moment is considered as the external disturbance to trigger the occurrence of buckling behavior when the compressive shrinkage force is bigger than the critical buckling load wang et al 2014b with further investigation on magnitude out of plane bending deformations of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 11 were summarized and compared in fig 30 which were obtained by measurement thermal elastic plastic fe analysis and elastic fe analysis fig 30 also demonstrated that points on line 2 have a concave bending profile and their magnitudes of out of plane bending deformation have good agreement with each other 4 5 elastic fe analysis and validation for sail type bending with similar computational procedure as mentioned above ah36 high tensile strength steel plate bending with induction heating was also examined shell elements model with 2501 nodes and 2400 elements for elastic fe analysis as shown in fig 31 was created and considered position of induction heating line with respect to the procedure parameters of experiment was indicated and located in the intersection line of adjacent parts with different colors meanwhile shrinkage force and bending moment summarized in table 2 were also applied for elastic fe analysis as mechanical loading to predict out of plane bending deformation and rigid body motion was prevented to be boundary condition fig 32 shows the contour plotting and distribution of computed out of plane bending deformation of examined ah36 high tensile strength steel plate by elastic fe analysis in addition plate bending with sail type can be obviously observed as well as curvatures in both length and width directions bend upward together with positive sign moreover bending deformation magnitudes of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 11 were examined again and compared for accuracy validation of computational approaches in fig 33 which were obtained by experimental measurement thermal elastic plastic fe analysis and elastic fe analysis it also can be found that computed results of elastic fe analysis agree well not only for distribution but also for magnitude of out of plane bending deformation comparing with measurement and the result of tep fe analysis deformed shape of examined ah36 high tensile strength steel plate with sail type was also observed with the bending tendency of examined points along length and width directions moreover not only deformed shape of bending plate but also magnitudes of considered points by means of thermal elastic plastic fe and elastic fe computations both have consistent feature comparing with measurement however elastic fe computation has much more advantages as effective and practical approach for engineering application which requires much less computer resource and computing time comparing to thermal elastic plastic fe computation as summarized in table 3 5 discussion and conclusions through advanced and holistic measurement framework plate bending experiment with double curvature for shipbuilding by high frequency induction

mechanical response and deformed tendency during plate bending with different procedure parameters and computed magnitudes of out of plane bending deformations of examined plates have good agreement comparing with measurement 4 plate bending mechanism was also clarified with shrinkage force and bending moment while q235 ship steel plate buckles due to large amount of shrinkage force and ah36 high tensile strength steel plate bends as sail type due to bending moments towards identical curvature 5 comparing with tep fe analysis elastic fe analysis with shrinkage force and bending moment as

22386,plate bending with double curvature is an essential procedure in shipbuilding which is also a bottleneck problem to restrict the fabrication schedule and dimensional accuracy with the induction heating technology plate bending with double curvature as saddle and sail types was conducted experimentally meanwhile due to the rated output power of induction heating heat input as well as moving speed of induction heating coil has a significant influence on maximal temperature and final bending deformation in addition out of plane bending deformation with different patterns can be observed and their magnitudes were also measured by three coordinate measuring machine tmm computational analysis with thermal elastic plastic tep and elastic fe approaches was then employed to investigate processing parameters of induction heating computed out of plane bending deformations have a good agreement with measurement about not only deformed shape but also magnitudes elastic fe computation with bending moment as input loading has much more obvious efficiency comparing to conventional tep fe computation without loss of computational accuracy moreover generation mechanism of bending

bending keywords induction heating plate bending with double curvature bending moment processing parameters fe computation 1 introduction in advanced ship design and construction curved hull structures are usually employed to enhance the hydrodynamic performance and plate bending procedure plays an important role to ensure dimensional accuracy and fabrication schedule moreover some particular ship structures such as bulbous bow and stern sections are assembled by curved plates with double curvature generally plate bending during the fabrication of curved hull structure is practiced by cold bending with rolling and mechanical pressing thermal bending such as oxygen acetylene flame heating laser heating and induction heating with the advantage of precision controlling high level of automation and others induction heating technology is increasing applied for plate bending with double curvature to guarantee required fabrication quality in shipbuilding up to now jang et al 2002 carried out a series of induction heating experiments considering the influence of plate thickness heating speed and power on bending deformation lee et al 2013 later examined high frequency induction heating on plate bending behavior of an ss400 thick plate experimentally and they pointed out that permanent out of plane bending deformation is determined by rated output power of induction heating regardless of the deformed shape with dual curvature according to the experimental test park et al 2015 concluded that the angular distortion behavior of heated plates with high frequency induction heating can be clarified with the function of heat intensity and the rigidity of heated plate as well as the size of test specimen lee and hwang 2014 employed an automatic high frequency induction heating hfih with triangular heating process for thick steel plate bending and the influence of heating patterns on out of plane bending deformation of an ss400 thick plate was examined zhang et al 2019 investigated the non dimensional relation between processing parameters and thermal bending behavior of ship hull plate with induction heating and orthogonal testing experiment was conducted to validate the critical value of processing parameters with the computational approach as well as finite element method induction heating procedure was represented for mechanism clarification of physical behavior and its processing parameters were also examined to ensure fabrication level and accuracy shen et al 2006 developed a mathematical tool to examine the temperature field during high frequency induction heating while the influences of heating parameters such as the distance between plate and induction coil frequency of induction current and the turns of induction coil on temperature profiles were also discussed zhang et al 2011 employed finite element analysis for hull plate bending with high frequency induction heating and computed results were validated by experiments with triangle heating technique bae et al 2012 examined the steel plate bending process with high frequency induction heating while computed bending deformations have good agreement with experiments in order to improve the computational efficiency elastic fe analysis with bending moment was proposed to consider the flame heating with different line heating patterns wang et al 2017 in application of shipyard park et al 2016 presented an automated thermal forming system with induction heating for shipbuilding which consists of scanning devices for measurement of plates high frequency induction heater for plate forming a computational unit for heating information and a gantry robot with six axes from the above mentioned literatures some investigations with experiment and computation on plate bending with induction heating were already achieved and presented although thermal and mechanical behaviors during the induction heating procedure were also examined holistic investigation on plate bending to objective shape of hull structure in particular curved hull structure with double curvature was still not carried out with experiment or computation by multi linear induction heating in this research hull structures with double curvature such as saddle and sail pattern were considered as research object advanced induction heating equipment with high frequency was employed for plate bending with double curvature transient temperature was measured and the relationship between moving speed of induction heating coil and maximal temperature was also established after cooling down three coordinate measuring machine tmm was then employed for bending deformation measurement in detail q235 plate with 6 mm thickness was linearly heated by six parallel induction heating lines with different moving speed and saddle type deformed shape was observed ah36 plate with 8 mm thickness was heated by five transverse and four longitudinal induction heating lines to be deformed as sail shape practical computational approach with thermal elastic plastic tep fe analysis was employed in particular elastic fe analysis with shrinkage force and bending moment as mechanical load was also proposed to efficiently predict the bending deformation without precision loss by comparing with experimental results in addition comparison of computational efficiency between conventional tep and proposed elastic fe analyses was then demonstrated 2 theorem of investigation in order to examine the plate bending with double curvature by high frequency induction heating it is desired to systematically clarify the relevant physical behavior measuring method and computational approach for mechanism understanding and processing parameters optimization the following theory and method were then introduced 2 1 behavior and principle of induction heating in nature some metals such as iron and steel has electric magnetic characteristic and induction heat will be generated as physical response when high frequency oscillatory current appears nearby due to their best magnetic hysteresis rudnev et al 2017 generally hysteresis heating occurs when the temperature is lower than curie temperature and magnetic materials will remain their electric magnetic characteristic and induction heating behavior this physical mechanism can be clarified with high permeability which is beneficial for induction heating in magnetic materials and appears when temperature is lower than curie temperature therefore induction heating is a physical process of heat generation and conduction on magnetic metals with electromagnetic induction behavior rudnev et al 2017 in detail induction heat is generated inside of steel workpiece itself due to the eddy current which is the result of high frequency oscillatory current of induction heating coil and rapidly alternating magnetic field then steel workpiece can be heated without any external heat source the heat amount generated by induction heating is significantly influenced by the distance between induction heating coil and steel workpiece meanwhile heat losses will occur due to the physical behaviors of thermal convection and radiation in addition the frequency of oscillatory current dominantly determines the penetrated depth as well as the ron of induction eddy current exists in the thickness direction of heated steel workpiece see fig 1 2 2 fe computational approach to examine mechanical response during induction heating process the thermal elastic plastic fe computation can be carried out by two steps with thermal analysis and mechanical analysis in detail temperature distribution at each time step can be easily computed with heat transfer analysis by employing a body heat source model of induction heating and then computed temperature data is applied as thermal loading for mechanical analysis while temperature dependent material properties as well as material non linear feature were considered in both analyses wang et al 2014a ma et al 2016 meanwhile mechanical analysis solves the equation of momentum conservation at the end of each time step to predict the deformed shape and magnitude of bending deformation in which initial stress is usually assumed to be zero and rigid body motion of considered steel workpiece is prevented to be boundary condition during the heating and cooling processes the plastic strain will be remained after cooling down and plastic strain is often considered as the mechanism cause of in plane shrinkage and bending deformation based on the physical behavior plastic strains close to induction heating ron can be converted to shrinkage force in longitudinal direction with eq 1 and bending moment in transverse direction with eq 2 respectively wang et al 2015 2016 when shrinkage force and bending moment generated by induction heating were obtained the mechanical response as well as bending deformation can be easily examined and represented with an elastic fe analysis wang et al 2013a 2018 1 f s h r i n k a g e e ε x p l a s t i c d y d z 2 d m z h 2 d f z h 2 e ε y p l a s t i c d a m b e n d i n g z h 2 e ε y p l a s t i c d y d z where ε x p l a s t i c and ε y p l a s t i c are the plastic strains generated by induction heating in the longitudinal and the transverse directions e is the young s modules h is the thickness of the plate with induction heating and x y z are the induction heating direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively 2 3 bending deformation mechanism with processing parameter during induction heating procedure heat is generated and temperature of steel workpiece in the local ron of eddy currents field will rapidly elevate thermal strain will be generated due to the nature of expanding with heat and contracting with cold as well as the constrain of surrounding cold metal and then elastic plastic behavior will occur and compressive plastic strain will be produced and remained after cooling down when the elevated temperature is higher than yield temperature as demonstrated in fig 2 luo et al 1997 the residual plastic strain is determined by compressive plastic strain generated during heating and tensile plastic strain generated during cooling down to ambient temperature since the geometrical features of induction heating coil and procedure parameters will influence the penetration depth distribution and magnitude of temperature through thickness direction of steel workpiece will vary the non uniform distribution of compressive plastic strain on cross section in transverse direction will cause plastic strain gradient and bending moment as well as out of plane bending deformation meanwhile compressive plastic strain along the induction heating direction will generate shrinkage force to be elementary cause of buckling behavior 3 experimental procedure and measurement for plate bending with double curvature in shipbuilding an experiment with ship steel plate was carried out by induction heating system which consists of induction heating coil water cooling recycle unit and an electronic oscillator which will generate high frequency alternating current and magnetic field as the basic setup alternating current power supply will provide electricity with low voltage but large current and high frequency meanwhile induction heating coil is usually made of copper tubing with water cooling while its diameter shape and the number of turns will together determine the efficiency of induction heating temperature field pattern and bending moment in this experiment an advanced induction heating equipment as shown in fig 3 with high frequency 30 khz 100 khz was employed which rated working power output current output voltage are 25 kw 1060 a and 24 v respectively meanwhile an additional water cooling system with 12 kw of rated power 50 000 kcal h of cooling capacity and 12 5 m3 h of circulating water quantity was also applied to make sure induction heating procedure with stable moving speed during plate bending experiment a portable moving car with fixed track was also used in order to examine the temperature profile during induction heating transient temperature and thermal cycle with moving of induction heating coil were measured by means of k type thermal couple in real time which will be used to establish the relationship between induction heating velocity and heated maximal temperature after cooling down to ambient temperature three coordinate measuring machine was employed to obtain the geometrical profile and out of plane bending deformation 3 1 temperature measurement during induction heating during the induction heating for plate bending heat is generated due to the alternating current and corresponding magnetic field and temperature distribution as well as temperature gradient in thickness direction then will be caused with thermal transfer which is generally considered as the reason of bending moment and bending deformation therefore it is necessary to measure and analysis the feature of induction heating temperature during experiment of plate bending by induction heating in advance in detail transient temperature measuring device with k type thermal couple platinum rhodium alloy was employed to obtain thermal cycles of several measured points as shown in fig 4 thermal couple as a kind of temperature sensor consists of two dissimilar electrical conductors with a forming of electrical junction which can generate a temperature dependent voltage as the result of thermal electrical effect or thermal electromotance before the experiment k type thermal couple with platinum rhodium was fixed to the accurate location of plate by special tack welding machine and then transient temperature measuring device can simultaneously obtain and save temperature data of connected thermal couples by measuring frequency with 16 hz sec during the induction heating based on the electric magnetic behavior and curie temperature 8 cases with different moving speeds of induction heating coil as summarized in table 1 were carried out with the moving car and its fixed track since the rated power of high frequency induction heating equipment as mentioned above is 25 kw energy per length with different moving speed of induction heating coil then can be calculated as summarized in table 1 meanwhile the relationship between linear energy of induction heating and measured maximal temperature during induction heating can be established as shown in fig 5 in detail the horizontal direction means linear energy which is determined by rated output power and moving speed of induction heating coil and the upright direction means measured maximal temperature with different linear energy as well as moving speed of induction heating coil it can be obviously concluded that maximal temperature of measured point will increase according to the increasing of linear energy as well as the decreasing of moving speed of induction heating coil in theory the maximal temperature of heated ship steel plate will keep constant value when it approximates to the curie temperature 3 2 bending deformation measurement in general advanced measurement approach of out of plane bending deformation can be divided into coordinate measuring and optical scanning approaches three coordinate measuring approach is usually employed to measure the geometrical characteristic of examined structure with high precision while probe as mechanical sensor controlled by computer will touch structure surface hocken and pereira 2016 as a measuring result point cloud which describes the geometrical characteristic of measured surface can be obtained while this point cloud has a regular distance and topological feature and will be used to establish the geometrical profile with numerical algorithms in post processing in detail after cooling down and with surface cleaning to avoid the measuring disturbance rust removal procedure was carried out on the measuring surface beforehand then three coordinate measuring machine tmm as shown in fig 6 was employed to obtain the coordinate of measured point cloud which was then used to establish the geometrical profile with measured data analysis meanwhile the measured ship steel plate should be fixed to the measuring platform with fixture or clamping which will make sure the measuring precision and completion of measuring procedure as shown in fig 7 furthermore fig 7 also shows the measuring procedure with computer controlling in which referenced coordinate system should be confirmed before measuring the number and locations of measured points can be fixed due to the balance of measuring cost and required measuring precision thus the distance between each adjacent point is eventually 15 mm with about 2 μm tolerance with analysis of measured data out of plane bending deformation can be visualized with contour plotting by means of post process and magnitude of out of plane bending deformations at each measured points also can be obtained for computer results validation later 3 3 plate bending experiment with saddle type with experiment of plate bending by single linear induction heating mentioned above mechanical response was observed and examined hull plate with double curvature for shipbuilding was then considered in detail as the typical designed geometry of ship hull plate plate bending experiment for saddle shape opposite curvatures was carried out by means of multiple induction heating lines a ship steel plate with 300 mm in length 200 mm in width and 6 mm in thickness was examined while its yield stress is about 235 mpa processing parameters during plate bending with six induction heating lines were indicated in fig 8 which were practiced sequentially in addition moving speed of induction heating coil was about 13 75 mm s for line 1 4 and 23 58 mm s for line 5 6 after cooling down geometrical profile of deformed plate was measured with advanced three coordinates measuring machine with high precision global classis sr series with 2 μm tolerance in detail operation of plate surface clearance was firstly carried out to ensure the measured accuracy and bending plate was then fixed on the platform as shown in fig 9 later three points were selected and marked to create a referenced plane coordinate of examined bending plate and magnitude of bending deformation were obtained while graphical visualization with contour plotting was demonstrated in fig 10 it can be seen that the examined ship steel plate bends upward in heating line direction while bends downward in the direction perpendicular to heating line meanwhile the bending curvatures in length and width directions have the opposite sign which is considered as the mechanical feature and cause to be saddle type of bending plate moreover out of plane bending deformation of points on line 1 and line 2 as indicated in fig 11 was examined and drawn in fig 12 due to plate bending with saddle shape it can be obviously concluded that bending tendency of points on line 1 longitudinal direction is overall upward and bending tendency of points on line 2 transverse direction is contrary downward 3 4 plate bending experiment with sail type furthermore a ship steel plate with high tensile strength steel ah36 which yield stress is about 360 mpa was then examined for plate bending with above employed induced heating equipment and geometrical profile of examined ship steel plate is 300 mm in length 200 mm in width and 8 mm in thickness as shown in fig 13 the route and sequence of multi induction heating lines were indicated while moving speeds of induced heating coil for all heating lines in both length and width directions are all about 15 mm s with same procedure comparing to above measurement of bending deformation three coordinated measurement machine tmm was employed to obtain the geometrical profile of examined ah36 ship steel plate after cooling down to ambient temperature and plate surface clearance operation while bending plate was also fixed on the platform as shown in fig 14 with measured data analysis deformed shape of bending plate with sail type by means of induction heating procedure as mentioned in fig 13 was established with contour plotting as shown in fig 15 fig 15 also obviously shows that bending plate with sail type bends downward in both longitudinal and transverse directions and has a geometry feature with positive riemann space due to thermal mechanical response of induction heating in both length and width directions moreover points on line 1 and line 2 as indicated in fig 11 was examined again their out of plane bending deformations were demonstrated in fig 16 it also can be seen that out of plane bending distortions bend downward together and directions of bending curvature are identical 4 computational analysis for plate bending due to experimental cost and time consumption computational analysis with high performance computer and advanced numerical approach was accepted and widely employed for out of plane bending deformation prediction during plate bending with induction heating in general there are two elementary computation approaches one is thermal elastic plastic fe analysis to represent the entire thermal transfer behavior and its generated mechanical response and the other is elastic fe analysis concentrating on residual bending deformation with bending moment and shrinkage force caused by induction heating 4 1 tep fe analysis for saddle type bending from above mentioned experiments there are two examined bending plates which are q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness and ah36 high tensile strength steel plate with 8 mm in thickness solid brick elements model as shown in fig 17 was made for thermal elastic plastic fe computation and geometrical profile is identical with experiment specimen of q235 ship steel plate mesh size in thickness direction is 0 5 mm and which is 5 mm in both length and width directions therefore the total number of node and element are 32 513 and 28 800 as indicated in fig 17 respectively in addition non linear temperature dependent material properties as shown in fig 18 were employed during thermal analysis body heat source with uniform flux density was employed to model the induction heating while the complex electric magnetic physical behavior can be avoided considering the rated output power and moving speed of induction heating coil in the previous experiments the heat input per length can be calculated and applied to the heated ron which is determined by the size of induction heating coil and penetration depth meanwhile rigid body motion as show in fig 17 was prevented to be boundary condition to predict the out of plane bending deformation according to the actual experiment an in house code programmed with the theory mentioned above was employed for thermal elastic plastic fe computation fig 19 shows the transient temperature distribution during the induction heating it can be seen that proposed body heat source can represent the similar temperature filed comparing to the experimental observation in detail the ron with maximal transient temperature above 700 c is almost identical with the size of induction heating coil as demonstrated in fig 20 and this maximal temperature approximates to the curie point but never exceeds the temperature of curie point after cooling down to ambient temperature out of plane bending deformation as well as displacement in thickness direction can be computed as shown in fig 21 while the computed bending plate with convex curvature in length direction and concave curvature in width direction was represented this kind of bending type was generated by means of compressive shrinkage force along the induction heating direction and the examined q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness lose its stability with buckling behavior as saddle type the comparison of magnitude of out of plane bending deformation comparing with measurement will be achieved later moreover residual plastic strain in the direction perpendicular to induction heating was also obtained which contour plotting distribution is demonstrated in fig 22 4 2 tep fe analysis for sail type bending similar investigation procedure mentioned above was employed again to examine the thermal mechanical response during the plate bending with sail type by induction heating while ah36 high tensile strength steel plate with 8 mm in thickness was selected solid brick elements model of examined ah36 high tensile strength steel plate as shown in fig 23 was also made for thermal elastic plastic fe computation while the total number of node and element are 42 517 and 38 400 respectively in addition non linear temperature dependent material properties of ah36 were employed meanwhile rigid body motion as show in fig 23 was also prevented to be boundary condition to predict the out of plane bending deformation during thermal analysis with body heat source transient temperature profile was obtained and which was applied as thermal loading to examine the mechanical response during induction heating as shown in fig 24 contour plotting of maximal temperature is demonstrated while the ron with maximal transient temperature above 700 c is consistent with the applied procedure parameters of induction heating after cooling down to ambient temperature out of plane bending deformation as well as displacement in thickness direction can be computed as shown in fig 25 which has a geometrical feature with upward bending in both length and width directions as well as positive riemann space as sail type bending plate curvatures with same sign is caused by bending moment in the direction perpendicular to induction heating line moreover residual plastic strains in both length and width directions were also obtained which contour plotting distributions are demonstrated in fig 26 4 3 evaluation of bending moment and shrinkage force although thermal elastic plastic fe computation can be carried out to represent mechanical response of plate bending with induction heating and predict magnitude of out of plane bending deformation it still requires lots of computer resource and computing time elastic fe computation was proposed and then employed to effectively predict deformed shape and magnitude of out of plane bending deformation when shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating as input loading can be evaluated beforehand wang et al 2013a 2016 zhou and wang 2019 with thermal analysis and mechanical analysis for plate bending with one induction heating line fig 27 shows contour plotting of plastic strains in both induction heating direction and direction perpendicular to induction heating line based on integration method with computed plastic strains the shrinkage force generated by induction heating can be evaluated by eq 1 meanwhile distribution of transverse plastic strains was also obtained as shown in fig 27 since plastic strains have gradient in the thickness direction wang et al 2017 the bending moment was generated and its magnitude then can be evaluated with eq 2 as well as the bending radius can be obtained with respect to bending moment by eq 3 3 d θ b d m e i z h 2 b ε p l a s t i c d a i θ t r a n s v e r s e 1 h 3 12 z h 2 ε t r a n s v e r s e p l a s t i c d y d z 1 h 3 12 1 e m t r a n s v e r s e based on the computed plastic strains of thermal elastic plastic fe analyses in previous sections shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating with different material properties plate thickness and moving speed of induction heating coil can be evaluated as summarized in table 2 later they will be applied for elastic fe analysis as mechanical loading 4 4 elastic fe analysis and validation for saddle type bending when shrinkage force and bending moment caused by induction heating were obtained and applied as the mechanical loading elastic fe analysis with shell elements model as shown in fig 28 was carried out to examine q235 ship steel plate bending with induction heating while different colors are used to mark the location of induction heating and there will be an induction heating line between adjacent parts with different colors meanwhile the examined q235 ship steel plate can be meshed with coarse shell element regardless of induction heating ron for fewer requirements of computer memory and computing time the total number of nodes and elements are 2501 and 2400 in shell elements model of q235 ship steel plate for elastic fe analysis respectively rigid body motion as shown in fig 28 was also constrained to be boundary condition during elastic fe analysis after the completion of elastic fe analysis fig 29 shows the contour plotting of out of plane bending deformation due to induction heating procedure in addition black straight line indicates the position of induction heating line which has identical position comparing to experimental observation buckling bending plate with saddle type was represented while the direction of induction heating line has a convex bending curvature and the direction perpendicular to induction heating line has a concave bending curvature wang et al 2013b wang and yi 2019 it can be concluded that the examined q235 ship steel plate with 6 mm in thickness will be buckled due to the compressive shrinkage force in direction of induction heating line caused by induction heating as well as bending moment is considered as the external disturbance to trigger the occurrence of buckling behavior when the compressive shrinkage force is bigger than the critical buckling load wang et al 2014b with further investigation on magnitude out of plane bending deformations of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 11 were summarized and compared in fig 30 which were obtained by measurement thermal elastic plastic fe analysis and elastic fe analysis fig 30 also demonstrated that points on line 2 have a concave bending profile and their magnitudes of out of plane bending deformation have good agreement with each other 4 5 elastic fe analysis and validation for sail type bending with similar computational procedure as mentioned above ah36 high tensile strength steel plate bending with induction heating was also examined shell elements model with 2501 nodes and 2400 elements for

intersection line of adjacent parts with different colors meanwhile shrinkage force and bending moment summarized in table 2 were also applied for elastic fe analysis as mechanical loading to predict out of plane bending deformation and rigid body motion was prevented to be boundary condition fig 32 shows the contour plotting and distribution of computed out of plane bending deformation of examined ah36 high tensile strength steel plate by elastic fe analysis in addition plate bending with sail type can be obviously observed as well as curvatures in both length and width directions bend upward together with positive sign moreover bending deformation magnitudes of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 11 were examined again and compared for accuracy validation of computational approaches in fig 33 which were obtained by experimental measurement thermal elastic plastic fe analysis and elastic fe analysis it also can be found that computed results of elastic fe analysis agree well not only for distribution but also for magnitude of out of plane bending deformation comparing with measurement and the result of tep fe analysis deformed shape of examined ah36 high tensile strength steel plate with sail type was also observed with the bending tendency of examined points along length and width directions moreover not only deformed shape of bending plate but also magnitudes of considered points by means of thermal elastic plastic fe and elastic fe computations both have consistent feature comparing with measurement however elastic fe computation has much more advantages as effective and practical approach for engineering application which requires much less computer resource and computing time comparing to thermal elastic plastic fe computation as summarized in table 3 5 discussion and conclusions through advanced and holistic measurement framework plate bending experiment with double curvature for shipbuilding by high frequency induction heating was completely conducted and computation approach with considering procedure parameters of induction heating to examine out of plane bending deformation was also carried out it was demonstrated that deformed shape and magnitude of out of plane bending deformation obtained by tep and elastic fe computations both have good agreement with measurement the following conclusions also can be drawn 1 double curvature plate bending experiments with different material and plate thickness were achieved by high frequency induction heating with different procedure parameters 2 three coordinate measuring machine tmm was employed to obtain the spatial coordinates of deformed plate with double curvature and with measured data analysis q235 ship steel plate bending with saddle type and ah36 high tensile strength steel plate bending with sail type were obviously observed by graphical visualization of geometrical profile 3 both tep and elastic fe computations examined the mechanical response and deformed tendency during plate bending with different procedure parameters and computed magnitudes of out of plane bending deformations of examined plates have good agreement comparing with measurement 4 plate bending mechanism was also clarified with shrinkage force and bending moment while q235 ship steel plate buckles due to large amount of shrinkage force and ah36 high tensile strength steel plate bends as sail type due to bending moments towards identical curvature 5 comparing with tep fe analysis elastic fe analysis with shrinkage force and bending moment as

speed ship with single rudder single propeller spsr or twin rudder twin propeller tptr configurations a 3 dof modular mathematical model or empirical approaches can be utilized in mansim in addition to certain maneuvers of ships such as turning or zigzag free maneuver can also be simulated input parameters required to solve the equations of motion can be estimated practically by several empirical formulas embedded in the software graphical user interface of the code has simple design to enable users to perform maneuvering calculations easily in addition to results such as advance transfer tactical diameters etc on the user interface simulation results can also be analyzed graphically thus it is possible to examine the variation of kinematic parameters during simulation using the code maneuverabilities of a tanker ship kvlcc2 and a surface combatant dtmb5415 is investigated and computed results are compared with free running data for validation purpose mansim can be advantageous for parametric studies and it is a valuable tool especially for sensitivity analysis on ship maneuvering the software is available online at www mansim org the effects of variation of hydrodynamic

highly effective in maneuvering motion another interesting outcome of this study is identification of the significance of third order coupled derivatives for dtmb5415 hull effects of linear

challenging topics in ship hydrodynamics maneuvering simulations are generally conducted by using cfd based or system based sb methods cfd based method can be defined as a direct simulation of the actual maneuvering motion including the steering rudder and rotating propeller bhushan et al 2009 carrica et al 2013 broglia et al 2015 ohashi et al 2018 duman and bal 2019 from practical perspective this approach is not feasible as it requires enourmous computational power to perform full time domain simulations on the other hand sb methods include the solution of equations of motion for every time step using the previously calculated hydrodynamic derivatives the latter method is more practical than the former however accuracy of these calculations directly depends on selected mathematical model and hydrodynamic derivatives involved guo and zou 2017 toxopeus et al 2018 sukas et al 2019 in the recent literature current trend to express the hydrodynamic forces and moments is adopting either abkowitz model abkowitz 1964 or mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 yoshimura 2005 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in abkowitz model hull rudder and propeller are considered as one rigid body and equations of motion are defined by third order taylor series function on contrary to abkowitz model mmg model is a simplified mathematical model that decomposes total hydrodynamic force and moment acting on the ship into hull rudder and propeller components one of the biggest advantages of mmg model is that it allows to take the hull rudder propeller interactions into account there are various maneuvering simulation results using mmg model with different modified versions fang et al 2005 kang et al 2008 he et al 2016 yasukawa et al 2019 there are several prediction methods proposed in literature to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives in mmg models sukas et al 2017a 2017b for example yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 carried out circular motion tests cmt to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives and it was noted that cmt is a suitable method since it has zero frequency of motion which reduces the uncertainties for hydrodynamic forces and moment pmm planar motion mechanism tests are also widely used to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives cura hochbaum 2011 obreja et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2012 yoon et al 2015 duman and bal 2017 accuracy of results based on the selection of pmm motion frequency and amplitude may even change however this issue can be handled if pmm motion parameters are selected properly according to ittc recommendations ittc 7 5 02 06 02 2014 recent study has shown that changing the advancing speed of ship in pmm tests has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic derivatives in mmg model zhang et al 2019 in addition to these methods liu et al 2017 presented an integrated empirical maneuvering model for inland vessels furthermore all hydrodynamic derivatives and propeller rudder parameters in mmg model were estimated by various regression formulas selected from literature on the other hand system identification techniques have also been used for estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives zhang and zou 2013 sutulo and soares 2014 yoon et al 2015 xu et al 2019 in order to predict maneuverability of any ship using system based approach these methods can be utilized to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives propeller rudder parameters in this study a new user friendly ship maneuvering code called mansim maneuvering simulation based on standard mmg mathematical model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 is introduced the code includes several empirical relations suggested by various researchers working on the topic and is for those who would like to have a fundamental background of the maneuvering abilities a ship during early design stages the primary aim here by developing such a code is to make the maneuvering predictions of ships easier by using a simple user interface the software allows to simulate the turning and zigzag maneuvers of ships in addition a free maneuver option is also available with unlimited number of rudder angles which means one can simulate free maneuver of any ship in mansim by importing a txt file that includes rudder angles with respect to times mansim displays the maneuvering results such as advance distance transfer distance tactical diameter etc input parameters of the mathematical model such as hydrodynamic derivatives and coefficients related to the propeller and rudder can also be estimated by several empirical formulas embedded in the software the empirical approach provided by lyster and knights 1979 may also be preferred as a second option to have a basic understanding of maneuvering abilities of a ship following this section section 2 presents the theoretical background of mansim including the empirical approach suggested by lyster and knights 1979 and mmg models for spsr and tptr ships section 3 gives the empirical formulas embedded in software to estimate input parameters of mmg model gui of code was briefly introduced and sample screenshots were given in section 4 in section 5 maneuverability of two benchmark ships kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 was examined for validation purposes and the results predicted were compared with the free running test data in addition the effect of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on general maneuvering performance was investigated by performing a parametrical sensitivity analysis finally section 6 includes brief summary and possible future studies about mansim 2 theoretical background in mansim maneuvering performance of ships can be predicted by using either the empirical model provided by lyster and knights 1979 or the mathematical models presented by khanfir et al 2011 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 further details are explained in the following sub sections 2 1 empirical approach range maximum and minimum values of parameters for ships used by lyster and knights 1979 are given in table 1 empirical formulations have been derived based on the model experiments turning maneuver indices of spsr ships can be calculated by the following semi empirical expressions 1 std l 4 19 203 c

the ship parameters related to rudder are rudder angle δ span length h chord length c and number of rudders n r 2 2 modular mathematical model in mmg model hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship are divided into different parts contributors such as hull rudder s and propeller s major advantage of this method compared to traditional approach abkowitz type is including interaction effects of hull rudder s and hull propeller s mansim contains certain assumptions due to the implementation of mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 these assumptions are given below hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship treat quasi steadily cruise speed of the ship is sufficiently low so that wave making resistance is ignored metacentric height gm is relatively large thus effects of roll coupling are negligible in the present version of mansim mathematical models for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships are available to predict the maneuvering performance in calm water condition following sections present the coordinate system non dimensionalization and the mathematical models for spsr and tptr ships respectively 2 2 1 coordinate system and non dimensionalization the basic dynamic of motion is described by using newton s second law of motion thus two different coordinate systems can be defined for a maneuvering ship earth fixed coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 and ship fixed o x y z coordinate system as shown in fig 1 here heading angle ψ refers to angle between x and x 0 axis the difference between ship s heading and actual course direction velocity vector at cog is drift angle β tan 1 v u the rudder angle δ is positive while rotating to starboard side u and v denote velocity components in x and y directions respectively r is the yaw rate that can also be defined as r ψ t the speed of ship is indicated as u u 2 v 2 in mansim hydrodynamic forces and moment mass added mass moment of inertia added moment of inertia and other kinematical parameters are non dimensionalized as given in table 2 2 2 2 mathematical model maneuverability of only low speed ships in the horizontal plane with sufficiently large gm is considered in the mathematical model of mansim ship motions withn six degree of freedom 6 dof were reduced to 3 dof under the following assumptions vertical motions heave pitch and roll are ignored then w p q w p q

r and p refer to hull rudder and propeller respectively 3 dof motion equations can be written in matrix form as follows 15 a c c m 1 p c v e l where a c c matrix includes acceleration terms a c c u v r t p forces and moments p x h x r x p y h y r n h n r t and v e l the velocity terms v e l u v r t m 1 is the inverse of mass matrix and c is the coriolis matrix mass matrix m and coriolis matrix c are given as follows 16a m m m x 0 0 0 m m y x g m 0 x g m i z g x g 2 m j z 16b c 0 m m y r x g m r m m x r 0 0 x g m r 0 0 using all these matrices eqn 15 can be written explicitly as 17 u v r 1 m

solution moment of inertia around z axis in the mass matrix m is not given by the user but assumed as approximately i z m 0 25 l p p 2 external forces and moment given in the right hand side rhs of eqn 13 are explained in the following sub sections 2 2 2 1 hull forces and moment hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on both spsr and tptr hulls are expressed as follows yasukawa and yoshimura 2015

all coefficients here x v v y v v v y v r r n r r r etc are known as hydrodynamic derivatives or maneuvering coefficients 2 2 2 2 propeller forces and moment propeller surge force x p is calculated for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships with the parameters given in table 3 note that side force y p and yaw moment n p due to propeller are neglected as they have smaller magnitudes compared to those of hull and rudder components the superscripts p and s in table 3 represent port and starboard propellers respectively here t p is propeller thrust deduction factor in maneuvering motion n p is propeller rotation rate and d p is propeller diameter k 0 k 1 and k 2 represent open water characteristics of propeller for expressing k t w p 0 denotes the effective wake fraction at propeller position in straight motion and x p is non dimensional longitudinal position of propeller from midship 2 2 2 3 rudder forces and moment forces and moment related to rudder x r y r n r for single rudder ships are calculated based on rudder normal force f n rudder angle δ and hull rudder interaction coefficients t r a h x h by the following equations yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ 19 n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where t r is steering resistance deduction factor a h and x h are rudder lateral force increase factor and non

the offsets of rudders from the ship s centerline parameters required for prediction of rudder normal force s f n during maneuver are given in table 4 here ε κ l r and γ r are unknown rudder parameters that need to be estimated empirically numerically or experimentally a r is the profile area of movable part of rudder λ is aspect ratio of rudder and η is ratio of propeller diameter to rudder span note that equation provided for rudder lift gradient coefficient f α is suggested by fujii and tuda 1961 3 empirical equations all input parameters should be inserted to obtain full maneuvering performance of a ship in mansim in case no input data is available for hydrodynamic parameters of hull rudder and propeller empirical relations embedded in mansim can be applied these empirical equations are taken from various studies in related literature from practical point of view empirical formulas may be useful to assess the order of magnitudes of parameters in the preliminary design stage the empirical formulas embedded in mansim are given in the following sub sections 3 1 added mass and added moment of inertia empirical formulas embedded in software for the estimation of added masses m x m y and added moment of inertia j z are given in table 5 all formulas provided are based on the main particulars of ship such as m l b d and c b it should be noted that m x is advised to be taken approximately as 3 6 of ship mass m in clarke et al 1983 where it is taken as 5 of ship mass in mansim 3 2 hydrodynamic derivatives in this section the empirical formulas existed in the software to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives are presented table 6 table 7 and table 8 show the empirical formulas provided for derivatives related to surge force x sway force y and yaw moment n respectively total resistance coefficient x 0 is calculated by holtrop method holtrop 1978 note that the accuracy of empirical relations may change with range of ship parameters and mathematical model used in the corresponding study note that all empirical equations given in tables 6 8 have been rearranged according to non dimensionalization procedure used in mansim 3 3 self propulsion parameters empirical relations used to estimate wake fraction coefficient in straight motion w p 0 and thrust deduction factor t p are given in table 9 and table 10 respectively empirical equations provided for self propulsion parameters are based on the main particulars of ship and propeller such as l b c b and d p apart from these parameters open water characteristics of the propeller k 0 k 1 k 2 and the propeller revolution n p must be known self propulsion parameters given in mmg model can also be obtained by traditional engineering approach as explained in kinaci et al 2018 3 4 rudder parameters empirical relations embedded in mansim for estimation of hull rudder interaction coefficients t r a h x h are given in tables 11 13 here t r is the deduction factor of rudder resistance due to existence of ship hull a h denotes the factor of lateral force acting on the hull during steering and x h represents the application point of this lateral force component in longitudinal direction during steering empirical formulas for rudder force parameters are based on the main particulars of ship such as l b d c b alongside of hull rudder interaction coefficients there are some necessary coefficients ε κ l r γ to be known according to mmg model to predict rudder normal force f n empirical relations for these coefficients given in related literature are presented in tables 14 17 4 graphical user interface graphical user interface gui of mansim provides an easy utilization to use mathematical models and empirical approaches and has been designed to be a practical tool for ship maneuvering simulations mathematical models embedded in mansim are available for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships to simulate turning zigzag and free maneuvers in calm water mathematical models for spsr and tptr ships were explained in detail in section 2 2 in addition to mathematical models turning maneuver of single propeller and twin propeller ships can be predicted based on the empirical relations provided by lyster and knights 1979 details of this approach are given in section 2 1 a flow diagramme of gui of mansim is shown in fig 2 main solver code and functions of mansim were developed in matlab environment gui was created with matlab guide layout editor which allows user to design different kinds of user interfaces with some basic tools menus toolbars buttons sliders etc in the input section of mansim parameters required for mathematical model can be imported from a premade txt file using the corresponding icon in toolbar instead of filling the text boxes one by one alternatively if user has no input parameters except the main dimensions of ship all inputs related to hull propeller s and rudder s can be calculated automatically by mansim using available empirical formulas embedded in software obtained outputs can be examined on user interface or can be exported as dat file it is also possible to visualize the trajectory of ships during turning zigzag free maneuvers as 2d animation sample screenshots of input and output sections of mansim are shown in figs 3 4 pop ups near some parameters in the input screen are used for selecting empirical formulas embedded in the code note that the parameters of propeller and rudder in tptr option have double values different from spsr configuration since tptr ships may have different values for each parameter of rudder and propeller 5 application of mansim to benchmark ships in this section turning and zigzag maneuvers computed by mansim were validated for two benchmark ships namely kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 hulls kvlcc2 tanker is a spsr ship while dtmb5415 has a tptr configuration mathematical models for these type of ships are available in mansim and these models are described in section 2 2 available experimental and computational results for hydrodynamic derivatives rudder force and self propulsion parameters were used to compare the turning and zigzag maneuvers for both ships numerically obtained hydrodynamic derivatives have free surface effects taken into account since both ships have relatively high froude numbers kinaci et al 2016 simulation results were compared with free running data available in literature furthermore influence of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on maneuvering indices such as advance tactical diameter overshoot angles etc were investigated systematically by performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis 5 1 simulation of turning and zigzag maneuvers of kvlcc2 turning and zigzag maneuvers of full scale kvlcc2 tanker have been simulated by mansim by using hydrodynamic derivatives rudder and propeller parameters given in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 who have conducted circular motion and rudder force tests for the 1 110 scaled model of kvlcc2 free running results are also available for this ship and these tests have been carried out by marin for the 1 45 7 scaled model ftp ftp forcetechnology com maneuvering results of 35 and 35 turning circle and 10 10 10 10 20 20 20 20 zigzag maneuvers predicted by mansim were compared with results of free running tests for full scale kvlcc2 input parameters of mansim for the prediction of maneuvering performance are given in table 18 comparison of results for port and starboard turnings are shown in figs 5 and 6 note that both results are in good agreement turning maneuver indices such as advance ad transfer tr tactical diameter td steady turning diameter std steady yaw rate syr steady turning speed sts and steady drift angle sda were obtained for the full scale kvlcc2 tanker and shown in table 19 it can be said that the results calculated by mansim agree well with the free running data history of kinematical parameters was underpredicted slightly except steady yaw rate that has a perfect match largest difference is around 20 in speed reduction however this discrepancy can also be attributed to the differences in propeller rotation rate calculations are based on the self propulsion point of the full scale ship whereas the free running tests are conducted by self propulsion point of model ship this is most likely the primary reason of differences in the turning circle trajectories it can also be stated that the results of empirical approach seem to be in accordance with experiments comparison of various type of predicted zigzag maneuvers with free running data for full scale kvlcc2 is shown in figs 7 10 agreement in the first overshoot angles oa are better than the second overshoot angles for both 10 10 and 10 10 zigzag maneuvers oas in 20 20 and 20 20 zigzag maneuvers are shown in figs 9 and 10 and general trend of zigzag motion agree well with the free running data it can also be deduced from these figures that the phase shifts in trajectories are generally caused by the mismatch in rudder execution times maneuvering indices of zigzag motion are considered as 1 s t and 2 n d oas for 10 10 10 10 20 20 and 20 20 maneuvers and comparison of results are given in table 20 scale effect could be a reason for these discrepancies since the hydrodynamic derivatives and other parameters have been obtained at model scale of ship furthermore a more precise prediction method may be required to improve the accuracy of results instead of using empirical approaches for the terms of added mass and added moment of inertia it should also be noted that the accuracy of prediction was found to be strongly related with the initial conditions approach speed rudder angle propeller rate etc in zigzag maneuvers 5 2 simulation of turning and zigzag maneuvers of dtmb5415 after performing a maneuvering simulation for kvlcc2 a system based simulation was also carried out for full scale dtmb5415 surface combatant by using mansim to predict its turning and zigzag maneuverabilities hydrodynamic derivatives and other parameters related to the propeller and rudder were computed by cfd for the 1 46 588 scaled model of dtmb5415 hull sukas et al 2019 since dtmb5415 has a tptr configuration propeller and rudder parameters may show difference due to asymmetric flow around the control surfaces during maneuvering motion for validation system based sb simulation results of 35 and 35 turning maneuvers and 20 20 zigzag manuever were compared with those of free running tests carried out by marin ftp ftp forcetechnology com input parameters of mansim for full scale dtmb5415 hull are given in table 21 parameters with superscripts s and p indicate the values for starboard and port sides respectively predicted results of trajectory yaw rate and speed loss were compared with experimental data for 35 and 35 turning maneuvers and shown in figs 11 and 12 according to the results shown in figs 12 and 13 free running data seems to have larger difference in port and starboard turnings than those of mansim this discrepancy in experiments can be due to asymmetry between the values of rudder parameters for port and starboard turnings on the other hand there is a large relative difference between mansim and free running data in starboard turning for dtmb5415 hull such difference is most likely due to symmetry assumption for the rudder and propeller parameters in cfd analyses because all necessary rudder and propeller parameters of dtmb5415 hull were estimated by cfd analyses 3 for port turning additionally it was assumed that these parameters are identical symmetrical with the starboard turning another possible reason for the discrepancies in figs 12 13 may be caused by neglecting the roll coupled effects for dtmb5415 hull yaw rate of ship was slightly overestimated by mansim which leads to a smaller turning trajectory prediction speed reduction percentages during maneuver were estimated higher than the free running results for both side turnings turning maneuver indices of full scale dtmb5415 are given in table 22 the results obtained by empirical approach also seem to be underpredicted as compared to the experiments predicted heading rudder angles and trajectory for 20 20 zigzag maneuver were also compared with free running data and shown in fig 13 despite a good agreement of the predicted overshoot angles with the experiments there is a discrepancy in trajectories due to the early execution time of second and third deflections of rudder in the system based simulation maneuvering indices of zigzag motion were compared in terms of 1 s t and 2 n d oas and given in table 23 as mentioned previously accuracy of results can be influenced by slight differences with the experimental procedure such as initial conditions of the model it can also be noted that the results by mansim are based on self propulsion point of the full scale ship whereas free running tests are conducted by self propulsion point of the model ship this can be another reason for the differences in the turning and zigzag trajectories of dtmb5415 hull 5 3 sensitivity analysis of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters standard mmg model used in mansim consists total of 17 hydrodynamic derivatives in the maneuvering equations of motion in addition propeller and rudder parameters are included into these equations to simulate free running tests utilizing the user interface of mansim parametrical studies such as sensitivity analysis can be performed readily effect of any parameter on general maneuvering performance of ships can be investigated in detail here a sensitivity analysis was performed for kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 ships to investigate the effect of each hydrodynamic derivative and rudder parameters on the turning and zigzag maneuverabilities 35 turning and 20 20 zigzag maneuvers were selected as sample cases to be examined influence of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives rudder parameters on maneuvering indices such as advance ad transfer tr tactical diameter td steady turning diameter std and overshoot angles oa were investigated original value of parameters was increased separately by 25 and these values were used in the mathematical model sensitivity analysis was carried out by using the index proposed by sen 2000 this analysis was adopted to examine the variation of maneuvering indices caused by changes in each hydrodynamic derivative and rudder parameter sensitivity index s is represented as given in eqn 21 21 s r r r h h h where r and h denote the original values of maneuvering index and corresponding hydrodynamic derivative rudder parameter respectively r and h represent increased values by 25 after calculating s all these values of parameters are summed up and a total value for each indice is obtained then sensitivity index for each parameter is divided by the total value of this indice for example percentage of the effect of x 0 in advance is calculated by 22 s x 0 a d 100 s x 0 s a d here s x 0 a d denotes the effect of x 0 in percentages s x 0 is the sensitivity index of x 0 and s a d is the total sensitivity index value for advance index sensitivity of each parameter as a percentage for each maneuvering index for kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 are given in tables 24 and 25 in these tables parameters which have greater value than or at least equal to 10 were considered to be highly effective as shown in bold form parameters which are between 3 and 10 were considered to have mediocre at best as shown in underlined form according to table 24 hydrodynamic derivatives related to surge force x have lower effect on the obtained results than that of sway force and yaw moment derivatives only resistance coefficient x 0 has a moderate effect on transfer tactical diameter and second overshoot angles first order derivatives seem to have a strong influence on maneuvers especially on zigzag indices where n v has the highest impact among all high order and coupled derivatives have lower effect on maneuvering indices except n v v r terms of added mass and added moment of inertia have a moderate effect on first overshoot angle while only m y has a moderate effect on steady turning radius rudder parameters have also major influence on maneuvering indices particularly variation of ε and κ greatly affects the turning and zigzag maneuvers of ship it can briefly be stated for sensitivity analysis of kvlcc2 tanker that the overshoot angles are more sensitive to the variations of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters than those of turning maneuver in addition advance distance and steady turning diameter seem to be the least and most influenced indices by the variation of parameters in turning maneuver respectively table 25 shows the sensitivity indices of turning and zigzag maneuver of dtmb5415 hull note that the parameters of port and starboard rudders of dtmb5415 are increased together similar to kvlcc2 hull n v was found to be the most dominant linear derivative in both turning and zigzag maneuvers of dtmb5415 hull nonlinear derivatives have small effects except n r r r which affects the manuevers moderately coupled derivatives related to the yaw moment n v v r n v r r have relatively major impact as compared to those of surge and sway forces x v v x r r x v r y r r r and m x have almost no influence on the indices of turning maneuver rudder parameters have a significant effect on the maneuvers rather than the hydrodynamic derivatives additionally similar to kvlcc2 case advance distance was found to be the least influenced index from the variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on the whole it can be noted for both ships that the derivatives based on yaw moment are highly influential on turning and zigzag maneuvers indices of zigzag motion are oversensitive to the variation of parameters in mmg model terms of added mass and added moment of inertia have relatively low effect than the other parameters especially in turning motion thus they are generally estimated based on empirical formulas or charts results of sensitivity analysis for both ships are summarized in table 26 5 4 effect of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices in the previous section sensitivity analyses showed the significance of each parameter on maneuvering indices however how these parameters change maneuvering indices are still unknown this section is devoted to the effect of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices of kvlcc2 to reveal how they change turning and zigzag maneuvers to do this linear derivatives y v y r n v and n r were changed by a considerable amount and results were plotted only one derivative was changed at a time to particularly show corresponding effect some interesting observations were noted there is an optimum value for y v to minimize advance and steady turning diameter y r also has an optimum value for minimizing steady turning diameter decrease in the magnitude of n v results in increase in some maneuvering indices such as advance transfer steady turning diameter and tactical diameter of turning circle test on the other hand it enhances zigzag test by decreasing 1st and 2nd overshoot angles decrease in the magnitude of n r results in decrease in some maneuvering indices such as advance transfer steady turning diameter and tactical diameter of turning circle test nevertheless overshoot angles in zigzag test considerably increase observations from these graphs may be elaborated but points listed above have primary importance for turning and zigzag tests graphs for y v are given in fig 14 y r in fig 15 n v in fig 16 and n r in fig 17 6 conclusions in this study a user friendly ship maneuvering code based on mmg mathematical model has been introduced graphical user interface of code allows to make an easy and simple changes to hydrodynamic derivatives or propeller rudder parameters this software provides a basis for researchers to experiment with all coefficients parameters and to have a better understanding of ship maneuvering phenomena which involves a dynamic and complex background it also contains many empirical relations suggested by many researchers in the field of ship maneuvering mansim is considered to be helpful especially for sensitivity analysis on maneuvering a spsr and a tptr ship have been investigated and parameters that have significant effect on each maneuvering indice have been found findings can be listed as follows n v and n r are highly effective on maneuvering indices ε is a highly effective rudder parameter in ship maneuvering coupled terms have a non negligible importance for dtmb5415 ship rudder parameters have higher importance in zigzag motion of dtmb5415 ship although the last two statements are only applicable for dtmb5415 ship it is considered that they are valid for tptr ships in general however more research is needed to support these statements an additional subsection was devoted to the effects of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices it was found that there was no linear relationship between the linear derivatives and maneuvering indices currently mansim does not consider external disturbances effects of wind wave and current are also to be included into the software future studies can also add quadratic model to the code which is only working with cubic model in the current form furthermore 3 dof mmg model will be expanded to a 4 dof model that includes roll coupled effects acknowledgements this study is a part of phd thesis of the first author under progress at istanbul technical university first author also would like to thank

speed ship with single rudder single propeller spsr or twin rudder twin propeller tptr configurations a 3 dof modular mathematical model or empirical approaches can be utilized in mansim in addition to certain maneuvers of ships such as turning or zigzag free maneuver can also be simulated input parameters required to solve the equations of motion can be estimated practically by several empirical formulas embedded in the software graphical user interface of the code has simple design to enable users to perform maneuvering calculations easily in addition to results such as advance transfer tactical diameters etc on the user interface simulation results can also be analyzed graphically thus it is possible to examine the variation of kinematic parameters during simulation using the code maneuverabilities of a tanker ship kvlcc2 and a surface combatant dtmb5415 is investigated and computed results are compared with free running data for validation purpose mansim can be advantageous for parametric studies and it is a valuable tool especially for sensitivity analysis on ship maneuvering the software is available online at www mansim org the effects of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on general maneuvering performance of ships are investigated by performing sensitivity analyses it is found that linear moment derivatives and rudder parameters are highly effective in maneuvering motion another interesting outcome of this study is identification of the significance of third order coupled derivatives for dtmb5415 hull effects of linear

challenging topics in ship hydrodynamics maneuvering simulations are generally conducted by using cfd based or system based sb methods cfd based method can be defined as a direct simulation of the actual maneuvering motion including the steering rudder and rotating propeller bhushan et al 2009 carrica et al 2013 broglia et al 2015 ohashi et al 2018 duman and bal 2019 from practical perspective this approach is not feasible as it requires enourmous computational power to perform full time domain simulations on the other hand sb methods include the solution of equations of motion for every time step using the previously calculated hydrodynamic derivatives the latter method is more practical than the former however accuracy of these calculations directly depends on selected mathematical model and hydrodynamic derivatives involved guo and zou 2017 toxopeus et al 2018 sukas et al 2019 in the recent literature current trend to express the hydrodynamic forces and moments is adopting either abkowitz model abkowitz 1964 or mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 yoshimura 2005 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in abkowitz model hull rudder and propeller are considered as one rigid body and equations of motion are defined by third order taylor series function on contrary to abkowitz model mmg model is a simplified mathematical model that decomposes total hydrodynamic force and moment acting on the ship into hull rudder and propeller components one of the biggest advantages of mmg model is that it allows to take the hull rudder propeller interactions into account there are various maneuvering simulation results using mmg model with different modified versions fang et al 2005 kang et al 2008 he et al 2016 yasukawa et al 2019 there are several prediction methods proposed in literature to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives in mmg models sukas et al 2017a 2017b for example yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 carried out circular motion tests cmt to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives and it was noted that cmt is a suitable method since it has zero frequency of motion which reduces the uncertainties for hydrodynamic forces and moment pmm planar motion mechanism tests are also widely used to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives cura hochbaum 2011 obreja et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2012 yoon et al 2015 duman and bal 2017 accuracy of results based on the selection of pmm motion frequency and amplitude may even change however this issue can be handled if pmm motion parameters are selected properly according to ittc recommendations ittc 7 5 02 06 02 2014 recent study has shown that changing the advancing speed of ship in pmm tests has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic derivatives in mmg model zhang et al 2019 in addition to these methods liu et al 2017 presented an integrated empirical maneuvering model for inland vessels furthermore all hydrodynamic derivatives and propeller rudder parameters in mmg model were estimated by various regression formulas selected from literature on the other hand system identification techniques have also been used for estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives zhang and zou 2013 sutulo and soares 2014 yoon et al 2015 xu et al 2019 in order to predict maneuverability of any ship using system based approach these methods can be utilized to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives propeller rudder parameters in this study a new user friendly ship maneuvering code called mansim maneuvering simulation based on standard mmg mathematical model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 is introduced the code includes several empirical relations suggested by various researchers working on the topic and is for those who would like to have a fundamental background of the maneuvering abilities a ship during early design stages the primary aim here by developing such a code is to make the maneuvering predictions of ships easier by using a simple user interface the software allows to simulate the turning and zigzag maneuvers of ships in addition a free maneuver option is also available with unlimited number of rudder angles which means one can simulate free maneuver of any ship in mansim by importing a txt file that includes rudder angles with respect to times mansim displays the maneuvering results such as advance distance transfer distance tactical diameter etc input parameters of the mathematical model such as hydrodynamic derivatives and coefficients related to the propeller and rudder can also be estimated by several empirical formulas embedded in the software the empirical approach provided by lyster and knights 1979 may also be preferred as a second option to have a basic understanding of maneuvering abilities of a ship following this section section 2 presents the theoretical background of mansim including the empirical approach suggested by lyster and knights 1979 and mmg models for spsr and tptr ships section 3 gives the empirical formulas embedded in software to estimate input parameters of mmg model gui of code was briefly introduced and sample screenshots were given in section 4 in section 5 maneuverability of two benchmark ships kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 was examined for validation purposes and the results predicted were compared with the free running test data in addition the effect of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on general maneuvering performance was investigated by performing a parametrical sensitivity analysis finally section 6 includes brief summary and possible future studies about mansim 2 theoretical background in mansim maneuvering performance of ships can be predicted by using either the empirical model provided by lyster and knights 1979 or the mathematical models presented by khanfir et al 2011 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 further details are explained in the following sub sections 2 1 empirical approach range maximum and minimum values of parameters for ships used by lyster and knights 1979 are given in table 1 empirical formulations have been derived based on the model experiments turning maneuver indices of spsr ships can be calculated by the following semi empirical expressions 1 std l 4 19 203 c

the ship parameters related to rudder are rudder angle δ span length h chord length c and number of rudders n r 2 2 modular mathematical model in mmg model hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship are divided into different parts contributors such as hull rudder s and propeller s major advantage of this method compared to traditional approach abkowitz type is including interaction effects of hull rudder s and hull propeller s mansim contains certain assumptions due to the implementation of mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 these assumptions are given below hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship treat quasi steadily cruise speed of the ship is sufficiently low so that wave making resistance is ignored metacentric height gm is relatively large thus effects of roll coupling are negligible in the present version of mansim mathematical models for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships are available to predict the maneuvering performance in calm water condition following sections present the coordinate system non dimensionalization and the mathematical models for spsr and tptr ships respectively 2 2 1 coordinate system and non dimensionalization the basic dynamic of motion is described by using newton s second law of motion thus two different coordinate systems can be defined for a maneuvering ship earth fixed coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 and ship fixed o x y z coordinate system as shown in fig 1 here heading angle ψ refers to angle between x and x 0 axis the difference between ship s heading and actual course direction velocity vector at cog is drift angle β tan 1 v u the rudder angle δ is positive while rotating to starboard side u and v denote velocity components in x and y directions respectively r is the yaw rate that can also be defined as r ψ t the speed of ship is indicated as u u 2 v 2 in mansim hydrodynamic forces and moment mass added mass moment of inertia added moment of inertia and other kinematical parameters are non dimensionalized as given in table 2 2 2 2 mathematical model maneuverability of only low speed ships in the horizontal plane with sufficiently large gm is considered in the mathematical model of mansim ship motions withn six degree of freedom 6 dof were reduced to 3 dof under the following assumptions vertical motions heave pitch and roll are ignored then w p q w p q

r and p refer to hull rudder and propeller respectively 3 dof motion equations can be written in matrix form as follows 15 a c c m 1 p c v e l where a c c matrix includes acceleration terms a c c u v r t p forces and moments p x h x r x p y h y r n h n r t and v e l the velocity terms v e l u v r t m 1 is the inverse of mass matrix and c is the coriolis matrix mass matrix m and coriolis matrix c

eqn 13 are explained in the following sub sections 2 2 2 1 hull forces and moment hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on both spsr and tptr hulls are expressed as follows yasukawa and yoshimura 2015

all coefficients here x v v y v v v y v r r n r r r etc are known as hydrodynamic derivatives or maneuvering coefficients 2 2 2 2 propeller forces and moment propeller surge force x p is calculated for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships with the parameters given in table 3 note that side force y p and yaw moment n p due to propeller are neglected as they have smaller magnitudes compared to those of hull and rudder components the superscripts p and s in table 3 represent port and starboard propellers respectively here t p is propeller thrust deduction factor in maneuvering motion n p is propeller rotation rate and d p is propeller diameter k 0 k 1 and k 2 represent open water characteristics of propeller for expressing k t w p 0 denotes the effective wake fraction at propeller position in straight motion and x p is non dimensional longitudinal position of propeller from midship 2 2 2 3 rudder forces and moment forces and moment related to rudder x r y r n r for single rudder ships are calculated based on rudder normal force f n rudder angle δ and hull rudder interaction coefficients t r a h x h by the following equations yasukawa

the offsets of rudders from the ship s centerline parameters required for prediction of rudder normal force s f n during maneuver are given in table 4 here ε κ l r and γ r are unknown rudder parameters that need to be estimated empirically numerically or experimentally a r is the profile area of movable part of rudder λ is aspect ratio of rudder and η is ratio of propeller diameter to rudder span note that equation provided for rudder lift gradient coefficient f α is suggested by fujii and tuda 1961 3 empirical equations all input parameters should be inserted to obtain full maneuvering performance of a ship in mansim in case no input data is available for hydrodynamic parameters of hull rudder and propeller empirical relations embedded in mansim can be applied these empirical equations are taken from various studies in related literature from practical point of view empirical formulas may be useful to assess the order of magnitudes of parameters in the preliminary design stage the empirical formulas embedded in mansim are given in the following sub sections 3 1 added mass and added moment of inertia empirical formulas embedded in software for the estimation of added masses m x m y and added moment of inertia j z are given in table 5 all formulas provided are based on the main particulars of ship such as m l b d and c b it should be noted that m x is advised to be taken approximately as 3 6 of ship mass m in clarke et al 1983 where it is taken as 5 of ship mass in mansim 3 2 hydrodynamic derivatives in this section the empirical formulas existed in the software to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives are presented table 6 table 7 and table 8 show the empirical formulas provided for derivatives related to surge force x sway force y and yaw moment n respectively total resistance coefficient x 0 is calculated by holtrop method holtrop 1978 note that the accuracy of empirical relations may change with range of ship parameters and mathematical model used in the corresponding study note that all empirical equations given in tables 6 8 have been rearranged according to non dimensionalization procedure used in mansim 3 3 self propulsion parameters empirical relations used to estimate wake fraction coefficient in straight motion w p 0 and thrust deduction factor t p are given in table 9 and table 10 respectively empirical equations provided for self propulsion parameters are based on the main particulars of ship and propeller such as l b c b and d p apart from these parameters open water characteristics of the propeller k 0 k 1 k 2 and the propeller revolution n p must be known self propulsion parameters given in mmg model can also be obtained by traditional engineering approach as explained in kinaci et al 2018 3 4 rudder parameters empirical relations embedded in mansim for estimation of hull rudder interaction coefficients t r a h x h are given in tables 11 13 here t r is the deduction factor of rudder resistance due to existence of ship hull a h denotes the factor of lateral force acting on the hull during steering and x h represents the application point of this lateral force component in longitudinal direction during steering empirical formulas for rudder force parameters are based on the main particulars of ship such as l b d c b alongside of hull rudder interaction coefficients there are some necessary coefficients ε κ l r γ to be known according to mmg model to predict rudder normal force f n empirical relations for these coefficients given in related literature are presented in tables 14 17 4 graphical user interface graphical user interface gui of mansim provides an easy utilization to use mathematical models and empirical approaches and has been designed to be a practical tool for ship maneuvering simulations mathematical models embedded in mansim are available for spsr yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 and tptr khanfir et al 2011 ships to simulate turning zigzag and free maneuvers in calm water mathematical models for spsr and tptr ships were explained in detail in section 2 2 in addition to mathematical models turning maneuver of single propeller and twin propeller ships can be predicted based on the empirical relations provided by lyster and knights 1979 details of this approach are given in section 2 1 a flow diagramme of gui of mansim is shown in fig 2 main solver code and functions of mansim were developed in matlab environment gui was created with matlab guide layout editor which allows user to design different kinds of user interfaces with some basic tools menus toolbars buttons sliders etc in the input section of mansim parameters required for mathematical model can be imported from a premade txt file using the corresponding icon in toolbar instead of filling the text boxes one by one alternatively if user has no input parameters except the main dimensions of ship all inputs related to hull propeller s and rudder s can be calculated automatically by mansim using available empirical formulas embedded in software obtained outputs can be examined on user interface or can be exported as dat file it is also possible to visualize the trajectory of ships during turning zigzag free maneuvers as 2d animation sample screenshots of input and output sections of mansim are shown in figs 3 4 pop ups near some parameters in the input screen are used for selecting empirical formulas embedded in the code note that the parameters of propeller and rudder in tptr option have double values different from spsr configuration since tptr ships may have different values for each parameter of rudder and propeller 5 application of mansim to benchmark ships in this section turning and zigzag maneuvers computed by mansim were validated for two benchmark ships namely kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 hulls kvlcc2 tanker is a spsr ship while dtmb5415 has a tptr configuration mathematical models for these type of ships are available in mansim and these models are described in section 2 2 available experimental and computational results for hydrodynamic derivatives rudder force and self propulsion parameters were used to compare the turning and zigzag maneuvers for both ships numerically obtained hydrodynamic derivatives have free surface effects taken into account since both ships have relatively high froude numbers kinaci et al 2016 simulation results were compared with free running data available in literature furthermore influence of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on maneuvering indices such as advance tactical diameter overshoot angles etc were investigated systematically by performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis 5 1 simulation of turning and zigzag maneuvers of kvlcc2 turning and zigzag maneuvers of full scale kvlcc2 tanker have been simulated by mansim by using hydrodynamic derivatives rudder and propeller parameters given in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 who have conducted circular motion and rudder force tests for the 1 110 scaled model of kvlcc2 free running results are also available for this ship and these tests have been carried out by marin for the 1 45 7 scaled model ftp ftp forcetechnology com maneuvering results of 35 and 35 turning circle and 10 10 10 10 20 20 20 20 zigzag maneuvers predicted by mansim were compared with results of free running tests for full scale kvlcc2 input parameters of mansim for the prediction of maneuvering performance are given in table 18 comparison of results for port and starboard turnings are shown in figs 5 and 6 note that both results are in good agreement turning maneuver indices such as advance ad transfer tr tactical diameter td steady turning diameter std steady yaw rate syr steady turning speed sts and steady drift angle sda were obtained for the full scale kvlcc2 tanker and shown in table 19 it can be said that the results calculated by mansim agree well with the free running data history of kinematical parameters was underpredicted slightly except steady yaw rate that has a perfect match largest difference is around 20 in speed reduction however this discrepancy can also be attributed to the differences in propeller rotation rate calculations are based on the self propulsion point of the full scale ship whereas the free running tests are conducted by self propulsion point of model ship this is most likely the primary reason of differences in the turning circle trajectories it can also be stated that the results of empirical approach seem to be in accordance with experiments comparison of various type of predicted zigzag maneuvers with free running data for full scale kvlcc2 is shown in figs 7 10 agreement in the first overshoot angles oa are better than the second overshoot angles for both 10 10 and 10 10 zigzag maneuvers oas in 20 20 and 20 20 zigzag maneuvers are shown in figs 9 and 10 and general trend of zigzag motion agree well with the free running data it can also be deduced from these figures that the phase shifts in trajectories are generally caused by the mismatch in rudder execution times maneuvering indices of zigzag motion are considered as 1 s t and 2 n d oas for 10 10 10 10 20 20 and 20 20 maneuvers and comparison of results are given in table 20 scale effect could be a reason for these discrepancies since the hydrodynamic derivatives and other parameters have been obtained at model scale of ship furthermore a more precise prediction method may be required to improve the accuracy of results instead of using empirical approaches for the terms of added mass and added moment of inertia it should also be noted that the accuracy of prediction was found to be strongly related with the initial conditions approach speed rudder angle propeller rate etc in zigzag maneuvers 5 2 simulation of turning and zigzag maneuvers of dtmb5415 after performing a maneuvering simulation for kvlcc2 a system based simulation was also carried out for full scale dtmb5415 surface combatant by using mansim to predict its turning and zigzag maneuverabilities hydrodynamic derivatives and other parameters related to the propeller and rudder were computed by cfd for the 1 46 588 scaled model of dtmb5415 hull sukas et al 2019 since dtmb5415 has a tptr configuration propeller and rudder parameters may show difference due to asymmetric flow around the control surfaces during maneuvering motion for validation system based sb simulation results of 35 and 35 turning maneuvers and 20 20 zigzag manuever were compared with those of free running tests carried out by marin ftp ftp forcetechnology com input parameters of mansim for full scale dtmb5415 hull are given in table 21 parameters with superscripts s and p indicate the values for starboard and port sides respectively predicted results of trajectory yaw rate and speed loss were compared with experimental data for 35 and 35 turning maneuvers and shown in figs 11 and 12 according to the results shown in figs 12 and 13 free running data seems to have larger difference in port and starboard turnings than those of mansim this discrepancy in experiments can be due to asymmetry between the values of rudder parameters for port and starboard turnings on the other hand there is a large relative difference between mansim and free running data in starboard turning for dtmb5415 hull such difference is most likely due to symmetry assumption for the rudder and propeller parameters in cfd analyses because all necessary rudder and propeller parameters of dtmb5415 hull were estimated by cfd analyses 3 for port turning additionally it was assumed that these parameters are identical symmetrical with the starboard turning another possible reason for the discrepancies in figs 12 13 may be caused by neglecting the roll coupled effects for dtmb5415 hull yaw rate of ship was slightly overestimated by mansim which leads to a smaller turning trajectory prediction speed reduction percentages during maneuver were estimated higher than the free running results for both side turnings turning maneuver indices of full scale dtmb5415 are given in table 22 the results obtained by empirical approach also seem to be underpredicted as compared to the experiments predicted heading rudder angles and trajectory for 20 20 zigzag maneuver were also compared with free running data and shown in fig 13 despite a good agreement of the predicted overshoot angles with the experiments there is a discrepancy in trajectories due to the early execution time of second and third deflections of rudder in the system based simulation maneuvering indices of zigzag motion were compared in terms of 1 s t and 2 n d oas and given in table 23 as mentioned previously accuracy of results can be influenced by slight differences with the experimental procedure such as initial conditions of the model it can also be noted that the results by mansim are based on self propulsion point of the full scale ship whereas free running tests are conducted by self propulsion point of the model ship this can be another reason for the differences in the turning and zigzag trajectories of dtmb5415 hull 5 3 sensitivity analysis of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters standard mmg model used in mansim consists total of 17 hydrodynamic derivatives in the maneuvering equations of motion in addition propeller and rudder parameters are included into these equations to simulate free running tests utilizing the user interface of mansim parametrical studies such as sensitivity analysis can be performed readily effect of any parameter on general maneuvering performance of ships can be investigated in detail here a sensitivity analysis was performed for kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 ships to investigate the effect of each hydrodynamic derivative and rudder parameters on the turning and zigzag maneuverabilities 35 turning and 20 20 zigzag maneuvers were selected as sample cases to be examined influence of variation of hydrodynamic derivatives rudder parameters on maneuvering indices such as advance ad transfer tr tactical diameter td steady turning diameter std and overshoot angles oa were investigated original value of parameters was increased separately by 25 and these values were used in the mathematical model sensitivity analysis was carried out by using the index proposed by sen 2000 this analysis was adopted to examine the variation of maneuvering indices caused by changes in each hydrodynamic derivative and rudder parameter sensitivity index s is represented as given in eqn 21 21 s r r r h h h where r and h denote the original values of maneuvering index and corresponding hydrodynamic derivative rudder parameter respectively r and h represent increased values by 25 after calculating s all these values of parameters are summed up and a total value for each indice is obtained then sensitivity index for each parameter is divided by the total value of this indice for example percentage of the effect of x 0 in advance is calculated by 22 s x 0 a d 100 s x 0 s a d here s x 0 a d denotes the effect of x 0 in percentages s x 0 is the sensitivity index of x 0 and s a d is the total sensitivity index value for advance index sensitivity of each parameter as a percentage for each maneuvering index for kvlcc2 and dtmb5415 are given in tables 24 and 25 in these tables parameters which have greater value than or at least equal to 10 were considered to be highly effective as shown in bold form parameters which are between 3 and 10 were considered to have mediocre at best as shown in underlined form according to table 24 hydrodynamic derivatives related to surge force x have lower effect on the obtained results than that of sway force and yaw moment derivatives only resistance coefficient x 0 has a moderate effect on transfer tactical diameter and second overshoot angles first order derivatives seem to have a strong influence on maneuvers especially on zigzag indices where n v has the highest impact among all high order and coupled derivatives have lower effect on maneuvering indices except n v v r terms of added mass and added moment of inertia have a moderate effect on first overshoot angle while only m y has a moderate effect on steady turning radius rudder parameters have also major influence on maneuvering indices particularly variation of ε and κ greatly affects the turning and zigzag maneuvers of ship it can briefly be stated for sensitivity analysis of kvlcc2 tanker that the overshoot angles are more sensitive to the variations of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters than those of turning maneuver in addition advance distance and steady turning diameter seem to be the least and most influenced indices by the variation of parameters in turning maneuver respectively table 25 shows the sensitivity indices of turning and zigzag maneuver of dtmb5415 hull note that the parameters of port and starboard rudders of dtmb5415 are increased together similar to kvlcc2 hull n v was found to be the most dominant linear derivative in both turning and zigzag maneuvers of dtmb5415 hull nonlinear derivatives have small effects except n r r r which affects the manuevers moderately coupled derivatives related to the yaw moment n v v r n v r r have relatively major impact as compared to those of surge and sway forces x v v x r r x v r y r r r and m x have almost no influence on the indices of turning maneuver rudder parameters have a significant effect on the maneuvers rather than the hydrodynamic derivatives additionally similar to kvlcc2 case advance distance was found to be the least influenced index from the variation of hydrodynamic derivatives and rudder parameters on the whole it can be noted for both ships that the derivatives based on yaw moment are highly influential on turning and zigzag maneuvers indices of zigzag motion are oversensitive to the variation of parameters in mmg model terms of added mass and added moment of inertia have relatively low effect than the other parameters especially in turning motion thus they are generally estimated based on empirical formulas or charts results of sensitivity analysis for both ships are summarized in table 26 5 4 effect of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices in the previous section sensitivity analyses showed the significance of each parameter on maneuvering indices however how these parameters change maneuvering indices are still unknown this section is devoted to the effect of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices of kvlcc2 to reveal how they change turning and zigzag maneuvers to do this linear derivatives y v y r n v and n r were changed by a considerable amount and results were plotted only one derivative was changed at a time to particularly show corresponding effect some interesting observations were noted there is an optimum value for y v to minimize advance and steady turning diameter y r also has an optimum value for minimizing steady turning diameter decrease in the magnitude of n v results in increase in some maneuvering indices such as advance transfer steady turning diameter and tactical diameter of turning circle test on the other hand it enhances zigzag test by decreasing 1st and 2nd overshoot angles decrease in the magnitude of n r results in decrease in some maneuvering indices such as advance transfer steady turning diameter and tactical diameter of turning circle test nevertheless overshoot angles in zigzag test considerably increase observations from these graphs may be elaborated but points listed above have primary importance for turning and zigzag tests graphs for y v are given in fig 14 y r in fig 15 n v in fig 16 and n r in fig 17 6 conclusions in this study a user friendly ship maneuvering code based on mmg mathematical model has been introduced graphical user interface of code allows to make an easy and simple changes to hydrodynamic derivatives or propeller rudder parameters this software provides a basis for researchers to experiment with all coefficients parameters and to have a better understanding of ship maneuvering phenomena which involves a dynamic and complex background it also contains many empirical relations suggested by many researchers in the field of ship maneuvering mansim is considered to be helpful especially for sensitivity analysis on maneuvering a spsr and a tptr ship have been investigated and parameters that have significant effect on each maneuvering indice have been found findings can be listed as follows n v and n r are highly effective on maneuvering indices ε is a highly effective rudder parameter in ship maneuvering coupled terms have a non negligible importance for dtmb5415 ship rudder parameters have higher importance in zigzag motion of dtmb5415 ship although the last two statements are only applicable for dtmb5415 ship it is considered that they are valid for tptr ships in general however more research is needed to support these statements an additional subsection was devoted to the effects of linear derivatives on maneuvering indices it was found that there was no linear relationship between the linear derivatives and maneuvering indices currently mansim does not consider external disturbances effects of wind wave and current are also to be included into the software future studies can also add quadratic model to the code which is only working with cubic model in the current form furthermore 3 dof mmg model will be expanded to a 4 dof model that includes roll coupled effects acknowledgements this study is a part of phd thesis of the first author under progress at istanbul technical university first author also would like to thank

22388,saint martin s island is one of the most notable tourist spots and the only coral island of bangladesh in the bay of bengal yet due to lack of electricity supply this beautiful island is becoming uninhabitable and losing tourist attraction in this study a decentralized mini hydroelectric power plant mhpp has been proposed and designed to mitigate electricity demand in the tourist resorts of the island during peak demand hours the energy input to the plant is supplied by harnessing ocean wave power available in the coastal regions of the island with a novel and simple wave energy converter wec named searaser to decide about the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp a field survey was conducted on the resorts of st martin s island the performance of searaser in the context of the island was investigated theoretically which indicated that the searaser is capable of producing about 35 m of water head by utilizing the available wave power realizing the availability of wave power and adopting sustainable tourism policy the estimated plant capacity was about 144 kw this study remarks that the implementation of searaser based mhpp technology in the st martin s island can be a profitable and eco friendly replacement of the existing stand alone diesel generators it was also found that huge amount of greenhouse gas ghg emission can be prevented and thereby the

which is the main cause of global warming also the earth has limited storage of fossil fuels which is depleting rapidly these ever rising problems have put a question on the use of fossil fuels and thus created a global incentive to look for proper renewable alternatives solar wind biomass hydro geothermal ocean energy otec tidal and wave are the most potential renewable resources that can be considered as appropriate substitutes of fossil fuels for example according to the results of extensive literature assessment conducted by many authors and organizations the estimated approximate global potential of different renewable energy resources are as follows 25 32 ej yr 1 ej 1018 j for hydropower sims et al 2003 245 ej yr for biomass hoogwijk and graus 2008 43 ej yr for geothermal

jacobson 2005 kabir et al 2018 studies conducted on finding average total co2 emissions by primary energy source shows that fossil fuels e g coal and gas are responsible for around 920 g co2 kwh and 490 g co2 kwh emissions respectively which is in sharp contrast to that of solar power 28 g co2 kwh wind power 12 g co2 kwh hydropower 24 g co2 kwh and biomass 220 g co2 kwh mccombie and jefferson 2016 similar studies on geothermal volcanic systems show that the peak emission from this source is around 400 g co2 kwh armannsson et al 2005 the ocean is a vast reservoir of energy the ocean wave energy has the maximum energy density among all other renewable resources and can be extracted almost 90 of the available time compared to about 20 30 for wind and solar energy fadaeenejad et al 2014 drew et al 2009 the wave energy can be harnessed by using special types of devices called wec e g oscillating water column owc oyster archimedes wave swing searaser wave dragon pelamis and so on using wecs to supply electricity in remote islands and coastal cities has become a central issue since the past few decades the ever rising global warming problem of fossil fuels and inconveniences associated with fuel shipping to the remote coastal places have sparked a growing interest to substitute them by potential renewable resources especially wave energy for instance two full sized nearshore wec prototypes 350 and 500 kw rated power were implemented near bergen norway in 1985 falcão 2010 in the early 1990s several prototypes of owc were put to service in different regions a 75 kw prototype at the island of islay in scotland whittaker et al 1993 a 60 kw prototype incorporated into a breakwater at the port of sakata in japan ohneda et al 1991 and a 125 kw plant at trivandrum in india ravindran and koola 1991 deane et al 2012 investigated about the economic impacts of 500 mw of wave power in ireland similar studies were also conducted at the shetland and bernera islands in scotland to construct their wave power plants in the upcoming years dunnet and wallace 2009 analyzed the pertinency of wecs to canada and canadian islands fadaeenejad et al 2014 did a comprehensive review of wecs with special consideration to small islands recently a 7 mw power plant based on wave dragon has been deployed on the coast of wales uk association eoe 2010 however in bangladesh research in the field of wec technology is still in unhatched condition although some islands and coastal areas here e g kuakata sandwip and st martin s island have sufficient wave power potentiality that can be utilized reasonably with appropriate wec technology ahmed et al 2013 undp 2006 this study unveils that with the prospect of the cutting edge nearshore wec named searaser the wave energy utilization quo of bangladesh may change for the better the searaser is the brainchild of british inventor alvin smith 2013 thereafter its discovery it has garnered worldwide attention and being tested in some areas as well for example babajani et al 2016 extensively investigated about an optimum distance between two searasers for maximum power absorption from the caspian sea in iran its simplistic concept coupled with eco friendly design features makes it an ideal wec for low budget situations and to be implementable in remote islands from the above literature it appears that the ocean wave energy can be one of the very potential options to electrify the tourist resorts of st martin s island in bangladesh the most notable tourist spot here where comprehensive research is needed to implement the searaser wec based power generation technology the aim of this research is to analyze the performance of searaser in case of st martin s island by theoretical investigation and present a feasible framework for designing an mhpp usually 100 1000 kw voros et al 2000 run by searaser with a view to supplying electricity in the tourist resorts during some peak demand hours thus replacing the existing diesel generators 2 methodology 2 1 concept and physical model 2 1 1 the wec searaser the searaser is basically a wave driven water pump for generating hydroelectric power which is shown schematically in fig 1 the working cycle of searaser is based on two actions suction stroke and working stroke during the suction stroke when a wave crest reaches the vicinity of searaser the weighted surface buoy wsb along with the elongated member piston is forced to heave upward consequently a vacuum is created inside the cylindrical pumping chamber and surrounding water starts entering into it during the working stroke when the wave passes the wsb heaves down due to gravity thus pressurizes the accumulated water in the chamber the pressurized water is then allowed to go uphill and be stored in a reservoir the stored water can be released back downhill through a hydraulic turbine producing electricity before finally returning back to the sea 2 1 2 layout of the proposed mhpp the layout of the proposed searaser based power plant is shown in fig 2 the mega reservoir which contains water pumped by searaser comprises of several chambers with certain water storage capacity for all generating units turbine generator connected to it the water chamber capacity of any unit and the water flowrate required to the turbine depend on the following parameters water head gained power rating and running time of that unit the water chambers may contain interconnected valves among them so that mutual transfer of water is possible in case of emergency the capacity of water chambers can be increased easily if required to materialize the future expansion in unit size in addition a removable reservoir roof with filtering net may be provided to take advantage of storing rain water 2 2 design of the mhpp designing an mhpp requires a lot of key factors and scenarios to be considered as per the aim of this study the searaser will supply necessary energy input to the plant hence its performance study becomes crucial at the initial stage of the design process the entire design process includes the following stages 2 2 1 1st stage wave characteristics hindcasting from wind speed measurement 2 2 1 1 use of historical wind speed data real ocean waves are very irregular and complex in nature because of nonlinearities three dimensional characteristics and their random behavior sarpkaya 2010 therefore to study them a significant wave height and period h m t m are defined such that they represent the characteristics of real sea in the form of monochromatic waves army 1984 the performance of searaser is governed by the wave characteristics at the location it is installed it is therefore essential for this study to know the wave characteristics in the st martin s island at a specific depth where the searaser will be put under service finding the wave characteristics by field measurement is beyond the scope of this study moreover no direct study has been conducted yet in the st martin s island to find these data but in the past several studies were performed to collect the wind speed data in there bangladesh council for scientific and industrial research bcsir conducted a study to find the wind speed in the island they collected data at the height of 30 m above the ground level for three consecutive years 1999 2001 kaiser and aditya 2006 khan et al 2004 nasa satellite measurement of wind speed for the same location at 10 m height is also available kaiser and aditya 2006 those records are tabulated in table 1 however it is possible to hindcast the wave characteristics at a certain location of the sea by using suitable wave prediction models in existence provided that the sea state condition as well as wind speed information at that location is known this is because of the reason that the wave characteristics are closely related to wind speed for the wind generated waves which is the most common types of waves seen in the seas army 1984 sundar 2015 in this study for quick and low cost estimates a simplified wave growth model discussed in literature was applied to hindcast wave characteristics in the st martin s island at a finite water depth for installing the searaser in that model the wind speed data from the record of bcsir khan et al 2004 were used assuming a fetch limited condition of generating wind but the fetch lengths f of those recorded wind data were not known also their direct measurement is beyond the reach of this study so a typical range between 42 km 100 km had been assumed 2 2 1 2 estimation of overwater wind speed the wind speed in a wave hindcasting computation must be the speed over water kamphuis 2000 in this study as discussed in literature overwater wind speed was estimated by projecting the overland values measured by bcsir see table 1 over the fetch considering several criterions and adjustment factors conversion of observed wind speed to a reference 10 m height level u l 10 adjustment for location effects r l and adjustment for stability effects r t for fetches longer than 16 km the factor r t solely depends upon the air sea temperature difference δt u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 therefore δt 3 c was considered since this is the most regular instance in the real oceanic situation to evaluate these factors some charts available in the literature were used army 2002 the overall relation for transforming overland wind speed into a constant overwater wind speed u a can be written as u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 1 u a 0 71 u l 10 r t r l 1 23 2 2 1 3 shallow water wave growth swwg model some parametric models for predicting shallow water wave growth as well as deep water wave growth are available u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 swwg model is of particular interest for this study because searaser is a nearshore type wec which needs to be moored to the sea bed i e to be installed in finite depth hence it cannot be set in deep water considering technical and economic viability although the wave energy density is higher in deep water fernandes and fonseca 2013 the swwg model requires three input parameters to be given f u a and depth d the empirical equations of swwg model eqs 2 and 3 proposed by young and verhagen young and verhagen 1996 kamphuis 2000 were used in this study this model is based on standard jonswap wave spectrum also it was developed by considering the distortion of the wave shape and the wave energy dissipation effects due to shallower depth as well as the directional spreading of ocean wave energy around mean wind direction young and verhagen 1996 young et al 1996 2 h m 0 24 u a 2 g tanh 0 49 g d u a 2 0 75 tanh 0 0031 g f u a 2 0 57 tanh 0 49 g d u a 2 0 75 3 t m

theory selection prior to the estimation of wave forces on nearshore offshore structures or devices e g the wecs simplification of actual irregular ocean waves is required to be able to quantify the wave action and its effects kamphuis 2000 therefore it is often necessary to describe a sea state more detailed than possible by the regular waves andersen and frigaard 2008 there are several wave theories that are useful in the design analysis of nearshore offshore structure or devices these theories by necessity are regular chakrabarti 2005 but the wave hindcasting model used in this study swwg model predicts wave parameters in terms of significant spectral wave height h m and peak spectral period t m which are the terminologies used in the definition of irregular waves a reasonable approach to relate irregular wave parameters with that of regular wave is to equate the average total wave energy in both regular and irregular wave trains u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 the height of a regular wave train with the same energy as an irregular wave train with significant height h m is equal to 0 71h m for deep water u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 a precise computation of such relationship in finite depth is much more difficult u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 therefore to minimize the complexity and proceed with the aim of this study the irregular wave parameters obtained from the swwg model h m t m has been assumed as approximately equal to the regular wave parameters so that a regular wave theory can be applied it is not convenient to deal individually with each and every hindcasted wave characteristics h m t m corresponding to each monthly wind speed data see table 1 the usual practice in such cases is to specify a single design wave in this study the height and period of the design wave h m t m were calculated in a simple manner by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 h m j 1 12 n j h m j j 1 12 n j 5 t m j 1 12 n j t m j j 1 12 n j after the design wave is specified an appropriate regular wave theory must be selected to estimate wave forces on the wec for reliable design and performance analysis varma 2014 wave characteristics in nearshore regions finite depth are better described by higher order finite amplitude wave faw theories u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 however selecting the most suitable faw theory for a defined design wave given h m t m and d is rather difficult any comparison between the theories must be considered only in relation to the prevailing environmental characteristics and particular location sarpkaya 2010 in this study fig 3 indicating regions of applicability of different wave theories was used for the selection purpose in fig 3 if the co ordinate d g t m 2 h m g t m 2 falls within the region of linear wave theory or stoke s 2nd order theory then the wavelength l of the design wave can be computed using eq 6 sundar 2015 6 l g t m 2 2 π tanh 2 π d l however this equation is implicit in terms of l the explicit expression developed by fenton and mckee 1990 is 7 k d ω 2 d g coth ω d g 3 2 2 3 where k 2 π l the wave theory selection process can be foolproofed further by using a dimensionless parameter called ursell number u r for the design wave it can be defined as 8 u r l 2 h m d 3 2 2 2 2 wave energy transport and wave profile estimation the measure of wave crest and trough amplitude a c and a t respectively can be obtained by using some analytical expressions corresponding to the selected wave theory it will be discussed in the result section of this study that the stoke s 2nd order theory is the best suited for this case according to this theory a c and a t are computed from eq 9 u s army engineer

sinusoidal design wave in deep water can be calculated from eq 10 su et al 2018 10 j ρ g 2 64 π h m 2 0 9 t m however for finite water depth the effect of change in wave celerity with depth should be considered which is done by introducing a term d kd to eq 10 falnes 2002 11 j ρ g 2 64 π h m 2 0 9 t m d k d the depth effect d kd is usually estimated using the following formula falnes 2002 12 d k d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d tanh k d 2 2 2 3 size limit of searaser s power take off pto system the mechanism by which energy is transferred between the waves and the wec and subsequently converted into a useful form is generally known as pto henderson 2006 in the case of searaser the major component of the pto system is the wsb the magnitudes of interacting forces between waves and the wsb depend on its size characteristics length i e diameter the occurrence possibility of scattering or radiation of incident wave energy from a wec is truly an important consideration for wave force estimation this phenomenon is signified by diffraction parameter d p 13 d p π d l as a rule of thumb if d p 0 5 for a nearshore offshore structure or device it can be considered as small sized and diffraction effect of waves becomes insignificant chakrabarti 2005 in an attempt to keep the force analysis simple in this study following assumptions were adopted the wsb is small sized the buoys of the searaser both wsb and underwater buoy are axisymmetric wsb absorbs power from the waves during heave mode of oscillation only 2 2 2 4 forces on the wsb the wsb of the searaser s pto system having a single degree of freedom heave basically incorporates two types of forces the weight of the buoy itself w f and wave applied exciting force in heave f f see fig 4 weight of the wsb should be such that it remains buoyant 14 w f m g 1 4 ρ g π d 2 d r on the other hand the total wave applied exciting force in heave on a submerged buoy can be expressed as f f ˆ f f k ˆ f d ˆ however considering only the magnitudes of those forces korde and ertekin 2015 showed that for a small sized buoy 15 f f f f k 1 4 ρ g a c π d 2 e k d r it is evident that during the suction stroke of searaser s operation the suction of water will occur only when f fk w f so the suction force is f fk w f the working force during the working stroke is simply w f 2 2 2 5 hydrodynamics of searaser and associated system

p w p 1 w f π 4 d b o r e 2 the water head that will be achieved from the searaser can be estimated in a simplistic manner by using the bernoulli s principle with following assumptions h m and t m remain constant over time minor losses in the pipe components are negligible searaser is operating under steady state consequently the application of it between the inlet of water transfer pipe and the top surface of the reservoir gives indicated by point 1 and 2 in fig 2 18 h p 1 p 2 ρ g v 1 2 v 2 2 2 g d z 1 h l a complete stroke during the work cycle of searaser occurs when a wave crest followed by a successive wave trough passes over the buoy as depicted in fig 5 the stroke length of the piston is h m h and distance between successive crest and trough is l 2 as per definition the design wave travels a distance of l by the time period t m similarly l 2 distance will be traveled by time period t l 2 which is the time required to complete one stroke the volume flow rate through the water transfer pipe can be calculated from the t l 2 and the mass of water inside the cylinder at the end of the suction stroke m w by using eq 19 19 q m w ρ t l 2 π h m h d b o r e 2 4 t l 2 let

capacity modelling a field survey was conducted in the st martin s island in order to find out total electricity demand on its resorts based on accommodation capacity and variety of electrical appliances the resorts of the st martin s island can be classified mainly into three categories high capacity average standard hcas medium capacity average standard mcas and medium capacity high standard mchs resorts hcas resorts typically have large tourist accommodation capacity a higher quantity of rooms unlike them mcas resorts have decreased number of rooms and moderate accommodation capacity however both hcas and mcas resorts contain only necessary electrical appliances e g light fan and so forth similarly mchs resorts have moderate accommodation capacity but they incorporate some luxury appliances crt led tv water heater together with the necessary appliances nevertheless each type of resort has some electric motor driven water pumps to provide the necessary water for the tourists it was found in the survey that around 71 resorts are mcas 19 are mchs and the rest 10 are hcas resorts tables 2 and 3 show typical examples of hcas mcas and mchs resorts including their average accommodation capacity types of rooms and the electrical appliances they contain currently the number of tourists visiting this island per day has exceeded its real carrying capacity rcc and obviously the effective carrying capacity ecc which is the optimum number of tourists to be allowed hasan et al 2014 conducted a study about the carrying capacity of st martin s island and they found the rcc is around 2913 tourists day they also evaluated the ecc for 63 management capacity mc which is around 1835 tourist day the rcc and ecc are related by the following relation hasan et al 2014 26 e c c r c c m c fig 6 constructed from available historical data alam et al 2015 hasan et al 2014 depicts the trend of yearly increase in the average number of tourists visiting this island per day during the peak tourist season oct mar over the past few years fig 6 clarifies that at present the island is overloaded with tourists well beyond its rcc to accommodate these rapidly increasing number of tourists many resorts have been built in the past several years but power generation and supply in the island should not be desired by keeping its ecological and tourism potential at risk therefore the concept of sustainable tourism policy was taken under major consideration in this study to model the effective accommodation capacity of the resorts or alternately to figure out the approximate electricity requirements in there for convenience it was assumed that the present ecc of the island is similar to that found by hasan et al 2014 in 2014 the total accommodation capacity in all three types of resorts mentioned earlier is to be modeled such that it remains under ecc accordingly a total of 21 resorts have been considered at present out of which two hcas fifteen mcas and four mchs resorts were selected to maintain compatibility with survey result see table 2 2 2 4 4th stage determination of the installed capacity of the mhpp a realistic estimation of the daily consumption profiles of total connected electrical loads in the resorts is essential to take a decision about the installed capacity of the mhpp and the size and operating schedules of its different generating units although every resort in st martin s island has stand alone generators of its own as a main power supply source it was assumed that all the 21 modeled resorts are connected to a central power supply system their individual demand is to be fulfilled integrally by the proposed mhpp the generator of a typical resort is only operated at some specific hours when the tourists are most likely to be in need of electricity those periods can be termed as peak demand hours pdhs which is on average 8 9 h day for any resort pdhs may vary from day to day and resort to resort though however from the survey it has been observed that the overall pdhs of all the resorts as a whole are in total of around 11 h day and can be divided into two shifts day shift 10 a m 3 p m and evening shift 6 p m 12 a m the generators remain off from around 12 a m 10 a m in almost every resort the prime objective of this work was only to mitigate the electricity demand in both the day shift and evening shift of pdhs by renewable wave powered hydro electricity as an alternative of using the diesel generators it ought to be mentioned that continuous supply of electricity from the mhhp may not be possible because the generation of electricity depends solely on the water supply from the reservoir i e the availability of wave power however wave power level in the nearshore region of st martin s island is quite unsteady because it tends to be higher during high tide and lower during low tide periods sometimes the power level in the low tide period is too small to be absorbed by a nearshore wec like searaser and thereby continuous electricity supply is seldom practical so there will be two load curves on the mhpp in a typical day during the day shift and evening shift of pdhs to generate the load curves for all the modeled number of resorts hcas mcas and mchs survey on each type of resort was conducted for three consecutive days then their individual load curves corresponding to the shift of pdhs were aggregated to find a single load curve representing the overall demand variation in a typical day from the load curves and corresponding load duration curves the decision about the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp size of generating units in each shift their startup and shutdown time and operating schedules were made to ensure economic operation and maintenance the evaluation of the proposed plant was also done using some economic factors such as demand factor df load factor lf and diversity factor divf nag 2007 2 2 5 5th stage generator selection and water chambers capacity estimation suitable generator selection for the selected unit sizes was done by using eq 27 considering a standard power factor f p of 0 8 the obtained kva rating was rounded to the next standard value 27 p g e n p u f p for any unit the required water flowrate to the hydraulic turbine 28 q t 3 6 10 6 p u ρ g η t g h hence the capacity of the water chamber for any unit 29 w c q t t r 2 2 6 7th stage economic feasibility analysis of the mhpp 2 2 6 1 cost estimation of the mhpp the development of a hydroelectric power plant is dependent on the economic and financial feasibility which must be evaluated by cost estimates before starting construction tiago filho et al 2017 for that purpose researchers have developed many empirical correlations relating cost to the head and power rating of a plant cost functions in order to simulate its cost these cost functions strongly depend upon the characteristics of local markets of a region and many other managerial and financial reasons deduction of such cost function for any region requires extensive field study on the power plants of that region many authors like singal and saini 2008 kaldellis et al 2005 and aggidis et al 2010 deduced cost functions for hydroelectric power plants in respectively india greece and uk after studying over a hundred of plants all across the country similar studies have been conducted in brazil and other countries as well tiago filho et al 2017 since bangladesh at the moment does not have enough hydroelectric power plants to enable such study cost functions developed for india were used in this study to get a priori cost estimation of the mhpp project considering the fact that india is the neighboring country of bangladesh and the characteristics of local markets here may be similar to that of india by some extent the indian cost functions for various component of a typical hydroelectric power plant are listed in table 4 the cost functions listed in table 4 give the cost in indian rupees rs so the costs had been converted to usd as of april 10 2019 1 usd 69 18 rs com 2019 the construction of per kw c const of the proposed mhpp comprises of total c comp for all possible unit layouts c

comparison with existing technology two mutually exclusive alternatives were considered for providing the estimated electricity needs from load curves one is the proposed mhpp itself and the other is a diesel generator based power plant dpp which reflects the current power supply scenario in the st martin s island out of them the most economical alternative was selected based on cumulative present worth method where the present worth pw of annual incomes from the plants are added and stated on a year by year basis throughout a defined evaluation period drbal et al 1996 the most economical alternative is the one having the highest profit margin after capital recovery the type of costs considered for the economic analysis are capital cost c capital annual depreciation cost a dep and annual fuel consumption cost a fuel for the mhpp alternative a fuel is zero being operated upon renewable resource whereas the dpp alternative incurs this additional cost due to exorbitant consumption of diesel fuel the salvage values s for both the alternatives was assumed to be zero the assumed lifetimes l t of the mhpp and the dpp are 45 and 15 years respectively which is very typical so the alternatives were compared over an evaluation period equal to the least common multiple of their stated lives to satisfy the equal service requirement blank and tarquin 2012 which is 45 years the associated cash inflows and outflows for the analysis can be estimated using the following equations 31 c c a p i t a l c c o n s t p l a n t c a p a c i t y 32 a d e p c c a p i t a l s i 1 i l t 1

flows for this alternative will be repeated two more times over the 45 years evaluation period the payback period n p of each alternative can be computed from 38 p v c a p i t a l a i n c o m e 1 i n p 1 i 1 i n p 0 2 2 7 8th stage emission analysis it is known that ghgs e g co2 so2 nox co are emitted when fossil fuels are burned a ghg emission based comparison during operation stage of the proposed hydropower scheme with other types of power plants operated based on common type of fossil fuels e g coal petroleum natural gas etc was also done in this study to evaluate the environmental impacts of the mhpp alternative table 5 shows typical power plant ghg emission factors ef during operation for different energy sources the emitted amount ea of any ghg gas can be calculated from eq 39 39 e a j e e f j where subscript j denotes the ghgs e g co2 so2 nox co 3 results and discussion 3 1 design wave parameters and wave theory according to the methodology described in section 2 2 1 2 u a was calculated the results are tabulated in table 6 the water depth d where the searaser will be installed was assumed to be 25 m the h m and t m for available wind speed data from bcsir khan et al 2004 table 1 were estimated by applying eqs 2 and 3 of the swwg model using the assumed d and calculated u a values the hindcasted wave characteristics h m t m are also tabulated in table 6 and shown in fig 7 the height h m and period t m of the design wave were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 with data from table 6 which are 0 918 m and 4 446 s respectively the entire aforementioned procedure for calculating h m and t m was repeated for some other d values 5 m 70 m than the assumed value 25 m and has been plotted and shown in fig 8 it is observable from fig 8 that the change in the values of h m and t m is significant in the regions 5 m d 25 m however the curves start to flatten out at approximately d 25 m which continues afterwards 25 m d 70 m and thereby the change is negligible as a result continuing this design study with any depth value 25 m will not have any significant effect on the outcomes of this study therefore the assumption of d 25 m is justified note that working with depths 25 m is undesired because the typical depth range for installing nearshore wecs is approximately 30 m 70 m fernandes and fonseca 2013 the assumed depth value in this study is very much marginal to this range using the calculated design wave characteristics for d 25 m h m 0 918 m t m 4 446 s in fig 3 it was found that the design wave is better described by stoke s 2nd order theory which also holds true for any other depth within the range considered in this study 5 m d 70 m hence eq 7 was used to calculate the wavelength l of the design wave which is 31 066 m using eq 8 the value of u r was found as 0 057 for small values 26 of u r stoke s faw theories are the most suitable fenton et al 1990 this further confirms that the selection of stoke s 2nd order theory is valid the a c and a t of the design wave were computed directly by using eq 9 which are 0 4803 m and 0 4377 m respectively 3 2 size of the pto system and head calculation the diameter d of the wsb is to be selected such that its geometry and dynamic behavior becomes simple also it can extract wave energy among a front wider than its own dimension fernandes and fonseca 2013 because of that reason d p 0 4 was assumed accordingly d 3 96 m 4 m was obtained from eq 13 eqs 14 and 15 elucidate that both the suction force f fk w f and the working force w f vary with draft length d r of the wsb using the buoy diameter and design wave parameters specified in sect 3 1 h m 0 918 m t m 4 446 s the variation of f fk w f and w f against d r has been plotted and shown in fig 9 according to sect 2 2 2 4 a negative value of f fk w f is not acceptable therefore d r 0 4 m is chosen to have optimum f fk w f and w f values simultaneously accordingly the height h of the buoy was assumed to be 0 6 m knowing the values of a c l d and d r w f and f fk were calculated by using eqs 14 and 15 which are 50 79 kn and 56 25 kn respectively so f fk w f 5 46 kn in the working stroke the wsb should push the water accumulated during suction stroke hence to have a working force of 50 79 kn the mass assigned to the buoy should be approximately 5200 kg this finding is fully compliant with the work of babajani et al 2016 where they assigned a buoy mass of 9000 kg in their searaser model once the diameter of the pumping chamber d bore of the searaser is known the pressures p s and p w or p 1 can be calculated using eqs 16 and 17 in this study d bore 350 mm was assumed which is within the range mention in searaser s patent smith 2013 so p 1 5 21 atm was obtained whereas p 2 1 atm 101 325 kpa see fig 2 for the specified t m d and l the time required to complete each stroke by searaser s piston t l 2 was calculated by replacing l with l 2 and t m with t l 2 in eq 6 the result is 3 15 s the water transfer pipe that carries pressurized sea water to the reservoir was assumed to be made of smooth plastic i e ԑ 0 mm for specified buoy dimension and design wave the velocity head gain v 1 2 2g and frictional head loss h l in water transfer pipe depends greatly on the reduction factor n see eqs 21 23 their variations with n are shown in fig 10 by analyzing this figure n 2 8 was chosen because beyond this value h l keeps on increasing while the net gain in v 1 2 2g is quite negligible also it is not economical to use pipe of larger diameter although the head loss would be less in that case this n 2 8 value can be considered as a trade off between both economic and head loss constraints with this ratio the chosen water transfer pipe diameter d pipe is 125 mm the value of friction factor f was determined from eq 24 that is 0 018 elevation of point 1 from the datum line z 1 as shown in fig 2 was assumed as 20 m the length of the water transfer pipe l can be assumed safely as 500 m since it is apparent from eq 25 that this value will not have any significant effect on it plugging in all these findings in eq 25 the net head h 34 95 m 35 m was obtained 3 3 the installed capacity of the mhpp and its operation guidelines the overall variation of electricity demand with time during the two shifts of the pdhs has been shown in fig 11 during the day shift the water pumps are turned on only for a couple of hours with a view to supplying necessary water for the tourists this particular time period may vary from day to day resort to resort reckoning on the situation as a consequence in fig 11 a the overall load curve of the resorts exhibits an abrupt change with time it is evident from fig 11 a that the demand during day shift is at its peak from 11 a m 12 a m this is because usually within this period the majority of the tourists prepare themselves for a day out at the sea beach hence use all the appliances in the room in the other periods of day shift demand falls because at those periods either the tourists are outside or not using the appliances while the supply is available nonetheless the generators stay heavily loaded almost over the entire period of the evening shift see fig 11 b the reason being that majority of the tourists return to resorts by evening and use almost all of the appliances available in rooms as a result the load curve in this shift does not seem to be fluctuating a lot rather it remains quite steady and consistent the load duration curves for both shifts have been shown in fig 12 from the constructed load curves and load duration curves figs 11 and 12 the selection of the size of generating units was done according to the procedure described in the literature nag 2007 the results are tabulated in table 7 an additional unit equal to the size of the largest selected unit was kept as standby the required installed capacity of the plant is the summation of all the seven selected units including the standby unit that is 144 kw from table 3 the total connected load in the modeled number of resorts is 85 68 kw the average loads in the day shift al day and evening shift al evening are 29 19 kw and 30 52 kw respectively fig 11 or 12 similarly peak loads pl day and pl evening are 61 35 kw and 34 81 kw respectively in addition the individual peak load imposed by each type of consumer e g hcas mcas and mchs resorts on the mhpp was available from the survey results the values during day shift are 11 85 kw 48 53 kw and 14 40 kw respectively and that during evening shift are 4 81 kw 21 kw and 11 40 kw respectively using these findings the df lf and divf had been estimated for both shifts separately the factors are summarized in table 8 the following step should be undertaken to improve the factors that have dissatisfactory values as shown in table 8 and thus to ensure economic plant operation in the day shift water pumps most power consuming appliances should be switched on during off peak periods i e from 12 p m 3 p m by doing so the peak load will be distributed over off peak periods as a result load curve will flatten out and average load on the plant will increase thus values of lf divf will also increase 3 3 1 selected generators and estimated water chamber capacity suitable generator ratings had been picked using eq 27 for the selected unit sizes the results are tabulated in table 9 the capacity of water chamber inside the mega reservoir associated with each unit was computed by applying eqs 28 and 29 using the data from table 7 the results are shown in table 10 it ought to be remarked that the standby unit will seldom come in operation so the water chamber of this unit should have connections with that of other six units so that necessary water can be transferred to them in case of emergency 3 4 economic feasibility of the mhpp project since the searaser has very unsophisticated design features its associated costs c searaser were assumed 500 kw as compared to that of other wecs usually 2 5 6 0 m mw astariz and iglesias 2015 based on the discussion of sect 2 2 6 1 construction cost per kw c const of the proposed mhpp had been estimated using required data from table 7 the cost breakdowns are shown in table 11 the c const for a dpp of the same capacity as the mhpp is approximately 767 68 kw nag 2007 the price of diesel fuel in bangladesh is about 0 77 litre byron and suman 2018 the diesel fuel consumption rates for the selected generator ratings see table 9 are shown in table 12 using these data different costs associated with both the alternatives mhpp and dpp had been estimated according to the discussion of sect 2 2 6 2 which is shown in table 13 for an interest rate i of 1 accordingly the lowest required tariff rate tr for the alternatives is 0 29 kwh a plot of cumulative pw of annual incomes from both alternatives is shown in fig 13 for i 1 and two different tr 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh referring to fig 13 it can be seen that the alternative mhpp is preferable over the dpp since the annual incomes from the mhpp have higher cumulative pw throughout the evaluation period for the stated i and tr fig 13 b shows the payback period n p for the dpp is less than that of mhpp however it is not preferable since the profit margin after the n p was considered as evaluation criteria the mhpp alternative has comparatively higher profit margin which is around 271 478 34 and 705 011 47 for tr of 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh respectively 3 5 emission calculation by implementing the mhpp technology instead of the existing one a huge amount of emissions of various gaseous pollutants can be saved annually the electrical energy generated in a year from the mhpp e has been calculated by using eq 33 and average loads data for both shifts from fig 11 or 12 that is 120110 55 kwh yr also the annual emitted amount of different ghgs produced during plant operation from different energy sources have been calculated by using eq 39 and the annual energy generation data as well as emission factor data from table 5 that is shown in fig 14 from fig 14 it is found that about 141 730 45 kg 102 093 97 kg and 63 658 59 kg of co2 emissions can be reduced by implementing the mhpp technology rather than implementing coal based petroleum based and natural gas based power plants respectively besides co2 huge amounts of so2 nox and co can be reduced that is also shown in fig 14 3 6 global tie up of the present case study the aforementioned results presented in earlier sections prove that the searaser based mhpp technology in the st martin s island is a profitable eco friendly and emission friendly alternative of the existing power supply scenario diesel generators as a result the tourism potential of the island may be enhanced as an added benefit however to tie up this finding of the present case study the wave energy flux i e wave power level j in the area of interest st martin s island at different possible searaser installation depth 5 m 70 m was estimated theoretically by using eqs 12 and 11 respectively the variation of j with d is shown in fig 15 table 14 shows the mean wave energy flux data at some specific regions island around the world together with the calculated mean wave energy flux for st martin s island comparing the calculated wave energy flux data for st martin s island with that of other sites see table 14 it seems evident that the searaser wec can be a potential candidate for wave power extraction in the majority of the coastal regions around the world even including the regions of low wave power as well thus being a unique competitor in contrast to other wecs 4 conclusion the present work analyzes the applicability of a novel low cost and eco friendly wec named searaser in the context of st martin s island thus laying the cornerstone for future studies based on wave energy extraction in bangladesh in this study a detailed layout for designing an mhpp using searaser including the economic feasibility and emission analysis has been shown in order to satisfy electricity demand during the pdhs in the resorts of saint martin s island instead of using diesel generators followings are the key findings of this entire design project at 25 m assumed depth for installing searaser the height and period of the design wave are 0 918 m and 4 446 s respectively the suction force during suction and the working force during working stroke of searaser are 5 46 kn and 50 79 kn respectively the searaser is able to produce water head of around 35 m by utilizing the wave power potential in the st martin s island the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp should be around 144 kw to effectively supply electricity in the tourist resorts of the island during the pdhs a rough cost estimation of the mhpp project indicates that around 5278 65 might be required per kw of installed capacity a financial comparison between the mhpp project and a typical dpp reveals that installing an mhpp is a more economical choice in terms of operating costs and end of life profit around 271 478 34 and 705 011 47 amount of profit can be made from this alternative for tr of 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh respectively at 1 interest rate by implementing the mhpp around 141 730 45 kg 102 093 97 kg and 63 658 59 kg of co2 emissions can be reduced rather than implementing coal based petroleum based and natural gas based power plants respectively this research may have one potential limitation that is hydrodynamic calculations associated with searaser were solely derived from the hindcasted wave data rather than actual field measurements furthermore the authors did not assess the pertinency of the wave hindcasting swwg model in the context of the region under investigation st martin s island through comparison with field or laboratory measurements this is because of the fact that the collection of actual wave data as well as validation of the swwg model is itself a massive study which requires special investigation and it is beyond the scope of the present study for this reason in the event of actual mhpp planning and installation a preliminary idea could be sought from the results produced in this study rather than accepting as a complete guider further studies regarding the collection of actual wave data in the st martin s island as well as the validation of the swwg model are therefore recommended to strengthen the feasibility of using searaser as proposed in this work 
22388,saint martin s island is one of the most notable tourist spots and the only coral island of bangladesh in the bay of bengal yet due to lack of electricity supply this beautiful island is becoming uninhabitable and losing tourist attraction in this study a decentralized mini hydroelectric power plant mhpp has been proposed and designed to mitigate electricity demand in the tourist resorts of the island during peak demand hours the energy input to the plant is supplied by harnessing ocean wave power available in the coastal regions of the island with a novel and simple wave energy converter wec named searaser to decide about the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp a field survey was conducted on the resorts of st martin s island the performance of searaser in the context of the island was investigated theoretically which indicated that the searaser is capable of producing about 35 m of water head by utilizing the available wave power realizing the availability of wave power and adopting sustainable tourism policy the estimated plant capacity was about 144 kw this study remarks that the implementation of searaser based mhpp technology in the st martin s island can be a profitable and eco friendly replacement of the existing stand alone diesel generators it was also found that huge amount of greenhouse gas ghg emission can be prevented and thereby the

which is the main cause of global warming also the earth has limited storage of fossil fuels which is depleting rapidly these ever rising problems have put a question on the use of fossil fuels and thus created a global incentive to look for proper renewable alternatives solar wind biomass hydro geothermal ocean energy otec tidal and wave are the most potential renewable resources that can be considered as appropriate substitutes of fossil fuels for example according to the results of extensive literature assessment conducted by many authors and organizations the estimated approximate

energy has the maximum energy density among all other renewable resources and can be extracted almost 90 of the available time compared to about 20 30 for wind and solar energy fadaeenejad et al 2014 drew et al 2009 the wave energy can be harnessed by using special types of devices called wec e g oscillating water column owc oyster archimedes wave swing searaser wave dragon pelamis and so on using wecs to supply electricity in remote islands and coastal cities has become a central issue since the past few decades the ever rising global warming problem of fossil fuels and inconveniences associated with fuel shipping to the remote coastal places have sparked a growing interest to substitute them by potential renewable resources especially wave energy for instance two full sized nearshore wec prototypes 350 and 500 kw rated power were implemented near bergen norway in 1985 falcão 2010 in the early 1990s several prototypes of owc were put to service in different regions a 75 kw prototype at the island of islay in scotland whittaker et al 1993 a 60 kw prototype incorporated into a breakwater at the port of sakata in japan ohneda et al 1991 and a 125 kw plant at trivandrum in india ravindran and koola 1991 deane et al 2012 investigated about the economic impacts of 500 mw of wave power in ireland similar studies were also conducted at the shetland and bernera islands in scotland to construct their wave power plants in the upcoming years dunnet and wallace 2009 analyzed the pertinency of wecs to canada and canadian islands fadaeenejad et al 2014 did a comprehensive review of wecs with special consideration to small islands recently a 7 mw power plant based on wave dragon has been deployed on the coast of wales uk association eoe 2010 however in bangladesh research in the field of wec technology is still in unhatched condition although some islands and coastal areas here e g kuakata sandwip and st martin s island have sufficient wave power potentiality that can be utilized reasonably with appropriate wec technology ahmed et al 2013 undp 2006 this study unveils that with the prospect of the cutting edge nearshore wec named searaser the wave energy utilization quo of bangladesh may change for the better the searaser is the brainchild of british inventor alvin smith 2013 thereafter its discovery it has garnered worldwide attention and being tested in some areas as well for example babajani et al 2016 extensively investigated about an optimum distance between two searasers for maximum power absorption from the caspian sea in iran its simplistic concept coupled with eco friendly design features makes it an ideal wec for low budget situations and to be implementable in remote islands from the above literature it appears that the ocean wave energy can be one of the very potential options to electrify the tourist resorts of st martin s island in bangladesh the most notable tourist spot here where comprehensive research is needed to implement the searaser wec based power generation technology the aim of this research is to analyze the performance of searaser in case of st martin s island by theoretical investigation and present a feasible framework for designing an mhpp usually 100 1000 kw voros et al 2000 run by searaser with a view to supplying electricity in the tourist resorts during some peak demand hours thus replacing the existing diesel generators 2 methodology 2 1 concept and physical model 2 1 1 the wec searaser the searaser is basically a wave driven water pump for generating hydroelectric power which is shown schematically in fig 1 the working cycle of searaser is based on two actions suction stroke and working stroke during the suction stroke when a wave crest reaches the vicinity of searaser the weighted surface buoy wsb along with the elongated member piston is forced to heave upward consequently a vacuum is created inside the cylindrical pumping chamber and surrounding water starts entering into it during the working stroke when the wave passes the wsb heaves down due to gravity thus pressurizes the accumulated water in the chamber the pressurized water is then allowed to go uphill and be stored in a reservoir the stored water can be released back downhill through a hydraulic turbine producing electricity before finally returning back to the sea 2 1 2 layout of the proposed mhpp the layout of the proposed searaser based power plant is shown in fig 2 the mega reservoir which contains water pumped by searaser comprises of several chambers with certain water storage capacity for all generating units turbine generator connected to it the water chamber capacity of any unit and the water flowrate required to the turbine depend on the following parameters water head gained power rating and running time of that unit the water chambers may contain interconnected valves among them so that mutual transfer of water is possible in case of emergency the capacity of water chambers can be increased easily if required to materialize the future expansion in unit size in addition a removable reservoir roof with filtering net may be provided to take advantage of storing rain water 2 2 design of the mhpp designing an mhpp requires a lot of key factors and scenarios to be considered as per the aim of this study the searaser will supply necessary energy input to the plant hence its performance study becomes crucial at the initial stage of the design process the entire design process includes the following stages 2 2 1 1st stage wave characteristics hindcasting from wind speed measurement 2 2 1 1 use of historical wind speed data real ocean waves are very irregular and complex in nature because of nonlinearities three dimensional characteristics and their random behavior sarpkaya 2010 therefore to study them a significant wave height and period h m t m are defined such that they represent the characteristics of real sea in the form of monochromatic waves army 1984 the performance of searaser is governed by the wave characteristics at the location it is installed it is therefore essential for this study to know the wave characteristics in the st martin s island at a specific depth where the searaser will be put under service finding the wave characteristics by field measurement is beyond the scope of this study moreover no direct study has been conducted yet in the st martin s island to find these data but in the past several studies were performed to collect the wind speed data in there bangladesh council for scientific and industrial research bcsir conducted a study to find the wind speed in the island they collected data at the height of 30 m above the ground level for three consecutive years 1999 2001 kaiser and aditya 2006 khan et al 2004 nasa satellite measurement of wind speed for the same location at 10 m height is also available kaiser and aditya 2006 those records are tabulated in table 1 however it is possible to hindcast the wave characteristics at a certain location of the sea by using suitable wave prediction models in existence provided that the sea state condition as well as wind speed information at that location is known this is because of the reason that the wave characteristics are closely related to wind speed for the wind generated waves which is the most common types of waves seen in the seas army 1984 sundar 2015 in this study for quick and low cost estimates a simplified wave growth model discussed in literature was applied to hindcast wave characteristics in the st martin s island at a finite water depth for installing the searaser in that model the wind speed data from the record of bcsir khan et al 2004 were used assuming a fetch limited condition of generating wind but the fetch lengths f of those recorded wind data were not known also their direct measurement is beyond the reach of this study so a typical range between 42 km 100 km had been assumed 2 2 1 2 estimation of overwater wind speed the wind speed in a wave hindcasting computation must be the speed over water kamphuis 2000 in this study as discussed in literature overwater wind speed was estimated by projecting the overland values measured by bcsir see table 1 over the fetch considering several criterions and adjustment factors conversion of observed wind speed to a reference 10 m height level u l 10 adjustment for location effects r l and adjustment for stability effects r t for fetches longer than 16 km the factor r t solely depends upon the air sea temperature difference δt u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 therefore δt 3 c was considered since this is the most regular instance in the real oceanic situation to evaluate these factors some charts available in the literature were used army 2002 the overall relation for transforming overland wind speed into a constant overwater wind speed u a can be written as u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 1 u a 0 71 u l 10 r t r l 1 23 2 2 1 3 shallow water wave growth swwg model some parametric models for predicting shallow water wave growth as well as deep water wave growth are available u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 swwg model is of particular interest for this study because searaser is a nearshore type wec which needs to be moored to the sea bed i e to be installed in finite depth hence it cannot be set in deep water considering technical and economic viability although the wave energy density is higher in deep water fernandes and fonseca 2013 the swwg model requires three input parameters to be given f u a and depth d the empirical equations of swwg model eqs 2 and 3 proposed by young and verhagen young and verhagen 1996 kamphuis 2000 were used in this study this model is based on standard jonswap wave spectrum also it was developed by considering the distortion of the wave shape and the wave energy dissipation effects due to shallower depth as well as the directional spreading of ocean wave energy around mean wind direction young and verhagen 1996 young et al 1996 2 h m 0 24 u a 2 g tanh 0 49 g d u a 2 0 75 tanh 0 0031 g f u a 2 0 57 tanh 0 49 g d u a 2 0 75 3 t m

theory selection prior to the estimation of wave forces on nearshore offshore structures or devices e g the wecs simplification of actual irregular ocean waves is required to be able to quantify the wave action and its effects kamphuis 2000 therefore it is often necessary to describe a sea state more detailed than possible by the regular waves andersen and frigaard 2008 there are several wave theories that are useful in the design analysis of nearshore offshore structure or devices these theories by necessity are regular chakrabarti 2005 but the wave hindcasting model used in this study swwg model predicts wave parameters in terms of significant spectral wave height h m and peak spectral period t m which are the terminologies used in the definition of irregular waves a reasonable approach to relate irregular wave parameters with that of regular wave is to equate the average total wave energy in both regular and irregular wave trains u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 the height of a regular wave train with the same energy as an irregular wave train with significant height h m is equal to 0 71h m for deep water u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 a precise computation of such relationship in finite depth is much more difficult u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 therefore to minimize the complexity and proceed with the aim of this study the irregular wave parameters obtained from the swwg model h m t m has been assumed as approximately equal to the regular wave parameters so that a regular wave theory can be applied it is not convenient to deal individually with each and every hindcasted wave characteristics h m t m corresponding to each monthly wind speed data see table 1 the usual practice in such cases is to specify a single design wave in this study the height and period of the design wave h m t m were calculated in a simple manner by using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 h m j 1 12 n j h m j j 1 12 n j 5 t m j 1 12 n j t m j j 1 12 n j after the design wave is specified an appropriate regular wave theory must be selected to estimate wave forces on the wec for reliable design and performance analysis varma 2014 wave characteristics in nearshore regions finite depth are better described by higher order finite amplitude wave faw theories u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 however selecting the most suitable faw theory for a defined design wave given h m t m and d is rather difficult any comparison between the theories must be considered only in relation to the prevailing environmental characteristics and particular location sarpkaya 2010 in this study fig 3 indicating regions of applicability of different wave theories was used for the selection purpose in fig 3 if the co ordinate d g t m 2 h m g t m 2 falls within the region of linear wave theory or stoke s 2nd order theory then the wavelength l of the design wave can be computed using eq 6 sundar 2015 6 l g t m 2 2 π tanh 2 π d l however this equation is implicit in terms of l the explicit expression developed by fenton and mckee 1990 is 7 k d ω 2 d g coth ω d g 3 2 2 3 where k 2 π l the wave theory selection process can be foolproofed further by using a dimensionless parameter called ursell number u r for the design wave it can be defined as 8 u r l 2 h m d 3 2 2 2 2 wave energy transport and wave profile estimation the measure of wave crest and trough amplitude a c and a t respectively can be obtained by using some analytical expressions corresponding to the selected wave theory it will be discussed in the result section of this study that the stoke s 2nd order theory is the best suited for this case according to this theory a c and a t are computed from eq 9 u s army engineer waterways experiment station 1984 9 a c a t h m 2 π h m 2 8 l cosh 2 π d l sinh 3 2 π d l 2 cosh 4 π d l considering a standard jonswap spectrum the wave energy flux j transported by the realistic non sinusoidal design wave in deep water can be calculated from eq 10 su et al 2018 10 j ρ g 2 64 π h m 2 0 9 t m however for finite water depth the effect of change in wave celerity with depth should be considered which is done by introducing a term d kd to eq 10 falnes 2002 11 j ρ g 2 64 π h m 2 0 9 t m d k d the depth effect d kd is usually estimated using the following formula falnes 2002 12 d k d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d tanh k d 2 2 2 3 size limit of searaser s power take off pto system the mechanism by which energy is transferred between the waves and the wec and subsequently converted into a useful form is generally known as pto henderson 2006 in the case of searaser the major component of the pto system is the wsb the magnitudes of interacting forces between waves and the wsb depend on its size characteristics length i e diameter the occurrence possibility of scattering or radiation of incident wave energy from a wec is truly an important consideration for wave force estimation this phenomenon is signified by diffraction parameter d p 13 d p π d l as a rule of thumb if d p 0 5 for a nearshore offshore structure or device it can be considered as small sized and diffraction effect of waves becomes insignificant chakrabarti 2005 in an attempt to keep the force analysis simple in this study following assumptions were adopted the wsb is small sized the buoys of the searaser both wsb and underwater buoy are axisymmetric wsb absorbs power from the waves during heave mode of oscillation only 2 2 2 4 forces on the wsb the wsb of the searaser s pto system having a single degree of freedom heave basically incorporates two types of forces the weight of the buoy itself w f and wave applied exciting force in heave f f see fig 4 weight of the wsb should be such that it remains buoyant 14 w f m g 1 4 ρ g π d 2 d r on the other hand the total wave applied exciting force in heave on a submerged buoy can be expressed as f f ˆ f f k ˆ f d ˆ however considering only the magnitudes of those forces korde and ertekin 2015 showed that for a small sized buoy 15 f f f f k 1 4 ρ g a c π d 2 e k d r it is evident that during the suction stroke of searaser s operation the suction of water will occur only when f fk w f so the suction force is f fk w f the working force during the working stroke is simply w f 2 2 2 5 hydrodynamics of searaser and associated system suction pressure that would be created inside the pumping chamber of searaser 16 p s f f k w f π 4 d b o r e 2 and the pressure to which sea water would be raised or the working pressure see fig 2 17 p w p 1 w f π 4 d b o r e 2 the water head that will be achieved from the searaser can be estimated in a simplistic manner by using the bernoulli s principle with following assumptions h m and t m remain constant over time minor losses in the pipe components are negligible searaser is operating under steady state consequently the application of it between the inlet of water transfer pipe and the top surface of the reservoir gives indicated by point 1 and 2 in fig 2 18 h p 1 p 2 ρ g v 1 2 v 2 2 2 g d z 1 h l a complete stroke during the work cycle of searaser occurs when a wave crest followed by a successive wave trough passes over the buoy as depicted in fig 5 the stroke length of the piston is h m h and distance between successive crest and trough is l 2 as per definition the design wave travels a distance of l by the time period t m similarly l 2 distance will be traveled by time period t l 2 which is the time required to complete one stroke the volume flow rate through the water transfer pipe can be calculated from the t l 2 and the mass of water inside the cylinder at the end of the suction stroke m w by using eq 19 19 q m w ρ t l 2 π h m h d b o r e 2 4 t l 2 let s consider the diameter of the water transfer pipe 20 d p i p e 1 n d b o r e so the velocity of water at its inlet 21 v 1 n 2 h m h t l 2 the velocity at the reservoir top can be considered as v 2 0

capacity modelling a field survey was conducted in the st martin s island in order to find out total electricity demand on its resorts based on accommodation capacity and variety of electrical appliances the resorts of the st martin s island can be classified mainly into three categories high capacity average standard hcas medium capacity average standard mcas and medium capacity high standard mchs resorts hcas resorts typically have large tourist accommodation capacity a higher quantity of rooms unlike them mcas resorts have decreased number of rooms and moderate accommodation capacity however both hcas and mcas resorts contain only necessary electrical appliances e g light fan and so forth similarly mchs resorts have moderate accommodation capacity but they incorporate some luxury appliances crt led tv water heater together with the necessary appliances nevertheless each type of resort has some electric motor driven water pumps to provide the necessary water for the tourists it was found in the survey that around 71 resorts are mcas 19 are mchs and the rest 10 are hcas resorts tables 2 and 3 show typical examples of hcas mcas and mchs resorts including their average accommodation capacity types of rooms and the electrical appliances they contain currently the number of tourists visiting this island per day has exceeded its real carrying capacity rcc and obviously the effective carrying capacity ecc which is the optimum number of tourists to be allowed hasan et al 2014 conducted a study about the carrying capacity of st martin s island and they found the rcc is around 2913 tourists day they also evaluated the ecc for 63 management capacity mc which is around 1835 tourist day the rcc and ecc are related by the following relation hasan et al 2014 26 e c c r c c m c fig 6 constructed from available historical data alam et al 2015 hasan et al 2014 depicts the trend of yearly increase in the average number of tourists visiting this island per day during the peak tourist season oct mar over the past few years fig 6 clarifies that at present the island is overloaded with tourists well beyond its rcc to accommodate these rapidly increasing number of tourists many resorts have been built in the past several years but power generation and supply in the island should not be desired by keeping its ecological and tourism potential at risk therefore the concept of sustainable tourism policy was taken under major consideration in this study to model the effective accommodation capacity of the resorts or alternately to figure out the approximate electricity requirements in there for convenience it was assumed that the present ecc of the island is similar to that found by hasan et al 2014 in 2014 the total accommodation capacity in all three types of resorts mentioned earlier is to be modeled such that it remains under ecc accordingly a total of 21 resorts have been considered at present out of which two hcas fifteen mcas and four mchs resorts were selected to maintain compatibility with survey result see table 2 2 2 4 4th stage determination of the installed capacity of the mhpp a realistic estimation of the daily consumption profiles of total connected electrical loads in the resorts is essential to take a decision about the installed capacity of the mhpp and the size and operating schedules of its different generating units although every resort in st martin s island has stand alone generators of its own as a main power supply source it was assumed that all the 21 modeled resorts are connected to a central power supply system their individual demand is to be fulfilled integrally by the proposed mhpp the generator of a typical resort is only operated at some specific hours when the tourists are most likely to be in need of electricity those periods can be termed as peak demand hours pdhs which is on average 8 9 h day for any resort pdhs may vary from day to day and resort to resort though however from the survey it has been observed that the overall pdhs of all the resorts as a whole are in total of around 11 h day and can be divided into two shifts day shift 10 a m 3 p m and evening shift 6 p m 12 a m the generators remain off from around 12 a m 10 a m in almost every resort the prime objective of this work was only to mitigate the electricity demand in both the day shift and evening shift of pdhs by renewable wave powered hydro electricity as an alternative of using the diesel generators it ought to be mentioned that continuous supply of electricity from the mhhp may not be possible because the generation of electricity depends solely on the water supply from the reservoir i e the availability of wave power however wave power level in the nearshore region of st martin s island is quite unsteady because it tends to be higher during high tide and lower during low tide periods sometimes the power level in the low tide period is too small to be absorbed by a nearshore wec like searaser and thereby continuous electricity supply is seldom practical so there will be two load curves on the mhpp in a typical day during the day shift and evening shift of pdhs to generate the load curves for all the modeled number of resorts hcas mcas and mchs survey on each type of resort was conducted for three consecutive days then their individual load curves corresponding to the shift of pdhs were aggregated to find a single load curve representing the overall demand variation in a typical day from the load curves and corresponding load duration curves the decision about the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp size of generating units in each shift their startup and shutdown time and operating schedules were made to ensure economic operation and maintenance the evaluation of the proposed plant was also done using some economic factors such as demand factor df load factor lf and diversity factor divf nag 2007 2 2 5 5th stage generator selection and water chambers capacity estimation suitable generator selection for the selected unit sizes was done by using eq 27 considering a standard power factor f p of 0 8 the obtained kva rating was rounded to the next standard value 27 p g e n p u f p for any unit the required water flowrate to the hydraulic turbine 28 q t 3 6 10 6 p u ρ g η t g h hence the capacity of the water chamber for any unit 29 w c q t t r 2 2 6 7th stage economic feasibility analysis of the mhpp 2 2 6 1 cost estimation of the mhpp the development of a hydroelectric power plant is dependent on the economic and financial feasibility which must be evaluated by cost estimates before starting construction tiago filho et al 2017 for that purpose researchers have developed many empirical correlations relating cost to the head and power rating of a plant cost functions in order to simulate its cost these cost functions strongly depend upon the characteristics of local markets of a region and many other managerial and financial reasons deduction of such cost function for any region requires extensive field study on the power plants of that region many authors like singal and saini 2008 kaldellis et al 2005 and aggidis et al 2010 deduced cost functions for hydroelectric power plants in respectively india greece and uk after studying over a hundred of plants all across the country similar studies have been conducted in brazil and other countries as well tiago filho et al 2017 since bangladesh at the moment does not have enough hydroelectric power plants to enable such study cost functions developed for india were used in this study to get a priori cost estimation of the mhpp project considering the fact that india is the neighboring country of bangladesh and the characteristics of local markets here may be similar to that of india by some extent the indian cost functions for various component of a typical hydroelectric power plant are listed in table 4 the cost functions listed in table 4 give the cost in indian rupees rs

comparison with existing technology two mutually exclusive alternatives were considered for providing the estimated electricity needs from load curves one is the proposed mhpp itself and the other is a diesel generator based power plant dpp which reflects the current power supply scenario in the st martin s island out of them the most economical alternative was selected based on cumulative present worth method where the present worth pw of annual incomes from the plants are added and stated on a year by year basis throughout a defined evaluation period drbal et al 1996 the most economical alternative is the one having the highest profit margin after capital recovery the type of costs considered for the economic analysis are capital cost c capital annual depreciation cost a dep and annual fuel consumption cost a fuel for the mhpp alternative a fuel is zero being operated upon renewable resource whereas the dpp alternative incurs this additional cost due to exorbitant consumption of diesel fuel the salvage values s for both the alternatives was assumed to be zero the assumed lifetimes l t of the mhpp and the dpp are 45 and 15 years respectively which is very typical so the alternatives were compared over an evaluation period equal to the least common multiple of their stated lives to satisfy the equal service requirement blank and tarquin 2012 which is 45 years the associated cash inflows and outflows for the analysis can be estimated using the following equations 31 c c a p i t a l c c o n s t p l a n t c a p a c i t y 32 a d e p c c a p i t a l s i 1 i l t 1

proposed hydropower scheme with other types of power plants operated based on common type of fossil fuels e g coal petroleum natural gas etc was also done in this study to evaluate the environmental impacts of the mhpp alternative table 5 shows typical power plant ghg emission factors ef during operation for different energy sources the emitted amount ea of any ghg gas can be calculated from eq 39 39 e a j e e f j where subscript j denotes the ghgs e g co2 so2 nox co 3 results and discussion 3 1 design wave parameters and wave theory according to the methodology described in section 2 2 1 2 u a was calculated the results are tabulated in table 6 the water depth d where the searaser will be installed was assumed to be 25 m the h m and t m for available wind speed data from bcsir khan et al 2004 table 1 were estimated by applying eqs 2 and 3 of the swwg model using the assumed d and calculated u a values the hindcasted wave characteristics h m t m are also tabulated in table 6 and shown in fig 7 the height h m and period t m of the design wave were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 with data from table 6 which are 0 918 m and 4 446 s respectively the entire aforementioned procedure for calculating h m and t m was repeated for some other d values 5 m 70 m than the assumed value 25 m and has been plotted and shown in fig 8 it is observable from fig 8 that the change in the values of h m and t m is significant in the regions 5 m d 25 m however the curves start to flatten out at approximately d 25 m which continues afterwards 25 m d 70 m and thereby the change is negligible as a result continuing this design study with any depth value 25 m will not have any significant effect on the outcomes of this study therefore the assumption of d 25 m is justified note that working with depths 25 m is undesired because the typical depth range for installing nearshore wecs is approximately 30 m 70 m fernandes and fonseca 2013 the assumed depth value in this study is very much marginal to this range using the calculated design wave characteristics for d 25 m h m 0 918 m t m 4 446 s in fig 3 it was found that the design wave is better described by stoke s 2nd order theory which also holds true for any other depth within the range considered in this study 5 m d 70 m hence eq 7 was used to calculate the wavelength l of the design wave which is 31 066 m using eq 8 the value of u r was found as 0 057 for small values 26 of u r stoke s faw theories are the most suitable fenton et al 1990 this further confirms that the selection of stoke s 2nd order theory is valid the a c and a t of the design wave were computed directly by using eq 9 which are 0 4803 m and 0 4377 m respectively 3 2 size of the pto system and head calculation the diameter d of the wsb is to be selected such that its geometry and dynamic behavior becomes simple also it can extract wave energy among a front wider than its own dimension fernandes and fonseca 2013 because of that reason d p 0 4 was assumed accordingly d 3 96 m 4 m was obtained from eq 13 eqs 14 and 15 elucidate that both the suction force f fk w f and the working force w f vary with draft length d r of the wsb using the buoy diameter and design wave parameters specified in sect 3 1 h m 0 918 m t m 4 446 s the variation of f fk w f and w f against d r has been plotted and shown in fig 9 according to sect 2 2 2 4 a negative value of f fk w f is not acceptable therefore d r 0 4 m is chosen to have optimum f fk w f and w f values simultaneously accordingly the height h of the buoy was assumed to be 0 6 m knowing the values of a c l d and d r w f and f fk were calculated by using eqs 14 and 15 which are 50 79 kn and 56 25 kn respectively so f fk w f 5 46 kn in the working stroke the wsb should push the water accumulated during suction stroke hence to have a working force of 50 79 kn the mass assigned to the buoy should be approximately 5200 kg this finding is fully compliant with the work of babajani et al 2016 where they assigned a buoy mass of 9000 kg in their searaser model once the diameter of the pumping chamber d bore of the searaser is known the pressures p s and p w or p 1 can be calculated using eqs 16 and 17 in this study d bore 350 mm was assumed which is within the range mention in searaser s patent smith 2013 so p 1 5 21 atm was obtained whereas p 2 1 atm 101 325 kpa see fig 2 for the specified t m d and l the time required to complete each stroke by searaser s piston t l 2 was calculated by replacing l with l 2 and t m with t l 2 in eq 6 the result is 3 15 s the water transfer pipe that carries pressurized sea water to the reservoir was assumed to be made of smooth plastic i e ԑ 0 mm for specified buoy dimension and design wave the velocity head gain v 1 2 2g and frictional head loss h l in water transfer pipe depends greatly on the reduction factor n see eqs 21 23 their variations with n are shown in fig 10 by analyzing this figure n 2 8 was chosen because beyond this value h l keeps on increasing while the net gain in v 1 2 2g is quite negligible also it is not economical to use pipe of larger diameter although the head loss would be less in that case this n 2 8 value can be considered as a trade off between both economic and head loss constraints with this ratio the chosen water transfer pipe diameter d pipe is 125 mm the value of friction factor f was determined from eq 24 that is 0 018 elevation of point 1 from the datum line z 1 as shown in fig 2 was assumed as 20 m the length of the water transfer pipe l can be assumed safely as 500 m since it is apparent from eq 25 that this value will not have any significant effect on it plugging in all these findings in eq 25 the net head h 34 95 m 35 m was obtained 3 3 the installed capacity of the mhpp and its operation guidelines the overall variation of electricity demand with time during the two shifts of the pdhs has been shown in fig 11 during the day shift the water pumps are turned on only for a couple of hours with a view to supplying necessary water for the tourists this particular time period may vary from day to day resort to resort reckoning on the situation as a consequence in fig 11 a the overall load curve of the resorts exhibits an abrupt change with time it is evident from fig 11 a that the demand during day shift is at its peak from 11 a m 12 a m this is because usually within this period the majority of the tourists prepare themselves for a day out at the sea beach hence use all the appliances in the room in the other periods of day shift demand falls because at those periods either the tourists are outside or not using the appliances while the supply is available nonetheless the generators stay heavily loaded almost over the entire period of the evening shift see fig 11 b the reason being that majority of the tourists return to resorts by evening and use almost all of the appliances available in rooms as a result the load curve in this shift does not seem to be fluctuating a lot rather it remains quite steady and consistent the load duration curves for both shifts have been shown in fig 12 from the constructed load curves and load duration curves figs 11 and 12 the selection of the size of generating units was done according to the procedure described in the literature nag 2007 the results are tabulated in table 7 an additional unit equal to the size of the largest selected unit was kept as standby the required installed capacity of the plant is the summation of all the seven selected units including the standby unit that is 144 kw from table 3 the total connected load in the modeled number of resorts is 85 68 kw the average loads in the day shift al day and evening shift al evening are 29 19 kw and 30 52 kw respectively fig 11 or 12 similarly peak loads pl day and pl evening are 61 35 kw and 34 81 kw respectively in addition the individual peak load imposed by each type of consumer e g hcas mcas and mchs resorts on the mhpp was available from the survey results the values during day shift are 11 85 kw 48 53 kw and 14 40 kw respectively and that during evening shift are 4 81 kw 21 kw and 11 40 kw respectively using these findings the df lf and divf had been estimated for both shifts separately the factors are summarized in table 8 the following step should be undertaken to improve the factors that have dissatisfactory values as shown in table 8 and thus to ensure economic plant operation in the day shift water pumps most power consuming appliances should be switched on during off peak periods i e from 12 p m 3 p m by doing so the peak load will be distributed over off peak periods as a result load curve will flatten out and average load on the plant will increase thus values of lf divf will also increase 3 3 1 selected generators and estimated water chamber capacity suitable generator ratings had been picked using eq 27 for the selected unit sizes the results are tabulated in table 9 the capacity of water chamber inside the mega reservoir associated with each unit was computed by applying eqs 28 and 29 using the data from table 7 the results are shown in table 10 it ought to be remarked that the standby unit will seldom come in operation so the water chamber of this unit should have connections with that of other six units so that necessary water can be transferred to them in case of emergency 3 4 economic feasibility of the mhpp project since the searaser has very unsophisticated design features its associated costs c searaser were assumed 500 kw as compared to that of other wecs usually 2 5 6 0 m mw astariz and iglesias 2015 based on the discussion of sect 2 2 6 1 construction cost per kw c const of the proposed mhpp had been estimated using required data from table 7 the cost breakdowns are shown in table 11 the c const for a dpp of the same capacity as the mhpp is approximately 767 68 kw nag 2007 the price of diesel fuel in bangladesh is about 0 77 litre byron and suman 2018 the diesel fuel consumption rates for the selected generator ratings see table 9 are shown in table 12 using these data different costs associated with both the alternatives mhpp and dpp had been estimated according to the discussion of sect 2 2 6 2 which is shown in table 13 for an interest rate i of 1 accordingly the lowest required tariff rate tr for the alternatives is 0 29 kwh a plot of cumulative pw of annual incomes from both alternatives is shown in fig 13 for i 1 and two different tr 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh referring to fig 13 it can be seen that the alternative mhpp is preferable over the dpp since the annual incomes from the mhpp have higher cumulative pw throughout the evaluation period for the stated i and tr fig 13 b shows the payback period n p for the dpp is less than that of mhpp however it is not preferable since the profit margin after the n p was considered as evaluation criteria the mhpp alternative has comparatively higher profit margin which is around 271 478 34 and 705 011 47 for tr of 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh respectively 3 5 emission calculation by implementing the mhpp technology instead of the existing one a huge amount of emissions of various gaseous pollutants can be saved annually the electrical energy generated in a year from the mhpp e has been calculated by using eq 33 and average loads data for both shifts from fig 11 or 12 that is 120110 55 kwh yr also the annual emitted amount of different ghgs produced during plant operation from different energy sources have been calculated by using eq 39 and the annual energy generation data as well as emission factor data from table 5 that is shown in fig 14 from fig 14 it is found that about 141 730 45 kg 102 093 97 kg and 63 658 59 kg of co2 emissions can be reduced by implementing the mhpp technology rather than implementing coal based petroleum based and natural gas based power plants respectively besides co2 huge amounts of so2 nox and co can be reduced that is also shown in fig 14 3 6 global tie up of the present case study the aforementioned results presented in earlier sections prove that the searaser based mhpp technology in the st martin s island is a profitable eco friendly and emission friendly alternative of the existing power supply scenario diesel generators as a result the tourism potential of the island may be enhanced as an added benefit however to tie up this finding of the present case study the wave energy flux i e wave power level j in the area of interest st martin s island at different possible searaser installation depth 5 m 70 m was estimated theoretically by using eqs 12 and 11 respectively the variation of j with d is shown in fig 15 table 14 shows the mean wave energy flux data at some specific regions island around the world together with the calculated mean wave energy flux for st martin s island comparing the calculated wave energy flux data for st martin s island with that of other sites see table 14 it seems evident that the searaser wec can be a potential candidate for wave power extraction in the majority of the coastal regions around the world even including the regions of low wave power as well thus being a unique competitor in contrast to other wecs 4 conclusion the present work analyzes the applicability of a novel low cost and eco friendly wec named searaser in the context of st martin s island thus laying the cornerstone for future studies based on wave energy extraction in bangladesh in this study a detailed layout for designing an mhpp using searaser including the economic feasibility and emission analysis has been shown in order to satisfy electricity demand during the pdhs in the resorts of saint martin s island instead of using diesel generators followings are the key findings of this entire design project at 25 m assumed depth for installing searaser the height and period of the design wave are 0 918 m and 4 446 s respectively the suction force during suction and the working force during working stroke of searaser are 5 46 kn and 50 79 kn respectively the searaser is able to produce water head of around 35 m by utilizing the wave power potential in the st martin s island the installed capacity of the proposed mhpp should be around 144 kw to effectively supply electricity in the tourist resorts of the island during the pdhs a rough cost estimation of the mhpp project indicates that around 5278 65 might be required per kw of installed capacity a financial comparison between the mhpp project and a typical dpp reveals that installing an mhpp is a more economical choice in terms of operating costs and end of life profit around 271 478 34 and 705 011 47 amount of profit can be made from this alternative for tr of 0 35 kwh and 0 45 kwh respectively at 1 interest rate by implementing the mhpp around 141 730 45 kg 102 093 97 kg and 63 658 59 kg of co2 emissions can be reduced rather than implementing coal based petroleum based and natural gas based power plants respectively this research may have one potential limitation that is hydrodynamic calculations associated with searaser were solely derived from the hindcasted wave data rather than actual field measurements furthermore the authors did not assess the pertinency of the wave hindcasting swwg model in the context of the region under investigation st martin s island through comparison with field or laboratory measurements this is because of the fact that the collection of actual wave data as well as validation of the swwg model is itself a massive study which requires special investigation and it is beyond the scope of the present study for this reason in the event of actual mhpp planning and installation a preliminary idea could be sought from the results produced in this study rather than accepting as a complete guider further studies regarding the collection of actual wave data in the st martin s island as well as the validation of the swwg model are therefore recommended to strengthen the feasibility of using searaser as proposed in this work 
22389,in this study a time domain higher order rankine panel method is developed and applied to evaluate the wave body interaction problem in shallow water and regular waves the hydrodynamic effects of forward speed and finite water depth are accounted for in order to verify the proposed numerical method the duisburg test case dtc container ship is chosen as a study object the numerical results of the wave induced ship motions and the added resistance are validated against the data of model tests which were carried out in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders

near shore or in coastal areas it is desired to have a better insight into the effects of shallow water the influence of shallow water leads to a more complex hydrodynamic situation compared to open sea in addition these areas are often subjected to wave conditions under the presence of waves in shallow water areas not only the safety related issues of the manoeuvring ships should arouse concern but also the seakeeping behaviour such as wave induced motions and added resistance needs to be taken into account to avoid grounding and to quantify speed reduction hence it is essential to investigate the wave induced motions and second order wave forces in finite water depth for this reason many researchers have developed numerical methods to solve the wave body interaction problems in finite water depth in an early stage the 2d strip theory was used for its practicability and high efficiency in the initial design kim 1968 hwang and lee 1975 takaki 1977 tasai et al 1978 andersen 1979 kim 1999 perunovic and jensen 2003 vantorre and journée 2003 kim and kim 2012 the mentioned method however is only suitable for relatively high frequencies and a slender ship hull because of this limitation researchers turned their attention to the matched asymptotic expansion method maem where the solutions of the far field is matched with the solution of the near field on the interface boundary by using different numerical techniques on the divided field zones tuck 1970 vorobyov and stasenko 2010 the main problem with this method is that because of the long wave assumption large deviations occur when the wave length is close to the ship length more advanced techniques are available nowadays to address this problem in shallow water such as 3d panel methods based on green function or rankine source the free surface green function panel method has been initially applied by researchers oortmerssen 1976 chan 1990 li 2001 though the accuracy seems to be better than the 2d theory or maem the form and evaluation of green function is relatively complex and difficult furthermore the neumann kelvin linearization of the method cannot consider the interaction between the steady and unsteady flows while it can be accounted for by using double body linearization method in comparison the rankine source based 3d panel method has been widely used for its flexible treatment of the free surface as well as the simpler kernel form moreover the rankine source method can more easily be extended to include nonlinear factors when addressing the ship motion in waves such as nonlinear free surface conditions and dynamic squat nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces see the works of riesner et al 2016 riesner and el moctar 2018 among others gao et al 2008 yao et al 2017 applied the frequency domain rankine panel method for ship hydrodynamic analysis in shallow water conditions in their frequency domain method transient dynamic effects such as the coupling effect with the nonlinear external force cannot be considered kim and kim 2012 the time domain rankine panel method was applied for the wave induced motion problems in shallow water by kim and kim 2012 kim and kim 2013 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 but their studies only focused on the zero forward speed cases another point of attentions is the added wave resistance when a ship navigates in a seaway this added resistance will lead to power loss and speed reduction moreover the arising greenhouse gas emissions are now constrained by the international maritime organization imo and the directives have already been established by the marine environment protection committee mepc from the perspective of an energy efficiency design index eedi recent research projects such as energy efficient safe ship operation shopera sprenger et al 2017 have been carried out to examine the safety and performance of ships in adverse weather conditions söding et al 2014 calculated the added resistance by a frequency domain rankine panel method which accounts for nonlinear steady flow the added wave resistance has also been studied using potential flow theory by many researchers such as seo et al 2014 lyu and el moctar 2017 kim et al 2017 zhang and el moctar 2019 park et al 2019 in order to fully investigate the viscous effects braking waves etc on added resistance in waves computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are also widely applied see for instance riesner and el moctar 2018 sigmund and el moctar 2018 however the mentioned studies on the added resistance in waves are mostly analysed in deep water cases and investigations in view of shallow water cases are scarce in the present study a time domain higher order rankine panel method is developed to investigate the motion responses and added resistance of a ship moving in shallow water of various water depths in regular waves the sea bottom is assumed to be flat and the image method is used to satisfy the bottom boundary condition a good agreement is achieved when comparing the numerical results with the data of model tests which were executed in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics

x y z fixed to a ship moving with the forward speed u 0 in the earth fixed coordinate system o x y z is introduced as shown in fig 1 the frame 0 x y z is on the mean water surface with its origin amidships the x axis positive to the bow the y axis positive to the port side and the z axis pointing upwards the total velocity potential ψ x t can be written as 1 ψ x y z t φ s x y z ϕ i x y z t ϕ d x y z t where φ s x y z ϕ i x y z t and ϕ d x y z t are the steady velocity potential the incident velocity potential and the unsteady disturbance velocity potential respectively the unsteady wave elevation ζ x y t can be written as 2 ζ x y t ζ i x y t ζ d x y t where ζ i x y t and ζ d x y t denote the incident wave elevation and the unsteady disturbance wave elevation respectively the velocity potential ϕ i x y z t of a regular incident wave is given as 3 ϕ i x y z t ζ a g ω 0 cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x cos β y sin β ω e t where ζ a is the wave amplitude g is the gravitational acceleration

as 5 ω e ω 0 k u 0 cos β the velocity potential ψ x y z t satisfies the following boundary value problem bvp 6 2 ψ 0 in the fluid domain the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the free

φ s the mj terms represent the interaction between the steady and unsteady flows since the second order derivatives of basic velocity potential can be considered as solutions of the dirichlet type problem when putting the first order derivatives of φ s as the right hand side terms the m j terms can be evaluated directly the detailed evaluation of the m j terms can be found in the authors previous work mei et al 2019 the sea bottom condition on z h is given as 16 ϕ d n 0 the initial condition at t 0 17 ϕ d 0 ϕ d t 0 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and motion equations using the method proposed by kring 1994 the unsteady disturbance velocity potential ϕ d x y z t can be further subdivided as the sum of a local flow potential ϕ l x y z t and a memory potential ϕ m x y z t 18 ϕ d x y z t ϕ l x y z t ϕ m x y z t then the diffraction potential is attributed to the memory potential which accounts for the effect on ship motion and wave elevation of the flow field at next moment while the radiation potential is attributed to the local potential and the memory potential the reason of taking out the local flow from the unsteady disturbance velocity potential is because of the instability of the numerical solution the local potential can be further decomposed as 19 ϕ l x t j 1 6 n j x ξ j t m j x ξ j t where n j x and m j x satisfy the following boundary conditions 20 n j x 0 m j x 0 j

d g should be added in the kinematic free surface condition to satisfy the radiation condition where υ is the newtonian cooling strength and is determined by 22 υ x 3 c s x x 0 2 x r x 0 3 0 x x 0 x r x 0 υ y 3 c s y y 0 2 y r y 0 3 0 y y 0 y r y 0 where c s is the coefficient of cooling strength x 0 y 0 and x r y r represent the coordinates of x axis and y axis of the start and end positions in the free surface damping region respectively once the unsteady velocity potentials ϕ l and ϕ m are obtained the wave exciting forces f i and radiation force f i j can be determined by integrating the pressure which is evaluated from bernoulli s equation along the mean wetted hull surface s b 23 f i s b ρ t u φ s ϕ i ϕ m n i d s 24 f i j s b ρ t u φ s ϕ d n i d s for a harmonically oscillating ship the radiation force f i j can be expressed as 25 f i j a i j ω e ξ j t b i j ω e ξ j t ω e 2 a i j ω e i ω e b i j ω e ξ j e i ω e t where ω e and ξ j are the encounter frequency and the amplitude of

newton s second law 27 m i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i ξ j ξ j t i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j represent the mass matrix and restoring coefficient matrix respectively the hydrodynamic forces f i ξ j ξ j t

expressed as 31 g x x 1 x x 2 y y 2 z z 2 1 x x 2 y y 2 z z 2 h 2 in order to avoid numerical errors due to a direct difference method the related physical variables are approximately described by a

the restoring coefficients matrix c i j an artificial spring model by kim and kim 2011 should be applied for evaluation of horizontal motion and resistance to avoid numerical divergence 38 c i i m i i

confined water cooperation fhr and ugent eight captive model tests and two tests in free running mode are selected the details of the experimental setup can be found in van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 here only the selected benchmark test conditions are listed in table 1 and table 2 for the experimental setup of the dtc container ship in deep water tests in regular waves have been conducted by marintek now sintef ocean el moctar et al 2015 the presented model test results for deep water in this paper are from lyu and el moctar 2017 here the selected test conditions are given in table 3 where h w is the wave height and t is the wave period 4 results and discussions the main particulars of the dtc container ship are listed in table 4 due to the symmetry of the flow field only half of the computational domain is considered fig 2 shows the adopted discretized panels on the boundaries after convergence analysis where the truncated free surface of the computational domain is 1 5l upstream 2l downstream and 0 8l half width the total number of discretized panels is 4950 with 1200 on half ship hull and 3750 on half free surface 4 1 wave exciting forces fig 3 shows the time histories of wave exciting force and moment at four water depths i e infinite water depth 100 ukc 50 ukc and 20 ukc as can be seen all of the curves are smooth which demonstrates the good numerical stability of the present program it is worth noting that even for the same wave frequency of the incident wave ω 0 l g 3 0 the time history curves at four water depths show different encounter wave frequencies due to the dispersion relation in finite water depth the non dimensional wave exciting heave force and pitch moment with respect to frequency at different water depths are plotted in fig 4 the amplitudes of the results are obtained by using fourier series expansion from the time history results corresponding to the same frequency from fig 4 it can be observed that the obvious difference mainly occurs at low frequencies for four water depths whereas the values at high frequencies do not show obvious differences except for phase shift persistence in low frequency range the most distinct feature is that the peak values of wave exciting force and moment rao move towards lower frequencies with decreasing water depth the same conclusion was also found in kim and kim 2012 for the zero forward speed case by rankine panel method and in perunovic and jensen 2003 for the nonzero forward speed case by strip method the reason is that the peak value is closely related to the ratio of wave length to the projected length of the ship on the direction of incident wave i e λ l cos β 4 2 hydrodynamic coefficients fig 5 presents the added masses and damping coefficients due to wave induced heave and pitch motions at different water depths from fig 5 a c it can be observed that the added masses decline sharply in low frequencies while almost tend to flat with the increase of the frequency as for the damping coefficients in fig 5 b d they first increase in relative low frequency range and then decrease as the frequency increases generally speaking shallower water induces larger hydrodynamic coefficients low frequency makes enormous contributions to the hydrodynamic coefficients in both deep and shallow waters especially for the added mass see fig 5 a c the reason is that the radiation wave length does not change dramatically at high wave frequency according to the dispersion relation however the shallow water effect is much more significant in relative low frequency ranges this is because the radiation waves are limited by the sea bottom for such low frequency thus more energy is needed to accelerate the fluid movement around the ship in the low frequency range in shallow water 4 3 motions in regular waves fig 6 shows the time histories of heave and pitch motions under four water depths at ω 0 l g 3 0 f r 0 139 similar to the time histories of wave exciting force in fig 3 the curves in fig 6 also show good smoothness and stability note that the wave induced motions show different encounter wave periods even for the same incident wave frequency the reason is that the orbit of a fluid particle in waves is strongly dependent on water depth hence in shallow water the flow is obstructed by the keel clearance which is different from that in deep water the upper plots in fig 7 a b present the comparison between the numerical and experimental time histories of heave and pitch motions at λ l 0 55 ω 0 l g 2 89 and 100 ukc as can be seen from fig 7 during the experimental process the acceleration and transition zones exist before the ship reaches a stable state between two dotted lines after that the intended regular wave pattern is disturbed because of reflections by the beach and the wave maker see the detailed description in van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 in addition due to the significant squat behaviour in shallow water the mean values of experimental heave and pitch motion time samples red line are not zero anymore which are different from the values calculated by the linear potential flow method blue line however when the mean values of the experimental time histories in steady state between two dotted lines are set to zero see the lower plots in fig 7 a b though some deviations of phase angle exist a good agreement can be found by comparing with the numerical results fig 8 depicts the present numerical results of heave and pitch motion raos at different water depths in comparison with the experimental data where the numerical amplitudes of motion responses are obtained from the time series of corresponding wave frequency by fourier series expansion here the test data and cfd results for deep water are taken from lyu and el moctar 2017 as can be seen in fig 8 generally the numerical results are in fair agreement with experimental data and cfd results however some deviations can also be observed especially for heave motion even for deep water case similar discrepancies were reported in lyu and el moctar 2017 one reason as explained in lyu and el moctar 2017 might be that the pitch resonance has an influence on heave motion another reason might be the linear potential flow method used in this study which does not consider the transient wetted hull surface or ship squat therefore it is likely that the linear potential flow theory based rankine panel method should be extended to a nonlinear one when the forward speed problem in shallow water is studied fig 9 shows the wave contours around dtc container ship at different water depths in regular waves at normalized wave frequency ω 0 l g 1 98 it can be seen that the smaller the water depth the shorter the wavelength at the same wave frequency 4 4 added resistance fig 10 presents the time series of the first order and second order surge forces at three water depths i e infinite water depth 100 ukc and 20 ukc from the figures it can be observed that the oscillation period of the second order surge force is almost twice as large as the first order surge force in addition the speed at which the second order force converges is lower than that for the first order force which implies that a longer simulation time is needed fig 11 shows the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results of added resistance obtained at infinite and 100 ukc water depths as can be seen from the figures the normalized added resistance values in infinite water show fair agreement with the experimental results by sprenger et al 2017 but the values are overestimated in the small wavelength ranges though some deviations exist between the numerical and experimental results the order of deviation magnitudes for 100 ukc is acceptable in general the peak values of numerical added resistance rao shift towards smaller wavelengths with the decrease of water depth in addition although the numerical values for 100 ukc fig 11 and 20 ukc fig 12 present a similar trend as that in infinite water it is not possible to find a consistent trend compared with experiment results especially for the case of 20 ukc the reasons can be explained as follows on one hand as described in sprenger et al 2017 the 20 ukc in the test is no more a static condition because the squat effects lead to dynamic ukc of merely 0 9 in the presence of waves moreover an issue worth noting is that in the test the incident wave amplitudes are very small in order to avoid the bottom contact problem because of very small ukc which could have introduced inaccuracies in the measurements a detailed explanation can be found in sprenger et al 2017 on the other hand other sources of discrepancies can be associated to the numerical analysis based on the linear potential flow method which does not account for the squat effects and viscous effects in shallow water thus the numerical accuracy is also questionable therefore the effects of water depth on added resistance in waves need to be further investigated both numerically and experimentally nevertheless to an extent the results can still be used for a qualitative analysis at the initial stages of design 5 conclusions in the present study the wave body interaction problems in finite water depth are investigated for the dtc container ship by using a time domain rankine panel method and the hydrodynamic forces motion response and added resistance are numerically predicted the developed numerical scheme and program are validated by comparing the numerical results with the corresponding model test data from this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 generally in shallow water larger hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained lower frequency radiation waves induce larger added mass in both deep and shallow waters and the results will converge to those in the deep water case with the increase of wave frequency 2 the smaller the water depth the larger the peak value of the wave induced force and moment is peak values of excitation rao shift toward to lower frequencies with the decrease of water depth similar results can also be found for the peak values of heave and pitch motion responses from the comparison of numerical results with model test data for motion responses at different water depths it can be concluded that the present linear approach is applicable for the prediction of wave body interaction problems related to motion dynamics in shallow water 3 as for the added resistance the peak values of added resistance rao shift toward to smaller wavelengths with the decrease of water depth though the numerical results in deep water agree well with model test data it is not possible to find a consistent trend for cases of finite water depths especially for the extreme test condition 20 ukc in order to estimate the second order force in shallow water accurately it is necessary to extend the present potential flow method to consider the

near shore or in coastal areas it is desired to have a better insight into the effects of shallow water the influence of shallow water leads to a more complex hydrodynamic situation compared to open sea in addition these areas are often subjected to wave conditions under the presence of waves in shallow water areas not only the safety related issues of the manoeuvring ships should arouse concern but also the seakeeping behaviour such as wave induced motions and added resistance needs to be taken into account to avoid grounding and to quantify speed reduction hence it is essential to investigate the wave induced motions and second order wave forces in finite water depth for this reason many researchers have developed numerical methods to solve the wave body interaction problems in finite water depth in an early stage the 2d strip theory was used for its practicability and high efficiency in the initial design kim 1968 hwang and lee 1975 takaki 1977 tasai et al 1978 andersen 1979 kim 1999 perunovic and jensen 2003 vantorre and journée 2003 kim and kim 2012 the mentioned method however is only suitable for relatively high frequencies and a slender ship hull because of this limitation researchers turned their attention to the matched asymptotic expansion method maem where the solutions of the far field is matched with the solution of the near field on the interface boundary by using different numerical techniques on the divided field zones tuck 1970 vorobyov and stasenko 2010 the main problem with this method is that because of the long wave assumption large deviations occur when the wave length is close to the ship length more advanced techniques are available nowadays to address this problem in shallow water such as 3d panel methods based on green function or rankine source the free surface green function panel method has been initially applied by researchers oortmerssen 1976 chan 1990 li 2001 though the accuracy seems to be better than the 2d theory or maem the form and evaluation of green function is relatively complex and difficult furthermore the neumann kelvin linearization of the method cannot consider the interaction between the steady and unsteady flows while it can be accounted for by using double body linearization method in comparison the rankine source based 3d panel method has been widely used for its flexible treatment of the free surface as well as the simpler kernel form moreover the rankine source method can more easily be extended to include nonlinear factors when addressing the ship motion in waves such as nonlinear free surface conditions and dynamic squat nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces see the works of riesner et al 2016 riesner and el moctar 2018 among others gao et al 2008 yao et al 2017 applied the frequency domain rankine panel method for ship hydrodynamic analysis in shallow water conditions in their frequency domain method transient dynamic effects such as the coupling effect with the nonlinear external force cannot be considered kim and kim 2012 the time domain rankine panel method was applied for the wave induced motion problems in shallow water by kim and kim 2012 kim and kim 2013 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2016 but their studies only focused on the zero forward speed cases another point of attentions is the added wave resistance when a ship navigates in a seaway this added resistance will lead to power loss and speed reduction moreover the arising greenhouse gas emissions are now constrained by the international maritime organization imo and the directives have already been established by the marine environment protection committee mepc from the perspective of an energy efficiency design index eedi recent research projects such as energy efficient safe ship operation shopera sprenger et al 2017 have been carried out to examine the safety and performance of ships in adverse weather conditions söding et al 2014 calculated the added resistance by a frequency domain rankine panel method which accounts for nonlinear steady flow the added wave resistance has also been studied using potential flow theory by many researchers such as seo et al 2014 lyu and el moctar 2017 kim et al 2017 zhang and el moctar 2019 park et al 2019 in order to fully investigate the viscous effects braking waves etc on added resistance in waves computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are also widely applied see for instance riesner and el moctar 2018 sigmund and el moctar 2018 however the mentioned studies on the added resistance in waves are mostly analysed in deep water cases and investigations in view of shallow water cases are scarce in the present study a time domain higher order rankine panel method is developed to investigate the motion responses and added resistance of a ship moving in shallow water of various water depths in regular waves the sea bottom is assumed to be flat and the image method is used to satisfy the bottom boundary condition a good agreement is achieved when comparing the numerical results with the data of model tests which were executed in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics

x y z fixed to a ship moving with the forward speed u 0 in the earth fixed coordinate system o x y z is introduced as shown in fig 1 the frame 0 x y z is on the mean water surface with its origin amidships the x axis positive to the bow the y axis positive to the port side and the z axis pointing upwards the total velocity potential ψ x t can be written as 1 ψ x y z t φ s x y z ϕ i x y z t ϕ d x y z t where φ s x y z ϕ i x y z t and ϕ d x y z t are the steady velocity potential the incident velocity potential and the unsteady disturbance velocity potential respectively the unsteady wave elevation ζ x y t can be written as 2 ζ x y t ζ i x y t ζ d x y t where ζ i x y t and ζ d x y t denote the incident wave elevation and the unsteady disturbance wave elevation respectively the velocity

φ s the mj terms represent the interaction between the steady and unsteady flows since the second order derivatives of basic velocity potential can be considered as solutions of the dirichlet type problem when putting the first order derivatives of φ s as the right hand side terms the m j terms can be evaluated directly the detailed evaluation of the m j terms can be found in the authors previous work mei et al 2019 the sea bottom condition on z h is given as 16 ϕ d n 0 the initial condition at t 0 17 ϕ d 0 ϕ d t 0 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and motion equations using the method proposed by kring 1994 the unsteady disturbance velocity potential ϕ d x y z t can be further subdivided as the sum of a local flow potential ϕ l x y z t and a memory potential ϕ m x y z t 18 ϕ d x y z t ϕ l x y z t ϕ m x y z t then the diffraction potential is attributed to the memory potential which accounts for the effect on ship motion and wave elevation of the flow field at next moment while the radiation potential is attributed to the local potential and the memory potential the reason of taking out the local flow from the unsteady disturbance velocity potential is because of the instability of the numerical solution the local potential can be further decomposed as 19 ϕ l x t j 1 6 n j x ξ j t m j x ξ j t where n j x and m j x satisfy the following boundary conditions 20 n j x 0 m j x 0 j

d g should be added in the kinematic free surface condition to satisfy the radiation condition where υ is the newtonian cooling strength and is determined by 22 υ x 3 c s x x 0 2 x r x 0 3 0 x x 0 x r

the free surface damping region respectively once the unsteady velocity potentials ϕ l and ϕ m are obtained the wave exciting forces f i and radiation force f i j can be determined by integrating the pressure which is evaluated from bernoulli s equation along the mean wetted hull surface s b 23 f i s b ρ t u φ s ϕ i ϕ m n i d s 24 f i j s b ρ t u φ s ϕ d n i d s for a harmonically oscillating ship the radiation force f i j can be expressed as 25 f i j a i j ω e ξ j t b i j ω e ξ j t ω e 2 a i j ω e i ω e b i j ω e ξ j e i ω e t where ω e and ξ j are the encounter frequency and the amplitude of

newton s second law 27 m i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i ξ j ξ j t i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j represent the mass matrix and restoring coefficient matrix respectively the hydrodynamic forces f i ξ j ξ j t include wave exciting force and radiation force in this study the second order force is evaluated by applying the pressure integration method also known as near field method proposed by joncquez 2009

confined water cooperation fhr and ugent eight captive model tests and two tests in free running mode are selected the details of the experimental setup can be found in van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 here only the selected benchmark test conditions are listed in table 1 and table 2 for the experimental setup of the dtc container ship in deep water tests in regular waves have been conducted by marintek now sintef ocean el moctar et al 2015 the presented model test results for deep water in this paper are from lyu and el moctar 2017 here the selected test conditions are given in table 3 where h w is the wave height and t is the wave period 4 results and discussions the main particulars of the dtc container ship are listed in table 4 due to the symmetry of the flow field only half of the computational domain is considered fig 2 shows the adopted discretized panels on the boundaries after convergence analysis where the truncated free surface of the computational domain is 1 5l upstream 2l downstream and 0 8l half width the total number of discretized panels is 4950 with 1200 on half ship hull and 3750 on half free surface 4 1 wave exciting forces fig 3 shows the time histories of wave exciting force and moment at four water depths i e infinite water depth 100 ukc 50 ukc and 20 ukc as can be seen all of the curves are smooth which demonstrates the good numerical stability of the present program it is worth noting that even for the same wave frequency of the incident wave ω 0 l g 3 0 the time history curves at four water depths show different encounter wave frequencies due to the dispersion relation in finite water depth the non dimensional wave exciting heave force and pitch moment with respect to frequency at different water depths are plotted in fig 4 the amplitudes of the results are obtained by using fourier series expansion from the time history results corresponding to the same frequency from fig 4 it can be observed that the obvious difference mainly occurs at low frequencies for four water depths whereas the values at high frequencies do not show obvious differences except for phase shift persistence in low frequency range the most distinct feature is that the peak values of wave exciting force and moment rao move towards lower frequencies with decreasing water depth the same conclusion was also found in kim and kim 2012 for the zero forward speed case by rankine panel method and in perunovic and jensen 2003 for the nonzero forward speed case by strip method the reason is that the peak value is closely related to the ratio of wave length to the projected length of the ship on the direction of incident wave i e λ l cos β 4 2 hydrodynamic coefficients fig 5 presents the added masses and damping coefficients due to wave induced heave and pitch motions at different water depths from fig 5 a c it can be observed that the added masses decline sharply in low frequencies while almost tend to flat with the increase of the frequency as for the damping coefficients in fig 5 b d they first increase in relative low frequency range and then decrease as the frequency increases generally speaking shallower water induces larger hydrodynamic coefficients low frequency makes enormous contributions to the hydrodynamic coefficients in both deep and shallow waters especially for the added mass see fig 5 a c the reason is that the radiation wave length does not change dramatically at high wave frequency according to the dispersion relation however the shallow water effect is much more significant in relative low frequency ranges this is because the radiation waves are limited by the sea bottom for such low frequency thus more energy is needed to accelerate the fluid movement around the ship in the low frequency range in shallow water 4 3 motions in regular waves fig 6 shows the time histories of heave and pitch motions under four water depths at ω 0 l g 3 0 f r 0 139 similar to the time histories of wave exciting force in fig 3 the curves in fig 6 also show good smoothness and stability note that the wave induced motions show different encounter wave periods even for the same incident wave frequency the reason is that the orbit of a fluid particle in waves is strongly dependent on water depth hence in shallow water the flow is obstructed by the keel clearance which is different from that in deep water the upper plots in fig 7 a b present the comparison between the numerical and experimental time histories of heave and pitch motions at λ l 0 55 ω 0 l g 2 89 and 100 ukc as can be seen from fig 7 during the experimental process the acceleration and transition zones exist before the ship reaches a stable state between two dotted lines after that the intended regular wave pattern is disturbed because of reflections by the beach and the wave maker see the detailed description in van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 in addition due to the significant squat behaviour in shallow water the mean values of experimental heave and pitch motion time samples red line are not zero anymore which are different from the values calculated by the linear potential flow method blue line however when the mean values of the experimental time histories in steady state between two dotted lines are set to zero see the lower plots in fig 7 a b though some deviations of phase angle exist a good agreement can be found by comparing with the numerical results fig 8 depicts the present numerical results of heave and pitch motion raos at different water depths in comparison with the experimental data where the numerical amplitudes of motion responses are obtained from the time series of corresponding wave frequency by fourier series expansion here the test data and cfd results for deep water are taken from lyu and el moctar 2017 as can be seen in fig 8 generally the numerical results are in fair agreement with experimental data and cfd results however some deviations can also be observed especially for heave motion even for deep water case similar discrepancies were reported in lyu and el moctar 2017 one reason as explained in lyu and el moctar 2017 might be that the pitch resonance has an influence on heave motion another reason might be the linear potential flow method used in this study which does not consider the transient wetted hull surface or ship squat therefore it is likely that the linear potential flow theory based rankine panel method should be extended to a nonlinear one when the forward speed problem in shallow water is studied fig 9 shows the wave contours around dtc container ship at different water depths in regular waves at normalized wave frequency ω 0 l g 1 98 it can be seen that the smaller the water depth the shorter the wavelength at the same wave frequency 4 4 added resistance fig 10 presents the time series of the first order and second order surge forces at three water depths i e infinite water depth 100 ukc and 20 ukc from the figures it can be observed that the oscillation period of the second order surge force is almost twice as large as the first order surge force in addition the speed at which the second order force converges is lower than that for the first order force which implies that a longer simulation time is needed fig 11 shows the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results of added resistance obtained at infinite and 100 ukc water depths as can be seen from the figures the normalized added resistance values in infinite water show fair agreement with the experimental results by sprenger et al 2017 but the values are overestimated in the small wavelength ranges though some deviations exist between the numerical and experimental results the order of deviation magnitudes for 100 ukc is acceptable in general the peak values of numerical added resistance rao shift towards smaller wavelengths with the decrease of water depth in addition although the numerical values for 100 ukc fig 11 and 20 ukc fig 12 present a similar trend as that in infinite water it is not possible to find a consistent trend compared with experiment results especially for the case of 20 ukc the reasons can be explained as follows on one hand as described in sprenger et al 2017 the 20 ukc in the test is no more a static condition because the squat effects lead to dynamic ukc of merely 0 9 in the presence of waves moreover an issue worth noting is that in the test the incident wave amplitudes are very small in order to avoid the bottom contact problem because of very small ukc which could have introduced inaccuracies in the measurements a detailed explanation can be found in sprenger et al 2017 on the other hand other sources of discrepancies can be associated to the numerical analysis based on the linear potential flow method which does not account for the squat effects and viscous effects in shallow water thus the numerical accuracy is also questionable therefore the effects of water depth on added resistance in waves need to be further investigated both numerically and experimentally nevertheless to an extent the results can still be used for a qualitative analysis at the initial stages of design 5 conclusions in the present study the wave body interaction problems in finite water depth are investigated for the dtc container ship by using a time domain rankine panel method and the hydrodynamic forces motion response and added resistance are numerically predicted the developed numerical scheme and program are validated by comparing the numerical results with the corresponding model test data from this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 generally in shallow water larger hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained lower frequency radiation waves induce larger added mass in both deep and shallow waters and the results will converge to those in the deep water case with the increase of wave frequency 2 the smaller the water depth the larger the peak value of the wave induced force and moment is peak values of excitation rao shift toward to lower frequencies with the decrease of water depth similar results can also be found for the peak values of heave and pitch motion responses from the comparison of numerical results with model test data for motion responses at different water depths it can be concluded that the present linear approach is applicable for the prediction of wave body interaction problems related to motion dynamics in shallow water 3 as for the added resistance the peak values of added resistance rao shift toward to smaller wavelengths with the decrease of water depth though the numerical results in deep water agree well with model test data it is not possible to find a consistent trend for cases of finite water depths especially for the extreme test condition 20 ukc in order to estimate the second order force in shallow water accurately it is necessary to extend the present potential flow method to consider the
