17650,with the development of analytical technology more emerging disinfection by products dbps have been identified and detected among them aromatic dbps especially heterocyclic dbps possess relatively high toxicity compared with regulated dbps which has been proved by bioassays thus the occurrence of aromatic dbps is of great concern this article provides a comprehensive review and summary of the characteristics occurrence transformation pathways and control of aromatic dbps aromatic dbps are frequently detected in drinking water wastewater and swimming pool water among which swimming pool water illustrates highest concentration considering the relatively high concentration and toxicity halophenylacetonitriles hpans and halonitrophenols hnps are more likely to be toxicity driver among frequently detected phenyl dbps aromatic dbps can be viewed as important intermediate products of dissolved organic matter dom during chlor am ination high molecular weight dom could convert to aromatic dbps via direct or indirect pathways and they can further decompose into regulated aliphatic dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by ring opening and side chain cleavage even though no single dbps control strategy is efficient to all aromatic dbps the decrease of overall toxicity may be achieved by several methods including absorption solar radiation and boiling by systematically considering aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps a better trade off can be made to reduce health risk induced by dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords aromatic disinfection by products analytical methods transformation pathways control strategies toxicity evaluation 1 introduction using chlorine as disinfectant in drinking water treatment to inactivate pathogen has greatly reduced water borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever pichel et al 2019 however the reactions between disinfectants and dissolved organic matter dom in source water may produce disinfection by products dbps some of which illustrate high mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in animals the first identified dbps in disinfected water are trihalomethanes thms bellar et al 1974 since then several hundreds of dbps such as haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams haloacetaldehydes hals have been discovered mian et al 2018 several epidemiological studies have found that long term consumption of chlorinated water may increase the risk of urinary bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 considering the health risk posed by dbps many countries and organizations have established regulations and guidelines for dbps in drinking water mainly including thms and haas known as regulated dbps usepa 2006 who 2006 even though regulated thms haas occur at a high level in drinking water they are not toxicity forcing agents in drinking water kimura et al 2019 although some identified dbps such as hans hams hals may contribute more to overall toxicity epidemiological studies have revealed that commonly known dbps cannot fully account for the adverse health effects caused by consuming chlorinated drinking water diana et al 2019 identified dbps consist less than 40 of total organic halogen tox and the tox formed from alternative disinfectants even contains more unknown dbps richardson 2002 yang and zhang 2016 thus increasing efforts have been made to identify and control emerging dbps such as halobenzoquinones iodinated dbps and aromatic dbps li et al 2016b li and mitch 2018 aromatic dbps refer to dbps with planar cyclic structures that follow hückel s rule generally aromatic dbps such as halogenated phenols and halogenated furanones contain phenyl or heterocycle structures those aromatic structures may provide aromatic dbps with some special characteristics such as high reactivity to electrophilic substitution or increased stability the history of aromatic dbps identification has been shown in fig 1 the first subgroup of aromatic dbps identified in drinking water is halofuranones at concentrations of 10 150 μg l smeds et al 1997 it was not was not until the application of precursor ion scan pis that large groups of aromatic dbps including halohydroxybenzaldehydes hbads halophenols hps halohydroxybenzoic acids hbacs halonitrophenols hnps halobenzenesulfonic acids and halopyrroles were discovered ding and zhang 2009 hitherto nearly 100 aromatic dbps have been discovered in drinking water swimming pool water or wastewater effluent by pis yang et al 2019c other emerging aromatic dbps including halo phenylacetonitrile halopeptides and halopyridines were confirmed successively in recent years aromatic dbps gain prominence for several reasons firstly many aromatic dbps present higher toxicity than commonly known aliphatic dbps although aromatic dbps occur at much lower concentration than aliphatic dbps their contribution to overall toxicity cannot be neglected the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of halofuranones have been widely proved cortés and marcos 2018 and smeds et al 1997 founded that halofuranones may account for 20 60 of the total of treated drinking water the occurrences of aromatic dbps not only pose risk to human health but also lead to adverse implications for marine ecology yang and zhang 2013 secondly human may be exposed to aromatic dbps during daily activities including drinking water swimming and eating the concentration of aromatic dbps in drinking water could be ng l level and cooking with iodized table salt may result in increased iodinated aromatic dbps in food pan et al 2016c in addition aromatic dbps including 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 bromophenol could permeate through skin during swimming and the amounts of aromatic dbps that permeate through skin increase with increasing exposure time xiao et al 2012 thirdly aromatic dbps tend to be precursor sources of aliphatic dbps or other toxic dbps the hydroquinone is easily oxidized to benzoquinone by disinfectants meanwhile haloquinones an important group of carcinogens may be produced by aromatic substitution bull et al 2011 further decomposition of aromatic dbps will produce aliphatic dbps with lower molecular weight mw hu et al 2019 understanding the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps can further reveal the mechanism of aliphatic dbps formation which can facilitate the development of dbps control strategies what s more some aromatic dbps may cause unpleasant taste or odor in drinking water aldehydes and chloroaldimine formed during chlorination of amino acids or peptides may be partially responsible for the unpleasant odors in drinking water ma et al 2016 the odor thresholds of n chlorophenylacetaldimine and phenylacetaldehyde are only 4 and 3 μg l respectively how et al 2018 moreover some hps possess extremely low odor threshold concentrations in the level of ng l acero et al 2005 hence understanding and controlling the occurrence of aromatic dbps have attracted lots of attention this review aims to 1 provide an overview of the characteristics and analytical methods of aromatic dbps and highlight the occurrence of aromatic dbps 2 systematically describe the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps 3 summarize the control strategies of aromatic dbps and 4 discuss topics for future research on aromatic dbps 2 characteristics of aromatic dbps 2 1 classification and stability of aromatic dbps aromatic dbps include two main types phenyl dbps and heterocyclic dbps the phenyl dbps can be further divided into phenyl nitrogenous dbps n dbps and carbonaceous dbps c dbps according to their structures phenyl n dbps contain functional groups with n atoms such as no2 nh2 cn while phenyl c dbps do not contain n atoms heterocyclic dbps also contain planar cyclic structure such as pyrrole and pyridine nihemaiti et al 2017 only a few aromatic dbps such as chlorophenazines simultaneously contain benzene and heterocyclic structure bull et al 2011 however not all dbps with cyclic structures possess aromaticity e g halobenzoquinones and trihalo hydroxy cyclopentene diones those cyclic dbps without aromaticity may be products of reaction between aromatic dbps and disinfectants which will be discussed in following section as shown in fig 2 the currently identified phenyl c dbps and n dbps mainly contain six subgroups i e halodipeptides halophenylacetonitriles hpans hbads hps hbacs hnps other kinds of phenyl dbps with alkyl chain or sulfonate are also identified and displayed in table s1 most heterocyclic dbps detected in drinking water or wastewater samples are halofuranones halopyrroles and their derivatives generally heterocyclic dbps are not stable halogenated furanones are easily hydrolyzed under alkaline condition nihemaiti et al 2017 and halopyrroles are also readily to decompose with excess chlorine yang and zhang 2014 researches on the stability of phenyl dbps are limited the stability of phenyl dbps differs from one another which is related to the electronegativity of the functional groups and halogen atoms hu et al 2018b 2019 bib hu et al 2019 bib hu et al 2018b huang et al 2017 phenyl dbps with electron withdrawing functional groups such as no2 and cn are more stable hu et al 2018b therefore phenylacetonitril and two chlorophenylacetonitriles are relatively stable in presence of chlorine while 100 μg l 2 4 6 triiodophenol becomes undetectable in 20 h with 30 mg l chloramine hu et al 2018b additionally brominated phenyl dbps i e 2 4 6 tribromophenol are readily transformed to phenyl aromatic dbps with chlorine zhai and zhang 2011 it s strongly suggested that the stability of those aromatic dbps should be evaluated most aromatic dbps are detected in finished water of drinking water treatment plants dwtps or chlorinated simulated drinking water however there are residual disinfectants in network which may result in formation or decomposition of aromatic dbps thus measuring aromatic dbps in water with different disinfection time or evaluating their stability is recommended besides the stability of aromatic dbps with different disinfectants may be various chloramine with poor oxidative capacity could result in aromatic dbps accumulation while chlorination could degrade aromatic dbps into small aliphatic dbps zhai et al 2014 2 2 toxicity of aromatic dbps exposure to dbps may cause side health effects which include colorectal bladder cancer and adverse birth outcomes diana et al 2019 currently the most commonly used and reliable methods to evaluate the toxicity of dbps are in vivo and in vitro bioassays epidemiological studies and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar methods may also be of great help to assess the toxicity of dbps current toxicity studies on aromatic dbps mainly focus on phenyl dbps as the concentration of most heterocyclic dbps in drinking water are not commonly researched several researches have been made on the developmental toxicity cytotoxicity and endocrine disruption effect of phenyl dbps by using different bioassay species which have been illustrated in tables s2 and s3 chinese hamster ovary cho cells are the most commonly utilized organism to evaluate the cytotoxicity of dbps including aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps liberatore et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2018 2020 bib zhang et al 2018 bib zhang et al 2020 the human hepatoma cells hepg2 is also applied in in vitro bioassays when evaluating the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps hu et al 2018b other bioassay species including the freshwater bacterium vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 the marine alga tetraselmis marina the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii and chinese rare minnow gobiocypris rarus are generally employed to evaluate the toxicity of phenyl dbps in terms of luminescence inhibition growth inhibition developmental toxicity and disrupting effects respectively in in vivo bioassay chen et al 2019 liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016c yang and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2008 aside from in vivo and in vitro bioassays evaluating the endocrine disrupting effects of phenyl dbps can also be achieved by in silico bioassays as human transthyretin httr is an important thyroid hormones ths carrier httr is selected as model serum proteins to assess the endocrine disrupting effects of 17 phenyl dbps yang et al 2019d besides holmes et al 2017 chose chimp androgen receptor to estimate the endocrine disrupting effect of 21 dbps in in silico bioassay which showed that the endocrine disrupting effect of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was one magnitude lower than 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone and the 4 chlorophenyl exhibited little endocrine disrupting effect as cho and p dumerilii are the most commonly used organism in in vivo and in vitro toxicity bioassay respectively the toxicity of the aromatic dbps and typical aliphatic dbps to cho and p dumerilii is illustrated in fig 3 even though the toxicity mechanism of phenyl dbps in various bioassay species may be different the results of bioassays have some similarities firstly phenyl n dbps are generally more toxic than phenyl c dbps and the toxicity of phenyl dbps follows the order of hnps hpans hps hbads hbacs according to the in vitro cytotoxicity and the in vivo developmental toxicity bioassays zhang et al 2018 2020 bib zhang et al 2018 bib zhang et al 2020 interestingly phenyl dbps possessing higher cytotoxicity also illustrate higher binding potency towards antioxidant enzymes especially for catalase phenyl dbps with different functional groups have various electrostatic potential which makes them bind to different sites on antioxidant enzymes with different binding energy thus phenyl dbps with various functional groups illustrate different toxic potency zhang et al 2020 besides the higher hydrophilicity may be responsible for the lower toxicity of phenyl c dbps compared to phenyl n dbps as they are less likely to permeate into cell or bind with protein yang et al 2019d however the results of alga and v qinghaiensis sp q67 bioassays are slightly different from others the growth inhibition effects of some hbads and hps are higher than hnps for alga this may be explained by the higher metabolism rates for hnps than hps in alga cells liu and zhang 2014 some hps also show higher toxicity in v qinghaiensis sp q67 than some hnps the mechanism of which needs further exploration chen et al 2019 secondly brominated phenyl dbps present higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogs and both of them possess lower toxicity than their iodinated analogs this is a common phenomenon that also has been discovered in other aliphatic dbps e g haas thms hams hans wagner and plewa 2017 the different toxicity of phenyl dbps with different halogen atoms can be partly explained by binding reaction between phenyl dbps and antioxidant enzymes halogen atoms may affect the electrostatic potential distributions of phenyl dbps and most brominated analogs show higher binding potency than chlorinated analogs zhang et al 2020 furthermore the higher lipophilicity of iodinated phenyl dbps may be another important reason yang and zhang 2013 the higher toxicity of iodinated haas is attributed to their higher inhibition rate on glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh activity in cho cells which would suppress atp formation pals et al 2011 besides echigo et al 2004 also demonstrated that total organic bromine was three times more active to induce chromosomal aberration than total organic chlorine in chlorinated water whether those toxicity mechanisms can be used to explain the higher toxicity of iodinated phenyl dbps requires further bioassays the substitution positions and amount of halogen atoms may also affect the toxicity of phenyl dbps mostly phenyl dbps with more halogen atoms possess higher endocrine activity and toxicity in cho alga and v qinghaiensis sp q67 while the trend appears to reverse in p dumerilii chen et al 2019 holmes et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019d zhang et al 2018 as for whether phenyl dbps are more toxic than aliphatic dbps bioassays show different results cho bioassays results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps was comparable to aliphatic dbps and some aliphatic dbps such hals and hams were even more toxic wagner and plewa 2017 besides some aliphatic dbps show higher endocrine activity than aromatic dbps holmes et al 2017 however in vivo bioassays applying aquatic organisms such as t marina and embryos of p dumerilii illustrate that phenyl dbps were more toxic liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 interestingly li s group also reported that halobenzoquinones could induce significantly higher developmental toxicity than haas in zebrafish embryos while such a trend was not consistent with the trend observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity bioassay wagner and plewa 2017 wang et al 2018 as various toxicity metrics can be classified into the two major groups in vitro and in vivo bioassays different toxicity mechanisms responsible for the observed toxicity results from in vitro and in vivo bioassays warrant further investigations disinfected water usually contains several hundreds of dbps studies on toxicological interactions between phenyl dbps such as antagonism and synergism are necessary chen et al 2019 observed that 61 41 and 31 of experimental ec50 ec20 ec10 the 50 20 and 10 effective concentrations of phenyl dbps mixtures were lower than prediction indicating that there were synergistic effects of coexistence on the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps this further highlights the health risks posed by aromatic dbps considering the relatively high level of aliphatic dbps in disinfected water testing the effects of the coexistence of aliphatic dbps and aromatic dbps is also recommended generally heterocyclic dbps show higher toxicity than phenyl dbps and aliphatic dbps the developmental toxicity of tetrabromopyrrole is 6 460 and 8805 higher than 2 5 dibromohydroquinone bromoform and bromoacetic acid respectively yang and zhang 2014 the toxicity of halofuranones has been widely proved as halofuranones are the first group of aromatic dbps identified the genotoxicity and mutation effect of halofuranones have been evaluated by both in vivo and in vitro bioassays which employed various bioassays species including rat liver epithelial cells ck6 hepg2 cells and wistar rats wang et al 2013 in vivo studies show that nitrosamines and 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone mx were the most potent carcinogenic dbps based on their td50 the dose of chemical that would produce cancer in 50 of the population studied in a lifetime among 409 analyzed dbps including haas thms hans diana et al 2019 the td50 of mx is one or two magnitude lower than haas and thms however lower dna damaging potency and cytotoxicity of mx compared to some aliphatic dbps was observed in in vitro bioassays plewa et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 with the development of analytical methods more heterocyclic dbps may be identified and evaluating the toxicity of heterocyclic dbps seems to be necessary considering the financial and technical cost it s impracticable to comprehensively evaluate and compare the toxicity of all series of aromatic dbps with different halogenation types and functional groups the toxicity of aromatic dbps demonstrates a strong relationship with their structures thus qsar methods recently have been used to facilitate interpretation of toxicity mechanisms and predict potential toxicological effect of dbps including developmental toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity chen et al 2015 the qsar methods require descriptors to predict the toxicity which generally include physical chemical descriptors and chemical structure descriptors descriptor filtration by either empirical judgment or computational analysis is needed to select appropriate and reasonable descriptors from candidates and reduce the complexity of qsar modeling chen et al 2015 the results of descriptor filtration could also reveal the toxicity mechanism that is of great importance based on the observed toxicity data and the values of candidate descriptors the equations derived from regression analysis and the optimized descriptors in previous researches are shown in table 1 considering the toxicity potencies of chemical compounds are related to the molecular structure several descriptors that strongly reflect chemical structure such as length to breadth ratio weighted by whim weighted holistic invariant molecular energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo are chosen as important descriptors chen et al 2019 yang and zhang 2013 those chemical structure descriptors can be divided into quantum chemical descriptors electronic descriptors and topological descriptors several physicochemical properties are also important descriptors as is mentioned above hydrophobic aromatic dbps possess higher toxicity because they can penetrate biological membranes and reach organs and tissues in the body more easily which may further results in membrane or mitochondrial dysfunction yang and zhang 2013 besides the hydrophobicity of aromatic dbps also affects the interaction between protein and aromatic dbps thus some researches chose physicochemical properties including dissociation constant pka octanol water distribution coefficient as descriptors yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019d the cytotoxicity and development toxicity of dbps may depend on their ability to induce oxidative stress li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 as the antioxidant defense system could change in response to the induced oxidative stress the binding affinity between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes are also chosen as an important descriptors zhang et al 2020 interestingly when developing the qsar model ecat binding energies of aromatic dbps with catalase ehomo elumo were chosen as most appropriate descriptors among the 18 candidates by elimination selection stepwise regression es swr this result highlights binding between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes in toxicity mechanism in cho cells zhang et al 2020 besides the statistically analysis of qsar module also demonstrates that the main toxicity mechanism of phenyl dbps in alga should be polar narcosis of cell membrane which was well described by log kow pka and molar topological index mti liu and zhang 2014 in general the toxicity effect of aromatic dbps is a complex process which may involve penetrating into cell membrane or mitochondrial dysfunction inhibiting atp formation inducing oxidative stress alter the expression of gene or directly combining with dna the carcinogenesis processes are even more complicated dad et al 2018 li et al 2015 2018 bib li et al 2018 bib li et al 2015 nowadays the studies on the toxicity of aromatic dbps mainly focus on the toxicity evaluation and prediction however few researches have been made on the toxicity mechanism of aromatic dbps especially for heterocyclic dbps several researches have revealed that in response to increased intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by halobenzoquinones thms and haas several cell signaling pathways including nuclear factor erythroidderived2 like 2 nrf2 are involved to control oxidative stress through modulation of stress response genes chaves et al 2019 li et al 2018 even though there isn t bioassay on the cell signaling pathways in response to aromatic dbps exposure the strong relationships between cytotoxicity and ecat of aromatic dbps suggest the potential important role of signaling mechanisms when cells are exposed to aromatic dbps zhang et al 2020 besides previous research shows that aromatic dbps could readily bind with human serum albumin and httr which could lead to dysfunction of those proteins yang et al 2019d zhang et al 2019b the binding interactions between aromatic dbps and functional proteins may also be important part of toxicity action mode of aromatic dbps the toxicity mechanisms of different dbps in different species are different and a further understanding of toxicity mechanism will be of great help to the development of qsar model and vice versa besides studies focus on the carcinogenicity and other adverse effect of aromatic dbps are rare and only halofuranones have been proved as carcinogens so far 76 compounds have been proved to be bladder carcinogens and 75 of them possess cycles structures with 82 of them being aromatic cycles e g 4 amino 2 nitrophenol p chloro o toluidine diana et al 2019 considering their structural similarity with aromatic dbps the contribution of aromatic dbps to the risk of cancer could not be neglected besides n halamines are potent carcinogen due to their ability to form radical species in vivo which emphasizes the health risk posed by aromatics dbps with n halamines such as halopeptides bull et al 2011 the carcinogenicity of aromatic dbps should be evaluated thoroughly and more epidemiological studies should be done on the connection between aromatic dbps and cancer especially for those with high cytotoxicity 3 analysis and occurrence of aromatic dbps 3 1 identification and quantification of aromatic dbps as most aromatic dbps are newly found dbps most efforts focus on analytical methods of aromatic dbps several reviews have been made on the identification and quantification of emerging dbps including n halogenated peptides and halogenated polar dbps jiang et al 2019 yang and zhang 2016 yang et al 2019c zhang et al 2020 therefore commonly used analytical methods for identifying and quantifying aromatic dbps are only simply summarized here identifying aromatic dbps that exist in water is the foundation of aromatic dbps research as water extracts are usually complex mixtures separation is the first step of identifying aromatic dbps the most commonly used methods to separate complex mixtures and identify individual dbps in water are gas chromatography gc and liquid chromatography lc two dimensional gc is also employed to achieve a better separation li et al 2016a besides selectively detection of potential aromatic dbps can also achieved by pis which has been thoroughly summarized before yang et al 2019c generally potential aromatic dbps are identified based on 1 retention time 2 isotopic patterns and 3 mass spectra that information can help us propose the structures of unknown dbps dbps with longer retention time are more likely to be aromatic dbps rather than aliphatic dbps the mass spectra and isotopic patterns could also reflect the functional groups and the halogen atoms of aromatic dbps yang et al 2019c finally the proposed structure can be confirmed by matching retention time and mass spectra with standard compound for those aromatic dbps without commercially available standard compound synthesis and isolation in laboratory are also needed gong and zhang 2015 moreover accurate mass measurements based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms techniques can provide unambiguous information of molecular formulas which are also beneficial to structure identification without standard compounds nihemaiti et al 2017 determination and quantification of aromatic dbps mainly involve three steps pre treatment compound separation by chromatography and quantification by detectors and previous researches on aromatic dbps identification show great similarity yang et al 2019c the pretreatments of water sample include quenching disinfectant and extraction previous research shows that ascorbic acid was most suitable for five phenyl dbps analysis among sodium sulfite sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride gong et al 2016a as most aromatic dbps occur at trace levels and water matrix are complicated extraction is a necessary pre treatment step solid phase extraction spe and liquid liquid extraction lle are the most commonly used concentration methods the detailed lle processes using methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as extractants have been summarized in previous review yang et al 2019c other extractants such as trichloromethane and dichloromethane were also employed when extracting hps and phenylacetonitrile from water liberatore et al 2017 ma et al 2016 the parameters of spe method such as ph and cartridge type also should be optimized to achieve a higher recovery and lower detection limit hu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019a for halopeptides with isomers that can t be separated by lc some extra pretreatment steps such as adding ascorbic acid may be needed to differentiate c cl substituted and n cl substituted halopeptides jiang et al 2017b furthermore when analyzed by gc related methods halofuranones must be derivatized with acidic methanol to improve its volatility onstad and weinberg 2005 gc is an effective analytical technique to separating emerging dbps with low polarity and high volatility only a few aromatic dbps such as hpans hps and heterocyclic dbps were analyzed by gc related methods liberatore et al 2017 ma et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 most aromatic dbps contain hydrophilic functional groups such as oh cho cooh x and show high polarity besides the mw of most aromatic dbps is higher than aliphatic dbps which results in their low volatility thus many aromatic dbps are not amenable to be identified by gc ms or gc qtof ms richardson 2002 yang et al 2019c lc doesn t require the emerging dbps to be volatile which make it suitable to analyze non volatile or semi volatile aromatic dbps including halodipeptides hnps hbads hbacs and halopyrroles and the most commonly used lc for aromatic dbps analysis is ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipped with hss t3 column yang and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 when gc is applied electronic impact ion source ei is the most commonly used ionization mode while electron spray ion source esi is generally equipped to uplc other ion sources such as positive chemical ionization are also used for halopyrroles and halopyridines identification nihemaiti et al 2017 after separation aromatic dbps can be identified and quantified by detectors such as ms triple quadrupole mass tqms and quadrupole time of flight ms qtof ms when quantifying aromatic dbps a more selective and sensitive scan mode should be chosen to achieve more accurate quantification and lower detection limit e g multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode rather than pis mode or full scan mode was applied for phenyl dbps quantification huang et al 2017 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2017 bib huang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b for aromatic dbps with complex structure such as n chloro peptides they can only be detected by mass spectrometry with high sensitivity and selectivity because mass spectrometry such as qtof ms and tqms can provide more detailed structural information which can separate them from water matrices and improve the accuracy of quantification jiang et al 2019 3 2 occurrence of aromatic dbps nowadays more and more aromatic dbps are detected in drinking water swimming water and effluent of wastewater treatment plants with the help of developing analysis method as table 2 shows compared to aliphatic dbps such as thms and haas that usually occur at μg l level the concentration of aromatic dbps in water is one or two magnitude lower due to lack of commercial standard compounds and high requirement of analysis instrument the data about the occurrence of phenyl dbps is not comprehensive and many phenyl dbps including halopeptides are not quantitatively analyzed jiang et al 2019 the most studied heterocyclic dbps are halogenated furanones pyrroles and their derivatives other heterocyclic dbps are only detected during chlor am ination of model compounds nihemaiti et al 2017 most researches on the occurrence of aromatic dbps were applied in china and us and there is less available information on the occurrence of aromatic dbps in other countries the occurrence of aromatic dbps in drinking water is of great concern as they are directly taken up by human interestingly the concentration of phenylacetonitrile is 10 1000 times higher than other aromatic dbps however its occurrence in raw water is not quantified which is necessary to prove phenylacetonitrile is a product of dom chlorination ma et al 2016 among other phenyl dbps hpans hbacs and hps show generally higher concentration which may be explained by the abundant carboxylic acid and phenolic groups in dom gaffney et al 1996 generally phenyl dbps with relatively higher concentration and higher toxicity are more likely to be toxicity driver as the contribution of a dbp group to the dbp associated toxicity depends on both its concentration and its potential toxicity thus the occurrence of hpans may be important toxicity driver besides the contribution of hnps with high toxicity and moderate concentration also shouldn t be neglected zhang et al 2020 on the contrary the much lower toxicity of hbacs makes them less important even though their concentration is relatively high as for heterocyclic dbps only the occurrence of halogenated furanones in drinking waters has been comprehensive analyzed and their concentration is slightly higher than most phenyl dbps onstad et al 2008 considering the much higher toxicity of heterocyclic dbps their occurrence should be paid more attention and their contribution to overall toxicity may even be higher than phenyl dbps the occurrence of aromatic dbps in drinking water can be affected by several factors such as raw water quality treatment process and disinfectant several researches show that drinking water with higher suva254 formed relatively higher level of aromatic dbps pan et al 2016a zhang et al 2019a due to the residual disinfectants in network the concentration of aromatic dbps may change with distance and their contributions to tox also change with increasing disinfection time li and mitch 2018 the tap water collected near dwtps may contain less phenyl dbps and show lower cytotoxicity zhang et al 2020 compared with drinking water the concentrations of aromatic dbps are much higher in wastewater and swimming pool water due to higher levels of anthropogenic contaminants such as diclofenac and naproxen in wastewater chlorination products of anthropogenic contaminants also generally occur at higher concentrations the relatively higher concentration of other aromatic dbps may attribute to the higher levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in wastewater considering high concentrations of aromatic dbps with high toxicity in wastewater the adverse ecological effect of aromatic dbps should be paid more attention not only dom in raw water but also human body substances including epidermis urine and saliva are important sources of aromatic dbps e g hnps in disinfected swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 both the higher chlorine dosage and abundant precursors lead to higher level of aromatic dbps in swimming pool water 4 transformation of aromatic dbps 4 1 precursor sources of aromatic dbps the dom in source water is considered as the major precursor of dbps dom is a complicated mixture of organic compounds with different size structure and functional groups from different sources thus it s unrealistic to find specific organic compounds that are responsible for dbps formation separating dom according to their characteristics and origination is a commonly used method for tracking precursor sources of dbps to date researches on the precursor of aromatic dbps are limited however considering the structure characteristics of aromatic dbps dom with higher aromaticity and more phenyl or heterocyclic structures may be more likely to form aromatic dbps therefore suva254 which manifests strong relationship with the aromaticity of dom may be a useful surrogate when tracking the precursor of aromatic dbps matilainen et al 2011 distinguishing dom based on its characteristics such as hydrophobicity fluorescence and mw distribution may be of help to reduce its complexity hydrophobic fraction of dom is richer in phenolic structures and double bond which makes them show higher aromaticity matilainen et al 2011 moreover humic substances in dom with relatively higher mw tends to be more hydrophobic and more aromatic which has been proved by the strong correlation between humic and suva254 baghoth et al 2011 thus the hydrophobic and high mw part of dom may be important precursor of aromatic dbps dom can be further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography sec and the humic substance with high aromaticity is moderately correlated with halobenzoquinones formation diemert et al 2013 most researches focus on aliphatic dbps formation potential fp of different fractions of dom rather than aromatic dbps further researches on the relationships between dom characteristics and aromatic dbps fp will be of great help to the development of aromatic dbps control strategies according to the origination of dom the dom can be divided into humic and fulvic acids human waste in effluent organic matter efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organisms all of them can serve as aromatic precursors although they produce aromatic dbps with different characteristics humic and fulvic acids are often originated from the prolonged degradation of plant and animal tissues some plant based structural polymers such as lignin and tannic acid are also important source of humic and fulvic acids tan 2003 although the composition of humic and fulvic acids from different origination is various substantial evidences have revealed that humic and fulvic acid consisted of a skeleton of aromatic units with high aromaticity gaffney et al 1996 hence it s no surprise that humic and fulvic acids play important roles in aromatic dbps formation chlorination of tannic acid samples with different biodegradation time could produce some phenyl dbps such as hbads and hbacs yang et al 2019a gallic acid a decomposition product of tannic acid and lignin also has been proved to be a precursor of 10 phenyl dbps three dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids two dihalo salicylic acids two dihalo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes and three trihalo phenols in both chlorination and chloramination pan et al 2017 as the humic and fulvic acids are nitrogen poor most aromatic dbps formed from them are phenyl c dbps gaffney et al 1996 human waste in efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organisms are rich in organic nitrogen they are important sources of aromatic dbps especially for halodipeptide and heterocyclic dbps as large proteins are effectively removed before disinfection peptides with small size and high solubility are more likely to be precursor of aromatic dbps huang et al 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2019a more than 600 peptides have been detected in raw and finished water and many of them contain aromatic structures tang et al 2016 those peptides with aromatic structure can be important precursors of halodipeptides and hpans huang et al 2017 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2017 bib huang et al 2019a ma et al 2016 it is worth noting that chlorine atoms are preferably substituted on the amine group while iodine and bromine atoms are generally substituted on the aromatic ring of aromatic dipeptides huang et al 2019a this phenomenon may be explained by the hard soft acid base theory nh2cl with hard acid characteristic is more readily to be substituted on the hard base amine group contrarily hoi which is soft acid is preferentially substituted on soft base aromatic group huang et al 2019a some heterocyclic compounds e g tetrapyrroles consist important part of dissolved organic nitrogen don which may react with disinfectant and form heterocyclic dbps such as halopyrroles bond et al 2011 yang and zhang 2014 some anthropogenic contaminants from efom such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and industrial chemicals may also contribute to aromatic dbps formation the removal efficiencies of contaminants with different structures and properties are various some of them could pass through the wastewater treatment plants and occur in the aquatic environment luo et al 2014 even though those anthropogenic contaminants occur at ng l level their chlorinated products can t be neglected whose toxicity effect are even higher than parent compound fan et al 2013 for example the estrogenic activity of 3 3 dichlorobpa is 38 times higher than bisphenol a fukazawa et al 2002 the structures of aromatic dbps from anthropogenic contaminants largely depend on their parent contaminants chlorination of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate a commonly used industrial and domestic detergents will produce halododecylbenzenesulfonic acids gong et al 2016b methylphenols dimethylphenol or other shortchain alkyl phenols in hydraulic fracturing wastewater also serve as precursors for aromatic dbps halomethylphenols and halodimethylphenols dbps liberatore et al 2017 n nitrosodiphenylamine also shows great similarity with its key precursor diphenylamine zhou et al 2009 during chlorination dom with high mw converts into halogenated aromatic dbps by direct pathways or indirect pathways in the indirect pathway the dom is attacked by chlorine and produces nonhalogenated aromatic dbps such as salicylic acid as important intermediates which further transform into halogenated aromatic dbps by electrophilic substitution in the direct pathways chlorine first substitutes into the phenolic moieties in dom and the subsequent cleavage of the formed chloro phenolic moieties in dom will generate halogenated aromatic dbps during which nonhalogenated aromatic dbps are not formed jiang et al 2020 according to jiang et al 2020 both direct and indirect pathways play important roles in halogenated aromatic dbps formation and up to 84 and 22 of monochlorinated and dichlorinated aromatic dbps are formed from the indirect pathways the nitrogen atoms in aromatic dbps may originate from dom or inorganic nitrogen as is mentioned before organic compound with aromatic structure and nitrogen atoms such as peptides and pyrroles can react with disinfectant to form aromatic n dbps meanwhile halopyrroles and halopyrimidines may also be produced during chloramination of resorcinol and the nitrogen atoms in chloramine can incorporate into the resorcinol by ring cleavage reaction and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution nihemaiti et al 2017 besides the electrophilic substitution of chloramine might occur in the ortho or para position of the hydroxyl group in phenyl during which chloramine serves as nitrogen source gong et al 2017 4 2 transformation among aromatic dbps transformation among dbps may occur in the presence of disinfectants heat or solar irradiation and the transformation among aromatic dbps will strongly affect the toxicity of the water liu et al 2017 2019 bib liu et al 2017 bib liu et al 2019 pan et al 2014 transformation pathways of aromatic dbps can be speculated by analyzing the products and intermediate products the proposed pathways can also be further confirmed by chlor am ination intermediate products for example to verify the proposed transformation pathways of 4 iodophenol gong et al 2017 further chloraminated proposed intermediate products 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 iodo 4 aminophenol and detected similar products the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps depend on the molecular structure however the transformation among phenyl dbps can be divided into three main types 1 electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution 2 redox reaction and 3 decarboxylation the most common transformation of phenyl dbps with disinfectants is electrophilic substitution while nucleophilic substitution generally occurs with solar irradiation liu et al 2017 2019 bib liu et al 2017 bib liu et al 2019 due to different electrophilicity the substitution order on the phenyl structure is i br cl gong et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 the ortho and para position are more active to electrophilic substitution on account of the electron donating effect of hydroxyl group and aldehyde group gong et al 2017 pan et al 2016b except halogen atoms other electrophilic groups e g thms will also substitute hydrogen atoms on phenyl structure pan et al 2017 the order of nucleophilic substitution is similar to that of electrophilic substitution which can be explained by increased stability of transformation products liu et al 2017 phenyl dbps may also undergo hydrolysis during which oh acts as a nucleophile gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016b zhai and zhang 2011 besides i on phenyl may be substituted by nh2 from nh2cl through nucleophilic substitution which will result in aminophenols formation gong et al 2017 some phenyl dbps contain several substitution positions the electrophilic substitution on amino group or peptide bond will produce n chloramines which may be responsible for chlorinous odors in water the α hydrogen atom of some functional groups including amino group aldehyde group and nitrile group is also active for electrophilic substitution chu et al 2012 2015 bib chu et al 2012 bib chu et al 2015 what s more the electrophilic substitution on the α hydrogen atom may result in the rupture of the side chain and aliphatic dbps formation chu et al 2012 2015 bib chu et al 2012 bib chu et al 2015 decarboxylation is the most common transformation when phenyl dbps with carboxyl group are heated pan et al 2014 decarboxylation of n halogenated amino acids is also an important step for phenylacetonitrile and hans formation which doesn t require heat chu et al 2015 ma et al 2016 besides the carboxyl groups may be attacked by hox during which carboxyl group is replaced by halogen atoms huang et al 2018b pan et al 2016b for instance 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid may convert to 2 4 6 tribromophenol after being attacked by hobr huang et al 2018b as disinfectants are strong oxidants phenyl dbps with reductive group are readily to be oxidized haloaminophenols products of nucleophilic substitution may be oxidized by chloramine and produce halonitrosophenol halonitrosophenol can be further oxidized to hnps gong et al 2017 the chx2 group on phenyl can be oxidized to be aldehyde group pan et al 2017 which can be further oxidized to carboxyl group huang et al 2018b except transformation among phenyl dbps phenyl dbps may transform into heterocyclic dbps during chloramination the phenyl dbps are converted to halobenzoquinones firstly further hydrolysis and chloramine arrack could transform halobenzoquinones into halopyrroles and halopyridines nihemaiti et al 2017 halofuranones are also produced during chlorination of orcinol tretyakova et al 1994 4 3 decomposition of aromatic dbps previous researches have proved that phenyl dbps could decompose into small aliphatic dbps such as haas thms and hans while researches on heterocyclic dbps decomposition are limited the formation of aliphatic dbps from aromatic dbps including two pathways 1 ring opening and 2 cleavage of the side chain some intermediates of aromatic dbps decomposition may show high toxicity which makes the decomposition pathways draw much attention besides further understanding of the decomposition pathways of aromatic dbps is an important step to reveal the formation process of some aliphatic dbps halobenzoquinones including halo 1 4 benzoquinone and halo 1 2 benzoquinone are important intermediate products of phenyl dbps decomposition zhao et al 2012 cho cells bioassays show that halobenzoquinones were 1000 times more cytotoxic than some regulated dbps such as thms and haas li et al 2015 the mechanisms of halobenzoquinones formation are different when different disinfectants are applied phenol firstly undergo electrophilic substitution to from trihalophenyls which further react with bromine or chlorine to form halobenzoquinones through an ion radical oxidation mechanism when chlorine or chloramine are applied heasley et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 according to criquet et al 2015 most hypohalous acids was consumed by phenolic compounds oxidation during chlorination and only 30 incorporated into dom by electrophilic aromatic substitution besides the percentage of hypohalous acids incorporated into phenolic compounds depends on the position of functional group and the possibility of quinone formation when ozone and chloramine are used dihydrobenzoquinone rather than trihalophenyl are most important intermediates zhao et al 2012 halobenzoquinones are unstable and easily transform to halohydroxybenzoquinones with higher stability especially under alkaline conditions or uv irradiation wang et al 2014 during phototransformation some aromatic dbps such as halogenated 1 2 4 benzenetriols may be important intermediate products qian et al 2013 wang et al 2016 with the increase of halogen atoms and hydroxyl substation halohydroxybenzoquinones are readily to decompose into halocyclopentene 1 3 dione huang et al 2018b pan et al 2016b yang et al 2019a zhai et al 2014 the predicted toxicity of halocyclopentene 1 3 dione is even 106 and 103 times higher than regulated bromoform and unregulated halobenzoquinone respectively yang et al 2019a halocyclopentene 1 3 dione will further decompose with increasing chlorine contract time pan et al 2016b however the decomposition pathways of halocyclopentene 1 3 dione haven t been studied thoroughly another important degradation pathways of halohydroxybenzoquinones are ring open reactions aliphatic aldehydes such as 2 butene 1 4 dial and its chlorinated analogue which can be further oxidized to aliphatic halocarboxylic acids such as maleic acid are common ring cleavage products of chlorine attack hu et al 2018b huang et al 2018b prasse et al 2020 yang et al 2019a halogenated amides may also be formed when chloramine is used chuang et al 2015 further chlorination of aliphatic halocarboxylic acids will produce hals thms and haas chuang et al 2015 hu et al 2018b degradation of halogenated amides such as 2 2 3 5 6 6 hexachloro hexanamide 5 ene 4 one will also from hams chuang et al 2015 le roux et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 the formation of thms and haas from aromatic dbps depends on several factors including molecular structure of aromatic dbps ph and disinfectant dosage the halogen atoms in thms may originate from the phenyl dbps or disinfectant hu et al 2019 thus chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol may produce iodinated thms and haas some of which are even more cytotoxic than aromatic dbps hu et al 2018b aside from ring opening pathways hals and hans can also be produced by the cleavage of the side chain chu et al 2012 chu et al 2015 proposed that further chlorination of n n dichloro tyrosine a chlorination product of tyrosine could result in alanine side chain cleavage and dichloroacetonitrile formation which can hydrolyze to hams as for heterocyclic dbps halopyrroles may be attacked by chloramine to form hams and hals nihemaiti et al 2017 further studies on the degradation of heterocyclic dbps should be made as both heterocyclic dbps and their degradation products show higher toxicity than regulated dbps such as thms and haas 5 control strategies of aromatic dbps as discussed before aromatic dbps are important intermediate products of dom chlorination controlling aromatic dbps not only reduces the health risk induced by aromatic dbps but also is of great help to control aliphatic dbps the control of aromatic dbps toxicity mainly includes four pathways 1 open the cyclic structure of aromatic dbps or precursors 2 remove cyclic structure from water by physical or chemical process 3 transform aromatic dbps into form with lower toxicity and 4 optimize disinfection process the first two pathways mainly focus on removing precursors before disinfection while pathway 3 and 4 focus on aromatic dbps that already exist and the disinfection process respectively those four pathways may co occur when aromatic dbps control strategies are applied 5 1 destroying cyclic structure the cyclic structure in precursors can be destroyed by oxidants such as ozone or radicals when pre oxidation is applied researchers should comprehensively evaluate the variation of toxicity as the cleavage of the cyclic structure may produce more aliphatic dbps efficient radial could simultaneously reduce the formation of aromatic dbps and small aliphatic dbps however when insufficient radicals are used radicals may activate dom to form more aromatic dbps lu et al 2016 ozone is a selective oxidant which primarily reacts with electron rich phenolic and hydroquinone moieties in the dom wenk et al 2013 ozonation can significantly reduce the formation of 23 phenyl dbps and the removal efficiency increases with increasing ozone dose and hydraulic retention time huang et al 2018b however ozonation of water with halogen ions should be cautious halogen ions in water could be activated by residual ozone and result in halogenation of aromatic compounds in water such as mono and dimethylbipyrrole kumar et al 2017 in general optimization of pre oxidation may be difficult due to the complexity of water matrix which makes it less feasible in practical application thus pre oxidation processes combined with other treatments such as biological activated carbon bac are recommended which can remove transformation products and take advantage of multiple barriers 5 2 removing cyclic structure the most common methods to remove cyclic structures from water are activated carbon adsorption and coagulation removing cyclic structure seems to be promising control strategies because not only aromatic dbps but also their decomposition products can be simultaneously controlled phenyl dbps are preferentially removed by activated carbon than aliphatic dbps due to their higher partition coefficient and partition coefficient jiang et al 2018 pre oxidation including chlorination and ozonation before activated carbon adsorption will reduce the size exclusion effect increase the phenyl remove efficiency and prolong saturate time huang et al 2018b jiang et al 2017a even though o3 bac process may increase the concentration of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol several other phenyl dbps become undetectable and the overall cytotoxicity is largely decreased zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that when ozone is used both phenyl structure cleavage and reduced size exclusion effect are responsible for decreased formation of aromatic dbps huang et al 2018b as hydrophobic part of dom shows higher aromaticity preferential removal of hydrophobic part by coagulation may result in reduced aromatic dbps formation zhao et al 2013 what s more humic substances which show high aromaticity are also readily removed by coagulation diemert et al 2013 compared to conventional coagulation enhanced coagulation produces less polar phenyl dbps especially those with chlorine atoms xiao et al 2010 with the increase of alum dose the halofuranones and mucochloric acid formed during subsequent chlorination also decrease which may lead to decrease of the overall genotoxicity zheng et al 2015 the types of coagulants will also affect aromatic dbps formation ferric chloride may oxidize iodide to form iodinated coagulation byproducts i cbps such as diiodoresorcinols which makes alum salts more appropriate for drinking water coagulation ding et al 2019 xiao et al 2010 also demonstrated coagulation with ferric salts would produce more polar dbps compared to alum slats even though coagulation could remove large part of dom not all aromatic dbps are effectively reduced some new polar aromatic dbps with bromine atoms are formed after coagulation which may be explained by increased bromide doc ration xiao et al 2010 removing cyclic structure before disinfection not only is of help to the control of aromatic dbps but also reduce aliphatic dbps since aromatic dbps are important intermediates there are also other water treatment process including sand or membrane filtration that may be able to remove aromatic dbps precursors the efficiency of which needs further study however activated carbon and membrane filtration may not be suitable for water with high bromide due to increased bromide doc ration after pre treatment some modification on activated carbon or membrane characteristic may alleviate those problems 5 3 detoxifying by transformation aromatic dbps will undergo transformation with heat or solar irradiation boiling water before drinking could significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of the tap water pan et al 2014 demonstrated that with boiling for 5 min the cytotoxicity index of simulated tap water decreased from 13 5 to 3 1 due to dehalogenation and decarboxylation most phenyl dbps are decreased and only a few stable phenyl dbps are accumulated which may contribute to the detoxification of water when effluent from wastewater treatment plants goes into aquatic environment solar irradiation could induce photoconversion of aromatic dbps with the increase of the light exposure the overall toxicity of chlorinated saline primary effluent is distinctly decreased liu et al 2017 however the overall toxicity of aromatic dbps solution first increases and then decreases when the light exposure time increases liu et al 2019 this can be explained by the formation of halo hydro quinones with high toxicity which have been proved by pis therefore when solar irradiation is applied to detoxify water the irradiation dose must be enough to destroy halo hydro quinones uv irradiation have been proved to be able degrade most aliphatic dbps and halobenzoquinones which will reduce overall toxicity huang et al 2019b qian et al 2013 uv irradiation may also be used in aromatic dbps control after optimization 5 4 optimizing disinfection process disinfectant types contact time and disinfectant dosage significantly affect the concentration of aromatic dbps thus aromatic dbps control can be achieved by optimizing disinfection process compared with chloramination chlorination possesses higher oxidative capacity and reacts much faster with dom zhai et al 2014 therefore chlorination produces more chlorinated aromatic dbps pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the effect of disinfectant on brominated aromatic dbps depends on the disinfectant condition when chlor am ine dosage is much higher than bromide concentration brominated aromatic dbps formed during chlorination may be lower than that of chloramination because excess chlorine could oxidize bromide into bromate and less bromide is available to form brominated aromatic dbps pan et al 2017 however when bromide concentration is similar to chlor am ine dosage more brominated aromatic dbps may be generated during chlorination due to relatively slow reactions among nh2cl bromide and dom zhai et al 2014 iodide can only be oxidized to hypoiodous acid which are hard be further oxidized to iodate by chloramine thus more iodinated aromatic dbps are formed during chloramination pan et al 2016a 2016c 2017 bib pan et al 2016a bib pan et al 2017 bib pan et al 2016c therefore when raw water contains high level of iodide chlorine is recommended while chloramine is more suitable for water with little bromide and iodide chloramine is mile enough to allow aromatic dbps accumulate pan et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 contrarily chlorine would promote aromatic dbps decomposition thus the concentration of aromatic dbps first increases than decreases during chlorination pan et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 zhai et al 2014 this may also explain the higher aliphatic dbps concentration in chlorinated water the variation of overall toxicity with different contract time or cumulative disinfectant concentration over time ct should be systemically evaluated considering more halogen atoms are provided when increasing disinfectant dosage it s no wonder that the concentration of aromatic dbps increases with disinfectant dosage pan et al 2016c xiao et al 2010 under the premise of microbiological safety high dosage of disinfectants should be avoided when choosing control strategies of aromatic dbps several factors including economy control efficiency characteristic of raw water and potential adverse effect should be considered optimizing coagulation and disinfection process boiling before drinking have the advantage of low cost as no extra treatment facility is needed however the control efficiency of optimizing coagulation and disinfection process needs to be further improved although pre oxidation and activated carbon adsorption may be less economic they may show better aromatic dbps control efficiency when there is also need of decolorization or odor control pre oxidation and activated carbon adsorption may be applied as multifunctional treatment process while they may not be recommended for water with low suva254 or high level of bromide or iodide furthermore combination of different aromatic dbps control strategies may be a noteworthy research direction in the future previous researches on dbps control generally focus on the aliphatic dbps such as thms haas hans or tox which may result in deviation when evaluating the efficiency of dbps control strategies tox may increase with increasing chlorination time while the overall toxicity shows insignificant change han and zhang 2018 when aromatic dbps are taken into account this phenomenon can be explained by decomposition of aromatic dbps which may be more toxic than their decomposition products thus when evaluating dbps control strategies the changes in both aliphatic dbps and aromatic dbps formation should be comprehensively analyzed to better reflect the overall toxicity 6 conclusions and future study with the help of developing analysis technology a new group of dbps aromatic dbps is detected and identified in drinking water waste water and swimming pool water from the foregoing review of published research aromatic dbps show relatively higher toxicity compare to aliphatic which makes them draw great attention among phenyl dbps hpans and hnps seem to be important toxicity driver considering their relatively high toxicity and high concentration different types of aromatic dbps may be produced during chlorination of humic and fulvic acids human waste in effluent organic matter efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organism when residual disinfectants exist aromatic dbps may transform to halo hydroxy benzoquinones and decompose into aliphatic dbps including thms hans hams step by step which may also cause adverse health effect thus several strategies such as peroxidation adsorption and coagulation have been proposed to control aromatic dbps reduce overall toxicity efficiently to gain a deeper perception of dbp formation process and achieve better toxicity control several important themes on aromatic dbps need further research in future work formation of important aromatic dbps may be predicable aromaticity of dom may be reflected by suva fluorescence or other water parameters that can be easily detected the relationship between those water parameters and aromatic dbps formation could be further explored to predict dbps concentration and overall toxicity of disinfected water aromatic dbps may be another important criterion to evaluate dbps control strategies most published researches focus on aliphatic dbps which may not be the driver of overall toxicity some dbp control strategies that have been proved to be efficient for aliphatic dbps may be further evaluated by aromatic dbps understanding the variation of both aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps during different process may provide a more comprehensive perception in dbps control strategies previous research on aromatic dbps mainly focus on phenyl dbps however the occurrence of heterocyclic dbps with higher toxicity deserves more attention it s suggested that the toxicity mechanism occurrence and transformation pathway of heterocyclic dbps should be further studied besides more emerging aromatic dbps with high toxicity may be identified by changing the analysis method there are disparities between the results of in vitro and in vivo toxicological bioassays the toxic mechanism of different results warrants further studied in addition previous researches on co existence of several types of dbps e g aromatic dbps aliphatic dbps and alicyclic dbps are rare it s recommend more systematic and comprehensive toxicological

17650,with the development of analytical technology more emerging disinfection by products dbps have been identified and detected among them aromatic dbps especially heterocyclic dbps possess relatively high toxicity compared with regulated dbps which has been proved by bioassays thus the occurrence of aromatic dbps is of great concern this article provides a comprehensive review and summary of the characteristics occurrence transformation pathways and control of aromatic dbps aromatic dbps are frequently detected in drinking water wastewater and swimming pool water among which swimming pool water illustrates highest concentration considering the relatively high concentration and toxicity halophenylacetonitriles hpans and halonitrophenols hnps are more likely to be toxicity driver among frequently detected phenyl dbps aromatic dbps can be viewed as important intermediate products of dissolved organic matter dom during chlor am ination high molecular weight dom could convert to aromatic dbps via direct or indirect pathways and they can further decompose into regulated aliphatic dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by ring opening and side chain cleavage even though no single dbps control strategy is efficient to all aromatic dbps the decrease of overall toxicity may be achieved by several methods including absorption solar radiation and boiling by systematically considering aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps a better trade off can be made to reduce health risk induced by dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords aromatic disinfection by products analytical methods transformation pathways control strategies toxicity evaluation 1 introduction using chlorine as disinfectant in drinking water treatment to inactivate pathogen has greatly reduced water borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever pichel et al 2019 however the reactions between disinfectants and dissolved organic matter dom in source water may produce disinfection by products dbps some of which illustrate high mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in animals the first identified dbps in disinfected water are trihalomethanes thms bellar et al 1974 since then several hundreds of dbps such as haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams haloacetaldehydes hals have been discovered mian et al 2018 several epidemiological studies have found that long term consumption of chlorinated water may increase the risk of urinary bladder cancer villanueva et al 2003 considering the health risk posed by dbps many countries and organizations have established regulations and guidelines for dbps in drinking water mainly including thms and haas known as regulated dbps usepa 2006 who 2006 even though regulated thms haas occur at a high level in drinking water they are not toxicity forcing agents in drinking water kimura et al 2019 although some identified dbps such as hans hams hals may contribute more to overall toxicity epidemiological studies have revealed that commonly known dbps cannot fully account for the adverse health effects caused by consuming chlorinated drinking water diana et al 2019 identified dbps consist less than 40 of total organic halogen tox and the tox formed from alternative disinfectants even contains more unknown dbps richardson 2002 yang and zhang 2016 thus increasing efforts have been made to identify and control emerging dbps such as halobenzoquinones iodinated dbps and aromatic dbps li et al 2016b li and mitch 2018 aromatic dbps refer to dbps with planar cyclic structures that follow hückel s rule generally aromatic dbps such as halogenated phenols and halogenated furanones contain phenyl or heterocycle structures those aromatic structures may provide aromatic dbps with some special characteristics such as high reactivity to electrophilic substitution or increased stability the history of aromatic dbps identification has been shown in fig 1 the first subgroup of aromatic dbps identified in drinking water is halofuranones at concentrations of 10 150 μg l smeds et al 1997 it was not was not until the application of precursor ion scan pis that large groups of aromatic dbps including halohydroxybenzaldehydes hbads halophenols hps halohydroxybenzoic acids hbacs halonitrophenols hnps halobenzenesulfonic acids and halopyrroles were discovered ding and zhang 2009 hitherto nearly 100 aromatic dbps have been discovered in drinking water swimming pool water or wastewater effluent by pis yang et al 2019c other emerging aromatic dbps including halo phenylacetonitrile halopeptides and halopyridines were confirmed successively in recent years aromatic dbps gain prominence for several reasons firstly many aromatic dbps present higher toxicity than commonly known aliphatic dbps although aromatic dbps occur at much lower concentration than aliphatic dbps their contribution to overall toxicity cannot be neglected the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of halofuranones have been widely proved cortés and marcos 2018 and smeds et al 1997 founded that halofuranones may account for 20 60 of the total of treated drinking water the occurrences of aromatic dbps not only pose risk to human health but also lead to adverse implications for marine ecology yang and zhang 2013 secondly human may be exposed to aromatic dbps during daily activities including drinking water swimming and eating the concentration of aromatic dbps in drinking water could be ng l level and cooking with iodized table salt may result in increased iodinated aromatic dbps in food pan et al 2016c in addition aromatic dbps including 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 bromophenol could permeate through skin during swimming and the amounts of aromatic dbps that permeate through skin increase with increasing exposure time xiao et al 2012 thirdly aromatic dbps tend to be precursor sources of aliphatic dbps or other toxic dbps the hydroquinone is easily oxidized to benzoquinone by disinfectants meanwhile haloquinones an important group of carcinogens may be produced by aromatic substitution bull et al 2011 further decomposition of aromatic dbps will produce aliphatic dbps with lower molecular weight mw hu et al 2019 understanding the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps can further reveal the mechanism of aliphatic dbps formation which can facilitate the development of dbps control strategies what s more some aromatic dbps may cause unpleasant taste or odor in drinking water aldehydes and chloroaldimine formed during chlorination of amino acids or peptides may be partially responsible for the unpleasant odors in drinking water ma et al 2016 the odor thresholds of n chlorophenylacetaldimine and phenylacetaldehyde are only 4 and 3 μg l respectively how et al 2018 moreover some hps possess extremely low odor threshold concentrations in the level of ng l acero et al 2005 hence understanding and controlling the occurrence of aromatic dbps have attracted lots of attention this review aims to 1 provide an overview of the characteristics and analytical methods of aromatic dbps and highlight the occurrence of aromatic dbps 2 systematically describe the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps 3 summarize the control strategies of aromatic dbps and 4 discuss topics for future research on aromatic dbps 2 characteristics of aromatic dbps 2 1 classification and stability of aromatic dbps aromatic dbps include two main types phenyl dbps and heterocyclic dbps the phenyl dbps can be further divided into phenyl nitrogenous dbps n dbps and carbonaceous dbps c dbps according to their structures phenyl n dbps contain functional groups with n atoms such as no2 nh2 cn while phenyl c dbps do not contain n atoms heterocyclic dbps also contain planar cyclic structure such as pyrrole and pyridine nihemaiti et al 2017 only a few aromatic dbps such as chlorophenazines simultaneously contain benzene and heterocyclic structure bull et al 2011 however not all dbps with cyclic structures possess aromaticity e g halobenzoquinones and trihalo hydroxy cyclopentene diones those cyclic dbps without aromaticity may be products of reaction between aromatic dbps and disinfectants which will be discussed in following section as shown in fig 2 the currently identified phenyl c dbps and n dbps mainly contain six subgroups i e halodipeptides halophenylacetonitriles hpans hbads hps hbacs hnps other kinds of phenyl dbps with alkyl chain or sulfonate are also identified and displayed in table s1 most heterocyclic dbps detected in drinking water or wastewater samples are halofuranones halopyrroles and their derivatives generally heterocyclic dbps are not stable halogenated furanones are easily hydrolyzed under alkaline condition nihemaiti et al 2017 and halopyrroles are also readily to decompose with excess chlorine yang and zhang 2014 researches on the stability of phenyl dbps are limited the stability of phenyl dbps differs from one another which is related to the electronegativity of the functional groups and halogen atoms hu et al 2018b 2019 bib hu et al 2019 bib hu et al 2018b huang et al 2017 phenyl dbps with electron withdrawing functional groups such as no2 and cn are more stable hu et al 2018b therefore phenylacetonitril and two chlorophenylacetonitriles are relatively stable in presence of chlorine while 100 μg l 2 4 6 triiodophenol becomes undetectable in 20 h with 30 mg l chloramine hu et al 2018b additionally brominated phenyl dbps i e 2 4 6 tribromophenol are readily transformed to phenyl aromatic dbps with chlorine zhai and zhang 2011 it s strongly suggested that the stability of those aromatic dbps should be evaluated most aromatic dbps are detected in finished water of drinking water treatment plants dwtps or chlorinated simulated drinking water however there are residual disinfectants in network which may result in formation or decomposition of aromatic dbps thus measuring aromatic dbps in water with different disinfection time or evaluating their stability is recommended besides the stability of aromatic dbps with different disinfectants may be various chloramine with poor oxidative capacity could result in aromatic dbps accumulation while chlorination could degrade aromatic dbps into small aliphatic dbps zhai et al 2014 2 2 toxicity of aromatic dbps exposure to dbps may cause side health effects which include colorectal bladder cancer and adverse birth outcomes diana et al 2019 currently the most commonly used and reliable methods to evaluate the toxicity of dbps are in vivo and in vitro bioassays epidemiological studies and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar methods may also be of great help to assess the toxicity of dbps current toxicity studies on aromatic dbps mainly focus on phenyl dbps as the concentration of most heterocyclic dbps in drinking water are not commonly researched several researches have been made on the developmental toxicity cytotoxicity and endocrine disruption effect of phenyl dbps by using different bioassay species which have been illustrated in tables s2 and s3 chinese hamster ovary cho cells are the most commonly utilized organism to evaluate the cytotoxicity of dbps including aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps liberatore et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 zhang et al 2018 2020 bib zhang et al 2018 bib zhang et al 2020 the human hepatoma cells hepg2 is also applied in in vitro bioassays when evaluating the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps hu et al 2018b other bioassay species including the freshwater bacterium vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 the marine alga tetraselmis marina the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii and chinese rare minnow gobiocypris rarus are generally employed to evaluate the toxicity of phenyl dbps in terms of luminescence inhibition growth inhibition developmental toxicity and disrupting effects respectively in in vivo bioassay chen et al 2019 liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016c yang and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2008 aside from in vivo and in vitro bioassays evaluating the endocrine disrupting effects of phenyl dbps can also be achieved by in silico bioassays as human transthyretin httr is an important thyroid hormones ths carrier httr is selected as model serum proteins to assess the endocrine disrupting effects of 17 phenyl dbps yang et al 2019d besides holmes et al 2017 chose chimp androgen receptor to estimate the endocrine disrupting effect of 21 dbps in in silico bioassay which showed that the endocrine disrupting effect of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was one magnitude lower than 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone and the 4 chlorophenyl exhibited little endocrine disrupting effect as cho and p dumerilii are the most commonly used organism in in vivo and in vitro toxicity bioassay respectively the toxicity of the aromatic dbps and typical aliphatic dbps to cho and p dumerilii is illustrated in fig 3 even though the toxicity mechanism of phenyl dbps in various bioassay species may be different the results of bioassays have some similarities firstly phenyl n dbps are generally more toxic than phenyl c dbps and the toxicity of phenyl dbps follows the order of hnps hpans hps hbads hbacs according to the in vitro cytotoxicity and the in vivo developmental toxicity bioassays zhang et al 2018 2020 bib zhang et al 2018 bib zhang et al 2020 interestingly phenyl dbps possessing higher cytotoxicity also illustrate higher binding potency towards antioxidant enzymes especially for catalase phenyl dbps with different functional groups have various electrostatic potential which makes them bind to different sites on antioxidant enzymes with different binding energy thus phenyl dbps with various functional groups illustrate different toxic potency zhang et al 2020 besides the higher hydrophilicity may be responsible for the lower toxicity of phenyl c dbps compared to phenyl n dbps as they are less likely to permeate into cell or bind with protein yang et al 2019d however the results of alga and v qinghaiensis sp q67 bioassays are slightly different from others the growth inhibition effects of some hbads and hps are higher than hnps for alga this may be explained by the higher metabolism rates for hnps than hps in alga cells liu and zhang 2014 some hps also show higher toxicity in v qinghaiensis sp q67 than some hnps the mechanism of which needs further exploration chen et al 2019 secondly brominated phenyl dbps present higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogs and both of them possess lower toxicity than their iodinated analogs this is a common phenomenon that also has been discovered in other aliphatic dbps e g haas thms hams hans wagner and plewa 2017 the different toxicity of phenyl dbps with different halogen atoms can be partly explained by binding reaction between phenyl dbps and antioxidant enzymes halogen atoms may affect the electrostatic potential distributions of phenyl dbps and most brominated analogs show higher binding potency than chlorinated analogs zhang et al 2020 furthermore the higher lipophilicity of iodinated phenyl dbps may be another important reason yang and zhang 2013 the higher toxicity of iodinated haas is attributed to their higher inhibition rate on glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh activity in cho cells which would suppress atp formation pals et al 2011 besides echigo et al 2004 also demonstrated that total organic bromine was three times more active to induce chromosomal aberration than total organic chlorine in chlorinated water whether those toxicity mechanisms can be used to explain the higher toxicity of iodinated phenyl dbps requires further bioassays the substitution positions and amount of halogen atoms may also affect the toxicity of phenyl dbps mostly phenyl dbps with more halogen atoms possess higher endocrine activity and toxicity in cho alga and v qinghaiensis sp q67 while the trend appears to reverse in p dumerilii chen et al 2019 holmes et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019d zhang et al 2018 as for whether phenyl dbps are more toxic than aliphatic dbps bioassays show different results cho bioassays results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps was comparable to aliphatic dbps and some aliphatic dbps such hals and hams were even more toxic wagner and plewa 2017 besides some aliphatic dbps show higher endocrine activity than aromatic dbps holmes et al 2017 however in vivo bioassays applying aquatic organisms such as t marina and embryos of p dumerilii illustrate that phenyl dbps were more toxic liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 interestingly li s group also reported that halobenzoquinones could induce significantly higher developmental toxicity than haas in zebrafish embryos while such a trend was not consistent with the trend observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity bioassay wagner and plewa 2017 wang et al 2018 as various toxicity metrics can be classified into the two major groups in vitro and in vivo bioassays different toxicity mechanisms responsible for the observed toxicity results from in vitro and in vivo bioassays warrant further investigations disinfected water usually contains several hundreds of dbps studies on toxicological interactions between phenyl dbps such as antagonism and synergism are necessary chen et al 2019 observed that 61 41 and 31 of experimental ec50 ec20 ec10 the 50 20 and 10 effective concentrations of phenyl dbps mixtures were lower than prediction indicating that there were synergistic effects of coexistence on the cytotoxicity of phenyl dbps this further highlights the health risks posed by aromatic dbps considering the relatively high level of aliphatic dbps in disinfected water testing the effects of the coexistence of aliphatic dbps and aromatic dbps is also recommended generally heterocyclic dbps show higher toxicity than phenyl dbps and aliphatic dbps the developmental toxicity of tetrabromopyrrole is 6 460 and 8805 higher than 2 5 dibromohydroquinone bromoform and bromoacetic acid respectively yang and zhang 2014 the toxicity of halofuranones has been widely proved as halofuranones are the first group of aromatic dbps identified the genotoxicity and mutation effect of halofuranones have been evaluated by both in vivo and in vitro bioassays which employed various bioassays species including rat liver epithelial cells ck6 hepg2 cells and wistar rats wang et al 2013 in vivo studies show that nitrosamines and 3 chloro 4 dichloromethyl 5 hydroxy 2 5h furanone mx were the most potent carcinogenic dbps based on their td50 the dose of chemical that would produce cancer in 50 of the population studied in a lifetime among 409 analyzed dbps including haas thms hans diana et al 2019 the td50 of mx is one or two magnitude lower than haas and thms however lower dna damaging potency and cytotoxicity of mx compared to some aliphatic dbps was observed in in vitro bioassays plewa et al 2002 zhang et al 2012 with the development of analytical methods more heterocyclic dbps may be identified and evaluating the toxicity of heterocyclic dbps seems to be necessary considering the financial and technical cost it s impracticable to comprehensively evaluate and compare the toxicity of all series of aromatic dbps with different halogenation types and functional groups the toxicity of aromatic dbps demonstrates a strong relationship with their structures thus qsar methods recently have been used to facilitate interpretation of toxicity mechanisms and predict potential toxicological effect of dbps including developmental toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity chen et al 2015 the qsar methods require descriptors to predict the toxicity which generally include physical chemical descriptors and chemical structure descriptors descriptor filtration by either empirical judgment or computational analysis is needed to select appropriate and reasonable descriptors from candidates and reduce the complexity of qsar modeling chen et al 2015 the results of descriptor filtration could also reveal the toxicity mechanism that is of great importance based on the observed toxicity data and the values of candidate descriptors the equations derived from regression analysis and the optimized descriptors in previous researches are shown in table 1 considering the toxicity potencies of chemical compounds are related to the molecular structure several descriptors that strongly reflect chemical structure such as length to breadth ratio weighted by whim weighted holistic invariant molecular energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo are chosen as important descriptors chen et al 2019 yang and zhang 2013 those chemical structure descriptors can be divided into quantum chemical descriptors electronic descriptors and topological descriptors several physicochemical properties are also important descriptors as is mentioned above hydrophobic aromatic dbps possess higher toxicity because they can penetrate biological membranes and reach organs and tissues in the body more easily which may further results in membrane or mitochondrial dysfunction yang and zhang 2013 besides the hydrophobicity of aromatic dbps also affects the interaction between protein and aromatic dbps thus some researches chose physicochemical properties including dissociation constant pka octanol water distribution coefficient as descriptors yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019d the cytotoxicity and development toxicity of dbps may depend on their ability to induce oxidative stress li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 as the antioxidant defense system could change in response to the induced oxidative stress the binding affinity between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes are also chosen as an important descriptors zhang et al 2020 interestingly when developing the qsar model ecat binding energies of aromatic dbps with catalase ehomo elumo were chosen as most appropriate descriptors among the 18 candidates by elimination selection stepwise regression es swr this result highlights binding between aromatic dbps and antioxidant enzymes in toxicity mechanism in cho cells zhang et al 2020 besides the statistically analysis of qsar module also demonstrates that the main toxicity mechanism of phenyl dbps in alga should be polar narcosis of cell membrane which was well described by log kow pka and molar topological index mti liu and zhang 2014 in general the toxicity effect of aromatic dbps is a complex process which may involve penetrating into cell membrane or mitochondrial dysfunction inhibiting atp formation inducing oxidative stress alter the expression of gene or directly combining with dna the carcinogenesis processes are even more complicated dad et al 2018 li et al 2015 2018 bib li et al 2018 bib li et al 2015 nowadays the studies on the toxicity of aromatic dbps mainly focus on the toxicity evaluation and prediction however few researches have been made on the toxicity mechanism of aromatic dbps especially for heterocyclic dbps several researches have revealed that in response to increased intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by halobenzoquinones thms and haas several cell signaling pathways including nuclear factor erythroidderived2 like 2 nrf2 are involved to control oxidative stress through modulation of stress response genes chaves et al 2019 li et al 2018 even though there isn t bioassay on the cell signaling pathways in response to aromatic dbps exposure the strong relationships between cytotoxicity and ecat of aromatic dbps suggest the potential important role of signaling mechanisms when cells are exposed to aromatic dbps zhang et al 2020 besides previous research shows that aromatic dbps could readily bind with human serum albumin and httr which could lead to dysfunction of those proteins yang et al 2019d zhang et al 2019b the binding interactions between aromatic dbps and functional proteins may also be important part of toxicity action mode of aromatic dbps the toxicity mechanisms of different dbps in different species are different and a further understanding of toxicity mechanism will be of great help to the development of qsar model and vice versa besides studies focus on the carcinogenicity and other adverse effect of aromatic dbps are rare and only halofuranones have been proved as carcinogens so far 76 compounds have been proved to be bladder carcinogens and 75 of them possess cycles structures with 82 of them being aromatic cycles e g 4 amino 2 nitrophenol p chloro o toluidine diana et al 2019 considering their structural similarity with aromatic dbps the contribution of aromatic dbps to the risk of cancer could not be neglected besides n halamines are potent carcinogen due to their ability to form radical species in vivo which emphasizes the health risk posed by aromatics dbps with n halamines such as halopeptides bull et al 2011 the carcinogenicity of aromatic dbps should be evaluated thoroughly and more epidemiological studies should be done on the connection between aromatic dbps and cancer especially for those with high cytotoxicity 3 analysis and occurrence of aromatic dbps 3 1 identification and quantification of aromatic dbps as most aromatic dbps are newly found dbps most efforts focus on analytical methods of aromatic dbps several reviews have been made on the identification and quantification of emerging dbps including n halogenated peptides and halogenated polar dbps jiang et al 2019 yang and zhang 2016 yang et al 2019c zhang et al 2020 therefore commonly used analytical methods for identifying and quantifying aromatic dbps are only simply summarized here identifying aromatic dbps that exist in water is the foundation of aromatic dbps research as water extracts are usually complex mixtures separation is the first step of identifying aromatic dbps the most commonly used methods to separate complex mixtures and identify individual dbps in water are gas chromatography gc and liquid chromatography lc two dimensional gc is also employed to achieve a better separation li et al 2016a besides selectively detection of potential aromatic dbps can also achieved by pis which has been thoroughly summarized before yang et al 2019c generally potential aromatic dbps are identified based on 1 retention time 2 isotopic patterns and 3 mass spectra that information can help us propose the structures of unknown dbps dbps with longer retention time are more likely to be aromatic dbps rather than aliphatic dbps the mass spectra and isotopic patterns could also reflect the functional groups and the halogen atoms of aromatic dbps yang et al 2019c finally the proposed structure can be confirmed by matching retention time and mass spectra with standard compound for those aromatic dbps without commercially available standard compound synthesis and isolation in laboratory are also needed gong and zhang 2015 moreover accurate mass measurements based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms techniques can provide unambiguous information of molecular formulas which are also beneficial to structure identification without standard compounds nihemaiti et al 2017 determination and quantification of aromatic dbps mainly involve three steps pre treatment compound separation by chromatography and quantification by detectors and previous researches on aromatic dbps identification show great similarity yang et al 2019c the pretreatments of water sample include quenching disinfectant and extraction previous research shows that ascorbic acid was most suitable for five phenyl dbps analysis among sodium sulfite sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and sodium borohydride gong et al 2016a as most aromatic dbps occur at trace levels and water matrix are complicated extraction is a necessary pre treatment step solid phase extraction spe and liquid liquid extraction lle are the most commonly used concentration methods the detailed lle processes using methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as extractants have been summarized in previous review yang et al 2019c other extractants such as trichloromethane and dichloromethane were also employed when extracting hps and phenylacetonitrile from water liberatore et al 2017 ma et al 2016 the parameters of spe method such as ph and cartridge type also should be optimized to achieve a higher recovery and lower detection limit hu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019a for halopeptides with isomers that can t be separated by lc some extra pretreatment steps such as adding ascorbic acid may be needed to differentiate c cl substituted and n cl substituted halopeptides jiang et al 2017b furthermore when analyzed by gc related methods halofuranones must be derivatized with acidic methanol to improve its volatility onstad and weinberg 2005 gc is an effective analytical technique to separating emerging dbps with low polarity and high volatility only a few aromatic dbps such as hpans hps and heterocyclic dbps were analyzed by gc related methods liberatore et al 2017 ma et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 most aromatic dbps contain hydrophilic functional groups such as oh cho cooh x and show high polarity besides the mw of most aromatic dbps is higher than aliphatic dbps which results in their low volatility thus many aromatic dbps are not amenable to be identified by gc ms or gc qtof ms richardson 2002 yang et al 2019c lc doesn t require the emerging dbps to be volatile which make it suitable to analyze non volatile or semi volatile aromatic dbps including halodipeptides hnps hbads hbacs and halopyrroles and the most commonly used lc for aromatic dbps analysis is ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipped with hss t3 column yang and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 when gc is applied electronic impact ion source ei is the most commonly used ionization mode while electron spray ion source esi is generally equipped to uplc other ion sources such as positive chemical ionization are also used for halopyrroles and halopyridines identification nihemaiti et al 2017 after separation aromatic dbps can be identified and quantified by detectors such as ms triple quadrupole mass tqms and quadrupole time of flight ms qtof ms when quantifying aromatic dbps a more selective and sensitive scan mode should be chosen to achieve more accurate quantification and lower detection limit e g multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode rather than pis mode or full scan mode was applied for phenyl dbps quantification huang et al 2017 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2017 bib huang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b for aromatic dbps with complex structure such as n chloro peptides they can only be detected by mass spectrometry with high sensitivity and selectivity because mass spectrometry such as qtof ms and tqms can provide more detailed structural information which can separate them from water matrices and improve the accuracy of quantification jiang et al 2019 3 2 occurrence of aromatic dbps nowadays more and more aromatic dbps are detected in drinking water swimming water and effluent of wastewater treatment plants with the help of developing analysis method as table 2 shows compared to aliphatic dbps such as thms and haas that usually occur at μg l level the concentration of aromatic dbps in water is one or two magnitude lower due to lack of commercial standard compounds and high requirement of analysis instrument the data about the occurrence of phenyl dbps is not comprehensive and many phenyl dbps including halopeptides are not quantitatively analyzed jiang et al 2019 the most studied heterocyclic dbps are halogenated furanones pyrroles and their derivatives other heterocyclic dbps are only detected during chlor am ination of model compounds nihemaiti et al 2017 most researches on the occurrence of aromatic dbps were applied in china and us and there is less available information on the occurrence of aromatic dbps in other countries the occurrence of aromatic dbps in drinking water is of great concern as they are directly taken up by human interestingly the concentration of phenylacetonitrile is 10 1000 times higher than other aromatic dbps however its occurrence in raw water is not quantified which is necessary to prove phenylacetonitrile is a product of dom chlorination ma et al 2016 among other phenyl dbps hpans hbacs and hps show generally higher concentration which may be explained by the abundant carboxylic acid and phenolic groups in dom gaffney et al 1996 generally phenyl dbps with relatively higher concentration and higher toxicity are more likely to be toxicity driver as the contribution of a dbp group to the dbp associated toxicity depends on both its concentration and its potential toxicity thus the occurrence of hpans may be important toxicity driver besides the contribution of hnps with high toxicity and moderate concentration also shouldn t be neglected zhang et al 2020 on the contrary the much lower toxicity of hbacs makes them less important even though their concentration is relatively high as for heterocyclic dbps only the occurrence of halogenated furanones in drinking waters has been comprehensive analyzed and their concentration is slightly higher than most phenyl dbps onstad et al 2008 considering the much higher toxicity of heterocyclic dbps their occurrence should be paid more attention and their contribution to overall toxicity may even be higher than phenyl dbps the occurrence of aromatic dbps in drinking water can be affected by several factors such as raw water quality treatment process and disinfectant several researches show that drinking water with higher suva254 formed relatively higher level of aromatic dbps pan et al 2016a zhang et al 2019a due to the residual disinfectants in network the concentration of aromatic dbps may change with distance and their contributions to tox also change with increasing disinfection time li and mitch 2018 the tap water collected near dwtps may contain less phenyl dbps and show lower cytotoxicity zhang et al 2020 compared with drinking water the concentrations of aromatic dbps are much higher in wastewater and swimming pool water due to higher levels of anthropogenic contaminants such as diclofenac and naproxen in wastewater chlorination products of anthropogenic contaminants also generally occur at higher concentrations the relatively higher concentration of other aromatic dbps may attribute to the higher levels of dissolved organic carbon doc in wastewater considering high concentrations of aromatic dbps with high toxicity in wastewater the adverse ecological effect of aromatic dbps should be paid more attention not only dom in raw water but also human body substances including epidermis urine and saliva are important sources of aromatic dbps e g hnps in disinfected swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 both the higher chlorine dosage and abundant precursors lead to higher level of aromatic dbps in swimming pool water 4 transformation of aromatic dbps 4 1 precursor sources of aromatic dbps the dom in source water is considered as the major precursor of dbps dom is a complicated mixture of organic compounds with different size structure and functional groups from different sources thus it s unrealistic to find specific organic compounds that are responsible for dbps formation separating dom according to their characteristics and origination is a commonly used method for tracking precursor sources of dbps to date researches on the precursor of aromatic dbps are limited however considering the structure characteristics of aromatic dbps dom with higher aromaticity and more phenyl or heterocyclic structures may be more likely to form aromatic dbps therefore suva254 which manifests strong relationship with the aromaticity of dom may be a useful surrogate when tracking the precursor of aromatic dbps matilainen et al 2011 distinguishing dom based on its characteristics such as hydrophobicity fluorescence and mw distribution may be of help to reduce its complexity hydrophobic fraction of dom is richer in phenolic structures and double bond which makes them show higher aromaticity matilainen et al 2011 moreover humic substances in dom with relatively higher mw tends to be more hydrophobic and more aromatic which has been proved by the strong correlation between humic and suva254 baghoth et al 2011 thus the hydrophobic and high mw part of dom may be important precursor of aromatic dbps dom can be further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography sec and the humic substance with high aromaticity is moderately correlated with halobenzoquinones formation diemert et al 2013 most researches focus on aliphatic dbps formation potential fp of different fractions of dom rather than aromatic dbps further researches on the relationships between dom characteristics and aromatic dbps fp will be of great help to the development of aromatic dbps control strategies according to the origination of dom the dom can be divided into humic and fulvic acids human waste in effluent organic matter efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organisms all of them can serve as aromatic precursors although they produce aromatic dbps with different characteristics humic and fulvic acids are often originated from the prolonged degradation of plant and animal tissues some plant based structural polymers such as lignin and tannic acid are also important source of humic and fulvic acids tan 2003 although the composition of humic and fulvic acids from different origination is various substantial evidences have revealed that humic and fulvic acid consisted of a skeleton of aromatic units with high aromaticity gaffney et al 1996 hence it s no surprise that humic and fulvic acids play important roles in aromatic dbps formation chlorination of tannic acid samples with different biodegradation time could produce some phenyl dbps such as hbads and hbacs yang et al 2019a gallic acid a decomposition product of tannic acid and lignin also has been proved to be a precursor of 10 phenyl dbps three dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids two dihalo salicylic acids two dihalo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes and three trihalo phenols in both chlorination and chloramination pan et al 2017 as the humic and fulvic acids are nitrogen poor most aromatic dbps formed from them are phenyl c dbps gaffney et al 1996 human waste in efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organisms are rich in organic nitrogen they are important sources of aromatic dbps especially for halodipeptide and heterocyclic dbps as large proteins are effectively removed before disinfection peptides with small size and high solubility are more likely to be precursor of aromatic dbps huang et al 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2019a more than 600 peptides have been detected in raw and finished water and many of them contain aromatic structures tang et al 2016 those peptides with aromatic structure can be important precursors of halodipeptides and hpans huang et al 2017 2018a 2019a bib huang et al 2018a bib huang et al 2017 bib huang et al 2019a ma et al 2016 it is worth noting that chlorine atoms are preferably substituted on the amine group while iodine and bromine atoms are generally substituted on the aromatic ring of aromatic dipeptides huang et al 2019a this phenomenon may be explained by the hard soft acid base theory nh2cl with hard acid characteristic is more readily to be substituted on the hard base amine group contrarily hoi which is soft acid is preferentially substituted on soft base aromatic group huang et al 2019a some heterocyclic compounds e g tetrapyrroles consist important part of dissolved organic nitrogen don which may react with disinfectant and form heterocyclic dbps such as halopyrroles bond et al 2011 yang and zhang 2014 some anthropogenic contaminants from efom such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and industrial chemicals may also contribute to aromatic dbps formation the removal efficiencies of contaminants with different structures and properties are various some of them could pass through the wastewater treatment plants and occur in the aquatic environment luo et al 2014 even though those anthropogenic contaminants occur at ng l level their chlorinated products can t be neglected whose toxicity effect are even higher than parent compound fan et al 2013 for example the estrogenic activity of 3 3 dichlorobpa is 38 times higher than bisphenol a fukazawa et al 2002 the structures of aromatic dbps from anthropogenic contaminants largely depend on their parent contaminants chlorination of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate a commonly used industrial and domestic detergents will produce halododecylbenzenesulfonic acids gong et al 2016b methylphenols dimethylphenol or other shortchain alkyl phenols in hydraulic fracturing wastewater also serve as precursors for aromatic dbps halomethylphenols and halodimethylphenols dbps liberatore et al 2017 n nitrosodiphenylamine also shows great similarity with its key precursor diphenylamine zhou et al 2009 during chlorination dom with high mw converts into halogenated aromatic dbps by direct pathways or indirect pathways in the indirect pathway the dom is attacked by chlorine and produces nonhalogenated aromatic dbps such as salicylic acid as important intermediates which further transform into halogenated aromatic dbps by electrophilic substitution in the direct pathways chlorine first substitutes into the phenolic moieties in dom and the subsequent cleavage of the formed chloro phenolic moieties in dom will generate halogenated aromatic dbps during which nonhalogenated aromatic dbps are not formed jiang et al 2020 according to jiang et al 2020 both direct and indirect pathways play important roles in halogenated aromatic dbps formation and up to 84 and 22 of monochlorinated and dichlorinated aromatic dbps are formed from the indirect pathways the nitrogen atoms in aromatic dbps may originate from dom or inorganic nitrogen as is mentioned before organic compound with aromatic structure and nitrogen atoms such as peptides and pyrroles can react with disinfectant to form aromatic n dbps meanwhile halopyrroles and halopyrimidines may also be produced during chloramination of resorcinol and the nitrogen atoms in chloramine can incorporate into the resorcinol by ring cleavage reaction and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution nihemaiti et al 2017 besides the electrophilic substitution of chloramine might occur in the ortho or para position of the hydroxyl group in phenyl during which chloramine serves as nitrogen source gong et al 2017 4 2 transformation among aromatic dbps transformation among dbps may occur in the presence of disinfectants heat or solar irradiation and the transformation among aromatic dbps will strongly affect the toxicity of the water liu et al 2017 2019 bib liu et al 2017 bib liu et al 2019 pan et al 2014 transformation pathways of aromatic dbps can be speculated by analyzing the products and intermediate products the proposed pathways can also be further confirmed by chlor am ination intermediate products for example to verify the proposed transformation pathways of 4 iodophenol gong et al 2017 further chloraminated proposed intermediate products 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 iodo 4 aminophenol and detected similar products the transformation pathways of aromatic dbps depend on the molecular structure however the transformation among phenyl dbps can be divided into three main types 1 electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution 2 redox reaction and 3 decarboxylation the most common transformation of phenyl dbps with disinfectants is electrophilic substitution while nucleophilic substitution generally occurs with solar irradiation liu et al 2017 2019 bib liu et al 2017 bib liu et al 2019 due to different electrophilicity the substitution order on the phenyl structure is i br cl gong et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 the ortho and para position are more active to electrophilic substitution on account of the electron donating effect of hydroxyl group and aldehyde group gong et al 2017 pan et al 2016b except halogen atoms other electrophilic groups e g thms will also substitute hydrogen atoms on phenyl structure pan et al 2017 the order of nucleophilic substitution is similar to that of electrophilic substitution which can be explained by increased stability of transformation products liu et al 2017 phenyl dbps may also undergo hydrolysis during which oh acts as a nucleophile gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016b zhai and zhang 2011 besides i on phenyl may be substituted by nh2 from nh2cl through nucleophilic substitution which will result in aminophenols formation gong et al 2017 some phenyl dbps contain several substitution positions the electrophilic substitution on amino group or peptide bond will produce n chloramines which may be responsible for chlorinous odors in water the α hydrogen atom of some functional groups including amino group aldehyde group and nitrile group is also active for electrophilic substitution chu et al 2012 2015 bib chu et al 2012 bib chu et al 2015 what s more the electrophilic substitution on the α hydrogen atom may result in the rupture of the side chain and aliphatic dbps formation chu et al 2012 2015 bib chu et al 2012 bib chu et al 2015 decarboxylation is the most common transformation when phenyl dbps with carboxyl group are heated pan et al 2014 decarboxylation of n halogenated amino acids is also an important step for phenylacetonitrile and hans formation which doesn t require heat chu et al 2015 ma et al 2016 besides the carboxyl groups may be attacked by hox during which carboxyl group is replaced by halogen atoms huang et al 2018b pan et al 2016b for instance 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid may convert to 2 4 6 tribromophenol after being attacked by hobr huang et al 2018b as disinfectants are strong oxidants phenyl dbps with reductive group are readily to be oxidized haloaminophenols products of nucleophilic substitution may be oxidized by chloramine and produce halonitrosophenol halonitrosophenol can be further oxidized to hnps gong et al 2017 the chx2 group on phenyl can be oxidized to be aldehyde group pan et al 2017 which can be further oxidized to carboxyl group huang et al 2018b except transformation among phenyl dbps phenyl dbps may transform into heterocyclic dbps during chloramination the phenyl dbps are converted to halobenzoquinones firstly further hydrolysis and chloramine arrack could transform halobenzoquinones into halopyrroles and halopyridines nihemaiti et al 2017 halofuranones are also produced during chlorination of orcinol tretyakova et al 1994 4 3 decomposition of aromatic dbps previous researches have proved that phenyl dbps could decompose into small aliphatic dbps such as haas thms and hans while researches on heterocyclic dbps decomposition are limited the formation of aliphatic dbps from aromatic dbps including two pathways 1 ring opening and 2 cleavage of the side chain some intermediates of aromatic dbps decomposition may show high toxicity which makes the decomposition pathways draw much attention besides further understanding of the decomposition pathways of aromatic dbps is an important step to reveal the formation process of some aliphatic dbps halobenzoquinones including halo 1 4 benzoquinone and halo 1 2 benzoquinone are important intermediate products of phenyl dbps decomposition zhao et al 2012 cho cells bioassays show that halobenzoquinones were 1000 times more cytotoxic than some regulated dbps such as thms and haas li et al 2015 the mechanisms of halobenzoquinones formation are different when different disinfectants are applied phenol firstly undergo electrophilic substitution to from trihalophenyls which further react with bromine or chlorine to form halobenzoquinones through an ion radical oxidation mechanism when chlorine or chloramine are applied heasley et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 according to criquet et al 2015 most hypohalous acids was consumed by phenolic compounds oxidation during chlorination and only 30 incorporated into dom by electrophilic aromatic substitution besides the percentage of hypohalous acids incorporated into phenolic compounds depends on the position of functional group and the possibility of quinone formation when ozone and chloramine are used dihydrobenzoquinone rather than trihalophenyl are most important intermediates zhao et al 2012 halobenzoquinones are unstable and easily transform to halohydroxybenzoquinones with higher stability especially under alkaline conditions or uv irradiation wang et al 2014 during phototransformation some aromatic dbps such as halogenated 1 2 4 benzenetriols may be important intermediate products qian et al 2013 wang et al 2016 with the increase of halogen atoms and hydroxyl substation halohydroxybenzoquinones are readily to decompose into halocyclopentene 1 3 dione huang et al 2018b pan et al 2016b yang et al 2019a zhai et al 2014 the predicted toxicity of halocyclopentene 1 3 dione is even 106 and 103 times higher than regulated bromoform and unregulated halobenzoquinone respectively yang et al 2019a halocyclopentene 1 3 dione will further decompose with increasing chlorine contract time pan et al 2016b however the decomposition pathways of halocyclopentene 1 3 dione haven t been studied thoroughly another important degradation pathways of halohydroxybenzoquinones are ring open reactions aliphatic aldehydes such as 2 butene 1 4 dial and its chlorinated analogue which can be further oxidized to aliphatic halocarboxylic acids such as maleic acid are common ring cleavage products of chlorine attack hu et al 2018b huang et al 2018b prasse et al 2020 yang et al 2019a halogenated amides may also be formed when chloramine is used chuang et al 2015 further chlorination of aliphatic halocarboxylic acids will produce hals thms and haas chuang et al 2015 hu et al 2018b degradation of halogenated amides such as 2 2 3 5 6 6 hexachloro hexanamide 5 ene 4 one will also from hams chuang et al 2015 le roux et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 the formation of thms and haas from aromatic dbps depends on several factors including molecular structure of aromatic dbps ph and disinfectant dosage the halogen atoms in thms may originate from the phenyl dbps or disinfectant hu et al 2019 thus chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol may produce iodinated thms and haas some of which are even more cytotoxic than aromatic dbps hu et al 2018b aside from ring opening pathways hals and hans can also be produced by the cleavage of the side chain chu et al 2012 chu et al 2015 proposed that further chlorination of n n dichloro tyrosine a chlorination product of tyrosine could result in alanine side chain cleavage and dichloroacetonitrile formation which can hydrolyze to hams as for heterocyclic dbps halopyrroles may be attacked by chloramine to form hams and hals nihemaiti et al 2017 further studies on the degradation of heterocyclic dbps should be made as both heterocyclic dbps and their degradation products show higher toxicity than regulated dbps such as thms and haas 5 control strategies of aromatic dbps as discussed before aromatic dbps are important intermediate products of dom chlorination controlling aromatic dbps not only reduces the health risk induced by aromatic dbps but also is of great help to control aliphatic dbps the control of aromatic dbps toxicity mainly includes four pathways 1 open the cyclic structure of aromatic dbps or precursors 2 remove cyclic structure from water by physical or chemical process 3 transform aromatic dbps into form with lower toxicity and 4 optimize disinfection process the first two pathways mainly focus on removing precursors before disinfection while pathway 3 and 4 focus on aromatic dbps that already exist and the disinfection process respectively those four pathways may co occur when aromatic dbps control strategies are applied 5 1 destroying cyclic structure the cyclic structure in precursors can be destroyed by oxidants such as ozone or radicals when pre oxidation is applied researchers should comprehensively evaluate the variation of toxicity as the cleavage of the cyclic structure may produce more aliphatic dbps efficient radial could simultaneously reduce the formation of aromatic dbps and small aliphatic dbps however when insufficient radicals are used radicals may activate dom to form more aromatic dbps lu et al 2016 ozone is a selective oxidant which primarily reacts with electron rich phenolic and hydroquinone moieties in the dom wenk et al 2013 ozonation can significantly reduce the formation of 23 phenyl dbps and the removal efficiency increases with increasing ozone dose and hydraulic retention time huang et al 2018b however ozonation of water with halogen ions should be cautious halogen ions in water could be activated by residual ozone and result in halogenation of aromatic compounds in water such as mono and dimethylbipyrrole kumar et al 2017 in general optimization of pre oxidation may be difficult due to the complexity of water matrix which makes it less feasible in practical application thus pre oxidation processes combined with other treatments such as biological activated carbon bac are recommended which can remove transformation products and take advantage of multiple barriers 5 2 removing cyclic structure the most common methods to remove cyclic structures from water are activated carbon adsorption and coagulation removing cyclic structure seems to be promising control strategies because not only aromatic dbps but also their decomposition products can be simultaneously controlled phenyl dbps are preferentially removed by activated carbon than aliphatic dbps due to their higher partition coefficient and partition coefficient jiang et al 2018 pre oxidation including chlorination and ozonation before activated carbon adsorption will reduce the size exclusion effect increase the phenyl remove efficiency and prolong saturate time huang et al 2018b jiang et al 2017a even though o3 bac process may increase the concentration of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol several other phenyl dbps become undetectable and the overall cytotoxicity is largely decreased zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that when ozone is used both phenyl structure cleavage and reduced size exclusion effect are responsible for decreased formation of aromatic dbps huang et al 2018b as hydrophobic part of dom shows higher aromaticity preferential removal of hydrophobic part by coagulation may result in reduced aromatic dbps formation zhao et al 2013 what s more humic substances which show high aromaticity are also readily removed by coagulation diemert et al 2013 compared to conventional coagulation enhanced coagulation produces less polar phenyl dbps especially those with chlorine atoms xiao et al 2010 with the increase of alum dose the halofuranones and mucochloric acid formed during subsequent chlorination also decrease which may lead to decrease of the overall genotoxicity zheng et al 2015 the types of coagulants will also affect aromatic dbps formation ferric chloride may oxidize iodide to form iodinated coagulation byproducts i cbps such as diiodoresorcinols which makes alum salts more appropriate for drinking water coagulation ding et al 2019 xiao et al 2010 also demonstrated coagulation with ferric salts would produce more polar dbps compared to alum slats even though coagulation could remove large part of dom not all aromatic dbps are effectively reduced some new polar aromatic dbps with bromine atoms are formed after coagulation which may be explained by increased bromide doc ration xiao et al 2010 removing cyclic structure before disinfection not only is of help to the control of aromatic dbps but also reduce aliphatic dbps since aromatic dbps are important intermediates there are also other water treatment process including sand or membrane filtration that may be able to remove aromatic dbps precursors the efficiency of which needs further study however activated carbon and membrane filtration may not be suitable for water with high bromide due to increased bromide doc ration after pre treatment some modification on activated carbon or membrane characteristic may alleviate those problems 5 3 detoxifying by transformation aromatic dbps will undergo transformation with heat or solar irradiation boiling water before drinking could significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of the tap water pan et al 2014 demonstrated that with boiling for 5 min the cytotoxicity index of simulated tap water decreased from 13 5 to 3 1 due to dehalogenation and decarboxylation most phenyl dbps are decreased and only a few stable phenyl dbps are accumulated which may contribute to the detoxification of water when effluent from wastewater treatment plants goes into aquatic environment solar irradiation could induce photoconversion of aromatic dbps with the increase of the light exposure the overall toxicity of chlorinated saline primary effluent is distinctly decreased liu et al 2017 however the overall toxicity of aromatic dbps solution first increases and then decreases when the light exposure time increases liu et al 2019 this can be explained by the formation of halo hydro quinones with high toxicity which have been proved by pis therefore when solar irradiation is applied to detoxify water the irradiation dose must be enough to destroy halo hydro quinones uv irradiation have been proved to be able degrade most aliphatic dbps and halobenzoquinones which will reduce overall toxicity huang et al 2019b qian et al 2013 uv irradiation may also be used in aromatic dbps control after optimization 5 4 optimizing disinfection process disinfectant types contact time and disinfectant dosage significantly affect the concentration of aromatic dbps thus aromatic dbps control can be achieved by optimizing disinfection process compared with chloramination chlorination possesses higher oxidative capacity and reacts much faster with dom zhai et al 2014 therefore chlorination produces more chlorinated aromatic dbps pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the effect of disinfectant on brominated aromatic dbps depends on the disinfectant condition when chlor am ine dosage is much higher than bromide concentration brominated aromatic dbps formed during chlorination may be lower than that of chloramination because excess chlorine could oxidize bromide into bromate and less bromide is available to form brominated aromatic dbps pan et al 2017 however when bromide concentration is similar to chlor am ine dosage more brominated aromatic dbps may be generated during chlorination due to relatively slow reactions among nh2cl bromide and dom zhai et al 2014 iodide can only be oxidized to hypoiodous acid which are hard be further oxidized to iodate by chloramine thus more iodinated aromatic dbps are formed during chloramination pan et al 2016a 2016c 2017 bib pan et al 2016a bib pan et al 2017 bib pan et al 2016c therefore when raw water contains high level of iodide chlorine is recommended while chloramine is more suitable for water with little bromide and iodide chloramine is mile enough to allow aromatic dbps accumulate pan et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 contrarily chlorine would promote aromatic dbps decomposition thus the concentration of aromatic dbps first increases than decreases during chlorination pan et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 zhai et al 2014 this may also explain the higher aliphatic dbps concentration in chlorinated water the variation of overall toxicity with different contract time or cumulative disinfectant concentration over time ct should be systemically evaluated considering more halogen atoms are provided when increasing disinfectant dosage it s no wonder that the concentration of aromatic dbps increases with disinfectant dosage pan et al 2016c xiao et al 2010 under the premise of microbiological safety high dosage of disinfectants should be avoided when choosing control strategies of aromatic dbps several factors including economy control efficiency characteristic of raw water and potential adverse effect should be considered optimizing coagulation and disinfection process boiling before drinking have the advantage of low cost as no extra treatment facility is needed however the control efficiency of optimizing coagulation and disinfection process needs to be further improved although pre oxidation and activated carbon adsorption may be less economic they may show better aromatic dbps control efficiency when there is also need of decolorization or odor control pre oxidation and activated carbon adsorption may be applied as multifunctional treatment process while they may not be recommended for water with low suva254 or high level of bromide or iodide furthermore combination of different aromatic dbps control strategies may be a noteworthy research direction in the future previous researches on dbps control generally focus on the aliphatic dbps such as thms haas hans or tox which may result in deviation when evaluating the efficiency of dbps control strategies tox may increase with increasing chlorination time while the overall toxicity shows insignificant change han and zhang 2018 when aromatic dbps are taken into account this phenomenon can be explained by decomposition of aromatic dbps which may be more toxic than their decomposition products thus when evaluating dbps control strategies the changes in both aliphatic dbps and aromatic dbps formation should be comprehensively analyzed to better reflect the overall toxicity 6 conclusions and future study with the help of developing analysis technology a new group of dbps aromatic dbps is detected and identified in drinking water waste water and swimming pool water from the foregoing review of published research aromatic dbps show relatively higher toxicity compare to aliphatic which makes them draw great attention among phenyl dbps hpans and hnps seem to be important toxicity driver considering their relatively high toxicity and high concentration different types of aromatic dbps may be produced during chlorination of humic and fulvic acids human waste in effluent organic matter efom and exudates or metabolites from aquatic organism when residual disinfectants exist aromatic dbps may transform to halo hydroxy benzoquinones and decompose into aliphatic dbps including thms hans hams step by step which may also cause adverse health effect thus several strategies such as peroxidation adsorption and coagulation have been proposed to control aromatic dbps reduce overall toxicity efficiently to gain a deeper perception of dbp formation process and achieve better toxicity control several important themes on aromatic dbps need further research in future work formation of important aromatic dbps may be predicable aromaticity of dom may be reflected by suva fluorescence or other water parameters that can be easily detected the relationship between those water parameters and aromatic dbps formation could be further explored to predict dbps concentration and overall toxicity of disinfected water aromatic dbps may be another important criterion to evaluate dbps control strategies most published researches focus on aliphatic dbps which may not be the driver of overall toxicity some dbp control strategies that have been proved to be efficient for aliphatic dbps may be further evaluated by aromatic dbps understanding the variation of both aromatic dbps and aliphatic dbps during different process may provide a more comprehensive perception in dbps control strategies previous research on aromatic dbps mainly focus on phenyl dbps however the occurrence of heterocyclic dbps with higher toxicity deserves more attention it s suggested that the toxicity mechanism occurrence and transformation pathway of heterocyclic dbps should be further studied besides more emerging aromatic dbps with high toxicity may be identified by changing the analysis method there are disparities between the results of in vitro and in vivo toxicological bioassays the toxic mechanism of different results warrants further studied in addition previous researches on co existence of several types of dbps e g aromatic dbps aliphatic dbps and alicyclic dbps are rare it s recommend more systematic and comprehensive toxicological

17651,nitrous oxide n2o emitted from wastewater treatment plants has caused widespread concern over the past decade people have made tremendous efforts to discover the microorganisms responsible for n2o production elucidate metabolic pathways establish production models and formulate mitigation strategies the ultimate goal of all these efforts is to shed new light on how n2o is produced and how to reduce it and one of the best ways is to find key opportunities by integrating the information obtained this review article critically evaluates the knowledge gained in the field within a decade especially in n2o production microbiology biochemistry models and mitigation strategies with a focus on denitrification previous research has greatly deepened the understanding of the n2o generation mechanism but further efforts are still needed due to the lack of standardized methodology for establishing n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems one of the challenges seems to be to convert the denitrification process from a net n2o source into an effective sink which is recommended as a key opportunity to reduce n2o production in this review graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment mitigation strategies denitrification 1 introduction biological nutrient removal processes have been widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide to achieve phosphorus and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater however a portion of nitrogen is converted into nitrous oxide n2o and is discharged from the open air treatment tank into the atmosphere lin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 n2o is a strong greenhouse gas ghg with a greenhouse effect 265 times stronger than carbon dioxide co2 and a global warming potential gwp100 of 298 which can cause positive radiative forcing and ozone destruction in the stratosphere and lead to acid rain and photochemical smog driscoll et al 2001 ipcc 2013 otte et al 2019 in recent decades n2o emissions from wwtps have steadily increased to 108 mtco2 equivalent accounting for 3 4 of the global n2o emissions budget ipcc 2015 consequently reducing n2o production in wastewater treatment has become a long standing research focus the major microorganisms that produce n2o during biological nitrogen removal are found to be ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdn desloover et al 2012 zaborowska et al 2019 a series of mathematical models from single path models e g model a to model f to multi path models e g asm2d n2o play an important role in describing the n2o production pathways and predicting n2o production in wwtps ni and yuan 2015 models based on mechanical processes have also been developed to integrate n2o production of different processes in the design operation and optimization of biological processes mannina et al 2016 domingo félez et al 2017 massara et al 2017 however the online integration of current models to reliably estimate the production of n2o remains a major challenge haimi et al 2013 mampaey et al 2019 to clarify the mechanism of n2o production and then accurately quantify the production of n2o the influencing factors of n2o production in biological nitrogen removal have been continuously explored in the past decade massara et al 2017 vasilaki et al 2018 unfortunately there are significant differences between the results obtained in different types of processes which brings a series of uncertainties to the prediction and reduction of n2o in practical applications for example the mechanism by which dissolved oxygen do inhibits n2o production varies greatly between nitrification denitrification n d and partial nitritation anammox pn a kampschreur et al 2008 castro barros et al 2015 over the past decade efforts to reduce n2o have focused on isolating n2o reducing microorganisms enhancing n2o reductase n2or activity replenishing carbon sources optimizing operating parameters and improving treatment processes chen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2017 the development of new n2o reducing microorganisms seems promising but no breakthrough has been achieved in the isolation and identification of strains and the biochemical knowledge of newly isolated microorganisms is far from sufficient moreover the uncertainty of n2o measurement under complex environmental conditions has not been clearly resolved which makes it difficult to establish a standardized methodology for n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems therefore none of the current strategies can guarantee the effective and stable reduction of n2o recent studies have shown that heterotrophic denitrification can effectively eliminate n2o chen et al 2019 conthe et al 2019 wan et al 2019 hdn s n2o reducing capacity is usually 2 10 times its n2o production capacity which shows great potential for reducing n2o conthe et al 2019 denitrification as an n2o sink can not only reduce n2o produced as an intermediate product of incomplete denitrification but also eliminate n2o produced by nh3 oxidation and abiotic pathways conthe et al 2019 these studies have evaluated hdn denitrification from various angles from gene sequencing to modeling analysis from laboratory scale to full scale applications and revealed the feasibility and superiority of hdn as an n2o scavenger in recent years several published reviews have discussed the production of n2o in wastewater treatment focusing mainly on the monitoring and quantification of n2o vasilaki et al 2019 production characteristics under different processes and configurations sabba et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 and mechanism analysis of enzyme activity and microbial community pauleta et al 2019 ren et al 2019 however no attempt has been made to fully evaluate the potential and possible applications of hdn denitrification as an n2o sink therefore the purpose of this article is to integrate recent advances in n2o production and mitigation and to propose strategies to enhance hdn denitrification as an effective n2o sink to this end this review focuses on the potential of hdn denitrification to solve the bottleneck of n2o reduction and critically assess the latest knowledge of microbiology biochemistry mathematical models influencing factors and mitigation strategies in the past decade the application of the source to sink strategy is also provided as an alternative method for reducing n2o in wwtps in the future 2 who produces n2o n2o is mainly produced by a series of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms of which aob and hdn play a vital role in the nitrogen cycle ren et al 2019 2 1 aob since the early 1980s aob are considered to be the main contributors to n2o stein 2019 aob are mainly composed of two monophyletic lines with distinct phylogeny β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria mills 2019 recently a series of new aob including nitrosococcus wardiae d1fhs nitrosomonas sp py1 and nitrosomonas sp np1 have been isolated from soil marine sediments and activated sludge stein 2019 indicating that aob play a dominant role in the nitrogen cycle in addition to aob nitrification can also be carried out by other nh3 oxidizers since the discovery of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa by könneke et al 2005 over 10 species of aoa have been isolated and more than 10 enrichments have been cultivated liu et al 2017 these species were classified as phylum thaumarchaeota muller et al 2010 in addition a bacterium capable of completely oxidizing nh4 to no3 comammox was also discovered daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 regarding the linkage between these nh3 oxidizers and n2o production plenty of aob have been shown to encode and express nitrite reductase nirk for aob and nitric oxide reductase norb for aob kozlowski et al 2016 this indicates that aob play a role in the nitrifier denitrification pathway to produce n2o see section 3 2 for details unlike aob aoa has been confirmed to be unable to perform nitrifier denitrification kits et al 2017 due to the strict lean nutritional lifestyle it is believed that n2o produced by comammox bacteria is very limited kits et al 2017 prosser et al 2020 therefore aob are the main n2o producers of all nh3 oxidizers it is essential to explore unique physiological characteristics of nitrosomonas due to its representative role in aob identification and isolation of new aob strains 2 2 hdn hdn are considered facultative chemoheterotrophs that use molecular o2 no3 or no2 as their electron acceptors to degrade the carbon sources and produce net energy to support prolific microbial growth mills 2019 the genera distributed in activated sludge include pseudomonas alcaligens rhodopseudomonas spirillum rhizobium neisseria etc among which alcaligens bacillus and pseudomonas constitute the majority of hdn gerardi 2006 hdn include n2 producing denitrifiers with complete set of denitrification enzymes and incomplete denitrifiers such as n2o pruducing denitrifiers lacking n2or holmes et al 2019 pseudomonas spp is the predominant heterotrophic bacteria involved in complete denitrification holmes et al 2019 however the key persistent genus of hdn in wwtps are reported to be dechloromonas and thauera fan et al 2017 denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos play a crucial role in several biological nutrient removal processes lin et al 2019 they can absorb the external carbon substrates into the cell and synthesize them as intracellular polymers e g polyhydroxyalkanoates and then use the intracellular polymers as electron donors and use no2 no3 as the final electron acceptor to complete denitrification li et al 2013 therefore dpaos can also be classified as hdn these indicate the need to pay attention to the dynamics of microbial communities in different processes generally heterotrophic denitrification occurs only under anoxic conditions because the molecular o2 can replace no3 no2 as the final electron acceptor however in recent years aerobic denitrification has gradually entered people s field of vision the main differences between heterotrophic aerobic denitrifying bacteria had and conventional hdn are as follows 1 the presence of oxygen will inhibit hdn reductase and affect gene expression resulting in incomplete denitrification papaspyrou et al 2014 2 had can breathe oxygen and nitrate simultaneously rajta et al 2019 since nitrification and denitrification in a single unit can save costs and require fewer chemical additives the development of had becomes promising overall most had are taxonomically located in the α β and γ subclasses of proteobacteria recently many researchers are dedicated to isolating had that can achieve both heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification giannopoulos et al 2017 jin et al 2019 for example a new strain of acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7t exhibited remarkable heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification ability at 2 c zheng et al 2018 besides halophilic bacillus strain n31 has been successfully used in marine sewage treatment huang et al 2017 since this had may coexist in aerobic regions it may compete with aob the main contributor to n2o therefore once had capable of heterotrophic nitrification dominates n2o production can be reduced from the source without affecting the nitrification performance the good news is that new strains with the potential to reduce n2o are constantly being discovered table 1 for example marinobacter sp nna5 and pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can significantly reduce n2o after biological enhancement in an activated sludge systems liu et al 2016 zheng 2019 zhu et al 2015 observed that the addition of pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can reduce n2o production by 40 88 under the condition of using corn flour as the carbon source interestingly when the carbon source is not limited p pantotrophus has excellent n2o reducing overcapacity and the potential for consuming n2o is 5 times that of producing n2o domingo félez and smets 2020 therefore as more and more hdn with excellent n2o reducing capacity are isolated and identified hdn will become one of the hotspots for future research 3 how do they produce n2o in conventional nitrification and denitrification processes n2o is produced through the metabolic pathways of aob and hdn including aob nitrification aob denitrification and hdn denitrification fig 1 meanwhile abiotic pathways may occur under certain circumstances 3 1 aob nitrification the aob nitrification pathway i e nh2oh oxidation refers to incomplete oxidation of nh2oh to no2 previous studies have shown that nh2oh and no2 are the two main precursors for the production of nitric oxide no and n2o schreiber et al 2012 nh3 is first oxidized to nh2oh by monooxygenase amo then nh2oh is catalyzed by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and generates nitroxyl hno as an intermediate hno reacts with another nh2oh molecule then dimerizes into hyponitrous acid h2n2o2 and finally chemically decomposes to form n2o yamazaki et al 2014 besides there is a bio abiotic coupling process that is considered to be the production pathway of n nitrosation hybrid n2o in which n2o is generated by the interaction of hno2 and nh2oh schreiber et al 2012 zhu barker et al 2015 duan et al 2017 therefore the n2o produced by aob nitrification cannot be ignored especially under the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions duan et al 2017 3 2 aob denitrification in recent years aob have been recognized as the main cause of n2o production ni and yuan 2015 su et al 2017 blum et al 2018 the aob denitrification pathway also known as autotrophic denitrification mainly occurs under oxygen limited or strictly anoxic conditions duan et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in aob denitrification there is electron competition between no2 and o2 especially when no2 accumulation occurs as a result n2o is produced with no2 as the terminal electron acceptor and no as the an intermediate and copper containing nirk and norb play a role the reason why aob denitrification has become the main way to produce n2o in biological n removal may be that aob does not have n2or which makes n2o the final product and aob become net n2o producers duan et al 2017 aob s contribution to n2o production is dynamic and always combined with other pathways peng et al 2015b which requires a more comprehensive analysis based on environmental conditions 3 3 hdn denitrification heterotrophic denitrification involves a series of consecutive steps in which no2 or no3 is reduced to n2 via two mandatory intermediates no and n2o these stepwise reactions are catalyzed by four different enzymes namely no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir for hdn no reductase nor for hdn and n2or which are regulated by genes narg nirk nirs nosz i and nosz ii vieira et al 2019 incomplete reduction of n2o to n2 will result in n2o accumulation thereby reducing the proportion of electrons allocated to n2o reductase pan et al 2013a surprisingly the newly isolated nna5 strain can use no3 or no2 as a nitrogen source for growth and convert it to n2 without producing any n2o which is significantly different from other had liu et al 2016 since the reduction of n2o is closely related to the periplasmic n2or of hdn where the nosz gene plays a crucial role ji et al 2015 so it can be speculated that the ratio of nirk to nosz of this strain nna5 may be low vieira et al 2019 this provides a crucial basis for further revealing the genetic potential of hdn to reduce n2o 3 4 abiotic pathways in addition to biological pathways abiotic pathways also exist in certain circumstances for instance nh2oh can be oxidized by o2 to form n2o nh2oh 0 5o2 0 5n2o 1 5h2o besides nh2oh can react spontaneously with nitrous acid hno2 to generate n2o nh2oh hno2 n2o 2h2o soler jofra et al 2016 this abiotic pathway contributes considerable n2o production in several advanced n removal processes e g single reactor high activity ammonia removal over nitrite sharon in which nitrification stops at the no2 stage and provides the required precursors of the above reaction soler jofra et al 2016 in addition chemical reactions between redox active metals iron and manganese organics humic and fulvic acids and nitrogen cycle intermediates under relevant environmental conditions may produce n2o zhu barker et al 2015 for example nh2oh can be oxidized by fe ⅲ or mn iv to further produce n2o which is more pronounced in soil than in wwtps although abiotic pathways mainly include chemical reactions and only account for a small part of the total n2o production in wwtps they are likely to be enhanced in wastewater containing heavy metals and should be considered carefully harper et al 2015 zhu barker et al 2015 3 5 limitation of biochemical studies microbiology studies using molecular methods have been carried out for decades which has deepened our understanding of the biochemical pathways that produce n2o during the n removal process even so the knowledge gap about microbial diversity still exists at present the classification of isolated microorganisms needs to be continuously improved and its metabolic pathways have yet to be studied for example anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria play a vital role in the n removal process but a detailed mechanism on how to produce n2o has not been established ali et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to explore their genetic and physiological characteristics in addition had produce more n2o than n2 liu et al 2016 new had strains that produce less n2o and achieve excellent denitrification performance are worthy exploring as the only n2o consuming bacteria hdn denitrification can serve as a sink for n2o produced by aob and hdn therefore the isolation identification and in depth analysis of heterotrophic denitrification pathway of hdn with high n2o reducing capacity are of great significance in short firmly grasping the metabolic pathways of aob and hdn and figuring out exactly how they produce n2o is critical to reducing n2o where mathematical modeling plays a vital role 4 mathematical models of n2o production activated sludge models asms have been widely used to predict the treatment performance of wwtps of which asm1 asm2 asm2d and asm3 are the mainstream massara et al 2017 in this section the models describing n2o production pathways are discussed as the n2o models of aob and hdn and their integrated models respectively 4 1 n2o models of aob ni and yuan 2015 described a series of n2o models of aob including four single path models involving aob denitrification ni et al 2011 mampaey et al 2013 pocquet et al 2013 guo and vanrolleghem 2014 two single path models involving nh2oh oxidation law et al 2012a ni et al 2013 and two two path models that include both aob denitrification and nh2oh oxidation ni et al 2014 peng et al 2015a the dependence on operating conditions limits the application of single path models for example the single path models involving aob denitrification are suitable for high no2 conditions while low no2 and high do conditions are favorable for nh2oh oxidation ni and yuan 2015 the relative applicability of the two path models to dynamic conditions makes it widely used in recent years ding et al 2018 table s1 lists three common two path models pocquet et al 2016 ding et al 2017 mampaey et al 2019 pocquet et al 2016 proposed a two path model that did not consider the inhibitory effect of free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna on aob growth but still obtained a good fit with no n2o and n2o emission factors this indicates that the inhibition items of fa and fna are not necessary to predict n2o production unless at high nh4 influent concentration subsequently this model was modified with ph regulation k p h k p h 1 10 p h o p t p h and oxygen inhibition k i o a o b s o 2 k i o a o b items to evaluate the n2o contribution of three n2o production pathways including aob denitrification nh2oh oxidation and hdn denitrification table s2 mampaey et al 2019 the results showed that the residual no2 and nh2oh in the aerobic stage induced the aob denitrification that occurred during anoxic stage mampaey et al 2019 therefore nh2oh should be regarded as a state variable even during the anoxic stage besides it seems feasible to simplify the model by removing the state variable of no in nitrification by combining reactions to avoid no loops ding et al 2017 in short the models can be fine tuned according to the specific environment the key issues regarding model selection still needs to be solved i e the scope of application has not yet been standardized 4 2 n2o models of hdn previous studies have proposed heterotrophic denitrification models including activated sludge model for nitrogen asmn and activated sludge model with indirect coupling of electrons ams ice hiatt and grady 2008 pan et al 2013b the latter is based on electron competition in denitrification systems pan et al 2018 electron competition between successive steps is the key to studying heterotrophic denitrification domingo félez and smets 2020 modeled denitrification as a circuit describing electron transfer when carbon source are insufficient microorganisms utilize intracellular polymers x s t o x h x s t o x h k s t o and electron competition occurs in denitrification ding et al 2017 the above models are based on four step denitrification as shown in table s1 the four step denitrification models contain all known intermediates including no2 no and n2o taking into account the toxic effects of no the inhibitory terms of no ki no h were added to the kinetic rate expression table s2 mampaey et al 2019 however considerable measurement data indicate that the accumulation of no hardly occurs in the anoxic stage and the concentration of no is negligible pavissich et al 2012 mampaey et al 2019 therefore it is feasible to simplify four step denitrification into three step denitrification by setting no2 to be reduced to n2o in one step wisniewski et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the combination of reaction processes is the main difference between the four step denitrification and the three step denitrification models table s1 presents two three step denitrification models the model proposed by pavissich et al 2012 only considered the reduction of no2 and no and excluded the toxicity consideration of no wisniewski et al 2018 applied three step denitrification to asm2d and considered the switch function of no2 k n o 2 h 1 k n o 2 h 1 s n o 2 reflecting the inhibitory effect of no2 on denitrification this extended asm2d not only had excellent n2o predictive ability but also fitted the effluent concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod and po4 well r2 0 9 wisniewski et al 2018 generally the process operations require alternating environments e g aerobic anoxic and anaerobic which complicates n2o production pathways and makes separate models of aob or hdn no longer applicable vasilaki et al 2018 domingo félez and smets 2020 therefore an integrated model involving aob and hdn pathways is desirable 4 3 integrated models combining known n2o production pathways to establish integrated n2o models can provide a more comprehensive insights into n2o production and flux variation in full scale wwtps ni and yuan 2015 domingo félez and smets 2016 proposed a new model called ndha nitrifier nitrification nitrifier denitrification heterotrophic denitrification and abiotic reaction which can predict the no and n2o dynamics under various operating conditions and can be calibrated by existing breath measurements domingo félez et al 2017 based on asms an extended asm2d type model was proposed as the asm2d n2o model which includes n2o production pathways n2o stripping and biological nutrient removal massara et al 2018 this model can be used to determine the optimal aeration strategy by simulating n2o production under different do conditions massara et al 2018 meantime the asm1 expansion model with the above three n2o production pathways can distinguish the main pathways and show good predictions under dynamic conditions lu et al 2018 note that excellent models do not necessarily include all n2o production pathways to avoid over parameterization cosenza et al 2013 hence to determine the main n2o production pathways under different conditions has become a research hotspot for example an integrated model including four n2o production pathways e g aob denitrification nh2oh oxygen heterotrophic denitrification and pao denitrification showed that the main pathways for n2o production were aob denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in an anaerobic oxygen limited aerobic process li et al 2020 in fact although the current models can predict the trend of n2o production well the numerical simulation is not accurate mannina et al 2018b mampaey et al 2019 on the one hand it may be that the biochemical pathways for n2o production are not comprehensive on the other hand it may also be due to the models being partially simplified to ensure practical application and avoid over parameterization therefore the current models are more suitable for qualitative analysis and it is still a challenge to improve their quantitative prediction capabilities mampaey et al 2019 since aob is a net n2o producer and hdn is both a producer and a scavenger it is necessary to combine the known microbiological and biochemical knowledge of aob and hdn with n2o modeling at present most of the research is focused on optimizing parameters and simulating production pathways without discussing in depth the potential of denitrification as an n2o sink which is another promising direction for n2o modeling in the future 5 what factors affect n2o production the substrate do fna and other factors in the n removal process will indirectly affect the production of n2o by inhibiting the activity of microorganisms or enzymes to better understand the production pathways of n2o and achieve mitigation the latest knowledge of the impact mechanism is evaluated in this chapter and some surveys are shown in fig 3 5 1 substrate the c n ratio is considered a limiting factor especially for heterotrophic denitrification processes because a low c n ratio usually indicates insufficient substrate zhang et al 2016b li et al 2017 spinelli et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 c a c n ratio of less than 3 results in a significant increase in n2o production the lack of substrate will lead to incomplete denitrification which may be due to the weaker competitiveness of n2or for electrons than other reductases chen et al 2020a in addition the low c n ratio of 5 in the n removal system was also found to increase ph and fa and eventually promote n2o production due to its inhibitory effect on autotrophic biomass mannina et al 2017a it has reported that the lowest n2o flux and the highest n removal rate can be achieved at a c n ratio of 12 1 li et al 2017 nevertheless it was also found that as the c n ratio increases the time to complete denitrification and the maximum accumulation of no2 increase with 1 5 being the optimal c n ratio for reducing n2o krishna mohan et al 2016 therefore the response of n2o production to the change of c n ratio remains to be elucidated in addition the substrate composition also has an important effect on heterotrophic denitrification butler et al 2009 lu and chandran 2010 zhang et al 2016a studies have shown that in wastewater treatment systems denitrifying bacteria prefer to use volatile fatty acids rather than organic complex molecules as substrates elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 methanol is one of the six best substrates for complete denitrification and n2o mitigation lee et al 2019 besides it was found that the substrate may affect the microbial community structure acetate feed was rich in dechloromonas and rubrivivax genus while methanol fed was rich in methylotenera song et al 2015 meanwhile it can be seen from table 1 that denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can not only adapt to different types of carbon sources but also regulate the production of n2o as the of c n ratio changes zheng et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 therefore sufficient carbon substrate and appropriate c n ratio must be provided to ensure heterotrophic denitrification and thus reduce the production of n2o since hdn are the only n2o scavengers only fewer n2o by products and more n2o reduction to n2 can make heterotrophic denitrification an effective sink for n2o 5 2 do aob s strong affinity for o2 allows it to grow under low do conditions which aggravates the accumulation of no2 soliman and eldyasti 2016 zhou et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 a the highest n2o emission factor in the batch test appears in the lowest do level of 0 35 mg l similarly chen et al 2020 detected a maximum emission factor of 4 32 at a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l n2o production is closely related to the do concentration and can be stimulated by the aob denitrification pathway under oxygen limited conditions do 0 5 mg l where aob use no2 as a terminal electron acceptor to save o2 for nh3 oxidation to nh2oh xie et al 2012 lv et al 2016 in addition do also contributes to the metabolism of microorganisms for example high do 2 mg l accelerates the nitrification process while increasing the formation of soluble microbial products that can be used for hdn n2o scavenger growth ni et al 2011 xie et al 2012 however n2o production in full scale wwtps increases with aeration due to gas striping especially in anoxic regions where dissolved n2o accumulates kampschreur et al 2008 castro barros et al 2015 as far as heterotrophic denitrification is concerned the activity of n2or will be inhibited under high levels of do because n2or is more sensitive to o2 than other reductases which leads to the failure of n2o to n2 wunderlin et al 2012 therefore do aeration is an important factor to control n2o production especially in the nitrification process law et al 2012b castro barros et al 2015 moreover the transition from a transient hypoxic state to an aerobic state can trigger aob to produce n2o due to the imbalance of two step nitritation metabolism and the simultaneous accumulation of nh2oh yu et al 2010 pijuan et al 2014 caranto et al 2016 the formation of anoxic n2o may be an important source of n2o production especially in sequencing batch reactors sbrs considering the concentration gradient of o2 in sedimentation anoxia is expected to appear inside the sludge aggregates and a series of n2o production pathways will occur under oxygen limited conditions rodriguez caballero and pijuan 2013 mampaey et al 2016 since the aerobic stage in most wastewater treatment systems is the main source of n2o production a higher do concentration 2 3 mg l and a moderate aeration rate may help reduce n2o considering the rejection of oxygen by hdn denitrification the alternation between aerobic and anoxic phases may require a transtition strategy such as setting the aerobic stage to gradually reduce do from a high level 2 3 mg l to a low level 0 5 mg l 5 3 no2 fna it is believed that the accumulation of no2 usually induces the production of n2o as shown in fig 3 a ali et al 2014 du et al 2016 castellano hinojosa et al 2018 yan et al 2019 under aerobic conditions high no2 concentrations 1 50 mg l and low do levels 1 mg l are the driving forces of nitrite dependent n2o production pathways i e aob denitrification law et al 2013 ni and yuan 2015 genetically increased no2 promotes nirk expression which is directly regulated by nitrite sensitive repressors peng et al 2015b nevertheless as shown in fig 3 b an inhibitory effect on n2o production was also observed at higher no2 concentrations 50 1000 mg n l law et al 2013 ni et al 2014 which indicated that extremely high no2 concentrations were also conducive to the control of n2o production despite the defect in the process operation in addition under anoxic conditions the denitrification rate will also decrease with the accumulation of no2 which eventually leads to n2o production kampschreur et al 2009 under certain ph and temperature conditions part of no2 will be converted into fna fna and fa can inhibit the growth of nob which is conducive to the proliferation of aob thereby causing no2 accumulation and n2o production jiang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a it has been reported that fna can inhibit microorganisms in wwtps such as nitrifiers denitrifiers and anammox bacteria zhou et al 2011 and can inhibit the activity of n2or once no2 is used as an electron acceptor zhao et al 2019 for example even fna levels as low as 0 1 0 2 mg n l can inhibit the electron transfer of microorganisms wang et al 2018 however fna pretreatment can change the threshold of no2 stimulated n2o production in domestic strength nitrifying cultures and enzymes and microbial communities were also affected wang et al 2016a this shows that fna can also be used for n2o mitigation in nitritation systems in short it is feasible to keep the concentration of no2 as low as possible to avoid the cytotoxic effect of fna on microorganisms and thus minimize the production of n2o 5 4 others in microbiology and chemistry ph not only affects the activity of aob nob and related enzymes but also affects the form of nitrogen in water the activity of denitrifying reductase in the anoxic stage and the nh4 oxidation rate in the aerobic stage are closely related to ph the production of n2o is related to the change of ph and the maximum yield occurs between ph 5 0 and 6 0 du et al 2016 lee et al 2019 pan et al 2012 conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of ph 6 0 to 9 0 on n2o production and found that n2o accumulated substantially at ph 6 0 then significantly decreased at ph 6 5 and did not accumulate at ph 7 0 to 9 0 low ph conditions not only inhibit relative enzyme activity by enhancing electron competition between reductases but also affect the metabolic rate of carbon substrates pan et al 2012 some specific denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas denitrificans g1 and pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can affect the expression of denitrifying genes at alkaline ph 7 0 9 0 thereby reducing n2o production table 1 chen et al 2020c chen et al 2020a zheng et al 2019 however there are also studies showing that increasing ph will promote the rate of n2o production in aob enriched cultures which may be due to increased nh4 oxidation law et al 2011 the highest production of n2o occured at ph 8 0 while the lowest production was between ph 6 0 to 7 0 law et al 2011 similarly the net n2o production increased 7 times once the ph was raised from 6 5 to 8 0 su et al 2019 considering that the effect of ph on n2o production is still controversial maintaining relatively neutral ph conditions in wwtps may be more favorable for reducing n2o temperature mainly affects n2o production through chemical equilibrium enzyme activity and solubility reino et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 first the temperature disturbance will cause an imbalance between the oxidation reaction of nh4 and no2 second as shown in fig 2 d a temperature of 25 c resulted in the lowest nirk nirs nosz value indicating that n2or may be enhanced and thus the n2o accumulation rate decreased third it was found that the solubility of n2o in the denitrification stage will decrease in the temperature range of 25 30 c and it becomes a potential source of n2o once aeration begins as the temperature rose from 25 to 35 c n2o was released due to higher n2o production rate and lower n2o solubility poh et al 2015 generally the temperature suitable for activated sludge and functional enzyme activity is 15 25 c in summary the temperature should be maintained in the range of 20 25 c to achieve both n2o minimization and reactor stability previous studies have shown that n2o production mainly occurs in the aerobic phase and the emission factor decreases with the shortening of srt in n removal processes kampschreur et al 2009 li and wu 2014 mannina et al 2018a in the short srt system nob with a long generation time is eliminated while aob with a short generation time is retained resulting in no2 accumulation and an increase in n2o production for example mannina et al 2017b found that increasing the srt in the integrated fixed film activated sludge membrane bioreactor from 15 to 30 days reduced the n2o emission factor from 0 76 to 0 21 the n2o emission factor of the 25 day srt is lower than that of the 15 day srt zhou et al 2019 meantime as shown in fig 2 e nitrospira a genus of comammox that can effectively prevent the accumulation of no2 was found in the 25 day srt oxidation ditch zhou et al 2019 therefore a relatively long srt is beneficial to reduce n2o under the premise of the stable reactor operation all the above parameters directly or indirectly affect the production of n2o insufficient carbon substrate will hinder the n2o consumption pathway of hdn denitrification by inducing electron competition between reductases abnormal temperature and ph environment inhibit the activity of related key enzymes limited oxygen and high fna nitrite conditions trigger aob denitrification thus increasing the load of hdn as an n2o sink since the mechanism of n2o production is interrelated it is impractical to extract n2o under each condition multivariate analysis should be used to explore the comprehensive impact of online monitoring campaigns and process variables on n2o production in full scale wwtps and microbial mechanisms influencing factors and economic impact should be comprehensively considered in short it turns out that adjusting favorable operating parameters to exploit the potential of heterotrophic denitrification to reduce n2o has been proven effective 6 n2o production in different processes the n2o emission factor will be technically different due to the differences in feed wastewater treatment processes and metabolic pathways that produce n2o in this section n2o production in different treatment processes including conventional n removal processes advanced n removal processes and biofilm processes are discussed 6 1 n2o production in conventional n removal processes conventional n removal processes mainly involve complete nitrification and denitrification such as anoxic oxic a o process and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process as is well known most continuous operating systems are developed based on a2 o process such as reversed a2 o uct and bardenpho processes therefore aob denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification are the main pathways to produce n2o since dpaos were ubiquitous in the a2 o process the bcfs and dephanox processes were designed to make full use of dpaos to achieve simultaneous denitrification and excessive phosphorus uptake van loosdrecht et al 1998 schmitz et al 2016 lin et al 2019 studies have shown that a large amount of n2o is emitted in denitrifying phosphorus removal systems but the contribution of dpaos is not yet clear so far there are three potential ways to produce n2o first the enrichment of denitrifying polysaccharide bacteria in these systems leads to the production of n2o zeng et al 2003 second the accumulation of no2 in these systems is higher than that in conventional denitrification systems third dpao s use of internal carbon substrates increases n2o production kampschreur et al 2009 zeng et al 2019 sbrs emit less n2o than continuous operating systems such as oxidation ditch zheng et al 2015 which may be due to better control of nitrogen intermediates blum et al 2018 in particular the modified a o sbr and a2 o sbr e g oxic extended idle process oxic anoxic extended idle process and static oxic anoxic process emit less n2o due to less dependence on internal carbon sources and less no2 accumulation chen et al 2014 li et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 the oxidation ditch produces less n2o due to the uniform do concentration law et al 2012b the amount of n2o emitted in the oxidation ditch was much lower than that in the sbr reactor sun et al 2015 besides it turns out that the full scale oxidation ditch has advantages in reducing greenhouse gases compared to a o and dual cycle a o processes masuda et al 2018 as the foundation and pioneer of advanced processes conventional n removal processes have been widely used in wwtps worldwide up to now they are still the mainstream processes especially in developing countries and regions so they are still the main battlefield for reducing n2o however the knowledge of n2o production and mitigation in these processes is still incomplete and deserves further study 6 2 n2o production in advanced n removal processes contrary to conventional processes advanced n removal processes are characterized by multiple biochemical reactions or short cut nitrification processes as shown in table 2 pn a simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and nitritation denitritation nit dnit are the three major advanced n removal processes to date which have been fully investigated and applied to full scale wwtps anammox refers to the direct oxidation of nh4 to n2 using no2 as an electron acceptor under anaerobic or anoxic conditions on this basis the combination of pn a process has been effectively realized ma et al 2015 by adjusting the temperature and srt the nitrification was controlled in the nitritation stage so that the ratio of nh4 to no2 is close to 1 and then the effluent of the nitritation reactor was used as the inflow of the anammox reactor the n2o production of pn a are completely different from those of n d this is due to differences in nitrogen production pathways microbial generation time and operating conditions as mentioned above the production of n2o in the conventional n d process can be attributed to autotrophic denitrification nh2oh oxidation and heterotrophic denitrification which means that the anammox step may not be the main source of n2o due to its absolutely different metabolic pathways zhang et al 2018 some studies claim that n2o is mainly produced during the partial nitritation stage kampschreur et al 2008 okabe et al 2011 domingo félez et al 2014 during the partial nitrification process the accumulation of no2 and the limitation of do will stimulate the production of n2o however n2o production during anammox has also been confirmed which may be caused by heterotrophic denitrification anammox intermediates or other unclear pathways the production of n2o in the anammox reactor is related to the concentration of nh4 fe2 and inorganic carbon jin et al 2016 zhang and jin 2017 zhang et al 2018 in fact it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of anammox and nitritation in the canon process that realizes pn a in one reactor therefore more detailed n2o production pathways in the anammox process are of concern for the snd process nitrification and denitrification are performed simultaneously under the same operating conditions in one reactor snd has become a promising technique due to its advantages of saving carbon reducing energy and eliminating the need for alkalinity liu et al 2010 jia et al 2013b under low oxygen or micro aerobic conditions some hdn may even coexist with aob and nob especially in internal sludge flocs all possible pathways for n2o production may occur simultaneously resulting in quite complex release characteristics oxygen limited conditions can easily promote n2o accumulation so a large amount of n2o will be released in the snd system jia et al 2012 jia et al 2013a for example the o2 uptake rate reflecting the trend of n2o production was higher in snd than in n d indicating that autotrophic denitrification and degradation of intracellular polymers may occur jia et al 2012 due to the low do and no2 environment aob denitrification may play a leading role in n2o production in addition jia et al 2013a found that controlling the particle size of sludge aggregates and influent cod p ratio can effectively reduce n2o production in snd reactors due to the strict restrictions on the operating conditions of snd n2o mitigation strategies should focus on the parameters that affect the process nit dnit also known as shortcut nitrification denitrification is another representative advanced n removal process if nitritation and denitritation are performed in one reactor that is single stage nit dnit it can be identified as sharon the principle is to control the nitrification process in the no2 stage and use no2 as the final electron acceptor to directly remove nitrogen similar to pn a the nitritation process emits more n2o due to low levels of do no2 accumulation and other operating conditions for example 68 of total production were attributed to nitritation in single stage nit dnit peng et al 2017 however the anoxic n2o production accounted for 66 of the total production in full scale sharon reactors which is basically consistent with other studies kampschreur et al 2008 mampaey et al 2016 it can be considered that the n2o produced under anoxic conditions is due to heterotrophic denitrification nitrifier denitrification driven by accumulated nh2oh and oxidation of nh2oh with no2 based on the contradiction between these two results more effort should be devoted to reveal the formation mechanism of n2o in sharon 6 3 n2o production in biofilm processes biofilm is another typical biological treatment technique according to the state of microbial attachment the biofilm process can be divided into biofilter biocontact oxidation biofluidized bed and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr due to the anoxic zone in the inner layer of the biofilm denitrification can be performed to remove total nitrogen therefore n2o will be produced during the denitrification process for example n2o was detected as a discharge from biofilm to liquid bulk during heterotrophic denitrification in a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor eldyasti et al 2014 moreover 72 25 4 86 of the total n2o was produced during the anoxic phase of the anaerobic oxic anoxic sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr ge et al 2018 besides some researchers have successfully combined membrane bioreactors mbr with biofilm processes to improve system performance such as the new mbbr based integrated fixed film activated sludge membrane bioreactor ifas mbr process di trapani et al 2014 ifas mbr has better mbr performance and lower n2o production than mbr which may be due to the presence of attached and suspended biomass indicating that biofilm may play a role in n2o mitigation mannina et al 2018c mannina et al 2018d however the specific mechanism by which n2o is generated and reduced in this process is unclear and the knowledge gap about n2o production in ifas mbr still exists in addition the contribution of aob and hdn to n2o production in sbbr is inconsistent with many other studies on activated sludge systems ge et al 2018 there is no consensus on the mechanism of n2o production in biofilms which may possess the potential to reduce n2o consequently attention should be paid to the biofilm and its modified process in summary advanced processes have better n removal performance than conventional processes but they may emit more n2o due to the required operating conditions biofilm processes have advantages in reducing n2o but the specific mechanism of n2o production has not been revealed therefore efforts on mitigation strategies should focus on influencing factors based on multiple biochemical pathways it will be a breakthrough to grasp the more detailed mechanism of n2o production in biofilms and establish a relative mathematical model from a microscopic point of view it is essential to make full use of the characteristics of the treatment process to make hdn the sink of n2o produced by all pathways from a macro perspective the optimization of parameters and the improvement of treatment processes are beneficial to reduce the production of n2o via heterotrophic denitrification 7 how to reduce n2o production based on the above discussion exerting influence on the complex metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions of aob and hdn is the key to achieving n2o mitigation fig 4 in this section the mitigation strategies studied in recent years are discussed the full scale mitigation applications over the past five years are summarized in table 3 7 1 regulation of microbial community structure the performance of nitrification and denitrification is closely related to the structure of the microbial community the predominant bacteria involved in both nitrification and denitrification play a key role in reducing n2o chen et al 2012a song et al 2014 vieira et al 2019 currently one of the main control strategies for microbial community structure is the application or enrichment of dominant bacteria such as alcaligenes faecalis a typical heterotrophic nitrifying bacterium for example the use of a three phase fluidized bed process to inoculate immobilized alcaligenes faecalis can not only control n2o production but also improve n removal efficiency kim et al 2004 in addition certain microorganisms isolated from wastewater treatment systems or the natural environments have the potential to reduce n2o and can be further utilized in the laboratory pseudomonas tolaasii strain y 11 and rhodococcus sp cpz24 isolated from long term flooded paddy soil and swine wastewater can simultaneously perform heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification with almost no n2o production and can be selected as a carrier for the snd process chen et al 2012a he et al 2016 song et al 2014 discovered unique predominant n2o reducing bacteria from two different full scale activated sludge systems including the genera rhodobacter showing excellent n2o reducing capability pcr and high throughput sequencing techniques are widely used to study microbial communities in wwtps the genetic potential of n2o reduction was discussed in a pilot scale oxidation ditch and it was found that nitrospira is closely related to avoiding no2 accumulation which is likely to be applicable to full scale wwtps zhou et al 2019 vieira et al 2019 linked n2o production to the microbial community in a full scale wwtp and found that the production of n2o is closely related to the abundance of nitrotoga candidatus microthrix and rhodobacter genera it was found that nirk denitrifiers replaced nirs denitrifiers to dominate n2o production and the nosz clade ii gene was responsible for reducing n2o vieira et al 2019 although the control of microbial community structure does not seem to be applicable to all n removal processes the identification of bacteria species can be achieved with the development of microbiology the bioremediation of n2o reducing microorganisms and the management of microbial communities can be well used to reduce n2o production in wwtps which is expected to be achieved in the future 7 2 selection of feeding strategies the denitrification pathways of aob and hdn are essentially redox reactions with a series of electron transfers there is electron competition between denitrifying reductases nar nir nor and n2or so it is easy to produce n2o when there are insufficient electron donor carbon substrates incomplete denitrification is the main reason for n2o production in the anoxic stage evidence shows that external carbon sources and proper feeding strategies can effectively solve this problem adding a carbon substrate mixture will result in a slight increase in the ratio of n2o reducing capacity to n2o producing capacity making denitrification a n2o consumption pathway conthe et al 2019 compared with ethanol and other long carbon chain compounds acetate as carbon source can produce more n2o adouani et al 2010 and methanol is superior to other carbon substrates in reducing n2o lee et al 2019 in addition despite the low total n removal rate the innovative carbon substrate mannitol can be selected to reduce n2o production zhang et al 2016a in addition better feeding strategies allow microorganisms to make extensive use of carbon substrates fig 4 studies have shown that implementing anoxic intermittent feeding to further utilize carbon substrates is a viable method to reduce n2o production peng et al 2017 su et al 2017 and multi step feeding can reduce n2o produced by nitrifier denitrification duan et al 2018 chai et al 2019 in contrast continuous feeding exhibited better performance than batch feeding in terms of n removal and n2o reduction in lab scale cyclic activated sludge systems liang et al 2015 which indicates that the feeding strategy should be adjusted according to the characteristics of the n removal process generally the addition of carbon sources and appropriate feeding strategies can reduce the electron competition between reductases and promote the reduction of n2o to n2 7 3 optimization of operating parameters reducing n2o production by optimizing operating parameters has been proven feasible in laboratory tests as mentioned in section 5 the accumulation of do and no2 has a great influence on the production of n2o by aob a model combining the two pathways of aob denitrification and nh2oh oxidation has been proposed ni et al 2014 peng et al 2015b pocquet et al 2016 at all do levels moderate no2 accumulation may trigger aob to produce n2o with negligible effect on nh2oh oxidation peng et al 2017 meanwhile the nh2oh oxidation pathway increased with increasing do concentration at all no2 levels while the n2o emission factor increased with decreasing do and no2 concentration peng et al 2015b therefore further minimizing the accumulation of no2 and controlling do will effectively reduce the n2o produced by aob however increasing the do level will result in more o2 consumption and will not inhibit nob during the nit dnit process accordingly changing the aeration strategy has always been a promising method to reduce n2o emissions since electricity consumption also causes a carbon footprint it is not recommended to increase the aeration blindly aboobakar et al 2013 according to the simulation results of the asm2d n2o model the optimal do level is between 1 8 and 2 5 mg l because too high aeration intensity will result in high power consumption and carbon footprint while too low dissolved oxygen may cause high n2o production massara et al 2018 the municipal wwtp in la roca del vallès barcelona spain uses intermittent aeration and with an n2o emission factor of 6 8 which is higher than most other data in full scale systems and may be due to the continuous fluctuation of do nh4 or no2 triggering multiple ways of generating n2o rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however whether ventilation intermittence works in n2o mitigation is contradictory between lab scale research and simulation analysis in most cases reactors with intermittent aeration can emit lower n2o which means that intermittent aeration mode with short aerobic and anoxic phases can effectively reduce n2o rodriguez caballero et al 2015 leix et al 2017 peng et al 2017 in other words proper aeration must be performed a higher aeration intensity will increase the do level in the anoxic zone through internal circulation to prevent the reduction of n2o to n2 while too low do levels will lead to incomplete nitrification and aob denitrification but is conducive to heterotrophic denitrification sun et al 2017 a step stage aeration mode based on the demand of microorganisms for do was proposed which seems to be feasible for the plug flow a2 o process wang et al 2016b other operating parameters such as temperature ph srt etc will also have a significant impact on n2o production therefore mitigation strategies based on these factors cannot be ignored avoiding acidic conditions during denitrification is beneficial for reducing n2o and the optimal ph is 7 5 to 8 0 pan et al 2012 the lower ph 6 0 to 7 0 obtained at slow feed rates under aerobic conditions especially in aob rich cultures can effectively inhibit n2o production law et al 2011 in the n removal process n2o is mainly produced in the aerobic stage and decreases with the increase of srt while the relative abundance of nirk and n2or is lower under shorter srt conditions li and wu 2014 zhou et al 2019 besides due to the sensitivity of related functional enzymes to abnormal temperatures extremely high or low temperatures may cause n2o accumulation poh et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in conclusion controlling aeration is essential to inhibit aob denitrification relatively neutral ph 6 5 7 0 moderate temperature approximately 20 c and appropriate long srt are beneficial for the nitrifier and denitrifier to maintain a stable enzyme reaction so that n2o can be consumed smoothly through complete denitrification 7 4 copper additive nirk and n2or are both copper containing enzymes and their active center has catalytic site called cuz which contains copper ions zhu and chen 2011 accordingly the lack of cu2 will easily inhibit the activity of these reductases thereby preventing the reduction of n2o to n2 in heterotrophic denitrification zhu and chen 2011 chen et al 2012b zhu et al 2013 the use of sludge fermentation liquid containing cu2 as an additional carbon substrate significantly reduced the production of n2o and no and did not affect the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus zhu and chen 2011 in addition the activity of reductases is related to ph conditions therefore controlling the concentration of cu2 to a certain level and ensuring a stable acidic environment is an effective method to reduce n2o production 7 5 process improvement for specific wastewater and environmental conditions it is important to choose the appropriate type of n removal process for domestic wastewater containing relatively moderate levels of cod total nitrogen and soluble orthophosphate it is best to use the a2 o process therefore the n2o mitigation strategy can be studied by modifying the operating scheme of the a2 o process chen et al 2014 eliminated the anaerobic phase and extended the idle phase by alternately changing the aerobic and anoxic phases and observed a significant reduction in n2o production zeng et al 2019 replaced the anaerobic phase with a shortened static phase to treat simulated domestic sewage which also reduced the production of n2o furthermore proper prolongation of the anoxic phase and reduction of aerobic no2 concentration can also reduce the production of n2o in the a o process wang et al 2019 for nitrogen enriched wastewater although low do conditions may increase n2o production advanced n removal processes such as nit dnit or pn a processes are satisfactory choices considering economics the key is to suppress the effects of no2 accumulation in advanced n removal systems for example intermittent aeration and feeding in nit dnit sbr treating co digested pig slurry can significantly inhibit no2 accumulation and reduce n2o production by approximately 99 peng et al 2017 however for more complex wastewater a combination technology involving chemical treatment is required in sharon n2o formed in the anoxic stage is considered an important source but the mechanism of n2o production is still unclear it has been observed that minimizing or avoiding anoxic conditions can significantly reduce n2o production in a full scale partial nitritation reactor mampaey et al 2016 as mentioned in section 5 the transient conditions of do may be a trigger for the surge of n2o indicating the effectiveness and feasibility of avoiding anoxia conversely extending the length of the anoxic phase to ensure heterotrophic n2o reducing capacity in the carrousel oxidation ditch is considered an effective n2o mitigation strategy chen et al 2019 therefore it is feasible to change the operation mode of full scale wwtps by adjusting the period of the n removal process and it needs to be examined and optimized according to different denitrification processes the strategies proposed in recent years are based on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of aob and hdn which have been effectively implemented in the laboratory and ultimately determined the optimization of the n removal process however considerable knowledge gaps still exist such as the abundance of newly isolated microorganisms functional gene dynamics in microbial mechanisms and large scale applications which provide important guidance for ongoing exploration 7 6 denitrification as an n2o sink as mentioned above aob and hdn are two key sources of n2o as illustrated in fig 5 the effective way to minimize n2o accumulation is to reduce its production from no and nh2oh and promote complete denitrification to ensure its reduction to n2 for example a mathematical model of a granular sludge reactor that describes the influencing factors of n2o production in a one stage pn a system concludes that hdn will dominate the fate of n2o reduction to n2 wan et al 2019 besides hdn with more specific genes e g nosz clade ii have a greater capacity to reduce n2o in three full scale wwtps vieira et al 2019 however due to the difference in the number of n2or and nir proteins rather than gene overexpression the n2o reducing capacity is excessive which must be considered in modeling and n2o mitigation strategy research conthe et al 2019 in addition since hdn have a dual impact on the net production and reduction of n2o chen et al 2019 it is recommended to implement more comprehensive strategies in wwtps to make full use of hdn as the only scavenger the key is to increase the potential for reducing n2o during the denitrification process as shown in fig 5 coupling strategies will be a good choice such as process upgrades and operating condition adjustments for a2 o based processes it is recommended to combine a staged aeration mode with increased hypoxia exposure the former can significantly increase the level of do without high gas stripping and can avoid the inhibitory effect of do concentration on n2or during the anoxic stage the latter can be achieved by properly extending the anoxic period or increasing the circulation rate of the reactor which provides a more anoxic environment to reduce n2o to n2 in this way the reduction of n2o during heterotrophic denitrification will be enhanced and aob denitrification will be well suppressed in advanced n removal processes the combination of intermittent feeding or carbon metering strategies and strict control of operating parameters such as ph and water temperature can reduce the electron competition between reductases thereby enhancing the ability to reduce n2o in addition it is encouraged to link the mitigation strategies of full scale wwtps with microbial analysis based on genetic level research since the n2o reducing capacity of hdn can be 10 times the production capacity it is expected to obtain a stable 10 fold or higher n2o reduction potential by utilizing the physiologic characteristics of hdn and controlling community abundance and denitrification gene expression only in this way can the microorganisms that reduce and produce n2o be fully utilized to properly control the transition of hdn from source to sink even so there are still many bottlenecks that need to be resolved first although increasingly more research is focused on the microbial community and the genetic potential of n2o reduction the knowledge gap in the field of biochemistry under complex environmental conditions limits the current exploration resulting in the metabolic pathways are still unclear hence it is not easy to further enhance the net n2o reducing capacity of hdn second there is no standardized methodology for establishing n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems most full scale applications are implemented based on short term or medium term monitoring campaigns which can easily lead to deviations between observed and actual values therefore the main gap lies in the identification of appropriate n2o mitigation measures and their integration into the control of wwtps in addition the above strategies inevitably bring a series of problems such as increasing power consumption adding additional expensive stoichiometric equipment and changing the configuration of the reactor since reducing ghgs and recycling resources have become part of the new goals of wwtps there must be a trade off between wastewater quality carbon footprint reduction and economic benefits therefore there is still a long way to go to achieve the excellent performance of n removal and energy saving and n2o mitigation in wwtps 8 conclusions and future directions 8 1 conclusions new hdn strains with excellent n2o reducing capacity are constantly being isolated and identified and hdn will become one of the hotspots for future research microbiology studies using molecular methods have deepened our understanding of the biochemical pathways that produce n2o during the n removal process but the knowledge gap about microbial diversity still exists although the current models can predict the trend of n2o production well the simulated values are not accurate enough the current models are more suitable for qualitative analysis and it is still a challenge to improve their quantitative prediction capabilities at present most of the researches are focused on optimizing parameters and simulating production pathways without discussing in depth the potential of denitrification as an n2o sink multivariate analysis should be valued to explore the comprehensive impact of online monitoring campaigns and process variables on n2o production in full scale wwtps meanwhile microbial mechanisms influencing factors and economic impact should also be taken into account advanced n removal processes emit more n2o than conventional ones biofilm processes have advantages in reducing n2o but the specific n2o production mechanism has not been revealed the combination of multiple mitigation strategies such as biological enhancement of n2o consuming bacteria and proper control of operating conditions has proven to be feasible and effective in converting denitrification from n2o sources to sinks 8 2 future directions there is still a considerable knowledge gap in understanding the microbial diversity that produces and reduces n2o further research is needed to clarify the biochemistry of the isolated strains and to isolate new hdn strains with excellent n2o reducing capacity it is necessary to fully clarify the n2o production in advanced n removal processes especially anammox and biofilm processes the identification of new pathways such as bio abiotic coupling pathways is especially critical continuous improvement and validation based on the existing mathematical models are significant combining current microbiological and biochemical knowledge of aob and hdn to describe all n2o production pathways and assess the denitrification potential as a n2o sink is a top priority n2o quantification and monitoring technology can be developed to accurately estimate n2o in full scale wwtps the traditional goals of wwtps are changed by adding new content reducing ghg emissions and recycling resources these facts require wwtp operators to adopt new methods and collect new information with the advent of the era of big data establishing a database of n2o emission factors and standard protocols based on local environmental conditions can play a vital role in the global ghg assessment the mitigation strategies implemented in the laboratory only make sense if they are applied to full scale wwtps on the basis of understanding the metabolic pathways of microorganisms that reduce n2o further attempts and explorations are needed to develop more comprehensive measures to give full play to the ability of hdn to reduce n2o and

17651,nitrous oxide n2o emitted from wastewater treatment plants has caused widespread concern over the past decade people have made tremendous efforts to discover the microorganisms responsible for n2o production elucidate metabolic pathways establish production models and formulate mitigation strategies the ultimate goal of all these efforts is to shed new light on how n2o is produced and how to reduce it and one of the best ways is to find key opportunities by integrating the information obtained this review article critically evaluates the knowledge gained in the field within a decade especially in n2o production microbiology biochemistry models and mitigation strategies with a focus on denitrification previous research has greatly deepened the understanding of the n2o generation mechanism but further efforts are still needed due to the lack of standardized methodology for establishing n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems one of the challenges seems to be to convert the denitrification process from a net n2o source into an effective sink which is recommended as a key opportunity to reduce n2o production in this review graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment mitigation strategies denitrification 1 introduction biological nutrient removal processes have been widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide to achieve phosphorus and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater however a portion of nitrogen is converted into nitrous oxide n2o and is discharged from the open air treatment tank into the atmosphere lin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 n2o is a strong greenhouse gas ghg with a greenhouse effect 265 times stronger than carbon dioxide co2 and a global warming potential gwp100 of 298 which can cause positive radiative forcing and ozone destruction in the stratosphere and lead to acid rain and photochemical smog driscoll et al 2001 ipcc 2013 otte et al 2019 in recent decades n2o emissions from wwtps have steadily increased to 108 mtco2 equivalent accounting for 3 4 of the global n2o emissions budget ipcc 2015 consequently reducing n2o production in wastewater treatment has become a long standing research focus the major microorganisms that produce n2o during biological nitrogen removal are found to be ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdn desloover et al 2012 zaborowska et al 2019 a series of mathematical models from single path models e g model a to model f to multi path models e g asm2d n2o play an important role in describing the n2o production pathways and predicting n2o production in wwtps ni and yuan 2015 models based on mechanical processes have also been developed to integrate n2o production of different processes in the design operation and optimization of biological processes mannina et al 2016 domingo félez et al 2017 massara et al 2017 however the online integration of current models to reliably estimate the production of n2o remains a major challenge haimi et al 2013 mampaey et al 2019 to clarify the mechanism of n2o production and then accurately quantify the production of n2o the influencing factors of n2o production in biological nitrogen removal have been continuously explored in the past decade massara et al 2017 vasilaki et al 2018 unfortunately there are significant differences between the results obtained in different types of processes which brings a series of uncertainties to the prediction and reduction of n2o in practical applications for example the mechanism by which dissolved oxygen do inhibits n2o production varies greatly between nitrification denitrification n d and partial nitritation anammox pn a kampschreur et al 2008 castro barros et al 2015 over the past decade efforts to reduce n2o have focused on isolating n2o reducing microorganisms enhancing n2o reductase n2or activity replenishing carbon sources optimizing operating parameters and improving treatment processes chen et al 2014 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2017 the development of new n2o reducing microorganisms seems promising but no breakthrough has been achieved in the isolation and identification of strains and the biochemical knowledge of newly isolated microorganisms is far from sufficient moreover the uncertainty of n2o measurement under complex environmental conditions has not been clearly resolved which makes it difficult to establish a standardized methodology for n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems therefore none of the current strategies can guarantee the effective and stable reduction of n2o recent studies have shown that heterotrophic denitrification can effectively eliminate n2o chen et al 2019 conthe et al 2019 wan et al 2019 hdn s n2o reducing capacity is usually 2 10 times its n2o production capacity which shows great potential for reducing n2o conthe et al 2019 denitrification as an n2o sink can not only reduce n2o produced as an intermediate product of incomplete denitrification but also eliminate n2o produced by nh3 oxidation and abiotic pathways conthe et al 2019 these studies have evaluated hdn denitrification from various angles from gene sequencing to modeling analysis from laboratory scale to full scale applications and revealed the feasibility and superiority of hdn as an n2o scavenger in recent years several published reviews have discussed the production of n2o in wastewater treatment focusing mainly on the monitoring and quantification of n2o vasilaki et al 2019 production characteristics under different processes and configurations sabba et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 and mechanism analysis of enzyme activity and microbial community pauleta et al 2019 ren et al 2019 however no attempt has been made to fully evaluate the potential and possible applications of hdn denitrification as an n2o sink therefore the purpose of this article is to integrate recent advances in n2o production and mitigation and to propose strategies to enhance hdn denitrification as an effective n2o sink to this end this review focuses on the potential of hdn denitrification to solve the bottleneck of n2o reduction and critically assess the latest knowledge of microbiology biochemistry mathematical models influencing factors and mitigation strategies in the past decade the application of the source to sink strategy is also provided as an alternative method for reducing n2o in wwtps in the future 2 who produces n2o n2o is mainly produced by a series of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms of which aob and hdn play a vital role in the nitrogen cycle ren et al 2019 2 1 aob since the early 1980s aob are considered to be the main contributors to n2o stein 2019 aob are mainly composed of two monophyletic lines with distinct phylogeny β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria mills 2019 recently a series of new aob including nitrosococcus wardiae d1fhs nitrosomonas sp py1 and nitrosomonas sp np1 have been isolated from soil marine sediments and activated sludge stein 2019 indicating that aob play a dominant role in the nitrogen cycle in addition to aob nitrification can also be carried out by other nh3 oxidizers since the discovery of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa by könneke et al 2005 over 10 species of aoa have been isolated and more than 10 enrichments have been cultivated liu et al 2017 these species were classified as phylum thaumarchaeota muller et al 2010 in addition a bacterium capable of completely oxidizing nh4 to no3 comammox was also discovered daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 regarding the linkage between these nh3 oxidizers and n2o production plenty of aob have been shown to encode and express nitrite reductase nirk for aob and nitric oxide reductase norb for aob kozlowski et al 2016 this indicates that aob play a role in the nitrifier denitrification pathway to produce n2o see section 3 2 for details unlike aob aoa has been confirmed to be unable to perform nitrifier denitrification kits et al 2017 due to the strict lean nutritional lifestyle it is believed that n2o produced by comammox bacteria is very limited kits et al 2017 prosser et al 2020 therefore aob are the main n2o producers of all nh3 oxidizers it is essential to explore unique physiological characteristics of nitrosomonas due to its representative role in aob identification and isolation of new aob strains 2 2 hdn hdn are considered facultative chemoheterotrophs that use molecular o2 no3 or no2 as their electron acceptors to degrade the carbon sources and produce net energy to support prolific microbial growth mills 2019 the genera distributed in activated sludge include pseudomonas alcaligens rhodopseudomonas spirillum rhizobium neisseria etc among which alcaligens bacillus and pseudomonas constitute the majority of hdn gerardi 2006 hdn include n2 producing denitrifiers with complete set of denitrification enzymes and incomplete denitrifiers such as n2o pruducing denitrifiers lacking n2or holmes et al 2019 pseudomonas spp is the predominant heterotrophic bacteria involved in complete denitrification holmes et al 2019 however the key persistent genus of hdn in wwtps are reported to be dechloromonas and thauera fan et al 2017 denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos play a crucial role in several biological nutrient removal processes lin et al 2019 they can absorb the external carbon substrates into the cell and synthesize them as intracellular polymers e g polyhydroxyalkanoates and then use the intracellular polymers as electron donors and use no2 no3 as the final electron acceptor to complete denitrification li et al 2013 therefore dpaos can also be classified as hdn these indicate the need to pay attention to the dynamics of microbial communities in different processes generally heterotrophic denitrification occurs only under anoxic conditions because the molecular o2 can replace no3 no2 as the final electron acceptor however in recent years aerobic denitrification has gradually entered people s field of vision the main differences between heterotrophic aerobic denitrifying bacteria had and conventional hdn are as follows 1 the presence of oxygen will inhibit hdn reductase and affect gene expression resulting in incomplete denitrification papaspyrou et al 2014 2 had can breathe oxygen and nitrate simultaneously rajta et al 2019 since nitrification and denitrification in a single unit can save costs and require fewer chemical additives the development of had becomes promising overall most had are taxonomically located in the α β and γ subclasses of proteobacteria recently many researchers are dedicated to isolating had that can achieve both heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification giannopoulos et al 2017 jin et al 2019 for example a new strain of acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7t exhibited remarkable heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification ability at 2 c zheng et al 2018 besides halophilic bacillus strain n31 has been successfully used in marine sewage treatment huang et al 2017 since this had may coexist in aerobic regions it may compete with aob the main contributor to n2o therefore once had capable of heterotrophic nitrification dominates n2o production can be reduced from the source without affecting the nitrification performance the good news is that new strains with the potential to reduce n2o are constantly being discovered table 1 for example marinobacter sp nna5 and pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can significantly reduce n2o after biological enhancement in an activated sludge systems liu et al 2016 zheng 2019 zhu et al 2015 observed that the addition of pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can reduce n2o production by 40 88 under the condition of using corn flour as the carbon source interestingly when the carbon source is not limited p pantotrophus has excellent n2o reducing overcapacity and the potential for consuming n2o is 5 times that of producing n2o domingo félez and smets 2020 therefore as more and more hdn with excellent n2o reducing capacity are isolated and identified hdn will become one of the hotspots for future research 3 how do they produce n2o in conventional nitrification and denitrification processes n2o is produced through the metabolic pathways of aob and hdn including aob nitrification aob denitrification and hdn denitrification fig 1 meanwhile abiotic pathways may occur under certain circumstances 3 1 aob nitrification the aob nitrification pathway i e nh2oh oxidation refers to incomplete oxidation of nh2oh to no2 previous studies have shown that nh2oh and no2 are the two main precursors for the production of nitric oxide no and n2o schreiber et al 2012 nh3 is first oxidized to nh2oh by monooxygenase amo then nh2oh is catalyzed by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and generates nitroxyl hno as an intermediate hno reacts with another nh2oh molecule then dimerizes into hyponitrous acid h2n2o2 and finally chemically decomposes to form n2o yamazaki et al 2014 besides there is a bio abiotic coupling process that is considered to be the production pathway of n nitrosation hybrid n2o in which n2o is generated by the interaction of hno2 and nh2oh schreiber et al 2012 zhu barker et al 2015 duan et al 2017 therefore the n2o produced by aob nitrification cannot be ignored especially under the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions duan et al 2017 3 2 aob denitrification in recent years aob have been recognized as the main cause of n2o production ni and yuan 2015 su et al 2017 blum et al 2018 the aob denitrification pathway also known as autotrophic denitrification mainly occurs under oxygen limited or strictly anoxic conditions duan et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in aob denitrification there is electron competition between no2 and o2 especially when no2 accumulation occurs as a result n2o is produced with no2 as the terminal electron acceptor and no as the an intermediate and copper containing nirk and norb play a role the reason why aob denitrification has become the main way to produce n2o in biological n removal may be that aob does not have n2or which makes n2o the final product and aob become net n2o producers duan et al 2017 aob s contribution to n2o production is dynamic and always combined with other pathways peng et al 2015b which requires a more comprehensive analysis based on environmental conditions 3 3 hdn denitrification heterotrophic denitrification involves a series of consecutive steps in which no2 or no3 is reduced to n2 via two mandatory intermediates no and n2o these stepwise reactions are catalyzed by four different enzymes namely no3 reductase nar no2 reductase nir for hdn no reductase nor for hdn and n2or which are regulated by genes narg nirk nirs nosz i and nosz ii vieira et al 2019 incomplete reduction of n2o to n2 will result in n2o accumulation thereby reducing the proportion of electrons allocated to n2o reductase pan et al 2013a surprisingly the newly isolated nna5 strain can use no3 or no2 as a nitrogen source for growth and convert it to n2 without producing any n2o which is significantly different from other had liu et al 2016 since the reduction of n2o is closely related to the periplasmic n2or of hdn where the nosz gene plays a crucial role ji et al 2015 so it can be speculated that the ratio of nirk to nosz of this strain nna5 may be low vieira et al 2019 this provides a crucial basis for further revealing the genetic potential of hdn to reduce n2o 3 4 abiotic pathways in addition to biological pathways abiotic pathways also exist in certain circumstances for instance nh2oh can be oxidized by o2 to form n2o nh2oh 0 5o2 0 5n2o 1 5h2o besides nh2oh can react spontaneously with nitrous acid hno2 to generate n2o nh2oh hno2 n2o 2h2o soler jofra et al 2016 this abiotic pathway contributes considerable n2o production in several advanced n removal processes e g single reactor high activity ammonia removal over nitrite sharon in which nitrification stops at the no2 stage and provides the required precursors of the above reaction soler jofra et al 2016 in addition chemical reactions between redox active metals iron and manganese organics humic and fulvic acids and nitrogen cycle intermediates under relevant environmental conditions may produce n2o zhu barker et al 2015 for example nh2oh can be oxidized by fe ⅲ or mn iv to further produce n2o which is more pronounced in soil than in wwtps although abiotic pathways mainly include chemical reactions and only account for a small part of the total n2o production in wwtps they are likely to be enhanced in wastewater containing heavy metals and should be considered carefully harper et al 2015 zhu barker et al 2015 3 5 limitation of biochemical studies microbiology studies using molecular methods have been carried out for decades which has deepened our understanding of the biochemical pathways that produce n2o during the n removal process even so the knowledge gap about microbial diversity still exists at present the classification of isolated microorganisms needs to be continuously improved and its metabolic pathways have yet to be studied for example anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria play a vital role in the n removal process but a detailed mechanism on how to produce n2o has not been established ali et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to explore their genetic and physiological characteristics in addition had produce more n2o than n2 liu et al 2016 new had strains that produce less n2o and achieve excellent denitrification performance are worthy exploring as the only n2o consuming bacteria hdn denitrification can serve as a sink for n2o produced by aob and hdn therefore the isolation identification and in depth analysis of heterotrophic denitrification pathway of hdn with high n2o reducing capacity are of great significance in short firmly grasping the metabolic pathways of aob and hdn and figuring out exactly how they produce n2o is critical to reducing n2o where mathematical modeling plays a vital role 4 mathematical models of n2o production activated sludge models asms have been widely used to predict the treatment performance of wwtps of which asm1 asm2 asm2d and asm3 are the mainstream massara et al 2017 in this section the models describing n2o production pathways are discussed as the n2o models of aob and hdn and their integrated models respectively 4 1 n2o models of aob ni and yuan 2015 described a series of n2o models of aob including four single path models involving aob denitrification ni et al 2011 mampaey et al 2013 pocquet et al 2013 guo and vanrolleghem 2014 two single path models involving nh2oh oxidation law et al 2012a ni et al 2013 and two two path models that include both aob denitrification and nh2oh oxidation ni et al 2014 peng et al 2015a the dependence on operating conditions limits the application of single path models for example the single path models involving aob denitrification are suitable for high no2 conditions while low no2 and high do conditions are favorable for nh2oh oxidation ni and yuan 2015 the relative applicability of the two path models to dynamic conditions makes it widely used in recent years ding et al 2018 table s1 lists three common two path models pocquet et al 2016 ding et al 2017 mampaey et al 2019 pocquet et al 2016 proposed a two path model that did not consider the inhibitory effect of free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna on aob growth but still obtained a good fit with no n2o and n2o emission factors this indicates that the inhibition items of fa and fna are not necessary to predict n2o production unless at high nh4 influent concentration subsequently this model was modified with ph regulation k p h k p h 1 10 p h o p t p h and oxygen inhibition k i o a o b s o 2 k i o a o b items to evaluate the n2o contribution of three n2o production pathways including aob denitrification nh2oh oxidation and hdn denitrification table s2 mampaey et al 2019 the results showed that the residual no2 and nh2oh in the aerobic stage induced the aob denitrification that occurred during anoxic stage mampaey et al 2019 therefore nh2oh should be regarded as a state variable even during the anoxic stage besides it seems feasible to simplify the model by removing the state variable of no in nitrification by combining reactions to avoid no loops ding et al 2017 in short the models can be fine tuned according to the specific environment the key issues regarding model selection still needs to be solved i e the scope of application has not yet been standardized 4 2 n2o models of hdn previous studies have proposed heterotrophic denitrification models including activated sludge model for nitrogen asmn and activated sludge model with indirect coupling of electrons ams ice hiatt and grady 2008 pan et al 2013b the latter is based on electron competition in denitrification systems pan et al 2018 electron competition between successive steps is the key to studying heterotrophic denitrification domingo félez and smets 2020 modeled denitrification as a circuit describing electron transfer when carbon source are insufficient microorganisms utilize intracellular polymers x s t o x h x s t o x h k s t o and electron competition occurs in denitrification ding et al 2017 the above models are based on four step denitrification as shown in table s1 the four step denitrification models contain all known intermediates including no2 no and n2o taking into account the toxic effects of no the inhibitory terms of no ki no h were added to the kinetic rate expression table s2 mampaey et al 2019 however considerable measurement data indicate that the accumulation of no hardly occurs in the anoxic stage and the concentration of no is negligible pavissich et al 2012 mampaey et al 2019 therefore it is feasible to simplify four step denitrification into three step denitrification by setting no2 to be reduced to n2o in one step wisniewski et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the combination of reaction processes is the main difference between the four step denitrification and the three step denitrification models table s1 presents two three step denitrification models the model proposed by pavissich et al 2012 only considered the reduction of no2 and no and excluded the toxicity consideration of no wisniewski et al 2018 applied three step denitrification to asm2d and considered the switch function of no2 k n o 2 h 1 k n o 2 h 1 s n o 2 reflecting the inhibitory effect of no2 on denitrification this extended asm2d not only had excellent n2o predictive ability but also fitted the effluent concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod and po4 well r2 0 9 wisniewski et al 2018 generally the process operations require alternating environments e g aerobic anoxic and anaerobic which complicates n2o production pathways and makes separate models of aob or hdn no longer applicable vasilaki et al 2018 domingo félez and smets 2020 therefore an integrated model involving aob and hdn pathways is desirable 4 3 integrated models combining known n2o production pathways to establish integrated n2o models can provide a more comprehensive insights into n2o production and flux variation in full scale wwtps ni and yuan 2015 domingo félez and smets 2016 proposed a new model called ndha nitrifier nitrification nitrifier denitrification heterotrophic denitrification and abiotic reaction which can predict the no and n2o dynamics under various operating conditions and can be calibrated by existing breath measurements domingo félez et al 2017 based on asms an extended asm2d type model was proposed as the asm2d n2o model which includes n2o production pathways n2o stripping and biological nutrient removal massara et al 2018 this model can be used to determine the optimal aeration strategy by simulating n2o production under different do conditions massara et al 2018 meantime the asm1 expansion model with the above three n2o production pathways can distinguish the main pathways and show good predictions under dynamic conditions lu et al 2018 note that excellent models do not necessarily include all n2o production pathways to avoid over parameterization cosenza et al 2013 hence to determine the main n2o production pathways under different conditions has become a research hotspot for example an integrated model including four n2o production pathways e g aob denitrification nh2oh oxygen heterotrophic denitrification and pao denitrification showed that the main pathways for n2o production were aob denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in an anaerobic oxygen limited aerobic process li et al 2020 in fact although the current models can predict the trend of n2o production well the numerical simulation is not accurate mannina et al 2018b mampaey et al 2019 on the one hand it may be that the biochemical pathways for n2o production are not comprehensive on the other hand it may also be due to the models being partially simplified to ensure practical application and avoid over parameterization therefore the current models are more suitable for qualitative analysis and it is still a challenge to improve their quantitative prediction capabilities mampaey et al 2019 since aob is a net n2o producer and hdn is both a producer and a scavenger it is necessary to combine the known microbiological and biochemical knowledge of aob and hdn with n2o modeling at present most of the research is focused on optimizing parameters and simulating production pathways without discussing in depth the potential of denitrification as an n2o sink which is another promising direction for n2o modeling in the future 5 what factors affect n2o production the substrate do fna and other factors in the n removal process will indirectly affect the production of n2o by inhibiting the activity of microorganisms or enzymes to better understand the production pathways of n2o and achieve mitigation the latest knowledge of the impact mechanism is evaluated in this chapter and some surveys are shown in fig 3 5 1 substrate the c n ratio is considered a limiting factor especially for heterotrophic denitrification processes because a low c n ratio usually indicates insufficient substrate zhang et al 2016b li et al 2017 spinelli et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 c a c n ratio of less than 3 results in a significant increase in n2o production the lack of substrate will lead to incomplete denitrification which may be due to the weaker competitiveness of n2or for electrons than other reductases chen et al 2020a in addition the low c n ratio of 5 in the n removal system was also found to increase ph and fa and eventually promote n2o production due to its inhibitory effect on autotrophic biomass mannina et al 2017a it has reported that the lowest n2o flux and the highest n removal rate can be achieved at a c n ratio of 12 1 li et al 2017 nevertheless it was also found that as the c n ratio increases the time to complete denitrification and the maximum accumulation of no2 increase with 1 5 being the optimal c n ratio for reducing n2o krishna mohan et al 2016 therefore the response of n2o production to the change of c n ratio remains to be elucidated in addition the substrate composition also has an important effect on heterotrophic denitrification butler et al 2009 lu and chandran 2010 zhang et al 2016a studies have shown that in wastewater treatment systems denitrifying bacteria prefer to use volatile fatty acids rather than organic complex molecules as substrates elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 methanol is one of the six best substrates for complete denitrification and n2o mitigation lee et al 2019 besides it was found that the substrate may affect the microbial community structure acetate feed was rich in dechloromonas and rubrivivax genus while methanol fed was rich in methylotenera song et al 2015 meanwhile it can be seen from table 1 that denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can not only adapt to different types of carbon sources but also regulate the production of n2o as the of c n ratio changes zheng et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 therefore sufficient carbon substrate and appropriate c n ratio must be provided to ensure heterotrophic denitrification and thus reduce the production of n2o since hdn are the only n2o scavengers only fewer n2o by products and more n2o reduction to n2 can make heterotrophic denitrification an effective sink for n2o 5 2 do aob s strong affinity for o2 allows it to grow under low do conditions which aggravates the accumulation of no2 soliman and eldyasti 2016 zhou et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 a the highest n2o emission factor in the batch test appears in the lowest do level of 0 35 mg l similarly chen et al 2020 detected a maximum emission factor of 4 32 at a low do concentration of 0 5 mg l n2o production is closely related to the do concentration and can be stimulated by the aob denitrification pathway under oxygen limited conditions do 0 5 mg l where aob use no2 as a terminal electron acceptor to save o2 for nh3 oxidation to nh2oh xie et al 2012 lv et al 2016 in addition do also contributes to the metabolism of microorganisms for example high do 2 mg l accelerates the nitrification process while increasing the formation of soluble microbial products that can be used for hdn n2o scavenger growth ni et al 2011 xie et al 2012 however n2o production in full scale wwtps increases with aeration due to gas striping especially in anoxic regions where dissolved n2o accumulates kampschreur et al 2008 castro barros et al 2015 as far as heterotrophic denitrification is concerned the activity of n2or will be inhibited under high levels of do because n2or is more sensitive to o2 than other reductases which leads to the failure of n2o to n2 wunderlin et al 2012 therefore do aeration is an important factor to control n2o production especially in the nitrification process law et al 2012b castro barros et al 2015 moreover the transition from a transient hypoxic state to an aerobic state can trigger aob to produce n2o due to the imbalance of two step nitritation metabolism and the simultaneous accumulation of nh2oh yu et al 2010 pijuan et al 2014 caranto et al 2016 the formation of anoxic n2o may be an important source of n2o production especially in sequencing batch reactors sbrs considering the concentration gradient of o2 in sedimentation anoxia is expected to appear inside the sludge aggregates and a series of n2o production pathways will occur under oxygen limited conditions rodriguez caballero and pijuan 2013 mampaey et al 2016 since the aerobic stage in most wastewater treatment systems is the main source of n2o production a higher do concentration 2 3 mg l and a moderate aeration rate may help reduce n2o considering the rejection of oxygen by hdn denitrification the alternation between aerobic and anoxic phases may require a transtition strategy such as setting the aerobic stage to gradually reduce do from a high level 2 3 mg l to a low level 0 5 mg l 5 3 no2 fna it is believed that the accumulation of no2 usually induces the production of n2o as shown in fig 3 a ali et al 2014 du et al 2016 castellano hinojosa et al 2018 yan et al 2019 under aerobic conditions high no2 concentrations 1 50 mg l and low do levels 1 mg l are the driving forces of nitrite dependent n2o production pathways i e aob denitrification law et al 2013 ni and yuan 2015 genetically increased no2 promotes nirk expression which is directly regulated by nitrite sensitive repressors peng et al 2015b nevertheless as shown in fig 3 b an inhibitory effect on n2o production was also observed at higher no2 concentrations 50 1000 mg n l law et al 2013 ni et al 2014 which indicated that extremely high no2 concentrations were also conducive to the control of n2o production despite the defect in the process operation in addition under anoxic conditions the denitrification rate will also decrease with the accumulation of no2 which eventually leads to n2o production kampschreur et al 2009 under certain ph and temperature conditions part of no2 will be converted into fna fna and fa can inhibit the growth of nob which is conducive to the proliferation of aob thereby causing no2 accumulation and n2o production jiang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a it has been reported that fna can inhibit microorganisms in wwtps such as nitrifiers denitrifiers and anammox bacteria zhou et al 2011 and can inhibit the activity of n2or once no2 is used as an electron acceptor zhao et al 2019 for example even fna levels as low as 0 1 0 2 mg n l can inhibit the electron transfer of microorganisms wang et al 2018 however fna pretreatment can change the threshold of no2 stimulated n2o production in domestic strength nitrifying cultures and enzymes and microbial communities were also affected wang et al 2016a this shows that fna can also be used for n2o mitigation in nitritation systems in short it is feasible to keep the concentration of no2 as low as possible to avoid the cytotoxic effect of fna on microorganisms and thus minimize the production of n2o 5 4 others in microbiology and chemistry ph not only affects the activity of aob nob and related enzymes but also affects the form of nitrogen in water the activity of denitrifying reductase in the anoxic stage and the nh4 oxidation rate in the aerobic stage are closely related to ph the production of n2o is related to the change of ph and the maximum yield occurs between ph 5 0 and 6 0 du et al 2016 lee et al 2019 pan et al 2012 conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of ph 6 0 to 9 0 on n2o production and found that n2o accumulated substantially at ph 6 0 then significantly decreased at ph 6 5 and did not accumulate at ph 7 0 to 9 0 low ph conditions not only inhibit relative enzyme activity by enhancing electron competition between reductases but also affect the metabolic rate of carbon substrates pan et al 2012 some specific denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas denitrificans g1 and pseudomonas stutzeri pcn 1 can affect the expression of denitrifying genes at alkaline ph 7 0 9 0 thereby reducing n2o production table 1 chen et al 2020c chen et al 2020a zheng et al 2019 however there are also studies showing that increasing ph will promote the rate of n2o production in aob enriched cultures which may be due to increased nh4 oxidation law et al 2011 the highest production of n2o occured at ph 8 0 while the lowest production was between ph 6 0 to 7 0 law et al 2011 similarly the net n2o production increased 7 times once the ph was raised from 6 5 to 8 0 su et al 2019 considering that the effect of ph on n2o production is still controversial maintaining relatively neutral ph conditions in wwtps may be more favorable for reducing n2o temperature mainly affects n2o production through chemical equilibrium enzyme activity and solubility reino et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 first the temperature disturbance will cause an imbalance between the oxidation reaction of nh4 and no2 second as shown in fig 2 d a temperature of 25 c resulted in the lowest nirk nirs nosz value indicating that n2or may be enhanced and thus the n2o accumulation rate decreased third it was found that the solubility of n2o in the denitrification stage will decrease in the temperature range of 25 30 c and it becomes a potential source of n2o once aeration begins as the temperature rose from 25 to 35 c n2o was released due to higher n2o production rate and lower n2o solubility poh et al 2015 generally the temperature suitable for activated sludge and functional enzyme activity is 15 25 c in summary the temperature should be maintained in the range of 20 25 c to achieve both n2o minimization and reactor stability previous studies have shown that n2o production mainly occurs in the aerobic phase and the emission factor decreases with the shortening of srt in n removal processes kampschreur et al 2009 li and wu 2014 mannina et al 2018a in the short srt system nob with a long generation time is eliminated while aob with a short generation time is retained resulting in no2 accumulation and an increase in n2o production for example mannina et al 2017b found that increasing the srt in the integrated fixed film activated sludge membrane bioreactor from 15 to 30 days reduced the n2o emission factor from 0 76 to 0 21 the n2o emission factor of the 25 day srt is lower than that of the 15 day srt zhou et al 2019 meantime as shown in fig 2 e nitrospira a genus of comammox that can effectively prevent the accumulation of no2 was found in the 25 day srt oxidation ditch zhou et al 2019 therefore a relatively long srt is beneficial to reduce n2o under the premise of the stable reactor operation all the above parameters directly or indirectly affect the production of n2o insufficient carbon substrate will hinder the n2o consumption pathway of hdn denitrification by inducing electron competition between reductases abnormal temperature and ph environment inhibit the activity of related key enzymes limited oxygen and high fna nitrite conditions trigger aob denitrification thus increasing the load of hdn as an n2o sink since the mechanism of n2o production is interrelated it is impractical to extract n2o under each condition multivariate analysis should be used to explore the comprehensive impact of online monitoring campaigns and process variables on n2o production in full scale wwtps and microbial mechanisms influencing factors and economic impact should be comprehensively considered in short it turns out that adjusting favorable operating parameters to exploit the potential of heterotrophic denitrification to reduce n2o has been proven effective 6 n2o production in different processes the n2o emission factor will be technically different due to the differences in feed wastewater treatment processes and metabolic pathways that produce n2o in this section n2o production in different treatment processes including conventional n removal processes advanced n removal processes and biofilm processes are discussed 6 1 n2o production in conventional n removal processes conventional n removal processes mainly involve complete nitrification and denitrification such as anoxic oxic a o process and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process as is well known most continuous operating systems are developed based on a2 o process such as reversed a2 o uct and bardenpho processes therefore aob denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification are the main pathways to produce n2o since dpaos were ubiquitous in the a2 o process the bcfs and dephanox processes were designed to make full use of dpaos to achieve simultaneous denitrification and excessive phosphorus uptake van loosdrecht et al 1998 schmitz et al 2016 lin et al 2019 studies have shown that a large amount of n2o is emitted in denitrifying phosphorus removal systems but the contribution of dpaos is not yet clear so far there are three potential ways to produce n2o first the enrichment of denitrifying polysaccharide bacteria in these systems leads to the production of n2o zeng et al 2003 second the accumulation of no2 in these systems is higher than that in conventional denitrification systems third dpao s use of internal carbon substrates increases n2o production kampschreur et al 2009 zeng et al 2019 sbrs emit less n2o than continuous operating systems such as oxidation ditch zheng et al 2015 which may be due to better control of nitrogen intermediates blum et al 2018 in particular the modified a o sbr and a2 o sbr e g oxic extended idle process oxic anoxic extended idle process and static oxic anoxic process emit less n2o due to less dependence on internal carbon sources and less no2 accumulation chen et al 2014 li et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 the oxidation ditch produces less n2o due to the uniform do concentration law et al 2012b the amount of n2o emitted in the oxidation ditch was much lower than that in the sbr reactor sun et al 2015 besides it turns out that the full scale oxidation ditch has advantages in reducing greenhouse gases compared to a o and dual cycle a o processes masuda et al 2018 as the foundation and pioneer of advanced processes conventional n removal processes have been widely used in wwtps worldwide up to now they are still the mainstream processes especially in developing countries and regions so they are still the main battlefield for reducing n2o however the knowledge of n2o production and mitigation in these processes is still incomplete and deserves further study 6 2 n2o production in advanced n removal processes contrary to conventional processes advanced n removal processes are characterized by multiple biochemical reactions or short cut nitrification processes as shown in table 2 pn a simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and nitritation denitritation nit dnit are the three major advanced n removal processes to date which have been fully investigated and applied to full scale wwtps anammox refers to the direct oxidation of nh4 to n2 using no2 as an electron acceptor under anaerobic or anoxic conditions on this basis the combination of pn a process has been effectively realized ma et al 2015 by adjusting the temperature and srt the nitrification was controlled in the nitritation stage so that the ratio of nh4 to no2 is close to 1 and then the effluent of the nitritation reactor was used as the inflow of the anammox reactor the n2o production of pn a are completely different from those of n d this is due to differences in nitrogen production pathways microbial generation time and operating conditions as mentioned above the production of n2o in the conventional n d process can be attributed to autotrophic denitrification nh2oh oxidation and heterotrophic denitrification which means that the anammox step may not be the main source of n2o due to its absolutely different metabolic pathways zhang et al 2018 some studies claim that n2o is mainly produced during the partial nitritation stage kampschreur et al 2008 okabe et al 2011 domingo félez et al 2014 during the partial nitrification process the accumulation of no2 and the limitation of do will stimulate the production of n2o however n2o production during anammox has also been confirmed which may be caused by heterotrophic denitrification anammox intermediates or other unclear pathways the production of n2o in the anammox reactor is related to the concentration of nh4 fe2 and inorganic carbon jin et al 2016 zhang and jin 2017 zhang et al 2018 in fact it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of anammox and nitritation in the canon process that realizes pn a in one reactor therefore more detailed n2o production pathways in the anammox process are of concern for the snd process nitrification and denitrification are performed simultaneously under the same operating conditions in one reactor snd has become a promising technique due to its advantages of saving carbon reducing energy and eliminating the need for alkalinity liu et al 2010 jia et al 2013b under low oxygen or micro aerobic conditions some hdn may even coexist with aob and nob especially in internal sludge flocs all possible pathways for n2o production may occur simultaneously resulting in quite complex release characteristics oxygen limited conditions can easily promote n2o accumulation so a large amount of n2o will be released in the snd system jia et al 2012 jia et al 2013a for example the o2 uptake rate reflecting the trend of n2o production was higher in snd than in n d indicating that autotrophic denitrification and degradation of intracellular polymers may occur jia et al 2012 due to the low do and no2 environment aob denitrification may play a leading role in n2o production in addition jia et al 2013a found that controlling the particle size of sludge aggregates and influent cod p ratio can effectively reduce n2o production in snd reactors due to the strict restrictions on the operating conditions of snd n2o mitigation strategies should focus on the parameters that affect the process nit dnit also known as shortcut nitrification denitrification is another representative advanced n removal process if nitritation and denitritation are performed in one reactor that is single stage nit dnit it can be identified as sharon the principle is to control the nitrification process in the no2 stage and use no2 as the final electron acceptor to directly remove nitrogen similar to pn a the nitritation process emits more n2o due to low levels of do no2 accumulation and other operating conditions for example 68 of total production were attributed to nitritation in single stage nit dnit peng et al 2017 however the anoxic n2o production accounted for 66 of the total production in full scale sharon reactors which is basically consistent with other studies kampschreur et al 2008 mampaey et al 2016 it can be considered that the n2o produced under anoxic conditions is due to heterotrophic denitrification nitrifier denitrification driven by accumulated nh2oh and oxidation of nh2oh with no2 based on the contradiction between these two results more effort should be devoted to reveal the formation mechanism of n2o in sharon 6 3 n2o production in biofilm processes biofilm is another typical biological treatment technique according to the state of microbial attachment the biofilm process can be divided into biofilter biocontact oxidation biofluidized bed and moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr due to the anoxic zone in the inner layer of the biofilm denitrification can be performed to remove total nitrogen therefore n2o will be produced during the denitrification process for example n2o was detected as a discharge from biofilm to liquid bulk during heterotrophic denitrification in a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor eldyasti et al 2014 moreover 72 25 4 86 of the total n2o was produced during the anoxic phase of the anaerobic oxic anoxic sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr ge et al 2018 besides some researchers have successfully combined membrane bioreactors mbr with biofilm processes to improve system performance such as the new mbbr based integrated fixed film activated sludge membrane bioreactor ifas mbr process di trapani et al 2014 ifas mbr has better mbr performance and lower n2o production than mbr which may be due to the presence of attached and suspended biomass indicating that biofilm may play a role in n2o mitigation mannina et al 2018c mannina et al 2018d however the specific mechanism by which n2o is generated and reduced in this process is unclear and the knowledge gap about n2o production in ifas mbr still exists in addition the contribution of aob and hdn to n2o production in sbbr is inconsistent with many other studies on activated sludge systems ge et al 2018 there is no consensus on the mechanism of n2o production in biofilms which may possess the potential to reduce n2o consequently attention should be paid to the biofilm and its modified process in summary advanced processes have better n removal performance than conventional processes but they may emit more n2o due to the required operating conditions biofilm processes have advantages in reducing n2o but the specific mechanism of n2o production has not been revealed therefore efforts on mitigation strategies should focus on influencing factors based on multiple biochemical pathways it will be a breakthrough to grasp the more detailed mechanism of n2o production in biofilms and establish a relative mathematical model from a microscopic point of view it is essential to make full use of the characteristics of the treatment process to make hdn the sink of n2o produced by all pathways from a macro perspective the optimization of parameters and the improvement of treatment processes are beneficial to reduce the production of n2o via heterotrophic denitrification 7 how to reduce n2o production based on the above discussion exerting influence on the complex metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions of aob and hdn is the key to achieving n2o mitigation fig 4 in this section the mitigation strategies studied in recent years are discussed the full scale mitigation applications over the past five years are summarized in table 3 7 1 regulation of microbial community structure the performance of nitrification and denitrification is closely related to the structure of the microbial community the predominant bacteria involved in both nitrification and denitrification play a key role in reducing n2o chen et al 2012a song et al 2014 vieira et al 2019 currently one of the main control strategies for microbial community structure is the application or enrichment of dominant bacteria such as alcaligenes faecalis a typical heterotrophic nitrifying bacterium for example the use of a three phase fluidized bed process to inoculate immobilized alcaligenes faecalis can not only control n2o production but also improve n removal efficiency kim et al 2004 in addition certain microorganisms isolated from wastewater treatment systems or the natural environments have the potential to reduce n2o and can be further utilized in the laboratory pseudomonas tolaasii strain y 11 and rhodococcus sp cpz24 isolated from long term flooded paddy soil and swine wastewater can simultaneously perform heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification with almost no n2o production and can be selected as a carrier for the snd process chen et al 2012a he et al 2016 song et al 2014 discovered unique predominant n2o reducing bacteria from two different full scale activated sludge systems including the genera rhodobacter showing excellent n2o reducing capability pcr and high throughput sequencing techniques are widely used to study microbial communities in wwtps the genetic potential of n2o reduction was discussed in a pilot scale oxidation ditch and it was found that nitrospira is closely related to avoiding no2 accumulation which is likely to be applicable to full scale wwtps zhou et al 2019 vieira et al 2019 linked n2o production to the microbial community in a full scale wwtp and found that the production of n2o is closely related to the abundance of nitrotoga candidatus microthrix and rhodobacter genera it was found that nirk denitrifiers replaced nirs denitrifiers to dominate n2o production and the nosz clade ii gene was responsible for reducing n2o vieira et al 2019 although the control of microbial community structure does not seem to be applicable to all n removal processes the identification of bacteria species can be achieved with the development of microbiology the bioremediation of n2o reducing microorganisms and the management of microbial communities can be well used to reduce n2o production in wwtps which is expected to be achieved in the future 7 2 selection of feeding strategies the denitrification pathways of aob and hdn are essentially redox reactions with a series of electron transfers there is electron competition between denitrifying reductases nar nir nor and n2or so it is easy to produce n2o when there are insufficient electron donor carbon substrates incomplete denitrification is the main reason for n2o production in the anoxic stage evidence shows that external carbon sources and proper feeding strategies can effectively solve this problem adding a carbon substrate mixture will result in a slight increase in the ratio of n2o reducing capacity to n2o producing capacity making denitrification a n2o consumption pathway conthe et al 2019 compared with ethanol and other long carbon chain compounds acetate as carbon source can produce more n2o adouani et al 2010 and methanol is superior to other carbon substrates in reducing n2o lee et al 2019 in addition despite the low total n removal rate the innovative carbon substrate mannitol can be selected to reduce n2o production zhang et al 2016a in addition better feeding strategies allow microorganisms to make extensive use of carbon substrates fig 4 studies have shown that implementing anoxic intermittent feeding to further utilize carbon substrates is a viable method to reduce n2o production peng et al 2017 su et al 2017 and multi step feeding can reduce n2o produced by nitrifier denitrification duan et al 2018 chai et al 2019 in contrast continuous feeding exhibited better performance than batch feeding in terms of n removal and n2o reduction in lab scale cyclic activated sludge systems liang et al 2015 which indicates that the feeding strategy should be adjusted according to the characteristics of the n removal process generally the addition of carbon sources and appropriate feeding strategies can reduce the electron competition between reductases and promote the reduction of n2o to n2 7 3 optimization of operating parameters reducing n2o production by optimizing operating parameters has been proven feasible in laboratory tests as mentioned in section 5 the accumulation of do and no2 has a great influence on the production of n2o by aob a model combining the two pathways of aob denitrification and nh2oh oxidation has been proposed ni et al 2014 peng et al 2015b pocquet et al 2016 at all do levels moderate no2 accumulation may trigger aob to produce n2o with negligible effect on nh2oh oxidation peng et al 2017 meanwhile the nh2oh oxidation pathway increased with increasing do concentration at all no2 levels while the n2o emission factor increased with decreasing do and no2 concentration peng et al 2015b therefore further minimizing the accumulation of no2 and controlling do will effectively reduce the n2o produced by aob however increasing the do level will result in more o2 consumption and will not inhibit nob during the nit dnit process accordingly changing the aeration strategy has always been a promising method to reduce n2o emissions since electricity consumption also causes a carbon footprint it is not recommended to increase the aeration blindly aboobakar et al 2013 according to the simulation results of the asm2d n2o model the optimal do level is between 1 8 and 2 5 mg l because too high aeration intensity will result in high power consumption and carbon footprint while too low dissolved oxygen may cause high n2o production massara et al 2018 the municipal wwtp in la roca del vallès barcelona spain uses intermittent aeration and with an n2o emission factor of 6 8 which is higher than most other data in full scale systems and may be due to the continuous fluctuation of do nh4 or no2 triggering multiple ways of generating n2o rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however whether ventilation intermittence works in n2o mitigation is contradictory between lab scale research and simulation analysis in most cases reactors with intermittent aeration can emit lower n2o which means that intermittent aeration mode with short aerobic and anoxic phases can effectively reduce n2o rodriguez caballero et al 2015 leix et al 2017 peng et al 2017 in other words proper aeration must be performed a higher aeration intensity will increase the do level in the anoxic zone through internal circulation to prevent the reduction of n2o to n2 while too low do levels will lead to incomplete nitrification and aob denitrification but is conducive to heterotrophic denitrification sun et al 2017 a step stage aeration mode based on the demand of microorganisms for do was proposed which seems to be feasible for the plug flow a2 o process wang et al 2016b other operating parameters such as temperature ph srt etc will also have a significant impact on n2o production therefore mitigation strategies based on these factors cannot be ignored avoiding acidic conditions during denitrification is beneficial for reducing n2o and the optimal ph is 7 5 to 8 0 pan et al 2012 the lower ph 6 0 to 7 0 obtained at slow feed rates under aerobic conditions especially in aob rich cultures can effectively inhibit n2o production law et al 2011 in the n removal process n2o is mainly produced in the aerobic stage and decreases with the increase of srt while the relative abundance of nirk and n2or is lower under shorter srt conditions li and wu 2014 zhou et al 2019 besides due to the sensitivity of related functional enzymes to abnormal temperatures extremely high or low temperatures may cause n2o accumulation poh et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 in conclusion controlling aeration is essential to inhibit aob denitrification relatively neutral ph 6 5 7 0 moderate temperature approximately 20 c and appropriate long srt are beneficial for the nitrifier and denitrifier to maintain a stable enzyme reaction so that n2o can be consumed smoothly through complete denitrification 7 4 copper additive nirk and n2or are both copper containing enzymes and their active center has catalytic site called cuz which contains copper ions zhu and chen 2011 accordingly the lack of cu2 will easily inhibit the activity of these reductases thereby preventing the reduction of n2o to n2 in heterotrophic denitrification zhu and chen 2011 chen et al 2012b zhu et al 2013 the use of sludge fermentation liquid containing cu2 as an additional carbon substrate significantly reduced the production of n2o and no and did not affect the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus zhu and chen 2011 in addition the activity of reductases is related to ph conditions therefore controlling the concentration of cu2 to a certain level and ensuring a stable acidic environment is an effective method to reduce n2o production 7 5 process improvement for specific wastewater and environmental conditions it is important to choose the appropriate type of n removal process for domestic wastewater containing relatively moderate levels of cod total nitrogen and soluble orthophosphate it is best to use the a2 o process therefore the n2o mitigation strategy can be studied by modifying the operating scheme of the a2 o process chen et al 2014 eliminated the anaerobic phase and extended the idle phase by alternately changing the aerobic and anoxic phases and observed a significant reduction in n2o production zeng et al 2019 replaced the anaerobic phase with a shortened static phase to treat simulated domestic sewage which also reduced the production of n2o furthermore proper prolongation of the anoxic phase and reduction of aerobic no2 concentration can also reduce the production of n2o in the a o process wang et al 2019 for nitrogen enriched wastewater although low do conditions may increase n2o production advanced n removal processes such as nit dnit or pn a processes are satisfactory choices considering economics the key is to suppress the effects of no2 accumulation in advanced n removal systems for example intermittent aeration and feeding in nit dnit sbr treating co digested pig slurry can significantly inhibit no2 accumulation and reduce n2o production by approximately 99 peng et al 2017 however for more complex wastewater a combination technology involving chemical treatment is required in sharon n2o formed in the anoxic stage is considered an important source but the mechanism of n2o production is still unclear it has been observed that minimizing or avoiding anoxic conditions can significantly reduce n2o production in a full scale partial nitritation reactor mampaey et al 2016 as mentioned in section 5 the transient conditions of do may be a trigger for the surge of n2o indicating the effectiveness and feasibility of avoiding anoxia conversely extending the length of the anoxic phase to ensure heterotrophic n2o reducing capacity in the carrousel oxidation ditch is considered an effective n2o mitigation strategy chen et al 2019 therefore it is feasible to change the operation mode of full scale wwtps by adjusting the period of the n removal process and it needs to be examined and optimized according to different denitrification processes the strategies proposed in recent years are based on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of aob and hdn which have been effectively implemented in the laboratory and ultimately determined the optimization of the n removal process however considerable knowledge gaps still exist such as the abundance of newly isolated microorganisms functional gene dynamics in microbial mechanisms and large scale applications which provide important guidance for ongoing exploration 7 6 denitrification as an n2o sink as mentioned above aob and hdn are two key sources of n2o as illustrated in fig 5 the effective way to minimize n2o accumulation is to reduce its production from no and nh2oh and promote complete denitrification to ensure its reduction to n2 for example a mathematical model of a granular sludge reactor that describes the influencing factors of n2o production in a one stage pn a system concludes that hdn will dominate the fate of n2o reduction to n2 wan et al 2019 besides hdn with more specific genes e g nosz clade ii have a greater capacity to reduce n2o in three full scale wwtps vieira et al 2019 however due to the difference in the number of n2or and nir proteins rather than gene overexpression the n2o reducing capacity is excessive which must be considered in modeling and n2o mitigation strategy research conthe et al 2019 in addition since hdn have a dual impact on the net production and reduction of n2o chen et al 2019 it is recommended to implement more comprehensive strategies in wwtps to make full use of hdn as the only scavenger the key is to increase the potential for reducing n2o during the denitrification process as shown in fig 5 coupling strategies will be a good choice such as process upgrades and operating condition adjustments for a2 o based processes it is recommended to combine a staged aeration mode with increased hypoxia exposure the former can significantly increase the level of do without high gas stripping and can avoid the inhibitory effect of do concentration on n2or during the anoxic stage the latter can be achieved by properly extending the anoxic period or increasing the circulation rate of the reactor which provides a more anoxic environment to reduce n2o to n2 in this way the reduction of n2o during heterotrophic denitrification will be enhanced and aob denitrification will be well suppressed in advanced n removal processes the combination of intermittent feeding or carbon metering strategies and strict control of operating parameters such as ph and water temperature can reduce the electron competition between reductases thereby enhancing the ability to reduce n2o in addition it is encouraged to link the mitigation strategies of full scale wwtps with microbial analysis based on genetic level research since the n2o reducing capacity of hdn can be 10 times the production capacity it is expected to obtain a stable 10 fold or higher n2o reduction potential by utilizing the physiologic characteristics of hdn and controlling community abundance and denitrification gene expression only in this way can the microorganisms that reduce and produce n2o be fully utilized to properly control the transition of hdn from source to sink even so there are still many bottlenecks that need to be resolved first although increasingly more research is focused on the microbial community and the genetic potential of n2o reduction the knowledge gap in the field of biochemistry under complex environmental conditions limits the current exploration resulting in the metabolic pathways are still unclear hence it is not easy to further enhance the net n2o reducing capacity of hdn second there is no standardized methodology for establishing n2o mitigation strategies in full scale systems most full scale applications are implemented based on short term or medium term monitoring campaigns which can easily lead to deviations between observed and actual values therefore the main gap lies in the identification of appropriate n2o mitigation measures and their integration into the control of wwtps in addition the above strategies inevitably bring a series of problems such as increasing power consumption adding additional expensive stoichiometric equipment and changing the configuration of the reactor since reducing ghgs and recycling resources have become part of the new goals of wwtps there must be a trade off between wastewater quality carbon footprint reduction and economic benefits therefore there is still a long way to go to achieve the excellent performance of n removal and energy saving and n2o mitigation in wwtps 8 conclusions and future directions 8 1 conclusions new hdn strains with excellent n2o reducing capacity are constantly being isolated and identified and hdn will become one of the hotspots for future research microbiology studies using molecular methods have deepened our understanding of the biochemical pathways that produce n2o during the n removal process but the knowledge gap about microbial diversity still exists although the current models can predict the trend of n2o production well the simulated values are not accurate enough the current models are more suitable for qualitative analysis and it is still a challenge to improve their quantitative prediction capabilities at present most of the researches are focused on optimizing parameters and simulating production pathways without discussing in depth the potential of denitrification as an n2o sink multivariate analysis should be valued to explore the comprehensive impact of online monitoring campaigns and process variables on n2o production in full scale wwtps meanwhile microbial mechanisms influencing factors and economic impact should also be taken into account advanced n removal processes emit more n2o than conventional ones biofilm processes have advantages in reducing n2o but the specific n2o production mechanism has not been revealed the combination of multiple mitigation strategies such as biological enhancement of n2o consuming bacteria and proper control of operating conditions has proven to be feasible and effective in converting denitrification from n2o sources to sinks 8 2 future directions there is still a considerable knowledge gap in understanding the microbial diversity that produces and reduces n2o further research is needed to clarify the biochemistry of the isolated strains and to isolate new hdn strains with excellent n2o reducing capacity it is necessary to fully clarify the n2o production in advanced n removal processes especially anammox and biofilm processes the identification of new pathways such as bio abiotic coupling pathways is especially critical continuous improvement and validation based on the existing mathematical models are significant combining current microbiological and biochemical knowledge of aob and hdn to describe all n2o production pathways and assess the denitrification potential as a n2o sink is a top priority n2o quantification and monitoring technology can be developed to accurately estimate n2o in full scale wwtps the traditional goals of wwtps are changed by adding new content reducing ghg emissions and recycling resources these facts require wwtp operators to adopt new methods and collect new information with the advent of the era of big data establishing a database of n2o emission factors and standard protocols based on local environmental conditions can play a vital role in the global ghg assessment the mitigation strategies implemented in the laboratory only make sense if they are applied to full scale wwtps on the basis of understanding the metabolic pathways of microorganisms that reduce n2o further attempts and explorations are needed to develop more comprehensive measures to give full play to the ability of hdn to reduce n2o and denitrification becomes the ultimate destination of n2o declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

g c3n4 based catalysts with high performance and cost effectiveness are promising heterogeneous catalysts for aops most research on g c3n4 based catalysts focuses on photocatalytic oxidation but increasingly researchers are paying attention to the application of g c3n4 based catalysts in other aops beyond photocatalysis this review aims to concisely highlight recent state of the art progress

based catalysts in water treatment are also mentioned lastly perspectives on the major challenges and opportunities of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are proposed for better developments in the future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes carbon nitride organic pollutants degradation water treatment 1 introduction with fast growth of industrialization and population the water contamination caused by organic pollutants is becoming a serious global issue that threatens public health and safety li et al 2020b yang et al 2020b 2018a various synthetic organics e g dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps etc are discharged into wastewaters and eventually enter natural water bodies chen et al 2020b lefebvre and moletta 2006 liu and wong 2013 tian et al 2020 it is well known that most of these compounds are persistent organic pollutants pops which will threaten the living organisms including human beings brown and wright 2016 muir and howard 2006 song et al 2018 a variety of physical and biological treatment methods have been employed for the removal of organic pollutants from water such as adsorption ultrafiltration and coagulation lei et al 2020a xiong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however insufficient capacity to remove trace organic pollutants and possible secondary pollution limit their practical applications thus highly efficient and environmentally friendly treatment processes are required for the removal of residual organic pollutants from water advanced oxidation processes aops have stimulated great interest from researchers around the world owing to their high efficiency in degrading and even mineralizing organic pollutants from water jia et al 2020 klavarioti et al 2009 tan et al 2020 yang et al 2020c moreover aops are more environmentally friendly than physical and biological treatment processes as they will not release masses of deleterious residues or divert organic pollutants from one phase to another oturan and aaron 2014 ye et al 2019a yi et al 2019 in aops almost all types of organic pollutants can be degraded or mineralized into intermediate products or co2 and h2o the outstanding activity and versatility of aops are originated from the production of highly reactive species such as oh so4 1o2 and o2 which can efficiently attack the target contaminants leading to their decomposition li et al 2020c wang and xu 2012 yang et al 2018b specifically aops include homogeneous aops and heterogeneous aops the heterogeneous aops generally utilize solid catalysts in combination with other systems h2o2 o3 persulfates light etc to degrade organic pollutants lin et al 2020 liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 compared with homogeneous catalysts the main advantage of heterogeneous catalysts is the convenience of catalysts recovery for practical applications in water decontamination heterogeneous catalysts must meet some requirements such as high activity sustainability as well as physical and chemical stability accordingly many efforts have been paid to the exploitation of efficient and durable heterogeneous catalysts for aops graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has recently emerged as promising catalyst in aops because of its simple synthesis low cost and toxicity unique electronic structure and good stability he et al 2019b wang et al 2020c zhou et al 2019 as a metal free conjugated polymer semiconductor the relatively narrow bandgap about 2 7 ev of g c3n4 endows it with a superior light absorption capacity yang et al 2019d zhou et al 2020a besides the inherent functional groups and vacancies as well as the sp2 hybridized carbon network are conductive to the generation and migration of delocalized electrons wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020a meanwhile g c3n4 possesses a two dimensional layered structure and six nitrogen lone pair electrons which are in favor of the immobilization and dispersion of metal species song et al 2019a yang et al 2019c benefiting from these excellent characteristics g c3n4 based catalysts have been widely applied in aops especially photocatalysis to degrade organic pollutants from water guo et al 2020a wang et al 2019d 2020e zhang et al 2020a and considerable reviews present broad introduction on the application of g c3n4 based catalysts in photocatalytic oxidation ding et al 2017 hao et al 2020 huang et al 2019a mamba and mishra 2016 ong et al 2016 however it is hard to achieve deep mineralization for organic pollutants using photocatalysis moreover the changeable weather and complex photoreactor also restrict the extensive large scale and practical applications of photocatalysis loeb et al 2019 melchionna and fornasiero 2020 wang et al 2020a in recent years some other aops based on g c3n4 based catalysts have drawn great attention owing to their superior oxidation ability and operational stability such as fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation in these processes oxidants like h2o2 o3 and persulfates can be activated by g c3n4 based catalysts to generate highly reactive species for the degradation of organic contaminants in water fig 1 therefore it is necessary to give a timely review of the progress of g c3n4 based catalysts in those concerned aops as a state of the art review the chief objective of this work is to highlight recent advances of g c3n4 based catalysts in aops beyond photocatalysis the catalytic performance and reaction mechanism of g c3n4 based catalysts in three classical aops including fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation are discussed meanwhile the effect of water chemistry on the catalytic performance of g c3n4 based catalysts are summarized such as ph water temperature natural organic matter inorganic anions and dissolved oxygen additionally the reusability stability and toxicity of g c3n4 based catalysts in water treatment are mentioned ultimately the challenges and opportunities faced by g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are presented 2 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton based processes fenton reaction is recognized as one of the most effective strategy for degrading organic contaminants from water deng et al 2020 li et al 2020a pignatello et al 2006 in a typical fenton reaction fe2 catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh eq 1 khataee et al 2016 the generated oh can quickly destroy the pollutant structure owing to its high oxidation potential more importantly the formed fe3 can be reduced to fe2 by h2o2 through the fenton like reaction eq 2 gholami et al 2020b which enables the continuous generation of oh however the application of conventional fenton reaction is generally restricted by its inherent shortcomings such as narrow range of working ph accumulation of fe containing sludge and poor reusability to overcome these problems numerous heterogeneous fenton like catalysts were developed to replace the homogeneous process cheng et al 2018b huang et al 2019b li et al 2019c 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o oh 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 in the past few years introducing metal species into g c3n4 to construct fenton like catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in water table 1 has attracted great interest because of its excellent characteristics such as efficient catalytic activity high stability and environmental friendliness for example wang and nan 2020 utilized fe doped g c3n4 fe g c3n4 to catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 for degrading methylene blue mb the pyridinic n in g c3n4 was easily bonded with the fe atoms to form active sites thus enhancing the catalytic activity owing to the presence of abundant active sites of fe ii nx and fe iii nx the fe g c3n4 exhibited excellent activity in fenton like oxidation achieving 83 7 removal of total organic carbon toc in 60 min moreover the g c3n4 supported iron oxide cn io was also reported to be an efficient fenton like catalyst for the degradation of ciprofloxacin cip ding et al 2019 under the experimental conditions almost all cip was degraded and 48 5 cip was mineralized which was ascribed to the accelerated redox cycle of fe iii fe ii by g c3n4 apart from iron species some other metal species have also been introduced into g c3n4 to fabricate fenton like catalyst the cu i was incorporated into g c3n4 for the degradation of various organic pollutants ma et al 2019b during the formation of g c3n4 the cu ii could be reduced by the released carbon and nitride fragments to form cu i which would be conductive to the enhancement of fenton like activity the removal efficiencies of rhodamine b rhb acid red 73 ar 73 bisphenol a bpa and tetracycline tc were 99 2 96 0 94 6 and 84 4 respectively indicating that the cu i doped g c3n4 cu i g c3n4 was an effective fenton like catalyst to degrade different kinds of organic pollutants in addition ge et al 2018 combined the mgo with g c3n4 to activate h2o2 for the degradation of organic dyes the g c3n4 mgo presented outstanding degradation activities for both anionic and cationic dyes such as methyl orange mo mb and rhb it was found that the mgn and co bonding between mgo and g c3n4 played a critical role in the degradation reaction via activating h2o2 to generate oh nevertheless the content of metals in these g c3n4 based catalysts was relatively low resulting in the unsatisfactory catalytic performance in fenton like oxidation bicalho et al 2017 luo et al 2016 and when the metal content increased it easily aggregated to form large particles leading to a reduction in the number of catalytic active sites teixeira et al 2018 to effectively improve the activity of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton like oxidation some g c3n4 based catalysts with high metal content and dispersion were developed for example zhu et al 2019 synthesized cu doped g c3n4 cu g c3n4 with high content of cu nx species by calcining the precursor of melamine templated crystalline copper chloride in the optimal cu g c3n4 composite the cu content was up to 25 9 wt and the cu was uniformly dispersed in the g c3n4 matrix the presence of abundant cu nx species could accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh therefore the cu g c3n4 presented superior catalytic activities for the degradation of rhb mo and mb moreover decorating g c3n4 with metals in forms of ultra small clusters and single atoms has drawn much attention due to the high atom utilization efficiency li et al 2019e an et al 2018 successfully embedded high density ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites in g c3n4 i fenx g c3n4 by calcining a mixture of fe imidazole coordination compound and melamine the nitrogen pots with six nitrogen lone pair electrons in g c3n4 could efficiently trap and stabilize ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites as shown in fig 2 a d high density 18 2 wt ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites were uniformly dispersed in the g c3n4 and no iron nanoparticles could be observed the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy images also showed the uniform distribution of c n and fe elements fig 2e the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra fig 2f and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra fig 2g further demonstrated that the fe nx structure was formed as the fe ii nx active sites could quickly decompose h2o2 to produce oh the i fenx g c3n4 catalyst exhibited excellent removal efficiency for mb despite no light fig 2h additionally the iron leaching of i fenx g c3n4 catalyst was 0 69 mg l 1 which was much lower than the nano fe3o4 2 3 mg l 1 and fe3o4 9 8 mg l 1 as well as the european union standard 2 mg l 1 khataee et al 2017 li et al 2019b xu and wang 2012 indicating that the fe ii nx configurations was stably implanted into g c3n4 although some achievements have been done on these g c3n4 based fenton like catalysts there are still some inadequacies and need further improvements typically the reduction of the metals anchored on g c3n4 through the oxidation of h2o2 is slow leading to the insufficient redox cycle of the metals additionally in this process h2o2 is finally decomposed into o2 or o2 which will cause the waste of h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 lyu et al 2015 to resolve these problems the g c3n4 based catalysts with dual reaction centers were developed to enhance the catalytic activity in fenton like process for example xu et al 2018 constructed a novel cu al2o3 g c3n4 catalyst to promote the selective conversion of h2o2 to oh for enhancing the fenton like catalytic activity in the cu al2o3 g c3n4 system the electron rich area around cu was formed because of the higher electronegativity of cu than al as well as the cu π interactions between cu and g c3n4 therefore the oh could be generated by two different electron transfer processes the one was from the electron rich cu center to h2o2 to produce oh and the other was from h2o to the electron poor site to form oh benefiting from the significant increase of oh generation the cu al2o3 g c3n4 catalyst exhibited high activities for the degradation of organic pollutants including rhb bpa mb 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d and phenytoin sodium pht besides lyu et al 2018 combined g c3n4 with in situ formed cu ii on the surface of cualo2 substrate to fabricate a new fenton like catalyst the cocu bonding bridge on g c3n4 cu ii cualo2 could efficiently strengthen the cation π interaction through the charge transfer as verified by the density functional theory dft calculations fig 3 a and b and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis fig 3c the dual reaction centers were formed around the cu and c sites in cn cu ii cualo2 which was ascribed to the cation π interaction via the cocu linkage as depicted in fig 3d the h2o2 was efficiently reduced by electrons to oh on the electron rich cu center meanwhile the electrons on h2o2 and pollutants were trapped by the electron poor c center and then diverted to the electron rich area through the cocu linkage therefore the catalytic activity of cn cu ii cualo2 for the degradation of bpa was greatly enhanced compared with that of g c3n4 and cualo2 moreover the cn cu ii cualo2 also exhibited excellent catalytic activities for the degradation of other refractory pollutants such as phenol 2 chlorphenol ibuprofen and phenytoin indicating its huge potential in water purification to further improve the activity of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton like oxidation carbonaceous materials with excellent electron transport property and chemical stability were introduced ma et al 2019a wang et al 2019a for example the graphitized mesoporous carbon gmc was hybridized with fe g c3n4 for the degradation of ar 73 ma et al 2017 the gmc not only provided a mesoporous structure for the growth of g c3n4 but also offered a similar sp2 bonding structure to promote the electron transfer benefiting from the accelerated fe iii fe ii redox cycle the fe g c3n4 gmc composite showed high activity for ar 73 degradation in the fenton like reaction obtaining 99 2 removal in 40 min additionally enhanced adsorption 10 7 caused by the introduction of gmc in fe g c3n4 gmc composite might also contribute to the accelerated degradation of ar 73 the carbon nanodots cds were also effective in enhancing the catalytic activity of fe ii doped g c3n4 fe ii g c3n4 in fenton like reaction because they could promote the decomposition of h2o2 to produce more oh fang et al 2019 in the presence of h2o2 the cds fe ii g c3n4 composite presented superior activity in the fenton like system for mb degradation quenching experiments and epr measurements suggested that oh and o2 were the main reactive species responsible for the mb degradation and o2 was originated from the reaction between h2o2 and oh the utilization of solar light to construct a photo fenton system is also an effective way to enhance the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts as g c3n4 based catalysts can be easily excited by visible light to generate electrons and holes li et al 2016 in this process the fe iii fe ii redox cycle can be greatly accelerated by the photogenerated electrons thereby facilitating the decomposition of h2o2 to oh and promoting the degradation of organic pollutants herney ramirez et al 2010 soon and hameed 2011 for example a fe2o3 quantum dots qds g c3n4 composite was fabricated to catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 for degrading p nitrophenol under visible light xi et al 2019 the excellent separation and transfer of photogenerated charges on fe2o3 qds g c3n4 could result in the continuous and fast conversion of fe iii fe ii therefore the activation of h2o2 was improved and the degradation rate of p nitrophenol was dramatically enhanced moreover a photo fenton like membrane was assembled for wastewater treatment by using g c3n4 sol and fe containing polyoxometalates fe poms as precursors lan et al 2019 owing to the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and fenton like reaction the photo fenton like membrane displayed outstanding self catalytic capacity for degrading retained pollutants besides the construction of photo electro fenton like system based on g c3n4 has also stimulated great research interest yue et al 2018 in this process the h2o2 is in situ generated in the cathode through the two electron reduction of o2 and then the h2o2 can be activated by the g c3n4 based catalysts to generate oh for the degradation of organic pollutants recently a photo electro fenton like system with wo3 g c3n4 was fabricated for cip degradation bai et al 2019 compared with the photocatalysis system and electro fenton like system the photo electro fenton like system showed superior degradation efficiency for cip and achieved 80 3 mineralization efficiency within 120 min in a word in fenton based processes g c3n4 can act as an excellent support to immobilize metal species thus improving the catalytic activity and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts specifically the layered structure of g c3n4 is an effective support for loading of the metal species which can suppress the mobility improve the dispersion and avoid the aggregation of metal species meanwhile the nitrogen pots with six nitrogen lone pair electrons in g c3n4 are ideal sites for trapping metal species the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during fenton based processes are depicted in fig 1 the active metal species on g c3n4 based catalysts can decompose h2o2 to generate oh o2 and 1o2 which will lead to the degradation of organic pollutants 3 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in catalytic ozonation as a powerful oxidant it is well known that o3 can react with many organic pollutants however the oxidation of some organic pollutants by o3 is relatively slow because of the selectivity of o3 to organics leading to the incomplete removal of pollutants or formation of toxic intermediate products esplugas et al 2007 hubner et al 2015 in addition o3 presents a low mineralization rate for organic pollutants due to the generation and accumulation of some intermediate products that cannot react with o3 such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids nawrocki and kasprzykhordern 2010 to address these issues some advanced technologies such as o3 h2o2 process and o3 uv process were developed to activate o3 miklos et al 2018 among these the catalytic ozonation process has stimulated much research interest as it can promote the activation of o3 to generate reactive oxygen species ros by the addition of some catalysts wang and bai 2017 wang and chen 2020 compared with homogeneous catalytic ozonation heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is greener more economical and more convenient therefore many efforts have been devoted to developing novel heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic ozonation graphitic carbon nitride based catalysts have been demonstrated to be effective heterogeneous catalysts in catalytic ozonation for degrading organic pollutants from water table 2 normally the delocalized electrons and surface oxygen containing functional groups are responsible for the activity of g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation song et al 2019b found that the g c3n4 exhibited activity in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid p cba and benzotriazole bza due to the presence of electron rich nitrogen vacancies and surface oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl group and carbonyl group compared with the sole ozonation apparent rate constant k obs 0 069 and 0 057 min 1 the catalytic ozonation by adding g c3n4 urea presented better activity for p cba and bza degradation k obs 0 116 and 0 156 min 1 during the reaction the o3 captured the delocalized electrons from the electron rich nitrogen vacancies in g c3n4 to form the o3 eq 3 and then the ho3 eq 4 which rapidly transformed into oh eq 5 moreover the o3 decomposed aromatic rings in organic species to olefins which subsequently reacted with o3 to form h2o2 meanwhile the carbonyl group in g c3n4 also enhanced the h2o2 production eq 6 and the reaction of h2o2 and o3 could generated more oh and o2 eqs 7 and 8 therefore the activity of g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation was greatly enhanced in addition the doping of o atoms could increase the amount of surface oxygen containing functional groups and nitrogen vacancies of g c3n4 thus enhancing the performance catalytic ozonation yuan et al 2019 the degradation efficiency of atrazine atz through catalytic ozonation over the oxygen functionalized g c3n4 o g c3n4 was increased by 29 76 in comparison with the sole ozonation 3 o 3 e o 3 4 o 3 h 2 o h o 3 o h 5 h o 3 o 2 oh 6 g c 3 n 4 c o o 3 h 2 o g c 3 n 4 c o h 2 o 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h 2 o ho 2 h 3 o 8 o 3 h 3 o oh o 2 o 2 it has been reported that metal species could significantly promote the decomposition of o3 to produce ros wang and bai 2017 wang et al 2019b accordingly numerous g c3n4 based metal containing catalysts have been constructed recently to realize the synergistic effect of g c3n4 and metal species for efficient catalytic ozonation for example the zno g c3n4 was found to be highly active in catalytic ozonation and the k obs of atz degradation was 2 73 min 1 which was almost 10 5 times higher than that of ozone alone yuan et al 2018a the enhanced activity was owing to the host guest interaction between g c3n4 and zno as well as the increased surface area and improved electron transfer ability tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq and nan3 were utilized as ros scavengers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the degradation efficiency of atz in zno g c3n4 o3 system was greatly inhibited after the addition of ros scavengers implying that o2 1o2 and oh were the major reactive species responsible for atz degradation besides the g c3n4 could also provide an ideal site to accommodate ce iii thus accelerating the formation of surface hydroxyl groups xie et al 2020 as a result the ce iii doped g c3n4 ce iii g c3n4 possessed a high catalytic ozonation activity in oxalate degradation which was ascribed to the synergistic effect of surface hydroxyl groups and ce iii active site moreover the lacoo3 g c3n4 exhibited an outstanding activity in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of bza due to the formation of electron transfer cycle zhang et al 2019b the electron transfer cycle in lacoo3 g c3n4 which was induced by the coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy could accelerate the decomposition of o3 to generate more oh thus promoting the bza degradation as shown in fig 4 a and b the kobs raised with the increase of the relative content of coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy indicating the positive role of coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy in lacoo3 g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation the mechanism for lacoo3 g c3n4 catalytic ozonation was displayed in fig 4c first the o3 trapped the single electrons from nitrogen vacancies to generate o3 eq 3 meanwhile the o3 was decomposed by the coco bonding to form o2 and 1o2 eq 9 and the o3 could react with oh to produce o2 and ho2 eq 10 additionally the o2 captured the delocalized electrons from electron rich centers to generate o2 eq 11 then a series of radical chain reactions eqs 4 and 12 were induced by the o2 and ho2 to produce oh eq 5 thus the catalytic ozonation activity of lacoo3 g c3n4 for bza degradation was significantly improved 9 o 3 c o co o 2 1 o 2 o 2 10 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 11 o 2 e o 2 12 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 furthermore the g c3n4 based catalysts were also utilized in o3 h2o2 process to promote the formation of oh under acidic conditions in general the production of oh in o3 h2o2 process is limited under acidic conditions as the ho2 that can induce free radical chain reactions to generate oh is mainly formed under alkaline conditions li et al 2015 sein et al 2008 to overcome this drawback guo et al 2019 anchored single mn atoms on g c3n4 mn cn to accelerate the oh formation for the degradation of oxalic acid oa as shown in fig 5 a and b the mn cn catalyst exhibited high activity for oa degradation in the o3 h2o2 process which was ascribed to the increased yield of oh fig 5c the chronoamperometry curves fig 5d and epr measurements fig 5e suggested that the ho2 was formed in the interaction between mn cn and h2o2 and the o3 could promote the formation of ho2 the energy change plot for different steps fig 5f further confirmed the reaction mechanism during the reaction fig 5g the mn n4 site in mn cn catalyst adsorbed h2o2 to form the hoo mn n4 species which then reacted with o3 to generate ho2 and o3 o3 would combine with h in acidic solution to generate ho3 and it rapidly transformed to oh meanwhile ho2 converted to o2 which could also react with o3 to produce o3 therefore the yield of oh was increased and the degradation efficiency of oa was significantly enhanced the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during catalytic ozonation are presented in fig 1 in brief the delocalized electrons and surface oxygen containing functional groups on g c3n4 can promote the transformation of o3 to generate oh and o2 additionally the immobilized metal species on g c3n4 also can activate o3 to produce oh o2 and 1o2 consequently these generated ros will accelerate the degradation of organic pollutants 4 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in persulfates activation as an effective and promising technology for the degradation of organic pollutants in water the aops based on persulfates including peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 or peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 have received increasing attention in recent years qin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b persulfates are strong oxidants and the redox potential for pms and pds are 1 82 v and 2 01 v respectively compared with h2o2 and o3 the persulfates is more convenient for storage and transportation because they usually exist as solid power however their direct reaction with most organic pollutants is so slow which need further activation for practical applications in previous studies numerous strategies such as uv heat alkali ultrasound transition metals and carbon based catalysts have been utilized for persulfates activation where reactive radicals e g so4 and oh or nonradical species 1o2 and surface bound complexes are generated for effectively degrading organic pollutants liu et al 2020b wang and wang 2018 among these approaches heterogeneous catalysis has attracted extensive interests due to its less energy consumption high catalytic activity and outstanding reusability wu et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 therefore many efforts have been devoted to exploring heterogeneous catalysts for persulfates activation graphitic carbon nitride based catalysts have been considered as effective catalysts for activating persulfates to degrade organic pollutants table 3 normally the catalytic activity of g c3n4 in persulfates activation is originated from the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups defective edges and sp2 hybridized carbon network dong et al 2016 duan et al 2015 however the physicochemical properties of g c3n4 prepared by different precursors and calcination procedures are usually somewhat different which may affect their activity for the activation of persulfates guan et al 2020 investigated the influences of different precursors e g melamine dicyandiamide and urea and calcination atmosphere e g air and n2 on the catalytic activity of g c3n4 in pms activation as shown in fig 6 a and b the obtained g c3n4 catalysts exhibited different catalytic activities for pms activation to degrade bpa and the g c3n4 prepared from melamine and calcined in n2 possessed the best performance the difference in their catalytic activities was because of the variation in the type and amount of active sites caused by the different preparation procedures generally methanol meoh p bq and l histidine l his were used as ros scavengers for so4 and oh o2 and 1o2 respectively gholami et al 2020a xu et al 2020 the quenching experiments fig 6c and epr tests demonstrated that so4 and oh rather than o2 or 1o2 were the major ros responsible for the degradation of bpa meanwhile the g c3n4 also exhibited effective catalytic activity to degrade phenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 4 6 tbp acetaminophen act sulfamethoxazole smx ibuprofen ibp and benzoic acid ba via activating pms fig 6d further excluding the contribution of surface bound reactive complexes accordingly the mechanism of pms activation by g c3n4 was proposed in fig 6e first pms was decomposed by the active sites on the surface of g c3n4 via an electron transfer pathway to form so4 eq 13 and so5 eq 14 then the so4 could react with h2o to generate oh eq 15 while the so5 could self react to generate so4 eq 16 resulting in the bpa degradation 13 hso 5 e so 4 o h 14 hso 5 e so 5 h 15 so 4 h 2 o oh h so 4 2 16 2 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 however the catalytic performance of pure g c3n4 in persulfates activation is greatly suppressed by its poor electron transfer capability lin et al 2018b to improve the electron mobility of g c3n4 for efficiently activating persulfates gao et al 2018b prepared o doped g c3n4 ocn with modulated electronic structure as displayed in fig 7 a and b compared with pure g c3n4 the electronic structure of ocn was altered due to the substitution of n atoms by o atoms because the electronegativity of o atom is higher than that of c atom and n atom the electrons of c atoms would flow to the o atom leading to formation of high and low electron density regions around the o atom and c atom respectively consequently the electron transfer on ocn would be accelerated which was confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis spectra fig 7c benefiting from the modulated electronic structure the ocn exhibited excellent catalytic activity in pms activation for the degradation of bpa cip and 2 chlorophenol 2 cp the epr tests and quenching experiments fig 7d indicated that the ocn could activate pms to generate so4 oh and 1o2 in which 1o2 was the major ros responsible for bpa degradation the n2 saturated experiment and linear sweep voltammetry lsv analysis fig 7e further demonstrated that 1o2 was originated from the pms oxidation rather than from the conversion of o2 therefore the mechanism of pms activation by ocn could be proposed as depicted in fig 7f the one was the pms oxidation by electron poor c atoms to form so5 followed by the reaction between so5 and h2o to generate 1o2 the other was the pms reduction by the electrons around the electron rich o atoms to generate so4 and oh as many metal species can activate persulfates to degrade organic pollutants it is reasonable to expect that incorporation of metal species could effectively enhance the catalytic performance of g c3n4 towards persulfates activation li et al 2017 oh et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a meanwhile the unique structure of g c3n4 with two dimensional layered nanosheets and six nitrogen lone pair electrons is conductive to the immobilization and dispersion of metal species therefore many efforts have been devoted to incorporating metal species into g c3n4 for enhancing persulfates activation nguyen et al 2019 qin et al 2019 yang et al 2019a for example xie et al 2019 synthesized co doped g c3n4 co g c3n4 for pms activation to degrade monochlorophenols mcps isomers including 2 cp 3 chlorophenol 3 cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp the co g c3n4 exhibited superior catalytic activity in pms activation compared with g c3n4 due to the doping of co the co doping could promote the generation of so4 eqs 17 20 resulting in the improved degradation of mcps meanwhile the adsorption experiments and quantum chemical calculations demonstrated that the adsorption behavior based on the intermolecular interactions between co g c3n4 and mcps was benefit to the process of mcps degradation fan et al 2019 prepared mn doped g c3n4 mn g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of act the catalytic performance of g c3n4 was significantly improved by the doping of mn further researches demonstrated that 1o2 rather than so4 or oh was the active species responsible for the degradation of act in addition to transition metal species noble metal species were also introduced into g c3n4 feng et al 2018a wang et al 2017 found that pd nanoparticles could greatly enhance the performance of g c3n4 in pms activation to degrade bpa because it could promote the formation of surface bound radical intermediates 17 co ii g c 3 n 4 hso 5 co iii g c 3 n 4 so 4 o h 18 co iii g c 3 n 4 hso 5 co ii g c 3 n 4 so 5 h 19 co iii g c 3 n 4 e co ii g c 3 n 4 20 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh interestingly it has been found that high valent iron oxo species e g feiv o and fev o instead of ros e g so4 oh and 1o2 were responsible for the degradation of organic pollutants in persulfates activation by fe g c3n4 li et al 2019a for example feng et al 2018b synthesized fe ii g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of phenol compared with g c3n4 the fe ii g c3n4 possessed superior catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade phenol which was attributed to the formation of feiv o the feiv o could rapidly degrade the phenol through electron transfer li et al 2018 employed fe iii doped g c3n4 fe iii g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of 4 cp as shown in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of 4 cp increased with the increase of fe iii content in fe iii g c3n4 when oxalate and citrate were added the degradation efficiency of 4 cp was decreased fig 8b and c these results suggested that the embedded fe iii in g c3n4 framework acted as the active sites for 4 cp degradation moreover the epr test and quenching experiments demonstrated that traditional ros in persulfates activation e g so4 oh and 1o2 played an insignificant role in degrading 4 cp however the degradation efficiency of 4 cp was suppressed by adding the dimethyl sulfoxide dmso fig 8d which is a probe compound for high valent iron oxo species the dmso can be oxidized by the high valent iron oxo species to generate the dimethyl sulfone dmso2 accordingly it could be concluded that the fev o was formed on fe iii g c3n4 in pms activation resulting in the 4 cp degradation via nonradical pathway as described in fig 8e in comparison with monometallic species bimetallic species have a better catalytic activity for persulfates activation because of the strengthened synergistic effect of metallic elements and the presence of abundant redox reactions chen et al 2017 lei et al 2020b lin et al 2018a thus a series of bimetallic species have been incorporated into g c3n4 to activate persulfates for example pi et al 2020 synthesized cofeo2 g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of levofloxacin lvf the cofeo2 g c3n4 displayed a higher catalytic performance than cofeo2 in activating pms to degrade lvf due to the accelerated redox cycles of metal species during the reaction co ii and fe iii activated hso5 to form so4 eqs 21 and 22 while fe ii and co iii activated hso5 to form so5 eqs 23 and 24 resulting in the lvf degradation li et al 2020d fabricated feco2s4 g c3n4 to degrade smx through the activation of pms owing to the synergistic effect between feco2s4 and g c3n4 the catalytic activity of feco2s4 g c3n4 was superior to feco2s4 g c3n4 and co3s4 g c3n4 the degradation efficiency of smx was determined to be 60 1 17 8 73 9 and 91 9 for feco2s4 g c3n4 co3s4 g c3n4 and feco2s4 g c3n4 respectively for feco2s4 g c3n4 1o2 was identified to be the dominant active species responsible for smx degradation 21 hso 5 co ii co iii so 4 o h 22 hso 5 fe iii fe ii so 4 h 23 hso 5 co iii co ii so 5 h 24 hso 5 fe ii fe iii so 5 o h additionally metal free materials with high electrical conductivity were employed to accelerate the electron transfer on g c3n4 for enhancing the activation of persulfates chen et al 2018 guo et al 2018 ye et al 2019b for example wei et al 2016 combined g c3n4 with activated carbon ac to activate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants compared with g c3n4 and ac the g c3n4 ac composite exhibited superior catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade acid orange 7 ao 7 which was ascribed to the synergistic effect between g c3n4 and ac firstly the specific surface area of g c3n4 ac was larger than that of g c3n4 which could provide more active sites and increase the adsorption ability for ao 7 secondly the effective interfacial contact between g c3n4 and ac could greatly facilitate the electron transfer on g c3n4 therefore both the radical generation so4 and oh and the nonradical effect in pms activation were significantly enhanced resulting in the efficient degradation of organic pollutants yao et al 2019 introduced covalent organic framework cof into g c3n4 to promote pms activation for the degradation of orange ii the electron transfer between g c3n4 cof and pms was boosted which was attributed to the good balance between nitrogen content and graphitization degree as a result the g c3n4 cof showed excellent catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade orange ii because of the strengthened nonradical pathway induced by boosted electron transfer recently the combination of photocatalysis and persulfates activation has drawn increasing attention because the synergistic effect between them could significantly improve the catalytic performance gao et al 2017 wang et al 2020d yang et al 2019b normally the persulfates can be activated by the photogenerated electrons on g c3n4 based catalysts to generate so4 and oh resulting in the boosted persulfates activation and enhanced organic pollutants degradation for example gao et al 2018a utilized a co3o4 qds g c3n4 heterostructure to degrade tc under visible light in the presence of pms compared to the case without visible light or pms the degradation efficiency was greatly enhanced which was ascribed to the cooperative effect between photocatalysis and persulfates activation in the study of li et al 2019d the cufe2o4 g c3n4 composite exhibited improved catalytic performance on pds activation under visible light for the degradation of propranolol due to the self redox cycles of iron and copper in cufe2o4 and the accelerated formation of so4 moreover our group recently developed a novel carbonyl and carboxyl groups co modified g c3n4 and employed it for the pms activation under visible light to degrade chlortetracycline hydrochloride guo et al 2020b in this system the photogenerated electrons were gathered around the electron withdrawing carbonyl and carboxyl groups of g c3n4 the pms could be quickly activated by these electrons to generate so4 and oh leading to the efficient degradation of chlortetracycline hydrochloride the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during persulfates activation are displayed in fig 1 in short the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups defective edges sp2 hybridized carbon network and photogenerated electrons of g c3n4 can facilitate the decomposition of persulfates to produce so4 and oh moreover the loaded metal species on g c3n4 also can activate persulfates to generate so4 oh o2 and 1o2 especially the fe n complex on fe g c3n4 can bound to pms resulting in the formation of high valent iron oxo species as a result these reactive species will promote the degradation of organic pollutants 5 the effect of water chemistry on catalytic performance 5 1 effect of ph due to the variable ph values of actual wastewater it is very important to clarify the effect of ph on the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts in aops normally the solution ph affects the surface properties of g c3n4 based catalysts the structural forms of target contaminants and the decomposition of oxidants h2o2 o3 and persulfates thereby influencing the catalytic performance the ph at point of zero charge phpzc can help determine the effect of ph on the surface charge of the catalyst when the solution ph is less than phpzc the surface of the catalyst is positively charged and when the solution ph is greater than phpzc the surface of the catalyst is negatively charged for example the phpzc of zero valent zinc immobilized g c3n4 zvz g c3n4 was determined to be 5 96 yuan et al 2018b at the initial ph above phpzc the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged as zvz g c3n4 o group therefore the zvz g c3n4 showed superior catalytic ozonation performance on atz degradation in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 since o3 is more likely to react with negatively charged surface fig 9 a in the study of li et al 2020d the phpzc of feco2s4 g c3n4 was determined to be 5 9 accordingly at the initial ph of 3 5 or 5 0 and 6 5 8 0 or 9 5 the surface charge of feco2s4 g c3n4 was positive and negative respectively because the smx existed as anionic species in the ph range of 3 5 9 5 the interaction between feco2s4 g c3n4 and smx was enhanced at the initial ph of 3 5 and 5 0 promoting the degradation of smx in the presence of pms in addition the decomposition of oxidants are also influenced by the solution ph in alkali media the oxidability of h2o2 is weakened because of its decomposition to o2 and h2o cheng et al 2018a the activity of o3 alone for organic pollutants degradation under acidic conditions is unsatisfactory however at high ph the abundant oh can react with o3 to accelerate the formation of oh thus promoting the degradation of organic pollutants nawrocki and kasprzykhordern 2010 wang and chen 2020 moreover the pms will decomposed to so4 2 o2 and h2o at high ph inhibiting the generation of ros ball and edwards 1956 as shown in fig 9b in the g c3n4 pms system the k obs of bpa degradation increased with ph increasing from 5 0 to 7 0 and then decreased as ph further increased to 9 0 guan et al 2020 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the following reasons at lower ph values the electron transfer from g c3n4 surface to pms was inhibited moreover the alkaline conditions weakened the interaction between g c3n4 surface and hso5 and accelerated the self decomposition of pms nonetheless most of the g c3n4 based catalysts were applicable in a wide ph range for the degradation of organic pollutants for example gao et al 2018b reported that pms could be activated by ocn in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 to efficiently degrade bpa fig 9c the zno g c3n4 exhibited excellent activity in a wide ph range of 3 5 9 5 for atz degradation in catalytic ozonation yuan et al 2018a the degradation efficiency of atz at each ph value was all over 95 5 within 3 min indicating the slight effect of solution ph on the azt degradation normally the classical fenton reaction only works better under acidic conditions because it easily forms iron precipitates under neutral and alkaline conditions compared to recent novel heterogeneous fenton like catalysts such as fe pd c he et al 2019a and nfe2o3 mil 53 cu ren et al 2020 which only worked in a narrow ph range of 3 0 6 0 the g c3n4 based catalysts usually performed well in a wider ph range for example in the study of lyu et al 2018 the cncu ii cualo2 catalyst exhibited effective activity for bpa degradation in a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 and possessed the highest activity under the neutral conditions no significant variation in the removal efficiency of bpa could be observed in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 with the change of initial ph and although the removal efficiency of bpa slightly decreased with the increase of initial ph in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 it could still achieve 70 at ph 9 0 after 120 min reaction which was attributed to its dual reaction centers moreover the cu i g c3n4 also displayed satisfactory activity for the degradation of rhb in a wide ph range of 5 0 11 0 ma et al 2019b unlike traditional fenton like reactions the removal efficiency of rhb increased with the increase of solution ph in the ph range of 3 0 6 0 while remained almost unchanged as the ph further increased to 11 0 the efficient activity of cu i g c3n4 for rhb degradation at higher ph values was ascribed to the 1o2 which was more easily generated under the alkaline conditions than the acidic conditions 5 2 effect of water temperature at ambient temperature the g c3n4 based catalysts can perform well in fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation slight temperature changes will not obviously affect the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts for degrading organic pollutants through these aops for example the degradation efficiencies of bpa in the cn cu ii cualo2 h2o2 system at 25 c 30 c and 35 c were 90 93 and 96 respectively lyu et al 2018 however if the water temperature fluctuates greatly the degradation rate of organic pollutants will also change significantly especially in persulfates activation because heat is an effective method to activate persulfates lin et al 2018b utilized s doped g c3n4 s g c3n4 to activate pds for the degradation of rhb as shown in fig 9d the k obs of rhb degradation was increased from 0 005 min 1 to 0 014 min 1 as the temperature was raised from 20 c to 60 c moreover in the feco2s4 g c3n4 pms system with the rise of temperature from 10 c to 40 c the degradation effciecny of smx was remarkably increased from 61 2 to 99 9 and the k obs of smx degradation was also increased from 0 059 min 1 to 0 294 min 1 li et al 2020d 5 3 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic substances which is extensively distributed in ground water surface water and wastewater in aops the nom usually competes with target organic pollutants for ros leading to the reduction in degradation efficiency as a major constituent of nom humic acid ha can react with o3 which may depress the performance of catalytic ozonation in the zno g c3n4 o3 system the k obs of atz degradation decreased from 1 84 to 0 57 min 1 when the ha concentration increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mg l 1 which was ascribed to the competition between ha and atz for both o3 and ros yuan et al 2018a however in the o g c3n4 o3 system fig 9e the production of oh was increased owing to the reaction between electron rich moieties of ha and o3 resulting in the accelerated atz degradation yuan et al 2019 in addition the nom can also inhibit the g c3n4 based catalysts to active persulfates because its abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups retard the reaction between persulfates and g c3n4 based catalysts to generate reactive species for example in the fe iii g c3n4 pms system the degradation efficiency of 4 cp declined from 93 to 72 with nom concentration increasing from 1 0 to 20 0 mg l 1 li et al 2018 this was mainly because of the delayed reaction between pms and fe iii g c3n4 caused by nom as well as the competitive reaction between nom and 4 cp 5 4 effect of inorganic anions inorganic anions are also ubiquitous in ground water surface water and wastewater which can serve as radical scavengers resulting in an inhibitory effect on the radical based degradation of organic pollutants for example in the zvz g c3n4 o3 system the hco3 obviously suppressed atz degradation since the oh was scavenged by hco3 yuan et al 2018b in the g c3n4 mnfe2o4 pms system the triclosan tcs degradation was inhibited by the hco3 and low concentration of cl which was attributed to the formation of less reactive radical species such as hco3 co3 and cl while the high concentration of cl could promote the degradation of tcs because of the generation of strong oxidizing species such as cl2 and hocl wang et al 2019c besides the effect of inorganic anions on organic contaminants degradation in the nonradical dominated process is usually insignificant in the feco2s4 g c3n4 pms system the 1o2 dominated nonradical pathway was determined to be the major process for smx degradation thus the cl hco3 and h2po4 showed unremarkable impact on the degradation of smx li et al 2020d similarly as exhibited in fig 9f in the o cn pms system with 1o2 as the major ros the effect of cl hco3 and co3 2 on the degradation of bpa was negligible gao et al 2018b however in pms activation some inorganic anions such as h2po4 li et al 2019a and f li et al 2018 would hinder the formation of high valent iron oxo species due to the complexation between inorganic anions and iron species leading to a slight decline in degradation efficiency 5 5 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the essential parameters of water chemistry it has been found that do could get involved in the free radical chain reactions thereby influencing the degradation of organic pollutants fang et al 2013 lu et al 2019 generally as an electron acceptor do can react with one electron of catalysts to form o2 which can be further reduced to h2o2 when two protons are present nosaka and nosaka 2017 besides the process of persulfates activation can also be affected by do zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 however there are limited reports on the effect of do on the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops meanwhile these reports demonstrated that the effect of do in the fenton based processes and persulfates activation over g c3n4 based catalysts was insignificant for example in the cds fe ii g c3n4 h2o2 system fang et al 2019 there was no obvious change in the degradation efficiency of mb in the absence of o2 moreover in the o cn pms system gao et al 2018b the bpa degradation was not inhibited after n2 saturation implying that the 1o2 was not derived from the do in reaction solution 6 reusability stability and toxicity from the view of practical applications the reusability and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are vital for the treatment of wastewater normally the g c3n4 based catalysts could still keep good catalytic performance after multiple successive cycles for example in fenton like oxidation the catalytic activity of cu al2o3 g c3n4 for rhb degradation decreased insignificantly after 7 successive cycles reaching a removal efficiency of 91 in 60 min xu et al 2018 in catalytic ozonation the decline of the catalytic performance of cuo g c3n4 for oa degradation was not obvious after 5 successive cycles liu et al 2020a in pms activation 90 removal of tcs was obtained over g c3n4 mnfe2o4 after 5 successive cycles wang et al 2019c in these cycles at lab scale centrifugation recovery and magnetic recovery were usually utilized to recover catalyst powder from the reaction suspension however in practical applications they may be complicated and expensive because of the need to install a large capacity centrifuge or a large electromagnetic system recently catalytic membranes have drawn considerable interest in practical applications due to the simple operation with no need to recover catalyst chen et al 2020a fabricated a mn3o4 g c3n4 polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane via a facile vacuum filtration method and used it to activate pms for 4 cp degradation fig 10 a and b as shown in fig 10c the catalytic performance of mn3o4 g c3n4 ptfe membrane still maintained at high level after 5 successive cycles and was able to remove 80 of 4 cp in 60 min the stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops was also confirmed by a series of characterizations such as x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem in the study of ma et al 2019b the xanes spectra and exafs spectra showed that the chemical state and coordination structure of the cu in cu i g c3n4 had no apparent changes before and after reaction fig 10d and e the xps spectra also indicated that the cu i was stably existed in g c3n4 via n coordination after reaction fig 10f moreover it has been reported that g c3n4 was chemically stable toward o2 and o3 xiao et al 2017 and although oh can directly tear the heptazine unit from g c3n4 to generate secondary pollutants the presence of organic pollutants will hinder the fragmentation of g c3n4 in the study of song et al 2019b the sem tem and atomic force microscopy afm images as well as the xrd and raman spectra displayed that the morphology crystal structure and framework of g c3n4 were only slightly changed after catalytic ozonation suggesting the high stability of g c3n4 and epr spectra exhibited that the amount of delocalized electrons in g c3n4 decreased not obviously after catalytic ozonation further verifying the relative chemical stability of g c3n4 overall these results demonstrated the good reusability and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops for the degradation of organic contaminants additionally the toxicity of g c3n4 based catalysts determines their further practical applications in general the toxicity of g c3n4 based materials is closely associated with their structure morphology composition and physicochemical properties such as the surface status dispersion and hydrophilicity chen et al 2015 liao et al 2020 some investigations have demonstrated that the g c3n4 based materials had low toxicity and good biocompatibility which could meet the requirements of practical applications for example zhang et al 2013 reported that the ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets possessed nontoxicity and excellent biocompatibility by assessing the viability of hela cells after incubation with the g c3n4 via an mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 3 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay even if the concentration of incubated g c3n4 was as high as 600 μg ml 1 there was no distinct decrease in cell viability feng et al 2016 found that the up conversion nanoparticles ucnp g c3n4 polyethylene glycol peg composite itself had no obvious toxicity to hela cells in the study of he et al 2020 although the short lived ros generated by g c3n4 at a concentration of 50 mg l 1 or more under simulated solar light would exert injury to the hatched zebrafish larvae the presence of nom in water could diminish the hazardous effect 7 conclusions and perspectives in conclusion the g c3n4 based catalysts presented excellent catalytic activities in fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation and could efficiently degrade organic contaminants from water through these aops in fenton based processes and catalytic ozonation the oh activated by g c3n4 based catalysts was the major reactive species for degrading organic pollutants while in persulfates activation the so4 oh 1o2 and high valent iron oxo species were responsible for the degradation of organic pollutants the effect of water chemistry on catalytic performance indicated that the g c3n4 based catalysts could work in a relatively complex water environment in addition most of the g c3n4 based catalysts exhibited excellent reusability and stability in these aops for organic contaminants degradation and showed good biocompatibility although some achievements have been made there are still many challenges to utilize g c3n4 based catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in water through aops beyond photocatalysis some points are listed as follows 1 the catalytic activity and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts should be further improved despite the high degradation efficiency there is still much room for improvement in the mineralization rate moreover the stability of some g c3n4 based catalysts is unsatisfactory due to the loss of active sites and the leaching of metal species thus it is significant to optimize the synthetic methods of g c3n4 based catalysts and develop new types of g c3n4 based catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and stability 2 the oxidation mechanism of organic pollutants and the toxicity of reaction intermediates should be deeply investigated theoretical calculation based on dft can provide a method to reveal the most preferentially attacked sites and potential reaction intermediates of target contaminants meanwhile it is necessary to assess the eco toxicity or human toxicity of these intermediate products as they are even more toxic than their parent compounds in some cases 3 the degradation activity test should be performed in the actual wastewater normally there is a huge difference between the composition of simulated wastewater and actual wastewater which makes the removal efficiency obtained in simulated wastewater less persuasive therefore it is recommended to develop g c3n4 based catalysts to target the actual wastewater which will be beneficial to identify the real challenges in practical applications 4 the scale of the experiments should be enlarged to date most investigations have been executed at the lab scale using small reactors to achieve the practical applicability of the g c3n4

17652,advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted much interest in the field of water treatment owing to their high removal efficiency for refractory organic contaminants graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 based catalysts with high performance and cost effectiveness are promising heterogeneous catalysts for aops most research on g c3n4 based catalysts focuses on photocatalytic oxidation but increasingly researchers are paying attention to the application of g c3n4 based catalysts in other aops beyond photocatalysis this review aims to concisely highlight recent state of the art progress of g c3n4 based catalysts in aops beyond photocatalysis emphasis is made on the application of g c3n4 based catalysts in three classical aops including fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation the catalytic performance and involved mechanism of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are discussed in detail meanwhile the effect of water chemistry including ph water temperature natural organic matter inorganic anions and dissolved oxygen on the catalytic performance of g c3n4 based catalysts are summarized moreover the reusability stability and toxicity of g c3n4 based catalysts in water treatment are also mentioned lastly perspectives on the major challenges and opportunities of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are proposed for better developments in the future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes carbon nitride organic pollutants degradation water treatment 1 introduction with fast growth of industrialization and population the water contamination caused by organic pollutants is becoming a serious global issue that threatens public health and safety li et al 2020b yang et al 2020b 2018a various synthetic organics e g dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps etc are discharged into wastewaters and eventually enter natural water bodies chen et al 2020b lefebvre and moletta 2006 liu and wong 2013 tian et al 2020 it is well known that most of these compounds are persistent organic pollutants pops which will threaten the living organisms including human beings brown and wright 2016 muir and howard 2006 song et al 2018 a variety of physical and biological treatment methods have been employed for the removal of organic pollutants from water such as adsorption ultrafiltration and coagulation lei et al 2020a xiong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however insufficient capacity to remove trace organic pollutants and possible secondary pollution limit their practical applications thus highly efficient and environmentally friendly treatment processes are required for the removal of residual organic pollutants from water advanced oxidation processes aops have stimulated great interest from researchers around the world owing to their high efficiency in degrading and even mineralizing organic pollutants from water jia et al 2020 klavarioti et al 2009 tan et al 2020 yang et al 2020c moreover aops are more environmentally friendly than physical and biological treatment processes as they will not release masses of deleterious residues or divert organic pollutants from one phase to another oturan and aaron 2014 ye et al 2019a yi et al 2019 in aops almost all types of organic pollutants can be degraded or mineralized into intermediate products or co2 and h2o the outstanding activity and versatility of aops are originated from the production of highly reactive species such as oh so4 1o2 and o2 which can efficiently attack the target contaminants leading to their decomposition li et al 2020c wang and xu 2012 yang et al 2018b specifically aops include homogeneous aops and heterogeneous aops the heterogeneous aops generally utilize solid catalysts in combination with other systems h2o2 o3 persulfates light etc to degrade organic pollutants lin et al 2020 liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 compared with homogeneous catalysts the main advantage of heterogeneous catalysts is the convenience of catalysts recovery for practical applications in water decontamination heterogeneous catalysts must meet some requirements such as high activity sustainability as well as physical and chemical stability accordingly many efforts have been paid to the exploitation of efficient and durable heterogeneous catalysts for aops graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has recently emerged as promising catalyst in aops because of its simple synthesis low cost and toxicity unique electronic structure and good stability he et al 2019b wang et al 2020c zhou et al 2019 as a metal free conjugated polymer semiconductor the relatively narrow bandgap about 2 7 ev of g c3n4 endows it with a superior light absorption capacity yang et al 2019d zhou et al 2020a besides the inherent functional groups and vacancies as well as the sp2 hybridized carbon network are conductive to the generation and migration of delocalized electrons wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020a meanwhile g c3n4 possesses a two dimensional layered structure and six nitrogen lone pair electrons which are in favor of the immobilization and dispersion of metal species song et al 2019a yang et al 2019c benefiting from these excellent characteristics g c3n4 based catalysts have been widely applied in aops especially photocatalysis to degrade organic pollutants from water guo et al 2020a wang et al 2019d 2020e zhang et al 2020a and considerable reviews present broad introduction on the application of g c3n4 based catalysts in photocatalytic oxidation ding et al 2017 hao et al 2020 huang et al 2019a mamba and mishra 2016 ong et al 2016 however it is hard to achieve deep mineralization for organic pollutants using photocatalysis moreover the changeable weather and complex photoreactor also restrict the extensive large scale and practical applications of photocatalysis loeb et al 2019 melchionna and fornasiero 2020 wang et al 2020a in recent years some other aops based on g c3n4 based catalysts have drawn great attention owing to their superior oxidation ability and operational stability such as fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation in these processes oxidants like h2o2 o3 and persulfates can be activated by g c3n4 based catalysts to generate highly reactive species for the degradation of organic contaminants in water fig 1 therefore it is necessary to give a timely review of the progress of g c3n4 based catalysts in those concerned aops as a state of the art review the chief objective of this work is to highlight recent advances of g c3n4 based catalysts in aops beyond photocatalysis the catalytic performance and reaction mechanism of g c3n4 based catalysts in three classical aops including fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation are discussed meanwhile the effect of water chemistry on the catalytic performance of g c3n4 based catalysts are summarized such as ph water temperature natural organic matter inorganic anions and dissolved oxygen additionally the reusability stability and toxicity of g c3n4 based catalysts in water treatment are mentioned ultimately the challenges and opportunities faced by g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are presented 2 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton based processes fenton reaction is recognized as one of the most effective strategy for degrading organic contaminants from water deng et al 2020 li et al 2020a pignatello et al 2006 in a typical fenton reaction fe2 catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh eq 1 khataee et al 2016 the generated oh can quickly destroy the pollutant structure owing to its high oxidation potential more importantly the formed fe3 can be reduced to fe2 by h2o2 through the fenton like reaction eq 2 gholami et al 2020b which enables the continuous generation of oh however the application of conventional fenton reaction is generally restricted by its inherent shortcomings such as narrow range of working ph accumulation of fe containing sludge and poor reusability to overcome these problems numerous heterogeneous fenton like catalysts were developed to replace the homogeneous process cheng et al 2018b huang et al 2019b li et al 2019c 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o oh 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 in the past few years introducing metal species into g c3n4 to construct fenton like catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in water table 1 has attracted great interest because of its excellent characteristics such as efficient catalytic activity high stability and environmental friendliness for example wang and nan 2020 utilized fe doped g c3n4 fe g c3n4 to catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 for degrading methylene blue mb the pyridinic n in g c3n4 was easily bonded with the fe atoms to form active sites thus enhancing the catalytic activity owing to the presence of abundant active sites of fe ii nx and fe iii nx the fe g c3n4 exhibited excellent activity in fenton like oxidation achieving 83 7 removal of total organic carbon toc in 60 min moreover the g c3n4 supported iron oxide cn io was also reported to be an efficient fenton like catalyst for the degradation of ciprofloxacin cip ding et al 2019 under the experimental conditions almost all cip was degraded and 48 5 cip was mineralized which was ascribed to the accelerated redox cycle of fe iii fe ii by g c3n4 apart from iron species some other metal species have also been introduced into g c3n4 to fabricate fenton like catalyst the cu i was incorporated into g c3n4 for the degradation of various organic pollutants ma et al 2019b during the formation of g c3n4 the cu ii could be reduced by the released carbon and nitride fragments to form cu i which would be conductive to the enhancement of fenton like activity the removal efficiencies of rhodamine b rhb acid red 73 ar 73 bisphenol a bpa and tetracycline tc were 99 2 96 0 94 6 and 84 4 respectively indicating that the cu i doped g c3n4 cu i g c3n4 was an effective fenton like catalyst to degrade different kinds of organic pollutants in addition ge et al 2018 combined the mgo with g c3n4 to activate h2o2 for the degradation of organic dyes the g c3n4 mgo presented outstanding degradation activities for both anionic and cationic dyes such as methyl orange mo mb and rhb it was found that the mgn and co bonding between mgo and g c3n4 played a critical role in the degradation reaction via activating h2o2 to generate oh nevertheless the content of metals in these g c3n4 based catalysts was relatively low resulting in the unsatisfactory catalytic performance in fenton like oxidation bicalho et al 2017 luo et al 2016 and when the metal content increased it easily aggregated to form large particles leading to a reduction in the number of catalytic active sites teixeira et al 2018 to effectively improve the activity of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton like oxidation some g c3n4 based catalysts with high metal content and dispersion were developed for example zhu et al 2019 synthesized cu doped g c3n4 cu g c3n4 with high content of cu nx species by calcining the precursor of melamine templated crystalline copper chloride in the optimal cu g c3n4 composite the cu content was up to 25 9 wt and the cu was uniformly dispersed in the g c3n4 matrix the presence of abundant cu nx species could accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh therefore the cu g c3n4 presented superior catalytic activities for the degradation of rhb mo and mb moreover decorating g c3n4 with metals in forms of ultra small clusters and single atoms has drawn much attention due to the high atom utilization efficiency li et al 2019e an et al 2018 successfully embedded high density ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites in g c3n4 i fenx g c3n4 by calcining a mixture of fe imidazole coordination compound and melamine the nitrogen pots with six nitrogen lone pair electrons in g c3n4 could efficiently trap and stabilize ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites as shown in fig 2 a d high density 18 2 wt ultra small fe clusters and single atom fe sites were uniformly dispersed in the g c3n4 and no iron nanoparticles could be observed the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy images also showed the uniform distribution of c n and fe elements fig 2e the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra fig 2f and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra fig 2g further demonstrated that the fe nx structure was formed as the fe ii nx active sites could quickly decompose h2o2 to produce oh the i fenx g c3n4 catalyst exhibited excellent removal efficiency for mb despite no light fig 2h additionally the iron leaching of i fenx g c3n4 catalyst was 0 69 mg l 1 which was much lower than the nano fe3o4 2 3 mg l 1 and fe3o4 9 8 mg l 1 as well as the european union standard 2 mg l 1 khataee et al 2017 li et al 2019b xu and wang 2012 indicating that the fe ii nx configurations was stably implanted into g c3n4 although some achievements have been done on these g c3n4 based fenton like catalysts there are still some inadequacies and need further improvements typically the reduction of the metals anchored on g c3n4 through the oxidation of h2o2 is slow leading to the insufficient redox cycle of the metals additionally in this process h2o2 is finally decomposed into o2 or o2 which will cause the waste of h2o2 bokare and choi 2014 lyu et al 2015 to resolve these problems the g c3n4 based catalysts with dual reaction centers were developed to enhance the catalytic activity in fenton like process for example xu et al 2018 constructed a novel cu al2o3 g c3n4 catalyst to promote the selective conversion of h2o2 to oh for enhancing the fenton like catalytic activity in the cu al2o3 g c3n4 system the electron rich area around cu was formed because of the higher electronegativity of cu than al as well as the cu π interactions between cu and g c3n4 therefore the oh could be generated by two different electron transfer processes the one was from the electron rich cu center to h2o2 to produce oh and the other was from h2o to the electron poor site to form oh benefiting from the significant increase of oh generation the cu al2o3 g c3n4 catalyst exhibited high activities for the degradation of organic pollutants including rhb bpa mb 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d and phenytoin sodium pht besides lyu et al 2018 combined g c3n4 with in situ formed cu ii on the surface of cualo2 substrate to fabricate a new fenton like catalyst the cocu bonding bridge on g c3n4 cu ii cualo2 could efficiently strengthen the cation π interaction through the charge transfer as verified by the density functional theory dft calculations fig 3 a and b and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis fig 3c the dual reaction centers were formed around the cu and c sites in cn cu ii cualo2 which was ascribed to the cation π interaction via the cocu linkage as depicted in fig 3d the h2o2 was efficiently reduced by electrons to oh on the electron rich cu center meanwhile the electrons on h2o2 and pollutants were trapped by the electron poor c center and then diverted to the electron rich area through the cocu linkage therefore the catalytic activity of cn cu ii cualo2 for the degradation of bpa was greatly enhanced compared with that of g c3n4 and cualo2 moreover the cn cu ii cualo2 also exhibited excellent catalytic activities for the degradation of other refractory pollutants such as phenol 2 chlorphenol ibuprofen and phenytoin indicating its huge potential in water purification to further improve the activity of g c3n4 based catalysts in fenton like oxidation carbonaceous materials with excellent electron transport property and chemical stability were introduced ma et al 2019a wang et al 2019a for example the graphitized mesoporous carbon gmc was hybridized with fe g c3n4 for the degradation of ar 73 ma et al 2017 the gmc not only provided a mesoporous structure for the growth of g c3n4 but also offered a similar sp2 bonding structure to promote the electron transfer benefiting from the accelerated fe iii fe ii redox cycle the fe g c3n4 gmc composite showed high activity for ar 73 degradation in the fenton like reaction obtaining 99 2 removal in 40 min additionally enhanced adsorption 10 7 caused by the introduction of gmc in fe g c3n4 gmc composite might also contribute to the accelerated degradation of ar 73 the carbon nanodots cds were also effective in enhancing the catalytic activity of fe ii doped g c3n4 fe ii g c3n4 in fenton like reaction because they could promote the decomposition of h2o2 to produce more oh fang et al 2019 in the presence of h2o2 the cds fe ii g c3n4 composite presented superior activity in the fenton like system for mb degradation quenching experiments and epr measurements suggested that oh and o2 were the main reactive species responsible for the mb degradation and o2 was originated from the reaction between h2o2 and oh the utilization of solar light to construct a photo fenton system is also an effective way to enhance the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts as g c3n4 based catalysts can be easily excited by visible light to generate electrons and holes li et al 2016 in this process the fe iii fe ii redox cycle can be greatly accelerated by the photogenerated electrons thereby facilitating the decomposition of h2o2 to oh and promoting the degradation of organic pollutants herney ramirez et al 2010 soon and hameed 2011 for example a fe2o3 quantum dots qds g c3n4 composite was fabricated to catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 for degrading p nitrophenol under visible light xi et al 2019 the excellent separation and transfer of photogenerated charges on fe2o3 qds g c3n4 could result in the continuous and fast conversion of fe iii fe ii therefore the activation of h2o2 was improved and the degradation rate of p nitrophenol was dramatically enhanced moreover a photo fenton like membrane was assembled for wastewater treatment by using g c3n4 sol and fe containing polyoxometalates fe poms as precursors lan et al 2019 owing to the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and fenton like reaction the photo fenton like membrane displayed outstanding self catalytic capacity for degrading retained pollutants besides the construction of photo electro fenton like system based on g c3n4 has also stimulated great research interest yue et al 2018 in this process the h2o2 is in situ generated in the cathode through the two electron reduction of o2 and then the h2o2 can be activated by the g c3n4 based catalysts to generate oh for the degradation of organic pollutants recently a photo electro fenton like system with wo3 g c3n4 was fabricated for cip degradation bai et al 2019 compared with the photocatalysis system and electro fenton like system the photo electro fenton like system showed superior degradation efficiency for cip and achieved 80 3 mineralization efficiency within 120 min in a word in fenton based processes g c3n4 can act as an excellent support to immobilize metal species thus improving the catalytic activity and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts specifically the layered structure of g c3n4 is an effective support for loading of the metal species which can suppress the mobility improve the dispersion and avoid the aggregation of metal species meanwhile the nitrogen pots with six nitrogen lone pair electrons in g c3n4 are ideal sites for trapping metal species the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during fenton based processes are depicted in fig 1 the active metal species on g c3n4 based catalysts can decompose h2o2 to generate oh o2 and 1o2 which will lead to the degradation of organic pollutants 3 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in catalytic ozonation as a powerful oxidant it is well known that o3 can react with many organic pollutants however the oxidation of some organic pollutants by o3 is relatively slow because of the selectivity of o3 to organics leading to the incomplete removal of pollutants or formation of toxic intermediate products esplugas et al 2007 hubner et al 2015 in addition o3 presents a low mineralization rate for organic pollutants due to the generation and accumulation of some intermediate products that cannot react with o3 such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids nawrocki and kasprzykhordern 2010 to address these issues some advanced technologies such as o3 h2o2 process and o3 uv process were developed to activate o3 miklos et al 2018 among these the catalytic ozonation process has stimulated much research interest as it can promote the activation of o3 to generate reactive oxygen species ros by the addition of some catalysts wang and bai 2017 wang and chen 2020 compared with homogeneous catalytic ozonation heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is greener more economical and more convenient therefore many efforts have been devoted to developing novel heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic ozonation graphitic carbon nitride based catalysts have been demonstrated to be effective heterogeneous catalysts in catalytic ozonation for degrading organic pollutants from water table 2 normally the delocalized electrons and surface oxygen containing functional groups are responsible for the activity of g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation song et al 2019b found that the g c3n4 exhibited activity in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid p cba and benzotriazole bza due to the presence of electron rich nitrogen vacancies and surface oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl group and carbonyl group compared with the sole ozonation apparent rate constant k obs 0 069 and 0 057 min 1 the catalytic ozonation by adding g c3n4 urea presented better activity for p cba and bza degradation k obs 0 116 and 0 156 min 1 during the reaction the o3 captured the delocalized electrons from the electron rich nitrogen vacancies in g c3n4 to form the o3 eq 3 and then the ho3 eq 4 which rapidly transformed into oh eq 5 moreover the o3 decomposed aromatic rings in organic species to olefins which subsequently reacted with o3 to form h2o2 meanwhile the carbonyl group in g c3n4 also enhanced the h2o2 production eq 6 and the reaction of h2o2 and o3 could generated more oh and o2 eqs 7 and 8 therefore the activity of g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation was greatly enhanced in addition the doping of o atoms could increase the amount of surface oxygen containing functional groups and nitrogen vacancies of g c3n4 thus enhancing the performance catalytic ozonation yuan et al 2019 the degradation efficiency of atrazine atz through catalytic ozonation over the oxygen functionalized g c3n4 o g c3n4 was increased by 29 76 in comparison with the sole ozonation 3 o 3 e o 3 4 o 3 h 2 o h o 3 o h 5 h o 3 o 2 oh 6 g c 3 n 4 c o o 3 h 2 o g c 3 n 4 c o h 2 o 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 h 2 o ho 2 h 3 o 8 o 3 h 3 o oh o 2 o 2 it has been reported that metal species could significantly promote the decomposition of o3 to produce ros wang and bai 2017 wang et al 2019b accordingly numerous g c3n4 based metal containing catalysts have been constructed recently to realize the synergistic effect of g c3n4 and metal species for efficient catalytic ozonation for example the zno g c3n4 was found to be highly active in catalytic ozonation and the k obs of atz degradation was 2 73 min 1 which was almost 10 5 times higher than that of ozone alone yuan et al 2018a the enhanced activity was owing to the host guest interaction between g c3n4 and zno as well as the increased surface area and improved electron transfer ability tert butanol tba p benzoquinone p bq and nan3 were utilized as ros scavengers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the degradation efficiency of atz in zno g c3n4 o3 system was greatly inhibited after the addition of ros scavengers implying that o2 1o2 and oh were the major reactive species responsible for atz degradation besides the g c3n4 could also provide an ideal site to accommodate ce iii thus accelerating the formation of surface hydroxyl groups xie et al 2020 as a result the ce iii doped g c3n4 ce iii g c3n4 possessed a high catalytic ozonation activity in oxalate degradation which was ascribed to the synergistic effect of surface hydroxyl groups and ce iii active site moreover the lacoo3 g c3n4 exhibited an outstanding activity in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of bza due to the formation of electron transfer cycle zhang et al 2019b the electron transfer cycle in lacoo3 g c3n4 which was induced by the coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy could accelerate the decomposition of o3 to generate more oh thus promoting the bza degradation as shown in fig 4 a and b the kobs raised with the increase of the relative content of coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy indicating the positive role of coco bonding and nitrogen vacancy in lacoo3 g c3n4 in catalytic ozonation the mechanism for lacoo3 g c3n4 catalytic ozonation was displayed in fig 4c first the o3 trapped the single electrons from nitrogen vacancies to generate o3 eq 3 meanwhile the o3 was decomposed by the coco bonding to form o2 and 1o2 eq 9 and the o3 could react with oh to produce o2 and ho2 eq 10 additionally the o2 captured the delocalized electrons from electron rich centers to generate o2 eq 11 then a series of radical chain reactions eqs 4 and 12 were induced by the o2 and ho2 to produce oh eq 5 thus the catalytic ozonation activity of lacoo3 g c3n4 for bza degradation was significantly improved 9 o 3 c o co o 2 1 o 2 o 2 10 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 11 o 2 e o 2 12 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 furthermore the g c3n4 based catalysts were also utilized in o3 h2o2 process to promote the formation of oh under acidic conditions in general the production of oh in o3 h2o2 process is limited under acidic conditions as the ho2 that can induce free radical chain reactions to generate oh is mainly formed under alkaline conditions li et al 2015 sein et al 2008 to overcome this drawback guo et al 2019 anchored single mn atoms on g c3n4 mn cn to accelerate the oh formation for the degradation of oxalic acid oa as shown in fig 5 a and b the mn cn catalyst exhibited high activity for oa degradation in the o3 h2o2 process which was ascribed to the increased yield of oh fig 5c the chronoamperometry curves fig 5d and epr measurements fig 5e suggested that the ho2 was formed in the interaction between mn cn and h2o2 and the o3 could promote the formation of ho2 the energy change plot for different steps fig 5f further confirmed the reaction mechanism during the reaction fig 5g the mn n4 site in mn cn catalyst adsorbed h2o2 to form the hoo mn n4 species which then reacted with o3 to generate ho2 and o3 o3 would combine with h in acidic solution to generate ho3 and it rapidly transformed to oh meanwhile ho2 converted to o2 which could also react with o3 to produce o3 therefore the yield of oh was increased and the degradation efficiency of oa was significantly enhanced the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during catalytic ozonation are presented in fig 1 in brief the delocalized electrons and surface oxygen containing functional groups on g c3n4 can promote the transformation of o3 to generate oh and o2 additionally the immobilized metal species on g c3n4 also can activate o3 to produce oh o2 and 1o2 consequently these generated ros will accelerate the degradation of organic pollutants 4 application of g c3n4 based catalysts in persulfates activation as an effective and promising technology for the degradation of organic pollutants in water the aops based on persulfates including peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 or peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 have received increasing attention in recent years qin et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b persulfates are strong oxidants and the redox potential for pms and pds are 1 82 v and 2 01 v respectively compared with h2o2 and o3 the persulfates is more convenient for storage and transportation because they usually exist as solid power however their direct reaction with most organic pollutants is so slow which need further activation for practical applications in previous studies numerous strategies such as uv heat alkali ultrasound transition metals and carbon based catalysts have been utilized for persulfates activation where reactive radicals e g so4 and oh or nonradical species 1o2 and surface bound complexes are generated for effectively degrading organic pollutants liu et al 2020b wang and wang 2018 among these approaches heterogeneous catalysis has attracted extensive interests due to its less energy consumption high catalytic activity and outstanding reusability wu et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 therefore many efforts have been devoted to exploring heterogeneous catalysts for persulfates activation graphitic carbon nitride based catalysts have been considered as effective catalysts for activating persulfates to degrade organic pollutants table 3 normally the catalytic activity of g c3n4 in persulfates activation is originated from the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups defective edges and sp2 hybridized carbon network dong et al 2016 duan et al 2015 however the physicochemical properties of g c3n4 prepared by different precursors and calcination procedures are usually somewhat different which may affect their activity for the activation of persulfates guan et al 2020 investigated the influences of different precursors e g melamine dicyandiamide and urea and calcination atmosphere e g air and n2 on the catalytic activity of g c3n4 in pms activation as shown in fig 6 a and b the obtained g c3n4 catalysts exhibited different catalytic activities for pms activation to degrade bpa and the g c3n4 prepared from melamine and calcined in n2 possessed the best performance the difference in their catalytic activities was because of the variation in the type and amount of active sites caused by the different preparation procedures generally methanol meoh p bq and l histidine l his were used as ros scavengers for so4 and oh o2 and 1o2 respectively gholami et al 2020a xu et al 2020 the quenching experiments fig 6c and epr tests demonstrated that so4 and oh rather than o2 or 1o2 were the major ros responsible for the degradation of bpa meanwhile the g c3n4 also exhibited effective catalytic activity to degrade phenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 4 6 tbp acetaminophen act sulfamethoxazole smx ibuprofen ibp and benzoic acid ba via activating pms fig 6d further excluding the contribution of surface bound reactive complexes accordingly the mechanism of pms activation by g c3n4 was proposed in fig 6e first pms was decomposed by the active sites on the surface of g c3n4 via an electron transfer pathway to form so4 eq 13 and so5 eq 14 then the so4 could react with h2o to generate oh eq 15 while the so5 could self react to generate so4 eq 16 resulting in the bpa degradation 13 hso 5 e so 4 o h 14 hso 5 e so 5 h 15 so 4 h 2 o oh h so 4 2 16 2 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 however the catalytic performance of pure g c3n4 in persulfates activation is greatly suppressed by its poor electron transfer capability lin et al 2018b to improve the electron mobility of g c3n4 for efficiently activating persulfates gao et al 2018b prepared o doped g c3n4 ocn with modulated electronic structure as displayed in fig 7 a and b compared with pure g c3n4 the electronic structure of ocn was altered due to the substitution of n atoms by o atoms because the electronegativity of o atom is higher than that of c atom and n atom the electrons of c atoms would flow to the o atom leading to formation of high and low electron density regions around the o atom and c atom respectively consequently the electron transfer on ocn would be accelerated which was confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis spectra fig 7c benefiting from the modulated electronic structure the ocn exhibited excellent catalytic activity in pms activation for the degradation of bpa cip and 2 chlorophenol 2 cp the epr tests and quenching experiments fig 7d indicated that the ocn could activate pms to generate so4 oh and 1o2 in which 1o2 was the major ros responsible for bpa degradation the n2 saturated experiment and linear sweep voltammetry lsv analysis fig 7e further demonstrated that 1o2 was originated from the pms oxidation rather than from the conversion of o2 therefore the mechanism of pms activation by ocn could be proposed as depicted in fig 7f the one was the pms oxidation by electron poor c atoms to form so5 followed by the reaction between so5 and h2o to generate 1o2 the other was the pms reduction by the electrons around the electron rich o atoms to generate so4 and oh as many metal species can activate persulfates to degrade organic pollutants it is reasonable to expect that incorporation of metal species could effectively enhance the catalytic performance of g c3n4 towards persulfates activation li et al 2017 oh et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a meanwhile the unique structure of g c3n4 with two dimensional layered nanosheets and six nitrogen lone pair electrons is conductive to the immobilization and dispersion of metal species therefore many efforts have been devoted to incorporating metal species into g c3n4 for enhancing persulfates activation nguyen et al 2019 qin et al 2019 yang et al 2019a for example xie et al 2019 synthesized co doped g c3n4 co g c3n4 for pms activation to degrade monochlorophenols mcps isomers including 2 cp 3 chlorophenol 3 cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp the co g c3n4 exhibited superior catalytic activity in pms activation compared with g c3n4 due to the doping of co the co doping could promote the generation of so4 eqs 17 20 resulting in the improved degradation of mcps meanwhile the adsorption experiments and quantum chemical calculations demonstrated that the adsorption behavior based on the intermolecular interactions between co g c3n4 and mcps was benefit to the process of mcps degradation fan et al 2019 prepared mn doped g c3n4 mn g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of act the catalytic performance of g c3n4 was significantly improved by the doping of mn further researches demonstrated that 1o2 rather than so4 or oh was the active species responsible for the degradation of act in addition to transition metal species noble metal species were also introduced into g c3n4 feng et al 2018a wang et al 2017 found that pd nanoparticles could greatly enhance the performance of g c3n4 in pms activation to degrade bpa because it could promote the formation of surface bound radical intermediates 17 co ii g c 3 n 4 hso 5 co iii g c 3 n 4 so 4 o h 18 co iii g c 3 n 4 hso 5 co ii g c 3 n 4 so 5 h 19 co iii g c 3 n 4 e co ii g c 3 n 4 20 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh interestingly it has been found that high valent iron oxo species e g feiv o and fev o instead of ros e g so4 oh and 1o2 were responsible for the degradation of organic pollutants in persulfates activation by fe g c3n4 li et al 2019a for example feng et al 2018b synthesized fe ii g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of phenol compared with g c3n4 the fe ii g c3n4 possessed superior catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade phenol which was attributed to the formation of feiv o the feiv o could rapidly degrade the phenol through electron transfer li et al 2018 employed fe iii doped g c3n4 fe iii g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of 4 cp as shown in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of 4 cp increased with the increase of fe iii content in fe iii g c3n4 when oxalate and citrate were added the degradation efficiency of 4 cp was decreased fig 8b and c these results suggested that the embedded fe iii in g c3n4 framework acted as the active sites for 4 cp degradation moreover the epr test and quenching experiments demonstrated that traditional ros in persulfates activation e g so4 oh and 1o2 played an insignificant role in degrading 4 cp however the degradation efficiency of 4 cp was suppressed by adding the dimethyl sulfoxide dmso fig 8d which is a probe compound for high valent iron oxo species the dmso can be oxidized by the high valent iron oxo species to generate the dimethyl sulfone dmso2 accordingly it could be concluded that the fev o was formed on fe iii g c3n4 in pms activation resulting in the 4 cp degradation via nonradical pathway as described in fig 8e in comparison with monometallic species bimetallic species have a better catalytic activity for persulfates activation because of the strengthened synergistic effect of metallic elements and the presence of abundant redox reactions chen et al 2017 lei et al 2020b lin et al 2018a thus a series of bimetallic species have been incorporated into g c3n4 to activate persulfates for example pi et al 2020 synthesized cofeo2 g c3n4 to activate pms for the degradation of levofloxacin lvf the cofeo2 g c3n4 displayed a higher catalytic performance than cofeo2 in activating pms to degrade lvf due to the accelerated redox cycles of metal species during the reaction co ii and fe iii activated hso5 to form so4 eqs 21 and 22 while fe ii and co iii activated hso5 to form so5 eqs 23 and 24 resulting in the lvf degradation li et al 2020d fabricated feco2s4 g c3n4 to degrade smx through the activation of pms owing to the synergistic effect between feco2s4 and g c3n4 the catalytic activity of feco2s4 g c3n4 was superior to feco2s4 g c3n4 and co3s4 g c3n4 the degradation efficiency of smx was determined to be 60 1 17 8 73 9 and 91 9 for feco2s4 g c3n4 co3s4 g c3n4 and feco2s4 g c3n4 respectively for feco2s4 g c3n4 1o2 was identified to be the dominant active species responsible for smx degradation 21 hso 5 co ii co iii so 4 o h 22 hso 5 fe iii fe ii so 4 h 23 hso 5 co iii co ii so 5 h 24 hso 5 fe ii fe iii so 5 o h additionally metal free materials with high electrical conductivity were employed to accelerate the electron transfer on g c3n4 for enhancing the activation of persulfates chen et al 2018 guo et al 2018 ye et al 2019b for example wei et al 2016 combined g c3n4 with activated carbon ac to activate pms for the degradation of organic pollutants compared with g c3n4 and ac the g c3n4 ac composite exhibited superior catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade acid orange 7 ao 7 which was ascribed to the synergistic effect between g c3n4 and ac firstly the specific surface area of g c3n4 ac was larger than that of g c3n4 which could provide more active sites and increase the adsorption ability for ao 7 secondly the effective interfacial contact between g c3n4 and ac could greatly facilitate the electron transfer on g c3n4 therefore both the radical generation so4 and oh and the nonradical effect in pms activation were significantly enhanced resulting in the efficient degradation of organic pollutants yao et al 2019 introduced covalent organic framework cof into g c3n4 to promote pms activation for the degradation of orange ii the electron transfer between g c3n4 cof and pms was boosted which was attributed to the good balance between nitrogen content and graphitization degree as a result the g c3n4 cof showed excellent catalytic activity in pms activation to degrade orange ii because of the strengthened nonradical pathway induced by boosted electron transfer recently the combination of photocatalysis and persulfates activation has drawn increasing attention because the synergistic effect between them could significantly improve the catalytic performance gao et al 2017 wang et al 2020d yang et al 2019b normally the persulfates can be activated by the photogenerated electrons on g c3n4 based catalysts to generate so4 and oh resulting in the boosted persulfates activation and enhanced organic pollutants degradation for example gao et al 2018a utilized a co3o4 qds g c3n4 heterostructure to degrade tc under visible light in the presence of pms compared to the case without visible light or pms the degradation efficiency was greatly enhanced which was ascribed to the cooperative effect between photocatalysis and persulfates activation in the study of li et al 2019d the cufe2o4 g c3n4 composite exhibited improved catalytic performance on pds activation under visible light for the degradation of propranolol due to the self redox cycles of iron and copper in cufe2o4 and the accelerated formation of so4 moreover our group recently developed a novel carbonyl and carboxyl groups co modified g c3n4 and employed it for the pms activation under visible light to degrade chlortetracycline hydrochloride guo et al 2020b in this system the photogenerated electrons were gathered around the electron withdrawing carbonyl and carboxyl groups of g c3n4 the pms could be quickly activated by these electrons to generate so4 and oh leading to the efficient degradation of chlortetracycline hydrochloride the general catalytic mechanisms of g c3n4 based catalysts during persulfates activation are displayed in fig 1 in short the nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups defective edges sp2 hybridized carbon network and photogenerated electrons of g c3n4 can facilitate the decomposition of persulfates to produce so4 and oh moreover the loaded metal species on g c3n4 also can activate persulfates to generate so4 oh o2 and 1o2 especially the fe n complex on fe g c3n4 can bound to pms resulting in the formation of high valent iron oxo species as a result these reactive species will promote the degradation of organic pollutants 5 the effect of water chemistry on catalytic performance 5 1 effect of ph due to the variable ph values of actual wastewater it is very important to clarify the effect of ph on the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts in aops normally the solution ph affects the surface properties of g c3n4 based catalysts the structural forms of target contaminants and the decomposition of oxidants h2o2 o3 and persulfates thereby influencing the catalytic performance the ph at point of zero charge phpzc can help determine the effect of ph on the surface charge of the catalyst when the solution ph is less than phpzc the surface of the catalyst is positively charged and when the solution ph is greater than phpzc the surface of the catalyst is negatively charged for example the phpzc of zero valent zinc immobilized g c3n4 zvz g c3n4 was determined to be 5 96 yuan et al 2018b at the initial ph above phpzc the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged as zvz g c3n4 o group therefore the zvz g c3n4 showed superior catalytic ozonation performance on atz degradation in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 since o3 is more likely to react with negatively charged surface fig 9 a in the study of li et al 2020d the phpzc of feco2s4 g c3n4 was determined to be 5 9 accordingly at the initial ph of 3 5 or 5 0 and 6 5 8 0 or 9 5 the surface charge of feco2s4 g c3n4 was positive and negative respectively because the smx existed as anionic species in the ph range of 3 5 9 5 the interaction between feco2s4 g c3n4 and smx was enhanced at the initial ph of 3 5 and 5 0 promoting the degradation of smx in the presence of pms in addition the decomposition of oxidants are also influenced by the solution ph in alkali media the oxidability of h2o2 is weakened because of its decomposition to o2 and h2o cheng et al 2018a the activity of o3 alone for organic pollutants degradation under acidic conditions is unsatisfactory however at high ph the abundant oh can react with o3 to accelerate the formation of oh thus promoting the degradation of organic pollutants nawrocki and kasprzykhordern 2010 wang and chen 2020 moreover the pms will decomposed to so4 2 o2 and h2o at high ph inhibiting the generation of ros ball and edwards 1956 as shown in fig 9b in the g c3n4 pms system the k obs of bpa degradation increased with ph increasing from 5 0 to 7 0 and then decreased as ph further increased to 9 0 guan et al 2020 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the following reasons at lower ph values the electron transfer from g c3n4 surface to pms was inhibited moreover the alkaline conditions weakened the interaction between g c3n4 surface and hso5 and accelerated the self decomposition of pms nonetheless most of the g c3n4 based catalysts were applicable in a wide ph range for the degradation of organic pollutants for example gao et al 2018b reported that pms could be activated by ocn in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 to efficiently degrade bpa fig 9c the zno g c3n4 exhibited excellent activity in a wide ph range of 3 5 9 5 for atz degradation in catalytic ozonation yuan et al 2018a the degradation efficiency of atz at each ph value was all over 95 5 within 3 min indicating the slight effect of solution ph on the azt degradation normally the classical fenton reaction only works better under acidic conditions because it easily forms iron precipitates under neutral and alkaline conditions compared to recent novel heterogeneous fenton like catalysts such as fe pd c he et al 2019a and nfe2o3 mil 53 cu ren et al 2020 which only worked in a narrow ph range of 3 0 6 0 the g c3n4 based catalysts usually performed well in a wider ph range for example in the study of lyu et al 2018 the cncu ii cualo2 catalyst exhibited effective activity for bpa degradation in a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 and possessed the highest activity under the neutral conditions no significant variation in the removal efficiency of bpa could be observed in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 with the change of initial ph and although the removal efficiency of bpa slightly decreased with the increase of initial ph in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 it could still achieve 70 at ph 9 0 after 120 min reaction which was attributed to its dual reaction centers moreover the cu i g c3n4 also displayed satisfactory activity for the degradation of rhb in a wide ph range of 5 0 11 0 ma et al 2019b unlike traditional fenton like reactions the removal efficiency of rhb increased with the increase of solution ph in the ph range of 3 0 6 0 while remained almost unchanged as the ph further increased to 11 0 the efficient activity of cu i g c3n4 for rhb degradation at higher ph values was ascribed to the 1o2 which was more easily generated under the alkaline conditions than the acidic conditions 5 2 effect of water temperature at ambient temperature the g c3n4 based catalysts can perform well in fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation slight temperature changes will not obviously affect the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts for degrading organic pollutants through these aops for example the degradation efficiencies of bpa in the cn cu ii cualo2 h2o2 system at 25 c 30 c and 35 c were 90 93 and 96 respectively lyu et al 2018 however if the water temperature fluctuates greatly the degradation rate of organic pollutants will also change significantly especially in persulfates activation because heat is an effective method to activate persulfates lin et al 2018b utilized s doped g c3n4 s g c3n4 to activate pds for the degradation of rhb as shown in fig 9d the k obs of rhb degradation was increased from 0 005 min 1 to 0 014 min 1 as the temperature was raised from 20 c to 60 c moreover in the feco2s4 g c3n4 pms system with the rise of temperature from 10 c to 40 c the degradation effciecny of smx was remarkably increased from 61 2 to 99 9 and the k obs of smx degradation was also increased from 0 059 min 1 to 0 294 min 1 li et al 2020d 5 3 effect of natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is a complex mixture of organic substances which is extensively distributed in ground water surface water and wastewater in aops the nom usually competes with target organic pollutants for ros leading to the reduction in degradation efficiency as a major constituent of nom humic acid ha can react with o3 which may depress the performance of catalytic ozonation in the zno g c3n4 o3 system the k obs of atz degradation decreased from 1 84 to 0 57 min 1 when the ha concentration increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mg l 1 which was ascribed to the competition between ha and atz for both o3 and ros yuan et al 2018a however in the o g c3n4 o3 system fig 9e the production of oh was increased owing to the reaction between electron rich moieties of ha and o3 resulting in the accelerated atz degradation yuan et al 2019 in addition the nom can also inhibit the g c3n4 based catalysts to active persulfates because its abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups retard the reaction between persulfates and g c3n4 based catalysts to generate reactive species for example in the fe iii g c3n4 pms system the degradation efficiency of 4 cp declined from 93 to 72 with nom concentration increasing from 1 0 to 20 0 mg l 1 li et al 2018 this was mainly because of the delayed reaction between pms and fe iii g c3n4 caused by nom as well as the competitive reaction between nom and 4 cp 5 4 effect of inorganic anions inorganic anions are also ubiquitous in ground water surface water and wastewater which can serve as radical scavengers resulting in an inhibitory effect on the radical based degradation of organic pollutants for example in the zvz g c3n4 o3 system the hco3 obviously suppressed atz degradation since the oh was scavenged by hco3 yuan et al 2018b in the g c3n4 mnfe2o4 pms system the triclosan tcs degradation was inhibited by the hco3 and low concentration of cl which was attributed to the formation of less reactive radical species such as hco3 co3 and cl while the high concentration of cl could promote the degradation of tcs because of the generation of strong oxidizing species such as cl2 and hocl wang et al 2019c besides the effect of inorganic anions on organic contaminants degradation in the nonradical dominated process is usually insignificant in the feco2s4 g c3n4 pms system the 1o2 dominated nonradical pathway was determined to be the major process for smx degradation thus the cl hco3 and h2po4 showed unremarkable impact on the degradation of smx li et al 2020d similarly as exhibited in fig 9f in the o cn pms system with 1o2 as the major ros the effect of cl hco3 and co3 2 on the degradation of bpa was negligible gao et al 2018b however in pms activation some inorganic anions such as h2po4 li et al 2019a and f li et al 2018 would hinder the formation of high valent iron oxo species due to the complexation between inorganic anions and iron species leading to a slight decline in degradation efficiency 5 5 effect of dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the essential parameters of water chemistry it has been found that do could get involved in the free radical chain reactions thereby influencing the degradation of organic pollutants fang et al 2013 lu et al 2019 generally as an electron acceptor do can react with one electron of catalysts to form o2 which can be further reduced to h2o2 when two protons are present nosaka and nosaka 2017 besides the process of persulfates activation can also be affected by do zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 however there are limited reports on the effect of do on the performance of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops meanwhile these reports demonstrated that the effect of do in the fenton based processes and persulfates activation over g c3n4 based catalysts was insignificant for example in the cds fe ii g c3n4 h2o2 system fang et al 2019 there was no obvious change in the degradation efficiency of mb in the absence of o2 moreover in the o cn pms system gao et al 2018b the bpa degradation was not inhibited after n2 saturation implying that the 1o2 was not derived from the do in reaction solution 6 reusability stability and toxicity from the view of practical applications the reusability and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops are vital for the treatment of wastewater normally the g c3n4 based catalysts could still keep good catalytic performance after multiple successive cycles for example in fenton like oxidation the catalytic activity of cu al2o3 g c3n4 for rhb degradation decreased insignificantly after 7 successive cycles reaching a removal efficiency of 91 in 60 min xu et al 2018 in catalytic ozonation the decline of the catalytic performance of cuo g c3n4 for oa degradation was not obvious after 5 successive cycles liu et al 2020a in pms activation 90 removal of tcs was obtained over g c3n4 mnfe2o4 after 5 successive cycles wang et al 2019c in these cycles at lab scale centrifugation recovery and magnetic recovery were usually utilized to recover catalyst powder from the reaction suspension however in practical applications they may be complicated and expensive because of the need to install a large capacity centrifuge or a large electromagnetic system recently catalytic membranes have drawn considerable interest in practical applications due to the simple operation with no need to recover catalyst chen et al 2020a fabricated a mn3o4 g c3n4 polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane via a facile vacuum filtration method and used it to activate pms for 4 cp degradation fig 10 a and b as shown in fig 10c the catalytic performance of mn3o4 g c3n4 ptfe membrane still maintained at high level after 5 successive cycles and was able to remove 80 of 4 cp in 60 min the stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops was also confirmed by a series of characterizations such as x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem in the study of ma et al 2019b the xanes spectra and exafs spectra showed that the chemical state and coordination structure of the cu in cu i g c3n4 had no apparent changes before and after reaction fig 10d and e the xps spectra also indicated that the cu i was stably existed in g c3n4 via n coordination after reaction fig 10f moreover it has been reported that g c3n4 was chemically stable toward o2 and o3 xiao et al 2017 and although oh can directly tear the heptazine unit from g c3n4 to generate secondary pollutants the presence of organic pollutants will hinder the fragmentation of g c3n4 in the study of song et al 2019b the sem tem and atomic force microscopy afm images as well as the xrd and raman spectra displayed that the morphology crystal structure and framework of g c3n4 were only slightly changed after catalytic ozonation suggesting the high stability of g c3n4 and epr spectra exhibited that the amount of delocalized electrons in g c3n4 decreased not obviously after catalytic ozonation further verifying the relative chemical stability of g c3n4 overall these results demonstrated the good reusability and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts in these aops for the degradation of organic contaminants additionally the toxicity of g c3n4 based catalysts determines their further practical applications in general the toxicity of g c3n4 based materials is closely associated with their structure morphology composition and physicochemical properties such as the surface status dispersion and hydrophilicity chen et al 2015 liao et al 2020 some investigations have demonstrated that the g c3n4 based materials had low toxicity and good biocompatibility which could meet the requirements of practical applications for example zhang et al 2013 reported that the ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets possessed nontoxicity and excellent biocompatibility by assessing the viability of hela cells after incubation with the g c3n4 via an mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 3 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay even if the concentration of incubated g c3n4 was as high as 600 μg ml 1 there was no distinct decrease in cell viability feng et al 2016 found that the up conversion nanoparticles ucnp g c3n4 polyethylene glycol peg composite itself had no obvious toxicity to hela cells in the study of he et al 2020 although the short lived ros generated by g c3n4 at a concentration of 50 mg l 1 or more under simulated solar light would exert injury to the hatched zebrafish larvae the presence of nom in water could diminish the hazardous effect 7 conclusions and perspectives in conclusion the g c3n4 based catalysts presented excellent catalytic activities in fenton based processes catalytic ozonation and persulfates activation and could efficiently degrade organic contaminants from water through these aops in fenton based processes and catalytic ozonation the oh activated by g c3n4 based catalysts was the major reactive species for degrading organic pollutants while in persulfates activation the so4 oh 1o2 and high valent iron oxo species were responsible for the degradation of organic pollutants the effect of water chemistry on catalytic performance indicated that the g c3n4 based catalysts could work in a relatively complex water environment in addition most of the g c3n4 based catalysts exhibited excellent reusability and stability in these aops for organic contaminants degradation and showed good biocompatibility although some achievements have been made there are still many challenges to utilize g c3n4 based catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in water through aops beyond photocatalysis some points are listed as follows 1 the catalytic activity and stability of g c3n4 based catalysts should be further improved despite the high degradation efficiency there is still much room for improvement in the mineralization rate moreover the stability of some g c3n4 based catalysts is unsatisfactory due to the loss of active sites and the leaching of metal species thus it is significant to optimize the synthetic methods of g c3n4 based catalysts and develop new types of g c3n4 based catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and stability 2 the oxidation mechanism of organic pollutants and the toxicity of reaction intermediates should be deeply investigated theoretical calculation based on dft can provide a method to reveal the most preferentially attacked sites and potential reaction intermediates of target contaminants meanwhile it is necessary to assess the eco toxicity or human toxicity of these intermediate products as they are even more toxic than their parent compounds in some cases 3 the degradation activity test should be performed in the actual wastewater normally there is a huge difference between the composition of simulated wastewater and actual wastewater which makes the removal efficiency obtained in simulated wastewater less persuasive therefore it is recommended to develop g c3n4 based catalysts to target the actual wastewater which will be beneficial to identify the real challenges in practical applications 4 the scale of the experiments should be enlarged to date most investigations have been executed at the lab scale using small reactors to achieve the practical applicability of the g c3n4 based catalysts for organic pollutants degradation more attention should be devoted in the reactor design and scale up declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

logan 2010 modular reactor design park et al 2018b 2018c cui et al 2020a b and process design side stream auxiliary and intermittent operation cerrillo et al 2018 park et al 2019b wang et al 2017a despite the effort certain inefficiencies such as electrochemical losses dead space material transfer limitations and increased internal resistance remain a challenge in up scaled bead beegle and borole 2018 logan and rabaey 2012 wang et al 2017b indicating a need to systematically summarize the current status of bead research to inform future efforts this review addresses the need by reviewing the fundamental bioprocesses in bead and summarizing the engineering optimizations that have been employed drawing from the work done thus far the review proposes a few novel ideas pertaining to the electrode materials reactor configurations and process designs with the goal of inspiring new research ideas for ad and bead in a mechanism informed fashion 2 fundamentals of bead 2 1 bioelectrochemical electron pathway in the biofilm bead utilizes direct electron exchange with the electrodes to achieve methane production blasco gómez et al 2017 zakaria and dhar 2019 the anodic and cathodic reaction pathways are shown in fig 1 and summarized below standard conditions ph 7 0 anodic reaction 1 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o e 0 28 v vs she 2 3 hco 3 16 h 14 e ch 3 ch 2 coo 7

she 10 hcoo 7h 6e ch4 2h2o e 0 17 v vs she the anode oxidizes the organic matter and releases e h and co2 eqs 1 3 and fig 1a torres et al 2007 the cathode utilizes the e h and co2 as substrate for methane production via three mechanisms 1 direct bioelectrochemical methanation where the electroactive biofilm reduces co2 into ch4 using electrons provided by the cathode eq 4 and fig 1b 2 h2 mediated methanation or hydrogenotrophic methanogensis where the electroactive biofilm reduces h into h2 and other h2 utilizing microbes produce ch4 from h2 and co2 eqs 5 6 and fig 1c and 3 carbon compounds mediated methanation where the electroactive biofilm reduces co2 into acetate and formate and other microbes generate ch4 from these intermediates eqs 7 10 and fig 1d blasco gómez et al 2017 schröder et al 2015 van eerten jansen et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 park et al 2018d among the three mechanisms direct bioelectrochemical methanation eq 4 and carbon compounds mediated methanation eqs 7 10 are thermodynamically spontaneous i e e c a t h o d e 0 e a n o d e 0 0 v and do not require an external voltage to drive the electron flow from the anode to the cathode choi et al 2017 geppert et al 2016 in contrast h2 mediated methanation eqs 5 6 is not a spontaneous reaction and a potential of 0 14 v is theoretically required therefore bead can theoretically be operated in the microbial fuel cell mfc mode no external voltage through direct bioelectrochemical methanation and carbon compounds mediated methanation or in the microbial electrolysis cell mec mode through h2 mediated methanation in this review we use bead and mec as interchangeable terms since most studies have been conducted with an external voltage in conventional mixed culture ad processes the stoichiometry suggests that acetoclastic methanogenesis eq 12 contributes approximately 2 3 of the total methane production and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 13 only contributes approximately 1 3 under ideal conditions conrad 1999 kotsyurbenko et al 2004 the availability of h2 is the limiting factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eqs 11 and 13 11 c6h12o6 2h2o 2ch3cooh 2co2 4h2 12 2ch3cooh 2ch4 2co2 13 co2 4h2 ch4 2h2o in bead the contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could theoretically be increased as more or faster h2 production can be achieved through bioelectrochemical reduction of h eq 5 a few studies pointed to the possibility of enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when 0 3 0 6 v was provided although the extent to which the fraction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be increased is not yet conclusive park et al 2019a 2020b li et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 moreover so far bead was only shown to expedite the h2 production eq 5 not the methanation eq 6 park et al 2020b increasing the fraction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis offers two advantages first hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can quickly convert the h released from organic matter to h2 eq 5 thereby moderating the ph drop that often suppresses ad feng et al 2018 liu et al 2017b park et al 2018c 2019a second the microbes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis i e hydrogenotrophic methanogens are faster growing and more resilient to variations in environmental conditions discussed later in section 2 3 another possibility for the anodic reaction is water electrolysis 4h 4e o2 2h2o e 0 81 v vs she at ph 7 0 eq 11 but it requires a minimum of 1 25 v to produce ch4 since most bead studies supplied voltages less than 1 0 v water electrolysis is not commonly utilized dou et al 2018 however when it is utilized additional electrons will be available to the cathodic reactions eqs 4 10 to increase the methane yield dou et al 2018 showed that when 2 0 v was supplied the methane content in the biogas increased from 64 5 1 9 to 88 5 1 4 by utilizing the additional electrons to convert co2 to ch4 eq 4 2 2 bioelectrochemical electron pathway in the bulk solution interestingly recent studies showed that bead enhanced the presence of bio electrochemically active microorganism in the bulk solution and their electron utilization in addition to impacting the biofilm on the electrode surface an et al 2020 cai et al 2016 dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 feng et al 2018 hagos et al 2018 li et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 similar to biofilms the bioelectrochemically activated bulk sludge could utilize electrons and produce methane through three mechanisms direct methanation fig 3 a h2 mediated methanation fig 3b and 3c and organic carbon mediated methanation fig 3d the main mechanism was suggested to be h2 mediated methanation feng et al 2018 which consumes the h2 produced by the biofilm to produce methane from co2 cai et al 2016 liu et al 2018a marone et al 2016 park et al 2019a 2020b previous work showed that in bead the bulk solution achieved high specific methanogenic activities sma that were similar to the bead biofilms both of which were higher than the bulk solution in ad park et al 2020b using food waste as the substrate and 0 3 v supplied voltage the smas of biofilm and bulk solution in bead reached 8 3 0 2 and 7 4 0 2 m3 ch4 m3 vs hr as compared to only 4 9 0 5 m3 ch4 m3 vs hr in the ad bulk solution park et al 2020b the much higher amount combined with potentially higher activity make suspended biomass more significant in methane production and electron utilization than the biofilm for example in reactors with a low areaelectrode volumereactor a v ratio of 7 0 m2 m3 park et al 2019a reported that the contribution of the bulk solution to methane production was 70 feng et al 2018 reported that their bead with abiotic bulk solution achieved a coulombic efficiency ce of 25 4 and a methane production rate of 0 062 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d but the ce consistently decreased to 16 0 14 2 6 7 and the methane production rate increased to 0 137 0 203 0 207 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d when 100 200 and 400 ml of biomass suspension was introduced into the abiotic bulk solution respectively while not conclusive these results suggest a new direction for the practical application of bead that is enhancing and harnessing the bioelectrochemical activity of the bulk sludge could be as effective as enhancing the biofilm activity park et al 2019a so far bead research has focused on improving the biofilm activity in small scale reactors and has encountered challenges in the scalability and economic viability beegle and borole 2018 guo et al 2014 park et al 2019a harnessing the activity of the bulk solution could introduce new possibilities such as novel electrode materials and reactor configurations that are more economical and scalable however thorough investigations of the mechanisms and activity of the bulk sludge are still needed to confirmed the potential 2 3 microbial communities in bead the dominant bacterial species reported in previous bead research were relatively consistent well known bioelectrochemically active bacterial species such as geobacter bacteroidies shewanella pseudomonas and clostridium were generally dominant in both the biofilm generally the anode biofilm and the bulk solution de vrieze et al 2014 dou et al 2018 liu et al 2016b park et al 2018c 2019a tian et al 2018 sun et al 2014 choi et al 2019 speers et al 2014 xu et al 2019a yu et al 2019 xu et al 2019b baek et al 2017 these species form a syntrophic consortium with three types of metabolic capabilities electron transfer degradation of complex organic compounds and h2 production geobacter and shewanella have the ability to oxidize vfas especially acetate and to extracellular transfer electrons feng et al 2016 pseudomonas is known as the anaerobic fermentative bacteria that act as the electron shuttle for the oxidation of organic matter boon et al 2008 clostridium was previously reported to be a major part of the microbial consortium producing butyrate acetate and propionate from complex organic matter along with h2 under anaerobic conditions sravan et al 2018 bacteroidies is known to convert the amino acids produced during protein hydrolysis to acetate lee et al 2017 known h2 producing bacteria including hydrogenispora park et al 2019a desulfovibrio sp baek et al 2017 desulfovibrio vulgaris xu et al 2019b were also commonly detected the types of bacterial species in ad and bead were not significantly different park et al 2018c lee et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the electroactive bacterial species that are widely present in bead were also discovered in ad possibly owing to their metabolic flexibilities to utilize a wide range of organic compounds as substrates e g vfas and aromatic hydrocarbons and to cooperate with other fermentative bacteria or vfas oxidizing bacteria xu et al 2019a however the relative abundance of each phylum or genus could be considerably different in bead and ad for example yu et al 2019 found that proteobacteria constituted 10 of the microbial community in ad but 30 and 2 of the microbial communities in the suspended and attached biomass respectively in bead yu et al 2019 the dominant bacterial species in bead were also shown to be impacted by operational conditions such as the olr electrode material substrate and voltage applied park et al 2019d found that the bacterial communities in ad and bead could respond differently to operating conditions such as the olr when olr was 2 0 kg m3 d clostridia and bacteroidia known vfas oxidizing species were 49 3 and 38 2 of the microbial community in ad and 56 6 and 28 0 in bead respectively when olr was 6 0 kg m3 d clostridia and bacteroidia decreased to 3 0 in ad but remained at 46 0 and 21 6 in bead which corresponded with better vfas removal and methane production in bead under this olr park et al 2019d chen et al 2020 reported that firmicutes were 39 and 31 on the bead anode and cathode when using graphene oxide electrodes but their relative abundance changed to 65 and 8 carbon felt anode and cathode respectively sun et al 2016 showed that glucose enriched citrobacter 29 2 enterococcus 14 7 alkaliflexus 9 2 and paludibacter 4 5 whereas acetate enriched acinetobacter 17 8 achromobacter 6 4 comamonas 2 5 stenotrophomonas 2 7 and fluviicola 5 0 both feng et al 2016 and sasaki et al 2011 also reported that the voltage applied could induce changes in the microbial communities in bead the dominant archaeal species in bead generally included two groups some bead studies reported that acetoclastic methanogens were dominant on the electrodes cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 and in bulk solution de vrieze et al 2014 liu et al 2016b park et al 2018c whereas some others reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated on the electrodes cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 dou et al 2018 li et al 2016 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b siegert et al 2015 tian et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 and in the bulk solutions cai et al 2016 feng et al 2018 li et al 2016 park et al 2018c 2019a tian et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens such as metanosaeata was generally reported in the anode biofilms which is likely attributable to their c type cytochromes and the resultant ability to engage in direct electron transfer with the electrode cai et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 bo et al 2014 moreover cathodic potential e 0 24 v vs she eq 4 for acetoclastic methanogenesis which is similar to anodic potential for organic oxidation e 0 28 0 29 v vs she eqs 1 3 might contribute dominance of acetoclastic methanogens on anode torres et al 2007 the direct electron transfer to acetoclastic methanogens was also shown to suppress the electrons available to h2 production and thereby the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens liu et al 2020 in contrast the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium methanoculleus methanobrevibacter and methanospaera was often reported in the cathode biofilms and the bulk solution choi et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 the direct electron transfer capability of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is under investigated except for methanosarcina which is known as both a hydrogenotrophic methanogen and an acetoclastic methanogen with direct electron transfer capacity liu et al 2019a moreover the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode biofilm was shown to induce the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the bulk solution by increasing the h2 partial pressure in the bulk solution cai et al 2016 cerrillo et al 2017 katuri et al 2014 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b park et al 2019a tian et al 2018 the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is generally believed to be advantageous for process stability and biogas production for a few reasons first hydrogenotrophic methanogens often exhibit a much higher activity than acetoclastic methanogens with a doubling time of 4 8 h and 5 7 days respectively zakaria and dhar 2019 and the specific methane production rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is approximately 1 5 times that of acetoclastic methanogenesis pan et al 2016 bead reactors using inocula obtained from a natural bog sediment with high quantities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens showed higher methane production than reactors inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge with mostly acetoclastic methanogens labarge et al 2017 second hydrogenotrophic methanogens are less sensitive to changes in environmental parameters including ph vfas and temperature than acetoclastic methanogens zakaria and dhar 2019 finally hydrogenotrophic methanogens have the metabolic potential that can be harnessed for processing and upgrading of biogas flores rodriguez et al 2019 in general bead was shown to increase the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens possibly through directly or indirectly providing access to more h2 on the electrode and in the bulk solution batlle vilanova et al 2015 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b park et al 2019a tian et al 2018 lee et al 2017 cai et al 2016 reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens constituted 64 41 of the bulk sludge in bead which was higher than in ad sludge 49 92 cai et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 also reported that in bead the population of hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales was increased up to 17 2 times compared to ad within bead the relative abundances of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were reported to be closely related to the applied voltage a low voltage which might provide higher electrode potential was often reported to induce the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens e 0 24 v vs she eq 4 whereas a high voltage was beneficial for the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens via h2 production e 0 42 v vs she eq 4 in bo et al 2014 the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogen decreased from 15 9 to 3 0 in the anodic biofilm when the applied voltage was changed from 0 2 v to 0 6 v while hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased from 16 0 to 68 4 in the meantime bo et al 2014 chen et al 2016 reported that the relative abundance of methanosaeta decreased from 50 5 at 0 3 v to 21 8 at 1 2 v but then increased to 37 8 at 1 5 v fu et al 2015 recent work also suggested the dominant species in bes bulk solution was impacted by the strength of the electrical field i e distance to electrodes formed around electrodes du et al 2018 it is not yet unclear whether similar spatial distributions also exist in bead 2 4 methane yield methane production rate and process stability in bead the overall strategy for improving bead is closely related with the maximization of the methane yield and the production rate beegle and borole 2018 de vrieze et al 2018 the methane production rate at steady state was similar for ad and bead ad 0 83 0 03 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d bead 0 85 0 08 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d both of which were close to the theoretical value park et al 2018c when the chemical oxygen demand cod is the sole electron donor the theoretical methane yield of bead and ad are the same 0 35 m3 ch4 kg cod assuming no loss to biomass growth buswell and mueller 1952 beegle and borole 2018 in most bead studies cod was the only electron donor and the methane yield was approaching the theoretical maximum park et al 2018c beegle and borole 2018 when a high voltage was provided bead could increase the methane yield on a per cod basis by utilizing the additional electrons produced from water electrolysis eq 9 dou et al 2018 in this case the methane yield depends on the amount of additional electrons produced for example in batlle vilanova et al 2019 dou et al 2018 and zhou et al 2020 the authors reported methane yields between 0 38 and 0 56 m3 ch4 kg cod when 2 0 4 0 v was provided while not increasing the theoretical methane yield or production rate bead was widely shown to increase the process stability the ad process contains multiple interdependent biochemical reactions catalyzed by diverse microbial groups such as fermentative microbes acetogenic microbes homoacetogens and methanogens mao et al 2015 these microbes differ widely with respect to their growth rates substrate utilization rates and sensitivity to environmental variation wang et al 2019 in general methanogens grow relatively slowly and are less robust against environmental variations than organic and vfas oxidizing bacteria acidogens at high olr the imbalance between the quick production of vfas by acidogens and the slow consumption of vfas by methanogens usually results in the accumulation of vfas decrease of ph and loss of methanogenic activities which is the most common reason for ad failures wang et al 2019 bead was shown to overcome the imbalance at high olr by regulating the ph drop and vfas accumulation park et al 2019c sasaki et al 2010 2020a feng et al 2019 hirano et al 2018 park et al 2019c showed that bead achieved stable methane yield 0 32 0 04 m3 ch4 kg cod and organic removal efficiency 76 3 1 7 under olr 10 kg cod m3 d of highly concentrated food waste whereas ad failed at olr of 6 0 kg cod m3 d sasaki et al 2010 and park et al 2020a reported stable methane production in bead under olr 26 9 kg cod m3 d of garbage slurry and 12 0 kg cod m3 d of food waste whereas ad failed at olr 6 0 kg cod m3 d park et al 2020a sasaki et al 2010 hirano et al 2018 reported that when olr was increased from 0 64 to 1 1 kg cod m3 d the acetic acid concentration increased from 1 5 mm to 22 mm in ad but no acetic acid build up was seen in bead feng et al 2019 also reported that when olr was increased from 2 04 0 05 to 5 22 0 02 kg cod m3 d the ph and vfas concentrations in bead were maintained at 7 02 and 680 mg l but changed to undesirable levels i e 6 8 and 1587 mg l respectively in ad one application of the higher stability of bead is quick start up start up is an important step in establishing a proper microbial community in ad process angelidaki et al 2006 ad often requires a stabilization period of 2 9 months during which time it is sensitive to ph decrease and vfas accumulation given the low microorganism activity lauwers et al 1990 angelidaki et al 2006 bead was shown to shorten the start up time and enhance the methane production during the time for example park et al 2018c reported that bead achieved reached an intermediate steady state after 34 days much shorter than the 112 days needed by ad their bead also achieved 70 higher stabilization and methane production rates than ad during start up e g the methane production rates of ad and bead were 0 40 1 6 and 0 67 0 12 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively and an improved methane content in the biogas during start up 55 8 7 5 and 65 8 8 3 for ad and bead respectively although the difference diminished as both reached the steady state 64 4 1 3 and 65 9 1 1 respectively park et al 2018c guo et al 2017 showed that the methane production rate of bead was twice that of ad during the 10 day start up stage and the difference remained after the steady state which were 0 131 and 0 055 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively song et al 2016 also reported fast stabilization rate of bead which required 50 days for start up owing to the ability to main a stable ph 7 2 7 6 song et al 2016 2 5 energy losses in bead the energy loss in bead reactors is similar to that in bes it is often referred to as the internal resistance and is mainly induced by the charge transfer loss and the mass transfer loss fig 4 feng et al 2016 malvankar et al 2012 manohar et al 2008 wang et al 2017b the charge transfer loss is due to the electron transfer resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte or the microorganisms attached to the electrode surface liu et al 2018b and the mass transfer loss is caused by the proton transfer resistance between the anode and the cathode park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b zikmund et al 2018 the mass transfer loss is closely related to the transport of the h released during the oxidation of organic matter from the anode to the cathode dhar and lee 2013 in the double chamber reactors used by early bes studies a key contributor to the mass transfer loss was the membrane separating the two chambers which led to increased resistance for h transfer and the build up of ph gradient in each chamber clauwaert et al 2008b this resistance could be reduced by changing the shape and material of the membrane pant et al 2010 however even with these improvements the h transfer capacity remains limited as compared to the rate of the electrode reactions clauwaert et al 2008b hou et al 2015 single chamber reactors were developed later liu et al 2004 which significantly reduced the mass transfer resistance in bes by removing the membrane that limited the h transfer bead usually adopted the single chamber design park et al 2018c wang et al 2009 feng et al 2016 cai et al 2016 it is generally believed that the mass transfer loss is more important than the charge transfer loss especially in larger scale bead given the distance of h transfer park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b kreig et al 2014 guo et al 2018 however so far a quantitative understanding of the charge transfer and mass transfer losses in bead has not been established in an earlier bes research he et al 2006 showed that the overall internal resistance in an up flow mfc wet volume 0 27 l was 17 13 ohm and that the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances were similar which could be separated into charge transfer electrolyte and diffusion resistances that were 8 62 7 05 and 1 46 ohms respectively they also simulated that the charge transfer and electrolyte resistances would be reduced by approximately 25 when the cod loading was increased from 0 57 to 4 29 kg cod m3 d it is unclear how transferrable their findings are to bead but their reactor used a proton exchange membrane that would have increased the mass transfer resistance and a small electrode distance that was beneficial for reducing the mass transfer resistance since the charge transfer resistance occurs on the electrode surface it is believed to be affected by 1 the characteristics of the electrode materials and 2 the biofilm mass and activity kong et al 2014 yasri and nakhla 2017 therefore efforts to reduce the charge transfer resistance have focused on applying electrode materials with high electric efficiency and surface area kong et al 2014 and maximizing the biofilm mass and activity cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 the mass transfer is generally optimized by reducing the electrode distance and changing the flow patterns several studies revealed that reducing the distance between the anode and the cathode in bes and bead can significantly reduce the mass transfer resistance by improving the ionic diffusion rate but these studies were often based on observations of a reduction in total internal resistance and an increase in electrochemical performance such as the current density hou et al 2015 cheng and logan 2011 park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b park et al 2017 quantified the mass transfer flux and showed that it increased from 3 2 to 7 6 s 1 when the electrode distance was reduced from 5 cm to 1 cm with a concurrent increase of the current density from 0 06 0 04 a m2 to 0 72 0 13 a m2 park et al 2017 efforts to change the flow patterns range from using up flow reactors feng et al 2017 sangeetha et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cui et al 2020a to rotating electrodes park et al 2018a 2018b 2 6 economics of bead information on the economics of bead is limited one research suggested that the net present value npv of bead was better than ad over a 20 year period but both ad and bead had a negative npv beegle and borole 2018 another estimate suggested that the overall cost efficiency of bead was lower because of increased costs for construction operation and maintenance batlle vilanova et al 2019 more specifically beegle and borole 2018 indicated that the projected annual revenue of bead 22 7 ton cod inf was 67 higher than that of ad 13 6 ton codinf from improved biogas production but bead would also increase the annualized capital expenditures capex by 29 8 ton codinf and the operation maintenance o m costs by 4 4 ton codinf beegle and borole 2018 but this o m cost is approximately 400 yr for a 11m3 reactor and is considerably lower than foley et al 2010 which reported that an additional 0 56 kw m3 reactor was needed to supply a voltage of 0 5 v with 90 process efficiency foley et al 2010 would suggest that a 10 m3 bead would require an additional 3000 yr to operate compared to ad assuming 330 days of operation and the 2019 average retail electricity price for industrial consumers 0 0683 kwh guerriero 2020 detailed information and comparison of economics of ad and bead are described at table 3 more systematic economic analyses of bead ideally normalized to the reactor size or cod treated are needed in future research assuming that bead is operated in the low voltage mode i e no additional electron donor introduced through water electrolysis beegle and borole 2018 would suggest that the o m costs of bead need to be reduced by approximately 50 to generate a positive annual cash flow assuming the price of the product is 0 05 kwh as a reference point the current natural gas industrial price is approximately 0 015 kwh in the us but higher elsewhere eia 2020 future bead work should keep these targets in mind and start to integrate low cost construction operation and maintenance into high performance to increase the competitiveness of bead in full scale applications zhang et al 2013 zhen et al 2017 3 technical strategies to improve the practicality of bead 3 1 optimal voltage supply voltage supply is the most widely used optimization parameter in bead blasco gómez et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 voltage is often provided as a potential difference across the anode and cathode instead of as a poised potential due to practicality reasons so far voltage supply has been shown to impact bead in three ways first it induces the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which in turn improves the process stability as discussed in section 2 4 second voltage supply affects the internal resistance choi et al 2017 reported that when an over potential is provided i e providing a potential higher than the energy theoretically required for deriving target reactions call and logan 2008 gajaraj et al 2017 an effective reduction of the internal resistance from 4 4 ohm at 0 5 v to 3 2 ohm at 1 0 v and enhancement of the current density from 5 84 a m3 to 19 04 a m3 were achieved third voltage supply impacts the methane production one group of previous studies reported that the optimum voltage in bead for producing methane was 0 3 0 6 v and that the methane production was inhibited when the supplied voltage was higher than 0 6 v chen et al 2016 feng et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2009 another group reported higher optimal voltages choi et al 2017 reported that maximum current and methane production were achieved at an applied of 1 0 v and was followed by the order of voltage 0 7 0 5 and 1 5 v choi et al 2017 the impact of voltage supply is likely intertwined with the other factors such as internal resistance and microbial communities as discussed earlier for example the wide range of optimal voltage was likely related to the differences in the internal resistance caused by the different electrode characteristics and reactor designs choi et al 2017 geppert et al 2016 there is not yet a quantitative understanding of how these factors impact each other and ultimately the bead performance since bead and ad showed similar performance once the steady state is reached it was recently proposed that continuous voltage supply was not necessary and intermittent voltage supply was a more efficient strategy to improve the energy efficiency of bead wang et al 2020 kong et al 2020 the quantitative feasibility of intermittent voltage supply was first demonstrated in cho et al 2019 which reported that bes with short intervals of voltage supply showed a 26 higher current density 31 0 higher hydrogen production and a 36 6 higher methane production than the control reactor with continuous voltage supply they also estimated that the intermittent voltage supply improved the overall energy efficiency from 92 to 111 cho et al 2019 3 2 electrode materials electrode material is another widely attempted engineering optimization in bead ceballos et al 2020 chen et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 noori et al 2020 cui et al 2020b the differences in the electrochemical properties of the electrode material changes the biogas production rate and composition which in turn determines the process efficiency feng et al 2016 the performances of bead with various electrode materials are summarized in table 3 two types of electrode materials have been popular early bead studies usually adopted carbon based brushes and fabric as the electrodes material choi et al 2017 cui et al 2016 kondaveeti and min 2015 the advantage of carbon based electrodes is the high specific surface area high electrochemical efficient and biocompatibility the current density with carbon based electrodes was reported to be 0 15 51 4 a m2 or 2 4 12 3 a m3 table 3 the main disadvantage of carbon based electrode materials is that they are not easy to maintain owing to their low durability and strength tensile strength of graphite 27 5 mpa ayatollahi and torabi 2010 they are also relatively expensive to manufacture and maintain guerrini et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 ledezma et al 2015 park et al 2018a to address these limitations carbon based materials were modified with durable metals reformed or used in granule type bajracharya et al 2015 cui et al 2020b dou et al 2018 for example feng and song 2016 reported enhancement of adhesion of electro active microorganisms and the electron transfer efficiency through the carbon nanotubes deposition and ni on gff electrodes feng and song 2016 liu et al 2018a reported the excellent methane production rate of 4 1 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d and cathodic current density of 35 a m2 with granular graphite electrode when cathodic potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl is applied recently metal electrodes particularly stainless steel ss electrodes have been used in bead the main advantage of stainless steel is the low cost and high durability and strength 630 mpa over 20 times higher than graphite bo et al 2014 escapa et al 2016 guerrini et al 2014 guo et al 2015 kim et al 2019 ledezma et al 2015 park et al 2018a pu et al 2020 muralimohan et al 2014 wang and yu 2019 wang and yu 2019 estimated that the cost of stainless steel was 1200 1500 ton which was only a quarter to one tenth of graphite 4536 18 144 ton noori et al 2020 estimated that the cost of stainless steel was 30 8 m2 much less than carbon based felt cloth and paper 145 8 m2 278 m2 and 462 m2 respectively in addition in the current market the production capacity of stainless steel is much larger than graphite wang and yu 2019 ss electrodes have demonstrated good electrochemical and high electrochemical efficiency 6 1 2 2 a m2 liu et al 2017a reported that the heat treated ss cathode exhibited current to methane and voltage to methane efficiencies of 60 8 and 21 9 respectively similar to graphite felt hagos et al 2018 demonstrated that stainless steel mesh electrodes increased the methane production rate by 65 compared to ad bo et al 2014 reported that the organic matter removal efficiency and methane production was improved by 200 with barrel shaped ss cathodes compared with ad guo et al 2015 reported high current density and good biofilm adhesion using a heat treating stainless steel felt anode with enriched iron oxide on the electrode surface additionally the high electrochemical efficiency was maintained with larger electrodes indicating the potential for full scale application guo et al 2015 moreover due to the good mechanical strength and plasticity ss felt can be easily fabricated into different configurations to further increase the specific surface area and optimize the mass transfer in the reactor guo et al 2015 the main disadvantage of ss electrodes is the risk of corrosion low grade stainless steel has poor corrosion resistance under the acidic condition often encountered in bead rousseau et al 2020 to avoid corrosion a high grade stainless steel e g 254 smo en 1 4547 astm uns s31254 is preferred which can resist corrosion in marine environments due to the molybdenum content but at the expense of increased costs rousseau et al 2020 in summary the high conductivity excellent scale up possibility low capital cost and high bioelectro catalytic performance make ss as a scalable electrode material for bead further research to improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steel is warranted 3 3 geometric reactor and electrode configurations as bead is being scaled up the electrochemical losses will increase due to increased internal resistance beegle and borole 2018 wang et al 2017b reactor configurations and process designs will be important to maintain efficiency in the scale up of bead hou et al 2015 park et al 2018a 2018b ran et al 2014 sangeetha et al 2017 a summary of the reactor configurations and process designs attempted thus far is presented in table 4 and fig 5 among the various aspects of reactor design electrode distance has been reported as one of the most impactful factors a higher electrode distance leads to increased mass transfer resistance and therefore increased internal resistance and decreased electrochemical efficiency of bead beegle and borole 2018 park et al 2017 similar to earlier bes results cheng and logan 2011 park et al 2017 reported that the current density in bead decreased from 0 72 to 0 06 a m2 when the electrode distance was increased from 1 to 5 cm presumably because of increased internal resistance park et al 2017 hou et al 2015 increased the methane production rate and cod removal efficiency by over 100 compared with regular ad by minimizing the electrode spacing and maximizing the electrode area with the installation of spiral type anode carbon cloth and cathode nickel which was attributed to the reduced internal resistance another important consideration in reactor design is the flow pattern which impacts the mass transfer resistance between the electrodes and thereby the internal resistance kundu et al 2013 various flow and mixing schemes were attempted to limit the mass transfer resistance by increasing the flux gradient the mass transfer rate and the mixing velocity park et al 2017 uasb is one of the widely applied designs to reduce the internal resistance fig 5c d owing to the up flow patterns that enhance the mass transfer capacity between electrodes feng et al 2017 sangeetha et al 2017 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2017 improved the methane production rate by 90 when a circulation flow rate of 3q was applied in an upflow bead 3 88 and 2 08 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively the reactor configuration can also reduce the internal resistance by mass transfer generated through a different hydraulic reactor characteristic park et al 2018a another type of efforts is the installation and arrangement of multi or series configuration guo and kim 2019 2018 ran et al 2014 rader and logan 2010 demonstrated the possibility of continuous flow bes by stacking up eight sets of electrodes anode graphite fiber brush cathode stainless steel mesh and they reported current densities of 1 18 a m2 and methane production rate of 0 118 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d guo and kim 2019 achieved highest current density of 1 4 a m2 and wastewater treatment efficiency of 90 20 in a stacked reactor with 10 pairs of electrodes ran et al 2014 obtained up to 70 1 methane content and 98 0 cod removal efficiency in a multi stage anaerobic baffled reactor sangeetha et al 2017 and cui et al 2016 reported that the position and the order of the electrodes had a significant effect on methane production while is proven useful for improving the bioelectrochemical efficiencies the multi electrode design results in high a v ratios that will increase the capital costs and energy consumption of bead ran et al 2014 feng et al 2017 hou et al 2015 for example the a v ratios were 66 7 m2 m3 ran et al 2014 135 5 m2 m3 guo and kim 2019 and 62 7 m2 m3 hou et al 2015 in multi electrode signs as compared to 0 023 21 0 m2 m3 in single electrode designs park et al 2017 de vrieze et al 2014 guo et al 2015 li et al 2016 hagos et al 2018 4 suggestions for further research directions 4 1 target applications so far the evidence suggests that compared to ad the most commonly used bead voltage supply 1 0 v does not increase the methane yield per cod removed nor the steady state methane production rate the main advantage of bead is its capability to maintain process stability at high olr and during shocks e g sharply changing waste streams owing to its ability to regulate the ph drop and vfas accumulation that cause ad failures as such future bead studies could consider targeting the following conditions feng et al 2018 flores rodriguez et al 2019 1 when ad operated at high olr bead has higher operational stability at high olrs than ad section 2 4 based on previous studies bead could tolerate olrs 30 180 higher than ad and achieve 1 7 3 2 times the methane production rate park et al 2020a sasaki et al 2010 hirano et al 2018 feng et al 2019 guo et al 2017 song et al 2016 park et al 2018c the ability of bead to treat higher olrs will reduce the reactor volume required by 1 2 2 3 or increase the cod removal by 200 300 per unit time which will reduce the footprint of ad facilities ziganshin et al 2016 2 when substrate characteristics are variable daily and seasonal variations of substrates i e food waste livestock manure and waste activated sludge and conditions i e temperature and olr cause starvation and shocks to microorganisms especially methanogens in ad and inhibit the methane yield for example when the olr increases by 220 which is very typical for food waste the vfas concentration in ad will increase by 130 160 and ph will decrease to less than 7 0 leading to 18 37 drop in the total methane production jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 park et al 2018c a temperature of 10 15 c will reduce the methane production rates by 51 compared to 30 c liu et al 2014 bead was shown to enhance specific methanogen activity 1 7 folds in mesophilic bead and 5 6 folds in psychrophilic bead which can be used to provide process stability under varying input operational parameters park et al 2018b liu et al 2016a 3 when quick start up is required after initial set up or interruptions the start up period or the restart period after maintenance is generally considered the most critical step in ad and is often a long and variable process that depends on the substrate characteristics the source of microorganisms the size of inoculum and the initial mode of operation gallert and winter 2008 for example wei et al 2017 reported that after the ad performance was inhibited due to vfas accumulation 60 days of restart period were needed to reach steady state again even with an increased hrt from 10 to 20 days wei et al 2017 even when ad was not challenged by difficult conditions such as vfas accumulation jauregui jauregui et al 2014 reported 22 30 days were needed for restart and start up impaired performance during start up or restart periods results in 41 95 methane losses in previous studies bead could provide excellent abilities in enrichment of microorganisms with its high activity park et al 2018c guo et al 2017 song et al 2016 4 when vfas are accumulating and or ph is decreasing due to the increase of acidic organic wastes and low methanogenic activity bead could achieve rapid vfas removal via anodic reactions eqs 1 3 and h reduction to h2 and ch4 via cathodic reactions eqs 4 6 negative charges on electrodes formed by supplied voltage could make enrichment of vfas oxidizing and h2 producing bacterial species and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in biofilm and bulk solution of reactor which can provide conditions to prevent vfas accumulation and ph decrease sravan et al 2018 baek et al 2017 lee et al 2017 4 2 process integration and optimization as suggested in section 4 1 and earlier de vrieze et al 2018 bead is more likely a supplement than a replacement of ad for example for ad to achieve the theoretical yield extensive efforts were often needed such as pre treatments eskicioglu et al 2006 phase separation nasr et al 2012 maintaining relatively low olrs of 2 0 kg cod m3 d park et al 2018c siles et al 2010 addition of chemicals zhu et al 2015 and maintaining steady operational conditions park et al 2018c all of which are to balance the rate of different reactions and electron transfer eskicioglu et al 2006 nasr et al 2012 park et al 2018c siles et al 2010 williams et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in practical applications maintaining such optimum operational conditions may be difficult as the feed streams and environmental conditions e g the substrate characteristics olr and temperature are constantly changing williams et al 2013 integrating bead into ad e g to replace certain pretreatments or augment ad as a side stream treatment fig 6 may be a promising application of bead de vrieze et al 2014 first showed the possibility of side stream bead application and reported that the organic acids degradation and methane production increased immediately when electrodes were installed and voltage was supplied to a failing ad reactor that were accumulating acids de vrieze et al 2014 park et al 2020a and cerrillo et al 2018 further developed side stream bead by circulating sludge to a bead reactor that was 1 8 1 7 the volume of the main ad reactor which achieved equally good methane yields up to the theoretical value of 0 35 0 02 m3 ch4 kg cod and process resilience as main stream bead under transient high orl side stream application of small capacity bead would reduce the energy requirement and the capital cost of bead park et al 2019a estimated that side stream bead reduced the energy demand by 48 compared to main stream bead intermittent voltage supply could be adopted in side stream bead to further improve the costs chen et al 2017 and park et al 2018a 2019a reported that the intermittent voltage supply to the side stream bead at high olr had a significant impact on performance recovery economical effectiveness of the intermittent and the side stream voltage supply could be also achieved by solar bead module and or reactor wang et al 2020 but it is not quantitative yet side stream bead reactor and or module supported by solar power could provide various electrode configurations and reduce energy required to voltage supply wang et al 2020 cui et al 2020a park et al 2019a 4 3 scalability the scalability of bead needs to be further investigated the largest bead reactor reported so far is 0 91 m3 cusick et al 2011 cusick et al 2011 achieved a total volume of 1 0 m3 effective volume 0 91 m3 using a continuous flow reactor containing 114 electrode pairs in 24 modules cusick et al 2011 at an applied voltage of 0 9 v the current density reached 7 4 a m3 and methane production reached 0 16 0 03 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d in their reactor cusick et al 2011 wang et al 2017c reported a maximum methane production rate of 2 01 0 13 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d and a cod removal efficiency of 93 5 1 6 in their pilot scale bead reactor effective volume 0 8 m3 when treating a concentrated influent with cods of 30 230 4 1074 3 mg l their reactor was also a stacked design with 6 electrode pairs an a v ratio of 9 6 m2 m3 and electrode distance of 5 cm wang et al 2017c 5 conclusion bead is a promising technology that can augment ad the complementary nature of biological activity and electrochemical reactions affords bead process stability advantages under some difficult conditions particularly those challenged by high olr vfas accumulation and low ph the economics of bead appear to be on par with ad but to be market competitive the economics of bead need to be improved in the scale up a combination of innovations in the reactor configuration operation and electrode material will be likely be required among the evidence presented thus far auxiliary systems and corrosion resistant metal electrodes e g stainless steel will likely emerge as the more promising option owing to the design flexibility and cost effectiveness also warrant further studies include the activity of suspended biomass and innovative reactor configurations that can reduce the mass transfer resistance both of which could lead to simplified and innovative reactor designs to further improve the cost effectiveness of bead declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by the ministry of trade industry and energy motie and korea

17653,anaerobic digestion ad is one of the most widely adopted bioenergy recovery technologies globally despite the wide adoption ad has been challenged by the unstable performances caused by imbalanced substrate and or electron availability among different reaction steps bioelectrochemical anaerobic digestion bead is a promising concept that has demonstrated potential for balancing the

methane from diverse organics wastes is one of the most widely adopted bioenergy production technologies li et al 2019 łukajtis et al 2018 in europe and the us alone over 50 000 full scale ad reactors have been constructed and operated treating a wide range of waste streams and producing approximately 30 billion tons of methane annually vasco correa et al 2018 despite the long history of research and achievements ad is still faced with a few critical technical challenges ye et al 2018 in particular the three steps of ad i e hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogensis are often differentially impacted by the environmental and operational conditions causing imbalanced substrate and or electron availability among different microorganisms and reaction steps for example at high olr acidogenesis yields excessive vfas and h that inhibit methanogensis which leads to low methane production rates long stabilization periods low process stability and ad failures chen et al 2008 wang et

despite the effort certain inefficiencies such as electrochemical losses dead space material transfer limitations and increased internal resistance remain a challenge in up scaled bead beegle and borole 2018 logan and rabaey 2012 wang et al 2017b indicating a need to systematically summarize the current status of bead research to inform future efforts this review addresses the need by reviewing the fundamental bioprocesses in bead and summarizing the engineering optimizations that have been employed drawing from the work done thus far the review proposes a few novel ideas pertaining to the electrode materials reactor configurations and process designs with the goal of inspiring new research ideas for ad and bead in a mechanism informed fashion 2 fundamentals of bead 2 1 bioelectrochemical electron pathway in the biofilm bead utilizes direct electron exchange with the electrodes to achieve methane production blasco gómez et al 2017 zakaria and dhar 2019 the anodic and cathodic reaction pathways are shown in fig 1 and summarized below standard conditions ph 7 0 anodic reaction 1 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o e 0 28 v vs she 2 3 hco 3 16 h 14 e ch 3 ch 2 coo 7

she 10 hcoo 7h 6e ch4 2h2o e 0 17 v vs she the anode oxidizes the organic matter and releases e h and co2 eqs 1 3 and fig 1a torres et al 2007 the cathode utilizes the e h and co2 as substrate for methane production via three mechanisms 1 direct bioelectrochemical methanation where the electroactive biofilm reduces co2 into ch4 using electrons provided by the cathode eq 4 and fig 1b 2 h2 mediated methanation or hydrogenotrophic methanogensis where the electroactive biofilm reduces h into h2 and other h2 utilizing microbes produce ch4 from h2 and co2 eqs 5 6 and fig 1c and 3 carbon compounds mediated methanation where the electroactive biofilm reduces co2 into acetate and formate and other microbes generate ch4 from these intermediates eqs 7 10 and fig 1d blasco gómez et al 2017 schröder et al 2015 van eerten jansen et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 park et al 2018d among the three mechanisms direct bioelectrochemical methanation eq 4 and carbon compounds mediated methanation eqs 7 10 are thermodynamically spontaneous i e e c a t h o d e 0 e a n o d e 0 0 v and do not require an external voltage to drive the electron flow from the anode to the cathode choi et al 2017 geppert et al 2016 in contrast h2 mediated methanation eqs 5 6 is not a spontaneous reaction and a potential of 0 14 v is theoretically required therefore bead can theoretically be operated in the microbial fuel cell mfc mode no external voltage through direct bioelectrochemical methanation and carbon compounds mediated methanation or in the microbial electrolysis cell mec mode through h2 mediated methanation in this review we use bead and mec as interchangeable terms since most studies have been conducted with an external voltage in conventional mixed culture ad processes the stoichiometry suggests that acetoclastic methanogenesis eq 12 contributes approximately 2 3 of the total methane production and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 13 only contributes approximately 1 3 under ideal conditions conrad 1999 kotsyurbenko et al 2004 the availability of h2 is the limiting factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eqs 11 and 13 11 c6h12o6 2h2o 2ch3cooh 2co2 4h2 12 2ch3cooh 2ch4 2co2 13 co2 4h2 ch4 2h2o in bead the contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could theoretically be increased as more or faster h2 production can be achieved through bioelectrochemical reduction of h eq 5 a few studies pointed to the possibility of enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when 0 3 0 6 v was provided although the extent to which the fraction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be increased is not yet conclusive park et al 2019a 2020b li et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 moreover so far bead was only shown to expedite the h2 production eq 5 not the methanation eq 6 park et al 2020b increasing the fraction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis offers two advantages first hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can quickly convert the h released from organic matter to h2 eq 5 thereby moderating the ph drop that often suppresses ad feng et al 2018 liu et al 2017b park et al 2018c 2019a second the microbes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis i e hydrogenotrophic methanogens are faster growing and more resilient to variations in environmental conditions discussed later in section 2 3 another possibility for the anodic reaction is water electrolysis 4h 4e o2 2h2o e 0 81 v vs she at ph 7 0 eq 11 but it requires a minimum of 1 25 v to produce ch4 since most bead studies supplied voltages less than 1 0 v water electrolysis is not commonly utilized dou et al 2018 however when it is utilized additional electrons will be available to the cathodic reactions eqs 4 10 to increase the methane yield dou et al 2018 showed that when 2 0 v was supplied the methane content in the biogas increased from 64 5 1 9 to 88 5 1 4 by utilizing the additional electrons to convert co2 to ch4 eq 4 2 2 bioelectrochemical electron pathway in the bulk solution interestingly recent studies showed that bead enhanced the presence of bio electrochemically active microorganism in the bulk solution and their electron utilization in addition to impacting the biofilm on the electrode surface an et al 2020 cai et al 2016 dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 feng et al 2018 hagos et al 2018 li et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 similar to biofilms the bioelectrochemically activated bulk sludge could utilize electrons and produce methane through three mechanisms direct methanation fig 3 a h2 mediated methanation fig 3b and 3c and organic carbon mediated methanation fig 3d the main mechanism was suggested to be h2 mediated methanation feng et al 2018 which consumes the h2 produced by the biofilm to produce methane from co2 cai et al 2016 liu et al 2018a marone et al 2016 park et al 2019a 2020b previous work showed that in bead the bulk solution achieved high specific methanogenic activities sma that were similar to the bead biofilms both of which were higher than the bulk solution in ad park et al 2020b using food waste as the substrate and 0 3 v supplied voltage the smas of biofilm and bulk solution in bead reached 8 3 0 2 and 7 4 0 2 m3 ch4 m3 vs hr as compared to only 4 9 0 5 m3 ch4 m3 vs hr in the ad bulk solution park et al 2020b the much higher amount combined with potentially higher activity make suspended biomass more significant in methane production and electron utilization than the biofilm for example in reactors with a low areaelectrode volumereactor a v ratio of 7 0 m2 m3 park et al 2019a reported that the contribution of the bulk solution to methane production was 70 feng et al 2018 reported that their bead with abiotic bulk solution achieved a coulombic efficiency ce of 25 4 and a methane production rate of 0 062 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d but the ce consistently decreased to 16 0 14 2 6 7 and the methane production rate increased to 0 137 0 203 0 207 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d when 100 200 and 400 ml of biomass suspension was introduced into the abiotic bulk solution respectively while not conclusive these results suggest a new direction for the practical application of bead that is enhancing and harnessing the bioelectrochemical activity of the bulk sludge could be as effective as enhancing the biofilm activity park et al 2019a so far bead research has focused on improving the biofilm activity in small scale reactors and has encountered challenges in the scalability and economic viability beegle and borole 2018 guo et al 2014 park et al 2019a harnessing the activity of the bulk solution could introduce new possibilities such as novel electrode materials and reactor configurations that are more economical and scalable however thorough investigations of the mechanisms and activity of the bulk sludge are still needed to confirmed the potential 2 3 microbial communities in bead the dominant bacterial species reported in previous bead research were relatively consistent well known bioelectrochemically active bacterial species such as geobacter bacteroidies shewanella pseudomonas and clostridium were generally dominant in both the biofilm generally the anode biofilm and the bulk solution de vrieze et al 2014 dou et al 2018 liu et al 2016b park et al 2018c 2019a tian et al 2018 sun et al 2014 choi et al 2019 speers et al 2014 xu et al 2019a yu et al 2019 xu et al 2019b baek et al 2017 these species form a syntrophic consortium with three types of metabolic capabilities electron transfer degradation of complex organic compounds and h2 production geobacter and shewanella have the ability to oxidize vfas especially acetate and to extracellular transfer electrons feng et al 2016 pseudomonas is known as the anaerobic fermentative bacteria that act as the electron shuttle for the oxidation of organic matter boon et al 2008 clostridium was previously reported to be a major part of the microbial consortium producing butyrate acetate and propionate from complex organic matter along with h2 under anaerobic conditions sravan et al 2018 bacteroidies is known to convert the amino acids produced during protein hydrolysis to acetate lee et al 2017 known h2 producing bacteria including hydrogenispora park et al 2019a desulfovibrio sp baek et al 2017 desulfovibrio vulgaris xu et al 2019b were also commonly detected the types of bacterial species in ad and bead were not significantly different park et al 2018c lee et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the electroactive bacterial species that are widely present in bead were also discovered in ad possibly owing to their metabolic flexibilities to utilize a wide range of organic compounds as substrates e g vfas and aromatic hydrocarbons and to cooperate with other fermentative bacteria or vfas oxidizing bacteria xu et al 2019a however the relative abundance of each phylum or genus could be considerably different in bead and ad for example yu et al 2019 found that proteobacteria constituted 10 of the microbial community in ad but 30 and 2 of the microbial communities in the suspended and attached biomass respectively in bead yu et al 2019 the dominant bacterial species in bead were also shown to be impacted by operational conditions such as the olr electrode material substrate and voltage applied park et al 2019d found that the bacterial communities in ad and bead could respond differently to operating conditions such as the olr when olr was 2 0 kg m3 d clostridia and bacteroidia known vfas oxidizing species were 49 3 and 38 2 of the microbial community in ad and 56 6 and 28 0 in bead respectively when olr was 6 0 kg m3 d clostridia and bacteroidia decreased to 3 0 in ad but remained at 46 0 and 21 6 in bead which corresponded with better vfas removal and methane production in bead under this olr park et al 2019d chen et al 2020 reported that firmicutes were 39 and 31 on the bead anode and cathode when using graphene oxide electrodes but their relative abundance changed to 65 and 8 carbon felt anode and cathode respectively sun et al 2016 showed that glucose enriched citrobacter 29 2 enterococcus 14 7 alkaliflexus 9 2 and paludibacter 4 5 whereas acetate enriched acinetobacter 17 8 achromobacter 6 4 comamonas 2 5 stenotrophomonas 2 7 and fluviicola 5 0 both feng et al 2016 and sasaki et al 2011 also reported that the voltage applied could induce changes in the microbial communities in bead the dominant archaeal species in bead generally included two groups some bead studies reported that acetoclastic methanogens were dominant on the electrodes cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 and in bulk solution de vrieze et al 2014 liu et al 2016b park et al 2018c whereas some others reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated on the electrodes cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 dou et al 2018 li et al 2016 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b siegert et al 2015 tian et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 and in the bulk solutions cai et al 2016 feng et al 2018 li et al 2016 park et al 2018c 2019a tian et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens such as metanosaeata was generally reported in the anode biofilms which is likely attributable to their c type cytochromes and the resultant ability to engage in direct electron transfer with the electrode cai et al 2016 zakaria and dhar 2019 bo et al 2014 moreover cathodic potential e 0 24 v vs she eq 4 for acetoclastic methanogenesis which is similar to anodic potential for organic oxidation e 0 28 0 29 v vs she eqs 1 3 might contribute dominance of acetoclastic methanogens on anode torres et al 2007 the direct electron transfer to acetoclastic methanogens was also shown to suppress the electrons available to h2 production and thereby the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens liu et al 2020 in contrast the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacterium methanoculleus methanobrevibacter and methanospaera was often reported in the cathode biofilms and the bulk solution choi et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 the direct electron transfer capability of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is under investigated except for methanosarcina which is known as both a hydrogenotrophic methanogen and an acetoclastic methanogen with direct electron transfer capacity liu et al 2019a moreover the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode biofilm was shown to induce the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the bulk solution by increasing the h2 partial pressure in the bulk solution cai et al 2016 cerrillo et al 2017 katuri et al 2014 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b park et al 2019a tian et al 2018 the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is generally believed to be advantageous for process stability and biogas production for a few reasons first hydrogenotrophic methanogens often exhibit a much higher activity than acetoclastic methanogens with a doubling time of 4 8 h and 5 7 days respectively zakaria and dhar 2019 and the specific methane production rate of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is approximately 1 5 times that of acetoclastic methanogenesis pan et al 2016 bead reactors using inocula obtained from a natural bog sediment with high quantities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens showed higher methane production than reactors inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge with mostly acetoclastic methanogens labarge et al 2017 second hydrogenotrophic methanogens are less sensitive to changes in environmental parameters including ph vfas and temperature than acetoclastic methanogens zakaria and dhar 2019 finally hydrogenotrophic methanogens have the metabolic potential that can be harnessed for processing and upgrading of biogas flores rodriguez et al 2019 in general bead was shown to increase the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens possibly through directly or indirectly providing access to more h2 on the electrode and in the bulk solution batlle vilanova et al 2015 lin et al 2019 liu et al 2016b park et al 2019a tian et al 2018 lee et al 2017 cai et al 2016 reported that hydrogenotrophic methanogens constituted 64 41 of the bulk sludge in bead which was higher than in ad sludge 49 92 cai et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 also reported that in bead the population of hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales was increased up to 17 2 times compared to ad within bead the relative abundances of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were reported to be closely related to the applied voltage a low voltage which might provide higher electrode potential was often reported to induce the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens e 0 24 v vs she eq 4 whereas a high voltage was beneficial for the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens via h2 production e 0 42 v vs she eq 4 in bo et al 2014 the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogen decreased from 15 9 to 3 0 in the anodic biofilm when the applied voltage was changed from 0 2 v to 0 6 v while hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased from 16 0 to 68 4 in the meantime bo et al 2014 chen et al 2016 reported that the relative abundance of methanosaeta decreased from 50 5 at 0 3 v to 21 8 at 1 2 v but then increased to 37 8 at 1 5 v fu et al 2015 recent work also suggested the dominant species in bes bulk solution was impacted by the strength of the electrical field i e distance to electrodes formed around electrodes du et al 2018 it is not yet unclear whether similar spatial distributions also exist in bead 2 4 methane yield methane production rate and process stability in bead the overall strategy for improving bead is closely related with the maximization of the methane yield and the production rate beegle and borole 2018 de vrieze et al 2018 the methane production rate at steady state was similar for ad and bead ad 0 83 0 03 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d bead 0 85 0 08 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d both of which were close to the theoretical value park et al 2018c when the chemical oxygen demand cod is the sole electron donor the theoretical methane yield of bead and ad are the same 0 35 m3 ch4 kg cod assuming no loss to biomass growth buswell and mueller 1952 beegle and borole 2018 in most bead studies cod was the only electron donor and the methane yield was approaching the theoretical maximum park et al 2018c beegle and borole 2018 when a high voltage was provided bead could increase the methane yield on a per cod basis by utilizing the additional electrons produced from water electrolysis eq 9 dou et al 2018 in this case the methane yield depends on the amount of additional electrons produced for example in batlle vilanova et al 2019 dou et al 2018 and zhou et al 2020 the authors reported methane yields between 0 38 and 0 56 m3 ch4 kg cod when 2 0 4 0 v was provided while not increasing the theoretical methane yield or production rate bead was widely shown to increase the process stability the ad process contains multiple interdependent biochemical reactions catalyzed by diverse microbial groups such as fermentative microbes acetogenic microbes homoacetogens and methanogens mao et al 2015 these microbes differ widely with respect to their growth rates substrate utilization rates and sensitivity to environmental variation wang et al 2019 in general methanogens grow relatively slowly and are less robust against environmental variations than organic and vfas oxidizing bacteria acidogens at high olr the imbalance between the quick production of vfas by acidogens and the slow consumption of vfas by methanogens usually results in the accumulation of vfas decrease of ph and loss of methanogenic activities which is the most common reason for ad failures wang et al 2019 bead was shown to overcome the imbalance at high olr by regulating the ph drop and vfas accumulation park et al 2019c sasaki et al 2010 2020a feng et al 2019 hirano et al 2018 park et al 2019c showed that bead achieved stable methane yield 0 32 0 04 m3 ch4 kg cod and organic removal efficiency 76 3 1 7 under olr 10 kg cod m3 d of highly concentrated food waste whereas ad failed at olr of 6 0 kg cod m3 d sasaki et al 2010 and park et al 2020a reported stable methane production in bead under olr 26 9 kg cod m3 d of garbage slurry and 12 0 kg cod m3 d of food waste whereas ad failed at olr 6 0 kg cod m3 d park et al 2020a sasaki et al 2010 hirano et al 2018 reported that when olr was increased from 0 64 to 1 1 kg cod m3 d the acetic acid concentration increased from 1 5 mm to 22 mm in ad but no acetic acid build up was seen in bead feng et al 2019 also reported that when olr was increased from 2 04 0 05 to 5 22 0 02 kg cod m3 d the ph and vfas concentrations in bead were maintained at 7 02 and 680 mg l but changed to undesirable levels i e 6 8 and 1587 mg l respectively in ad one application of the higher stability of bead is quick start up start up is an important step in establishing a proper microbial community in ad process angelidaki et al 2006 ad often requires a stabilization period of 2 9 months during which time it is sensitive to ph decrease and vfas accumulation given the low microorganism activity lauwers et al 1990 angelidaki et al 2006 bead was shown to shorten the start up time and enhance the methane production during the time for example park et al 2018c reported that bead achieved reached an intermediate steady state after 34 days much shorter than the 112 days needed by ad their bead also achieved 70 higher stabilization and methane production rates than ad during start up e g the methane production rates of ad and bead were 0 40 1 6 and 0 67 0 12 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively and an improved methane content in the biogas during start up 55 8 7 5 and 65 8 8 3 for ad and bead respectively although the difference diminished as both reached the steady state 64 4 1 3 and 65 9 1 1 respectively park et al 2018c guo et al 2017 showed that the methane production rate of bead was twice that of ad during the 10 day start up stage and the difference remained after the steady state which were 0 131 and 0 055 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively song et al 2016 also reported fast stabilization rate of bead which required 50 days for start up owing to the ability to main a stable ph 7 2 7 6 song et al 2016 2 5 energy losses in bead the energy loss in bead reactors is similar to that in bes it is often referred to as the internal resistance and is mainly induced by the charge transfer loss and the mass transfer loss fig 4 feng et al 2016 malvankar et al 2012 manohar et al 2008 wang et al 2017b the charge transfer loss is due to the electron transfer resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte or the microorganisms attached to the electrode surface liu et al 2018b and the mass transfer loss is caused by the proton transfer resistance between the anode and the cathode park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b zikmund et al 2018 the mass transfer loss is closely related to the transport of the h released during the oxidation of organic matter from the anode to the cathode dhar and lee 2013 in the double chamber reactors used by early bes studies a key contributor to the mass transfer loss was the membrane separating the two chambers which led to increased resistance for h transfer and the build up of ph gradient in each chamber clauwaert et al 2008b this resistance could be reduced by changing the shape and material of the membrane pant et al 2010 however even with these improvements the h transfer capacity remains limited as compared to the rate of the electrode reactions clauwaert et al 2008b hou et al 2015 single chamber reactors were developed later liu et al 2004 which significantly reduced the mass transfer resistance in bes by removing the membrane that limited the h transfer bead usually adopted the single chamber design park et al 2018c wang et al 2009 feng et al 2016 cai et al 2016 it is generally believed that the mass transfer loss is more important than the charge transfer loss especially in larger scale bead given the distance of h transfer park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b kreig et al 2014 guo et al 2018 however so far a quantitative understanding of the charge transfer and mass transfer losses in bead has not been established in an earlier bes research he et al 2006 showed that the overall internal resistance in an up flow mfc wet volume 0 27 l was 17 13 ohm and that the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances were similar which could be separated into charge transfer electrolyte and diffusion resistances that were 8 62 7 05 and 1 46 ohms respectively they also simulated that the charge transfer and electrolyte resistances would be reduced by approximately 25 when the cod loading was increased from 0 57 to 4 29 kg cod m3 d it is unclear how transferrable their findings are to bead but their reactor used a proton exchange membrane that would have increased the mass transfer resistance and a small electrode distance that was beneficial for reducing the mass transfer resistance since the charge transfer resistance occurs on the electrode surface it is believed to be affected by 1 the characteristics of the electrode materials and 2 the biofilm mass and activity kong et al 2014 yasri and nakhla 2017 therefore efforts to reduce the charge transfer resistance have focused on applying electrode materials with high electric efficiency and surface area kong et al 2014 and maximizing the biofilm mass and activity cai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2014 the mass transfer is generally optimized by reducing the electrode distance and changing the flow patterns several studies revealed that reducing the distance between the anode and the cathode in bes and bead can significantly reduce the mass transfer resistance by improving the ionic diffusion rate but these studies were often based on observations of a reduction in total internal resistance and an increase in electrochemical performance such as the current density hou et al 2015 cheng and logan 2011 park et al 2017 wang et al 2017b park et al 2017 quantified the mass transfer flux and showed that it increased from 3 2 to 7 6 s 1 when the electrode distance was reduced from 5 cm to 1 cm with a concurrent increase of the current density from 0 06 0 04 a m2 to 0 72 0 13 a m2 park et al 2017 efforts to change the flow patterns range from using up flow reactors feng et al 2017 sangeetha et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cui et al 2020a to rotating electrodes park et al 2018a 2018b 2 6 economics of bead information on the economics of bead is limited one research suggested that the net present value npv of bead was better than ad over a 20 year period but both ad and bead had a negative npv beegle and borole 2018 another estimate suggested that the overall cost efficiency of bead was lower because of increased costs for construction operation and maintenance batlle vilanova et al 2019 more specifically beegle and borole 2018 indicated that the projected annual revenue of bead 22 7 ton cod inf was 67 higher than that of ad 13 6 ton codinf from improved biogas production but bead would also increase the annualized capital expenditures capex by 29 8 ton codinf and the operation maintenance o m costs by 4 4 ton codinf beegle and borole 2018 but this o m cost is approximately 400 yr for a 11m3 reactor and is considerably lower than foley et al 2010 which reported that an additional 0 56 kw m3 reactor was needed to supply a voltage of 0 5 v with 90 process efficiency foley et al 2010 would suggest that a 10 m3 bead would require an additional 3000 yr to operate compared to ad assuming 330 days of operation and the 2019 average retail electricity price for industrial consumers 0 0683 kwh guerriero 2020 detailed information and comparison of economics of ad and bead are described at table 3 more systematic economic analyses of bead ideally normalized to the reactor size or cod treated are needed in future research assuming that bead is operated in the low voltage mode i e no additional electron donor introduced through water electrolysis beegle and borole 2018 would suggest that the o m costs of bead need to be reduced by approximately 50 to generate a positive annual cash flow assuming the price of the product is 0 05 kwh as a reference point the current natural gas industrial price is approximately 0 015 kwh in the us but higher elsewhere eia 2020 future bead work should keep these targets in mind and start to integrate low cost construction operation and maintenance into high performance to increase the competitiveness of bead in full scale applications zhang et al 2013 zhen et al 2017 3 technical strategies to improve the practicality of bead 3 1 optimal voltage supply voltage supply is the most widely used optimization parameter in bead blasco gómez et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 voltage is often provided as a potential difference across the anode and cathode instead of as a poised potential due to practicality reasons so far voltage supply has been shown to impact bead in three ways first it induces the proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens which in turn improves the process stability as discussed in section 2 4 second voltage supply affects the internal resistance choi et al 2017 reported that when an over potential is provided i e providing a potential higher than the energy theoretically required for deriving target reactions call and logan 2008 gajaraj et al 2017 an effective reduction of the internal resistance from 4 4 ohm at 0 5 v to 3 2 ohm at 1 0 v and enhancement of the current density from 5 84 a m3 to 19 04 a m3 were achieved third voltage supply impacts the methane production one group of previous studies reported that the optimum voltage in bead for producing methane was 0 3 0 6 v and that the methane production was inhibited when the supplied voltage was higher than 0 6 v chen et al 2016 feng et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2009 another group reported higher optimal voltages choi et al 2017 reported that maximum current and methane production were achieved at an applied of 1 0 v and was followed by the order of voltage 0 7 0 5 and 1 5 v choi et al 2017 the impact of voltage supply is likely intertwined with the other factors such as internal resistance and microbial communities as discussed earlier for example the wide range of optimal voltage was likely related to the differences in the internal resistance caused by the different electrode characteristics and reactor designs choi et al 2017 geppert et al 2016 there is not yet a quantitative understanding of how these factors impact each other and ultimately the bead performance since bead and ad showed similar performance once the steady state is reached it was recently proposed that continuous voltage supply was not necessary and intermittent voltage supply was a more efficient strategy to improve the energy efficiency of bead wang et al 2020 kong et al 2020 the quantitative feasibility of intermittent voltage supply was first demonstrated in cho et al 2019 which reported that bes with short intervals of voltage supply showed a 26 higher current density 31 0 higher hydrogen production and a 36 6 higher methane production than the control reactor with continuous voltage supply they also estimated that the intermittent voltage supply improved the overall energy efficiency from 92 to 111 cho et al 2019 3 2 electrode materials electrode material is another widely attempted engineering optimization in bead ceballos et al 2020 chen et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 noori et al 2020 cui et al 2020b the differences in the electrochemical properties of the electrode material changes the biogas production rate and composition which in turn determines the process efficiency feng et al 2016 the performances of bead with various electrode materials are summarized in table 3 two types of electrode materials have been popular early bead studies usually adopted carbon based brushes and fabric as the electrodes material choi et al 2017 cui et al 2016 kondaveeti and min 2015 the advantage of carbon based electrodes is the high specific surface area high electrochemical efficient and biocompatibility the current density with carbon based electrodes was reported to be 0 15 51 4 a m2 or 2 4 12 3 a m3 table 3 the main disadvantage of carbon based electrode materials is that they are not easy to maintain owing to their low durability and strength tensile strength of graphite 27 5 mpa ayatollahi and torabi 2010 they are also relatively expensive to manufacture and maintain guerrini et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 ledezma et al 2015 park et al 2018a to address these limitations carbon based materials were modified with durable metals reformed or used in granule type bajracharya et al 2015 cui et al 2020b dou et al 2018 for example feng and song 2016 reported enhancement of adhesion of electro active microorganisms and the electron transfer efficiency through the carbon nanotubes deposition and ni on gff electrodes feng and song 2016 liu et al 2018a reported the excellent methane production rate of 4 1 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d and cathodic current density of 35 a m2 with granular graphite electrode when cathodic potential of 1 1 v vs ag agcl is applied recently metal electrodes particularly stainless steel ss electrodes have been used in bead the main advantage of stainless steel is the low cost and high durability and strength 630 mpa over 20 times higher than graphite bo et al 2014 escapa et al 2016 guerrini et al 2014 guo et al 2015 kim et al 2019 ledezma et al 2015 park et al 2018a pu et al 2020 muralimohan et al 2014 wang and yu 2019 wang and yu 2019 estimated that the cost of stainless steel was 1200 1500 ton which was only a quarter to one tenth of graphite 4536 18 144 ton noori et al 2020 estimated that the cost of stainless steel was 30 8 m2 much less than carbon based felt cloth and paper 145 8 m2 278 m2 and 462 m2 respectively in addition in the current market the production capacity of stainless steel is much larger than graphite wang and yu 2019 ss electrodes have demonstrated good electrochemical and high electrochemical efficiency 6 1 2 2 a m2 liu et al 2017a reported that the heat treated ss cathode exhibited current to methane and voltage to methane efficiencies of 60 8 and 21 9 respectively similar to graphite felt hagos et al 2018 demonstrated that stainless steel mesh electrodes increased the methane production rate by 65 compared to ad bo et al 2014 reported that the organic matter removal efficiency and methane production was improved by 200 with barrel shaped ss cathodes compared with ad guo et al 2015 reported high current density and good biofilm adhesion using a heat treating stainless steel felt anode with enriched iron oxide on the electrode surface additionally the high electrochemical efficiency was maintained with larger electrodes indicating the potential for full scale application guo et al 2015 moreover due to the good mechanical strength and plasticity ss felt can be easily fabricated into different configurations to further increase the specific surface area and optimize the mass transfer in the reactor guo et al 2015 the main disadvantage of ss electrodes is the risk of corrosion low grade stainless steel has poor corrosion resistance under the acidic condition often encountered in bead rousseau et al 2020 to avoid corrosion a high grade stainless steel e g 254 smo en 1 4547 astm uns s31254 is preferred which can resist corrosion in marine environments due to the molybdenum content but at the expense of increased costs rousseau et al 2020 in summary the high conductivity excellent scale up possibility low capital cost and high bioelectro catalytic performance make ss as a scalable electrode material for bead further research to improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steel is warranted 3 3 geometric reactor and electrode configurations as bead is being scaled up the electrochemical losses will increase due to increased internal resistance beegle and borole 2018 wang et al 2017b reactor configurations and process designs will be important to maintain efficiency in the scale up of bead hou et al 2015 park et al 2018a 2018b ran et al 2014 sangeetha et al 2017 a summary of the reactor configurations and process designs attempted thus far is presented in table 4 and fig 5 among the various aspects of reactor design electrode distance has been reported as one of the most impactful factors a higher electrode distance leads to increased mass transfer resistance and therefore increased internal resistance and decreased electrochemical efficiency of bead beegle and borole 2018 park et al 2017 similar to earlier bes results cheng and logan 2011 park et al 2017 reported that the current density in bead decreased from 0 72 to 0 06 a m2 when the electrode distance was increased from 1 to 5 cm presumably because of increased internal resistance park et al 2017 hou et al 2015 increased the methane production rate and cod removal efficiency by over 100 compared with regular ad by minimizing the electrode spacing and maximizing the electrode area with the installation of spiral type anode carbon cloth and cathode nickel which was attributed to the reduced internal resistance another important consideration in reactor design is the flow pattern which impacts the mass transfer resistance between the electrodes and thereby the internal resistance kundu et al 2013 various flow and mixing schemes were attempted to limit the mass transfer resistance by increasing the flux gradient the mass transfer rate and the mixing velocity park et al 2017 uasb is one of the widely applied designs to reduce the internal resistance fig 5c d owing to the up flow patterns that enhance the mass transfer capacity between electrodes feng et al 2017 sangeetha et al 2017 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2017 improved the methane production rate by 90 when a circulation flow rate of 3q was applied in an upflow bead 3 88 and 2 08 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d respectively the reactor configuration can also reduce the internal resistance by mass transfer generated through a different hydraulic reactor characteristic park et al 2018a another type of efforts is the installation and arrangement of multi or series configuration guo and kim 2019 2018 ran et al 2014 rader and logan 2010 demonstrated the possibility of continuous flow bes by stacking up eight sets of electrodes anode graphite fiber brush cathode stainless steel mesh and they reported current densities of 1 18 a m2 and methane production rate of 0 118 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d guo and kim 2019 achieved highest current density of 1 4 a m2 and wastewater treatment efficiency of 90 20 in a stacked reactor with 10 pairs of electrodes ran et al 2014 obtained up to 70 1 methane content and 98 0 cod removal efficiency in a multi stage anaerobic baffled reactor sangeetha et al 2017 and cui et al 2016 reported that the position and the order of the electrodes had a significant effect on methane production while is proven useful for improving the bioelectrochemical efficiencies the multi electrode design results in high a v ratios that will increase the capital costs and energy consumption of bead ran et al 2014 feng et al 2017 hou et al 2015 for example the a v ratios were 66 7 m2 m3 ran et al 2014 135 5 m2 m3 guo and kim 2019 and 62 7 m2 m3 hou et al 2015 in multi electrode signs as compared to 0 023 21 0 m2 m3 in single electrode designs park et al 2017 de vrieze et al 2014 guo et al 2015 li et al 2016 hagos et al 2018 4 suggestions for further research directions 4 1 target applications so far the evidence suggests that compared to ad the most commonly used bead voltage supply 1 0 v does not increase the methane yield per cod removed nor the steady state methane production rate the main advantage of bead is its capability to maintain process stability at high olr and during shocks e g sharply changing waste streams owing to its ability to regulate the ph drop and vfas accumulation that cause ad failures as such future bead studies could consider targeting the following conditions feng et al 2018 flores rodriguez et al 2019 1 when ad operated at high olr bead has higher operational stability at high olrs than ad section 2 4 based on previous studies bead could tolerate olrs 30 180 higher than ad and achieve 1 7 3 2 times the methane production rate park et al 2020a sasaki et al 2010 hirano et al 2018 feng et al 2019 guo et al 2017 song et al 2016 park et al 2018c the ability of bead to treat higher olrs will reduce the reactor volume required by 1 2 2 3 or increase the cod removal by 200 300 per unit time which will reduce the footprint of ad facilities ziganshin et al 2016 2 when substrate characteristics are variable daily and seasonal variations of substrates i e food waste livestock manure and waste activated sludge and conditions i e temperature and olr cause starvation and shocks to microorganisms especially methanogens in ad and inhibit the methane yield for example when the olr increases by 220 which is very typical for food waste the vfas concentration in ad will increase by 130 160 and ph will decrease to less than 7 0 leading to 18 37 drop in the total methane production jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 park et al 2018c a temperature of 10 15 c will reduce the methane production rates by 51 compared to 30 c liu et al 2014 bead was shown to enhance specific methanogen activity 1 7 folds in mesophilic bead and 5 6 folds in psychrophilic bead which can be used to provide process stability under varying input operational parameters park et al 2018b liu et al 2016a 3 when quick start up is required after initial set up or interruptions the start up period or the restart period after maintenance is generally considered the most critical step in ad and is often a long and variable process that depends on the substrate characteristics the source of microorganisms the size of inoculum and the initial mode of operation gallert and winter 2008 for example wei et al 2017 reported that after the ad performance was inhibited due to vfas accumulation 60 days of restart period were needed to reach steady state again even with an increased hrt from 10 to 20 days wei et al 2017 even when ad was not challenged by difficult conditions such as vfas accumulation jauregui jauregui et al 2014 reported 22 30 days were needed for restart and start up impaired performance during start up or restart periods results in 41 95 methane losses in previous studies bead could provide excellent abilities in enrichment of microorganisms with its high activity park et al 2018c guo et al 2017 song et al 2016 4 when vfas are accumulating and or ph is decreasing due to the increase of acidic organic wastes and low methanogenic activity bead could achieve rapid vfas removal via anodic reactions eqs 1 3 and h reduction to h2 and ch4 via cathodic reactions eqs 4 6 negative charges on electrodes formed by supplied voltage could make enrichment of vfas oxidizing and h2 producing bacterial species and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in biofilm and bulk solution of reactor which can provide conditions to prevent vfas accumulation and ph decrease sravan et al 2018 baek et al 2017 lee et al 2017 4 2 process integration and optimization as suggested in section 4 1 and earlier de vrieze et al 2018 bead is more likely a supplement than a replacement of ad for example for ad to achieve the theoretical yield extensive efforts were often needed such as pre treatments eskicioglu et al 2006 phase separation nasr et al 2012 maintaining relatively low olrs of 2 0 kg cod m3 d park et al 2018c siles et al 2010 addition of chemicals zhu et al 2015 and maintaining steady operational conditions park et al 2018c all of which are to balance the rate of different reactions and electron transfer eskicioglu et al 2006 nasr et al 2012 park et al 2018c siles et al 2010 williams et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in practical applications maintaining such optimum operational conditions may be difficult as the feed streams and environmental conditions e g the substrate characteristics olr and temperature are constantly changing williams et al 2013 integrating bead into ad e g to replace certain pretreatments or augment ad as a side stream treatment fig 6 may be a promising application of bead de vrieze et al 2014 first showed the possibility of side stream bead application and reported that the organic acids degradation and methane production increased immediately when electrodes were installed and voltage was supplied to a failing ad reactor that were accumulating acids de vrieze et al 2014 park et al 2020a and cerrillo et al 2018 further developed side stream bead by circulating sludge to a bead reactor that was 1 8 1 7 the volume of the main ad reactor which achieved equally good methane yields up to the theoretical value of 0 35 0 02 m3 ch4 kg cod and process resilience as main stream bead under transient high orl side stream application of small capacity bead would reduce the energy requirement and the capital cost of bead park et al 2019a estimated that side stream bead reduced the energy demand by 48 compared to main stream bead intermittent voltage supply could be adopted in side stream bead to further improve the costs chen et al 2017 and park et al 2018a 2019a reported that the intermittent voltage supply to the side stream bead at high olr had a significant impact on performance recovery economical effectiveness of the intermittent and the side stream voltage supply could be also achieved by solar bead module and or reactor wang et al 2020 but it is not quantitative yet side stream bead reactor and or module supported by solar power could provide various electrode configurations and reduce energy required to voltage supply wang et al 2020 cui et al 2020a park et al 2019a 4 3 scalability the scalability of bead needs to be further investigated the largest bead reactor reported so far is 0 91 m3 cusick et al 2011 cusick et al 2011 achieved a total volume of 1 0 m3 effective volume 0 91 m3 using a continuous flow reactor containing 114 electrode pairs in 24 modules cusick et al 2011 at an applied voltage of 0 9 v the current density reached 7 4 a m3 and methane production reached 0 16 0 03 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d in their reactor cusick et al 2011 wang et al 2017c reported a maximum methane production rate of 2 01 0 13 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d and a cod removal efficiency of 93 5 1 6 in their pilot scale bead reactor effective volume 0 8 m3 when treating a concentrated influent with cods of 30 230 4 1074 3 mg l their reactor was also a stacked design with 6 electrode pairs an a v ratio of 9 6 m2 m3 and electrode distance of 5 cm wang et al 2017c 5 conclusion bead is a promising technology that can augment ad the complementary nature of biological activity and electrochemical reactions affords bead process stability advantages under some difficult conditions particularly those challenged by high olr vfas accumulation and low ph the economics of bead appear to be on par with ad but to be market competitive the economics of bead need to be improved in the scale up a combination of innovations in the reactor configuration operation and electrode material will be likely be required among the evidence presented thus far auxiliary systems and corrosion resistant metal electrodes e g stainless steel will likely emerge as the more promising option owing to the design flexibility and cost effectiveness also warrant further studies include the activity of suspended biomass and innovative reactor configurations that can reduce the mass transfer resistance both of which could lead to simplified and innovative reactor designs to further improve the cost effectiveness of bead declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by the ministry of trade industry and energy motie and korea

17654,there are many reports on the detection and removal of emerging pollutants in the wastewater effluents while the fate of their chlorinated derivatives generated during chlorination is not well understood here we investigated the photodegradation of chlorinated derivatives of bisphenol a cdbpas mainly including 3 chlorobisphenol a 3 3 dichlorobisphenol a 3 5 dichlorobisphenol a 3 3 5 trichlorobisphenol a and 3 3 5 5 tetrachlorobisphenol a under simulated sunlight distinct from bpa cdbpas underwent rapid direct photodegradation due to a pronounced bathochromic shift of uv absorption the photodegradation of cdbpas was significantly enhanced by effluent organic matter efom from the wastewater effluent a series of quenching experiments and laser flash photolysis analysis verified the contribution of triplet states of efom 3efom for the indirect photodegradation of cdbpas with rate constant of 109 m 1 s 1 both direct and efom induced indirect photodegradation of cdbpas increased with a higher degree of chlorination furthermore high resolution mass spectrometry showed similar photoproducts for direct and indirect photodegradation of cdbpas mainly ascribed to the cleavage of c cl bond and hydroxylation with further cleavage of the benzene ring the estrogenic activity of the photoproducts was diminished these findings suggest that photodegradation is an important pathway for the removal and detoxication of cdbpas from effluents and receiving natural waters under sunlight graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater effluent chlorination bisphenol a photodegradation effluent organic matter estrogenic activity 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa a kind of endocrine disrupting chemical edc is one of the most extensively used industrial chemicals in plastics with an estimated production of over 8 billion pounds per year pahigian and zuo 2018 due to its broad use in many consumer products and leaching from plastic materials bpa is ubiquitous in the environment and has been detected in foodstuffs drinking water and even in humans im and löffler 2016 russo et al 2019 schecter et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 zuo and zhu 2014 bpa has a strong estrogenic effect and thus imposes great risks to human health howdeshell et al 1999 terasaki et al 2005 effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the primary sources of bpa released into the aquatic environment klečka et al 2009 zafra et al 2003 chlorination is the oldest and the most commonly used disinfection technique in wwtps around the world deborde and von gunten 2008 lau et al 2016 wu et al 2009 during chlorination bpa is transformed into chlorinated derivatives cdbpas yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 mainly including 3 chlorobisphenol a 3 clbpa 3 3 dichlorobisphenol a 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 dichlorobisphenol a 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 trichlorobisphenol a 3 3 5 triclbpa and 3 3 5 5 tetrachlorobisphenol a tcbpa gallard et al 2004 hu et al 2002 these cdbpas have been widely detected in effluents of wwtps surface waters drinking waters and even in humans at concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 5 00 μg l 1 chen et al 2016 doumas et al 2018 fan et al 2013 fukazawa et al 2001 liu et al 2009 migeot et al 2013 zafra et al 2003 the estrogenic activity of cdbpas is much higher than that of the parent compound hu et al 2002 terasaki et al 2011 j zhang et al 2018 for example a yeast bioassay showed that 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa exhibits 8 38 8 20 and 3 fold higher estrogenic activity than bpa respectively fukazawa et al 2002 therefore it is essential to understand the fate and the ecological risk of these emerging chlorinated derivatives although various methods have been employed for the degradation and transformation of bpa chin et al 2004 huang et al 2013 lin et al 2009 few studies were focused on the environmental fate of cdbpas it is well known that direct and indirect photodegradation is an important elimination pathway for emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment bianco et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2010 zhang and zhou 2008 in natural waters phenolic compounds are mainly in the neutral form and absorb at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm thereby they are resistant to solar photodegradation boule et al 1982 the chlorination of phenolic compounds in wwtps introduces halogen substituent to the benzene ring which gives rise to p π conjugation between chlorine lone pair p electrons and phenyl π electrons the p π conjugation causes a bathochromic shift of the uv absorption spectrum and an increase of acid dissociation constant due to lower delocalization energy of phenolic ring chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 which facilitates the deprotonation of chlorinated derivatives the anionic forms absorb at longer wavelengths up to 320 nm boule et al 1982 resulting in the absorption spectrum of the chlorinated derivatives overlap with the terrestrial sunlight therefore the chlorinated derivatives are expected to undergo direct photodegradation upon the irradiation of sunlight effluent organic matter efom in the wwtps can screen light due to inner filter and also act as a photosensitizer via formation of reactive species such as triplet states of efom 3efom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh which play important roles in the indirect photodegradation of emerging contaminants bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 lee et al 2013 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 zhang et al 2014 it is well known that the triplet state of dissolved organic matter 3dom can react directly with organic pollutants via electron or energy transfer interaction chen et al 2012 2009 makunina et al 2015 sharpless and blough 2014 wenk et al 2011 to our best knowledge few documents have reported the indirect photodegradation of chlorinated pollutants with triplet states of efom the objectives of this work were to i evaluate the formation and photodegradation of cdbpas including 3 clbpa 3 3

available chlorine were purchased from sigma aldrich usa the primary chemical properties of bpa and cdbpas are shown in table s1 of the supporting information si the wastewater effluent ph 7 0 0 2 toc 7 7 0 4 mg l 1 was obtained from a typical municipal sewage plant in hubei province china efom were prepared by a solid phase extraction process see details in text s1 all chemicals used were of at least analytical reagent grade ultrapure water was obtained from a millipore milli q system and used in all experiments hybrid yeast powder kit was obtained from aquality technology wuxi co ltd jiangsu china 2 2 chlorination and photodegradation experiments the chlorination experiments were initiated by adding bpa to the chlorine containing 10 0 mg l 1 pure water or efom solution under dark conditions respectively at different reaction time 1 0 ml of solution was rapidly transferred into a 2 0 ml hplc vial previously filled with 50 μl of na2s2o3 100 g l 1 to quench the residual chlorine the solutions were then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to determine the concentrations of bpa and cdbpas with chlorination time the same chlorination procedure was also performed under simulated sunlight irradiation the light source was a 150 w xenon short arc lamp with a 300 nm cutoff filter which has been widely used to simulate sunlight ma et al 2020 wan et al 2019 the scheme of the irradiation device can be found in the previous study wan et al 2018 the solution temperature was maintained at 22 1 c by a temperature control unit the emission spectrum of the light used is given in fig s1 the intensity of the light 8 7 10 8 e l 1 s 1 was controlled by constant electric current and monitored by p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer laszakovits et al 2017 the photodegradation experiments were performed in a 60 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 30 mm inner diameter containing 50 ml of solution bpa and cdbpas in pure water or efom solution toc 8 0 mg l 1 ph 7 0 were irradiated under simulated sunlight the loss of bpa or cdbpas was negligible in the dark photolysis experiments of cdbpas were also conducted in a nitrogen saturated solution to evaluate the influence of o2 on photodegradation the quenching experiments were performed with the addition of nan3 50 mm isopropanol 50 mm and sorbic acid 10 mm to examine the roles of 1o2 oh and 3efom in the photodegradation of cdbpas respectively chen et al 2009 lian et al 2017 moor et al 2019 y n zhang et al 2018 three replicates were included for all photodegradation experiments 2 3 analytical methods the uv vis absorption spectra of the samples were obtained by an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific u s a the concentrations of bpa and cdbpas were measured using a hplc uv system essentia lc 15c shimadzu japan with an apollo c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm the mobile phase was 60 acetonitrile 40 phosphate buffer ph 2 5 10 mm the detection wavelength was

with a heated electrospray ionization hesi source see details in text s2 the formulas and structures of the photodegradation products were determined based on accurate m z analysis using thermo scientific xcalibur 4 1 software all mathematically possible formulas for each ion were calculated with a mass tolerance of 10 ppm the estrogenic activity of the cdbpas before and after photodegradation was measured by a yeast two hybrid assay text s3 2 4 laser flash photolysis experiments transient absorption experiments were carried out with laser flash photolysis lfp setup using the third harmonic 355 nm of an nd yag laser sli 10 continuum electro optics inc u s a as an excitation source pulse duration 6 ns pulse energy 1 10 mj time resolution ca 50 ns that was previously described in previous studies makunina et al 2015 yurkova et al 2013 a 150 w xenon lamp was adopted as the probe light to prevent quenching of the excited triplet species by dissolved oxygen nitrogen was bubbled to the solutions during the lfp experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of bpa fig s2 and s3 show the degradation profile of bpa peak intensity and formation of new peaks attributed to transformation products of bpa during chlorination in pure water and efom solution respectively according to the comparison with standard samples the concentration variation of bpa and its chlorinated derivatives with chlorination time under different conditions are presented in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a and c bpa disappeared rapidly during chlorination in dark in both pure water and efom solution meanwhile 3 clbpa rapidly increased to a maximum concentration of 8 3 μm in the first 0 5 min and then gradually decreased within the next 20 min simultaneously with the formation of 3 3 diclbpa and 3 5 diclbpa which increased over time to final concentrations of 0 6 and 6 1 μm respectively 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa were formed within the first 20 min of reaction the chlorination of bpa by naclo was in agreement with the previous studies hu et al 2002 lane et al 2015 the sum of bpa and cdbpas decreased slightly during chlorination in the dark condition fig 1a and c in contrast it was dramatically reduced upon irradiation of simulated sunlight fig 1b and d it is reported that solar photolysis of free available chlorine generates reactive species such as oh and chlorine radicals cl cheng et al 2019 which might contribute to the degradation of bpa nevertheless there was very little difference on the formation of intermediates under dark or simulated sunlight in the first 10 min of chlorination figs s2 and s3 suggesting that the solar chlorine system had little influence on the chlorination of bpa in this study besides the residual chlorine was negligible after 20 min of chlorination while cdbpas gradually decrease fig 1b and d indicating photodegradation was a significant pathway for the attenuation of cdbpas the attenuation of the sum of bpa and cdbpas was fitted to a pseudo first order reaction model showing rate constants of 0 019 and 0 036 min 1 in the pure water and efom solution respectively fig 1b and d therefore the efom significantly accelerated the photodegradation of cdbpas under simulated sunlight 3 2 direct photodegradation of cdbpas when exposed to simulated sunlight bpa was hardly degraded in pure water while an obvious loss of cdbpas was observed fig s4 the direct photodegradation rates of cdbpas increased with higher chlorine substitution in the order of 3 clbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa tcbpa the substitution of chlorine on the benzene ring of bpa leads to the p π conjugation effect and thus causes a bathochromic shift of the uv absorption to the terrestrial solar spectrum and also an increase of acid dissociation constants fig 2 and table s1 for instance the pk a1 values were 9 6 9 1 8 8 8 1 7 8 and 7 5 for bpa 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively table s1 the decrease of pk a facilitates the dissociation to anion forms in neutral ph conditions which in turn increases the uv absorption bathochromic shift and direct photodegradation fig 3 further shows that the direct photodegradation of cdbpas increased with ph corresponding to the increase of the fraction of deprotonated forms of cdbpas in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s5 indicating that anion forms contributed to the direct photodegradation 3 3 photosensitization effect of efom fig s6 shows that the photodegradation of cdbpas was remarkably enhanced in the efom solution compared to that in pure water the observed photodegradation rate constants of 3 clbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa increased from 0 007 0 008 0 012 0 013 and 0 018 min 1 in pure water to 0 011 0 020 0 023 0 036 and 0 095 min 1 in efom solution at ph 7 0 respectively fig 4 which suggested that indirect photodegradation played a crucial role in the efom solution the efom had absorbance at λ 300 nm fig s7 indicating that the light screening or photosensitization effect by efom could be involved during light exposure the total light screening factor of efom ŝ λ was then calculated according to eq 1 gomis et al 2014 walse et al 2004 1 s ˆ λ i λ 1 10 α λ ε λ c l ε λ c α λ ε λ c i λ 1 10 ε λ c l where i λ is the lamp irradiance at a specific wavelength c and ε λ are the concentration and molar extinction coefficient of cdbpas respectively α λ is the absorption coefficient of the efom solution and l is the path length the calculated ŝ λ values increased with the increasing concentration of cdbpas table s2 accordingly the indirect photodegradation rate constant k in of cdbpas sensitized by efom can be calculated by eq 2 zhang et al 2010 y n zhang et al 2018 2 k in k obs efom k di efom k obs efom ŝ λ k di where k obs efom is the total observed photodegradation rate constant of cdbpas in efom solution k di and k di efom are the direct photodegradation rate constants of cdbpas in pure water and efom solution respectively the k in values were calculated as 0 005 0 013 0 013 0 025 0 080 min 1 which account for 43 0 57 1 65 3 70 3 and 84 4 of the k obs efom of 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively fig 4 besides the photodegradation of cdbpas and the contribution of indirect photodegradation increased with the decrease of initial cdbpas concentration fig s8 further indicating the indirect photodegradation sensitized by efom played a primary role in the photodegradation of cdbpas 3 4 quenching experiments to examine the mechanism of the direct and indirect photodegradation of cdbpas a series of quenching experiments were performed as shown in fig 5 a the addition of 1o2 quencher nan3 and oh inhibitor isopropanol exhibited negligible effects on the photodegradation of cdbpas in pure water which excluded the role of 1o2 and oh for the direct photodegradation in contrast the presence of triplet state quencher sorbic acid markedly decreased the photodegradation by approximately 60 fig 5a indicating the excited triplet states of cdbpas 3cdbpa were significant reactive species involving in the direct photodegradation moreover the n2 sparging deoxygenation led to a pronounced increase of the pseudo first order rate constants k obs fig 5a since oxygen is a quencher of excited triplet states of most organic compounds lian et al 2017 the deoxygenation increased the concentration and lifetime of excited triplet states allowing a higher fraction of 3cdbpa to be transformed therefore the direct photodegradation was mainly ascribed to the decomposition of 3cdbpa for the photodegradation of cdbpas in efom solution similar results were observed during the quenching and deoxygenation experiments fig 5b previous studies have shown that the photoinduced of 1o2 and oh from efom were important reactive species for the transformation of organic contaminants bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 thus the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss and oh oh ss in the efom solution under simulated sunlight were determined using furfuryl alcohol and terephthalate as chemical probes text s4 and fig s9 and found to be 1 83 0 17 10 13 and 1 21 0 22 10 16 m for 1o2 ss and oh ss respectively the generation of 1o2 and oh was also confirmed by electron spin resonance esr spectrometry fig s10 which was consistent with the transformation of probe molecules fig s9 the bimolecular reaction rate constants of each cdbpa with 1o2 and oh were determined by competition kinetics text s4 figs s11 and s12 the 1o2 and oh reaction rate constants for cdbpas were in the range of 0 25 3 29 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 18 6 55 109 m 1 s 1 respectively table s3 the pseudo first order rate constants for the reaction of cdbpas with 1o2 and oh were then calculated to be 0 45 6 03 10 5 and 1 43 7 92 10 7 s 1 thus 1o2 and oh accounted for approximately 3 6 and 0 2 of the total degradation of cdbpas in the efom solution respectively which was consistent with the quenching effect of nan3 and isopropanol on reaction fig 5b therefore 1o2 and oh contributed little to the indirect photodegradation of cdbpas in efom solution in contrast the photodegradation rate of cdbpas in efom solution decreased obviously after the addition of sorbic acid indicating that 3efom was the primary reactive species for indirect photodegradation the enhanced photodegradation in the deoxygenated efom solution further confirmed that the indirect photodegradation was mainly attributed to 3efom 3 5 energy transfer mechanism it is well known that 3dom can react directly with organic pollutants via electron or energy transfer interaction for the electron transfer case previous studies have shown that the reaction of phenolic compounds with 3dom is initiated via charge transfer from the o electrons of the phenols to 3dom canonica et al 2000 1995 however the chlorine substitution remarkably increases the one electron oxidation potential e cdbpa cdbpa of cdbpas text s5 and table s4 thus the electron donating ability of cdbpas decreased with the increasing number of cl substituents which was in the contrary order for the photosensitization effect of efom fig 4 besides the e cdbpa cdbpa values 1 9 2 3 v vs she were higher than the one electron reduction potential of most 3dom e 3dom dom 1 4 1 9 v vs she mcneill and canonica 2016 therefore the electron transfer from cdbpas to 3efom could be ruled out on the other hand we further examined the possibility of energy transfer interaction between cdbpas and 3efom the phosphorescence spectra of bpa cdbpas and efom were recorded at 77 k fig s13 interestingly cdbpas showed a much longer peak wavelength 500 nm of the 0 0 level for t1 s0 transition than that of bpa 389 nm and efom 413 nm indicating that the triplet state energy of bpa decreased markedly after chlorination and thus render the energy transfer feasible from 3efom to cdbpas the calculated lowest triplet state energy e t1 of bpa and cdbpas was in agreement with the phosphorescence spectra table s4 and fig s13 moreover the addition of sorbic acid a high energy triplet states 239 247 kj mol 1 quencher mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2019 inhibited the photodegradation of cdbpas by approximately 90 in efom solution fig 5b this result indicated that high energy 3efom was significantly responsible for the sensitization of cdbpas e t1 263 282 kj mol 1 and further verified the little contribution of low energy 3efom for cdbpas photodegradation via electron transfer reaction therefore the energy transfer was the main photosensitization pathway for indirect photodegradation of cdbpas 3 6 laser flash photolysis to further investigate the interaction between 3efom and cdbpas laser flash photolysis experiments were performed fig 6 a shows the transient absorption spectra of nitrogen saturated efom solution after excitation by a 355 nm laser pulse noted that direct photodegradation of cdbpas was excluded since no light absorption at this wavelength the broad unstructured absorption band centered at 440 nm was assigned to the 3efom absorption which was sensitive to o2 fig 6a inset the triplet lifetime of efom τ t was determined to be around 77 μs in nitrogen saturated solution as can be seen in fig s14a when tcbpa was added to the efom solution the absorption of 3efom at 440 nm decreased with the formation of a new absorption peak at 400 nm the calculated result shows that the absorption spectrum of the t1 state of tcbpa 3tcbpa has the main absorption band at around 390 nm fig s14b previous studies also showed that halogenophenols exhibit absorption peaks at 400 nm in the transient spectra bonnichon et al 2001 grabner et al 1994 pelras et al 2017 accordingly the absorption band at 400 nm was attributed to the 3tcbpa formed by energy transfer from 3efom the decay of the 3efom was further monitored in the presence of different concentrations of tcbpa fig 6b by the plot of the rate of decay at 440 nm against tcbpa concentration fig 6b inset the rate constant of interaction between 3efom and tcbpa was calculated to be 1 64 108 m 1 s 1 based on the quenching experiments and lfp results the interaction between 3efom and cdbpas in the deoxygenated efom solution involves the following reactions efom h v k f e 3 fom e 3 fom reaction 1 e 3 fom k d efom reaction 2 e 3 fom cdbpa k q efom c 3 dbpa reaction 3 c 3 dbpa k d cdbpa reaction 4 c 3 dbpa k r products reaction 5 accordingly the indirect photodegradation rate of cdbpas sensitized by 3efom r in 3 efom can be given by eq 3 3 r in e 3

reaction rate constant for the reaction between 3efom and cdbpas assuming that the formation rate of 3efom k f 3 efom was constant in the irradiated efom solution the steady state concentration of the

independent decay of 3efom 1 3 104 s 1 according to triplet lifetime k d and k r are the observed deactivation and degradation rate constants of 3cdbpa respectively substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3 yields 6 r in e 3 fom k r k q k f e 3 fom efom cdbpa k d k r k d k q cdbpa eq 6 can be rearranged as eq 7 7 1 r in e 3 fom k d f k q 1 cdbpa 1 f where 8 f k r k f e 3 fom efom k d k r to further investigate the reaction between 3efom and cdbpas a 340 nm filter cut off below 340 nm was used to avoid the direct photodegradation of cdbpas fig s15a based on the indirect photodegradation kinetics of cdbpas in the deoxygenated efom solution fig s15b and table s5 the fitting of eq 7 to the experimental data is shown in fig 7 the solid lines r2 0 99 p 0 05 according to the ratios of y intercept to slope of the fitted lines the k q values were calculated to be 6 01 108 8 41 108 8 22 108 1 09 109 and 1 74 109 m 1 s 1 for 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively with an average value of 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 the k q values obtained were higher than the quenching rate constants between 3efom and tcbpa determination by lfp 1 64 108 m 1 s 1 which was attributed to the higher formation of triplets when using simulated sunlight 340 nm as the light source compared to the laser radiation 355 nm the cdbpa with a higher degree of chlorination exhibited higher reaction rate constant with 3efom which was in accordance with the indirect photodegradation sensitized by efom fig 4 3 7 photodegradation products and pathway the photodegradation products of cdbpas were identified using hr lc ms ms fig s16 s25 based on the analysis of the mass spectra the photoproducts were identified as shown in table s6 s10 similar photoproducts were observed when cdbpas were irradiated in pure water and efom solution indicating that cdbpas underwent similar pathways in the absence and presence of efom this result further confirms the energy transfer occurred from 3efom to cdbpas fig 8 demonstrates the formation of main photodegradation products in the efom solution during irradiation for each of cdbpas the hydroxylated intermediates i e products a1 b4 c1 d2 and e2 were determined to be major photoproducts which were rapidly formed in the first stage of simulated sunlight exposure and then gradually decreased fig 8 besides the dechlorination oxygenation i e products a5 b2 c3 and d3 and ring opening i e products a6 b3 and c4 intermediates were also detected as minor photoproducts for cdbpas these results indicated that the photodegradation of cdbpas proceeded by the cleavage of the c cl bond and hydroxylation followed by the cleavage of benzene rings besides the t1 states of cdbpas were optimized by density functional theory dft calculation text s5 and table s11 as can be seen one c cl bond was broken in the t1 state of cdbpas suggesting that dechlorination was likely to occur easily during photodegradation of cdbpas which was in accord with the photoproducts determination based on the identified photodegradation products and the analysis of the reaction intermediates the proposed photodegradation pathways of cdbpas in efom solution are shown in scheme 1 for the mono chlorinated derivative of bpa when exposed to simulated sunlight 3 clbpa was excited to form a triplet state directly or sensitized by 3efom then the cleavage of the c cl bond occurred initially yielding the hydroxyphenyl radical followed by hydroxyl substitution to yield hydroxylated intermediate a1 m z 243 1025 major or free radical hydrogen abstraction to yield dechlorinated product bpa m z 227 1074 minor meanwhile in the presence of oxygen the hydroxyphenyl radicals could also be attacked by o2 to form peroxy radicals and subsequently yield benzoquinone intermediate a5 m z 241 0868 which could be further oxidized to ring opening product a6 m z 275 0926 besides 3 clbpa could deprotonate in the excited state and rearrange with loss of a chloride ion to give a cco group which further transformed to carboxyl with h2o yielding product a7 m z 243 1024 a similar process has been previously reported for the photolysis of 2 chlorophenol czaplicka 2006 for the di tri and tetra chlorinated derivatives of bpa they underwent similar photodegradation pathways to yield the corresponding products as shown in scheme 1 3 8 estrogenic activity attenuation after photodegradation the estrogenic activity of the photodegradation products of edcs is considered to be an important factor impacting aquatic ecosystems pahigian and zuo 2018 roberts et al 2017 fig s26 shows the results of the yeast two hybrid estrogenic activity assay of bpa and cdbpas in pure water before photolysis bpa and cdbpas conformed to s shaped dose response relationships the ec50 values of bpa 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa were 11 05 0 71 1 31 0 53 2 20 and 0 77 μm respectively cdbpas exhibited higher estrogenic activity than bpa itself which was in agreement with previous studies fukazawa et al 2002 hu et al 2002 however the estrogenic activity of cdbpas was nearly not detected after photodegradation suggesting the photodegradation effectively decreased the capacity of cdbpas to bind the estrogen receptor therefore the photodegradation of cdbpas significantly reduced their estrogenic activity and the photodegradation products have little secondary risk to the aquatic environment 4 conclusion in this study for the first time the environmental fate of bpa and its chlorinated derivatives in the wwtps effluent was investigated the chlorination of bpa leads to the formation of cdbpas with higher estrogenic activity which exhibits a higher risk to the aquatic ecosystems however the introduction of chlorine substituent to the benzene ring of bpa causes a bathochromic shift of uv absorption to partly overlap with sunlight spectrum resulting in rapid direct photolysis under sunlight irradiation here photodegradation was presented to be the significant elimination pathway of cdbpas under simulated sunlight a higher degree of chlorination facilitates the photodegradation moreover the efom from the wastewater effluent significantly accelerated the attenuation of cdbpas via photosensitization effect 3efom was the main reactive species involved in the photodegradation of cdbpas with a rate constant 109 m 1 s 1 the other edcs widely detected in wwtps such as estrone estradiol 17α ethynyl estradiol diethylstilbestrol 4 nonylphenol 4 octylphenol and di n butyl phthalate typically exhibit n π transition with a characteristic uv absorption peak at 280 nm and tailing into 300 nm close to the initial wavelength of terrestrial sunlight fig s27 these edcs cannot undergo noticeable direct photodegradation according to grotthuss draper s law like cdbpas the chlorination of these edcs in wwtps thus results in chlorinated derivatives that are photolabile moreover since chlorine disinfection is the most conventional and frequent process for effluents in wwtps before being discharged into natural waters the ubiquitous dom in the surface waters also exhibits a similar photosensitization effect for the chlorinated derivatives the subsequent direct and indirect photodegradation become important attenuation pathways for the chlorinated derivatives and thus diminish their estrogenic activity future

17654,there are many reports on the detection and removal of emerging pollutants in the wastewater effluents while the fate of their chlorinated derivatives generated during chlorination is not well understood here we investigated the photodegradation of chlorinated derivatives of bisphenol a cdbpas mainly including 3 chlorobisphenol a 3 3 dichlorobisphenol a 3 5 dichlorobisphenol a 3 3 5 trichlorobisphenol a and 3 3 5 5 tetrachlorobisphenol a under simulated sunlight distinct from bpa cdbpas underwent rapid direct photodegradation due to a pronounced bathochromic shift of uv absorption the photodegradation of cdbpas was significantly enhanced by effluent organic matter efom from the wastewater effluent a series of quenching experiments and laser flash photolysis analysis verified the contribution of triplet states of efom 3efom for the indirect photodegradation of cdbpas with rate constant of 109 m 1 s 1 both direct and efom induced indirect photodegradation of cdbpas increased with a higher degree of chlorination furthermore high resolution mass spectrometry showed similar photoproducts for direct and indirect photodegradation of cdbpas mainly ascribed to the cleavage of c cl bond and hydroxylation with further cleavage of the benzene ring the estrogenic activity of the photoproducts was diminished these findings suggest that photodegradation is an important pathway for the removal and detoxication of cdbpas from effluents and receiving natural waters under sunlight graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater effluent chlorination bisphenol a photodegradation effluent organic matter estrogenic activity 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa a kind of endocrine disrupting chemical edc is one of the most extensively used industrial chemicals in plastics with an estimated production of over 8 billion pounds per year pahigian and zuo 2018 due to its broad use in many consumer products and leaching from plastic materials bpa is ubiquitous in the environment and has been detected in foodstuffs drinking water and even in humans im and löffler 2016 russo et al 2019 schecter et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 zuo and zhu 2014 bpa has a strong estrogenic effect and thus imposes great risks to human health howdeshell et al 1999 terasaki et al 2005 effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the primary sources of bpa released into the aquatic environment klečka et al 2009 zafra et al 2003 chlorination is the oldest and the most commonly used disinfection technique in wwtps around the world deborde and von gunten 2008 lau et al 2016 wu et al 2009 during chlorination bpa is transformed into chlorinated derivatives cdbpas yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 mainly including 3 chlorobisphenol a 3 clbpa 3 3 dichlorobisphenol a 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 dichlorobisphenol a 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 trichlorobisphenol a 3 3 5 triclbpa and 3 3 5 5 tetrachlorobisphenol a tcbpa gallard et al 2004 hu et al 2002 these cdbpas have been widely detected in effluents of wwtps surface waters drinking waters and even in humans at concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 5 00 μg l 1 chen et al 2016 doumas et al 2018 fan et al 2013 fukazawa et al 2001 liu et al 2009 migeot et al 2013 zafra et al 2003 the estrogenic activity of cdbpas is much higher than that of the parent compound hu et al 2002 terasaki et al 2011 j zhang et al 2018 for example a yeast bioassay showed that 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa exhibits 8 38 8 20 and 3 fold higher estrogenic activity than bpa respectively fukazawa et al 2002 therefore it is essential to understand the fate and the ecological risk of these emerging chlorinated derivatives although various methods have been employed for the degradation and transformation of bpa chin et al 2004 huang et al 2013 lin et al 2009 few studies were focused on the environmental fate of cdbpas it is well known that direct and indirect photodegradation is an important elimination pathway for emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment bianco et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2010 zhang and zhou 2008 in natural waters phenolic compounds are mainly in the neutral form and absorb at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm thereby they are resistant to solar photodegradation boule et al 1982 the chlorination of phenolic compounds in wwtps introduces halogen substituent to the benzene ring which gives rise to p π conjugation between chlorine lone pair p electrons and phenyl π electrons the p π conjugation causes a bathochromic shift of the uv absorption spectrum and an increase of acid dissociation constant due to lower delocalization energy of phenolic ring chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 which facilitates the deprotonation of chlorinated derivatives the anionic forms absorb at longer wavelengths up to 320 nm boule et al 1982 resulting in the absorption spectrum of the chlorinated derivatives overlap with the terrestrial sunlight therefore the chlorinated derivatives are expected to undergo direct photodegradation upon the irradiation of sunlight effluent organic matter efom in the wwtps can screen light due to inner filter and also act as a photosensitizer via formation of reactive species such as triplet states of efom 3efom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh which play important roles in the indirect photodegradation of emerging contaminants bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 lee et al 2013 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 zhang et al 2014 it is well known that the triplet state of dissolved organic matter 3dom can react directly with organic pollutants via electron or energy transfer interaction chen et al 2012 2009 makunina et al 2015 sharpless and blough 2014 wenk et al 2011 to our best knowledge few documents have reported the indirect photodegradation of chlorinated pollutants with triplet states of efom the objectives of this work were to i evaluate the formation and photodegradation of cdbpas including 3 clbpa 3 3

least analytical reagent grade ultrapure water was obtained from a millipore milli q system and used in all experiments hybrid yeast powder kit was obtained from aquality technology wuxi co ltd jiangsu china 2 2 chlorination and photodegradation experiments the chlorination experiments were initiated by adding bpa to the chlorine containing 10 0 mg l 1 pure water or efom solution under dark conditions respectively at different reaction time 1 0 ml of solution was rapidly transferred into a 2 0 ml hplc vial previously filled with 50 μl of na2s2o3 100 g l 1 to quench the residual chlorine the solutions were then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to determine the concentrations of bpa and cdbpas with chlorination time the same chlorination procedure was also performed under simulated sunlight irradiation the light source was a 150 w xenon short arc lamp with a 300 nm cutoff filter which has been widely used to simulate sunlight ma et al 2020 wan et al 2019 the scheme of the irradiation device can be found in the previous study wan et al 2018 the solution temperature was maintained at 22 1 c by a temperature control unit the emission spectrum of the light used is given in fig s1 the intensity of the light 8 7 10 8 e l 1 s 1 was controlled by constant electric current and monitored by p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer laszakovits et al 2017 the photodegradation experiments were performed in a 60 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 30 mm inner diameter containing 50 ml of solution bpa and cdbpas in pure water or efom solution toc 8 0 mg l 1 ph 7 0 were irradiated under simulated sunlight the loss of bpa or cdbpas was negligible in the dark photolysis experiments of cdbpas were also conducted in a nitrogen saturated solution to evaluate the influence of o2 on photodegradation the quenching experiments were performed with the addition of nan3 50 mm isopropanol 50 mm and sorbic acid 10 mm to examine the roles of 1o2 oh and 3efom in the photodegradation of cdbpas respectively chen et al 2009 lian et al 2017 moor et al 2019 y n zhang et al 2018 three replicates were included for all photodegradation experiments 2 3 analytical methods the uv vis absorption spectra of the samples were obtained by an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific u s a the concentrations of bpa and cdbpas were measured using a hplc uv system essentia lc 15c shimadzu japan with an apollo c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm the mobile phase was 60 acetonitrile 40 phosphate buffer ph 2 5 10 mm the detection wavelength was

with a heated electrospray ionization hesi source see details in text s2 the formulas and structures of the photodegradation products were determined based on accurate m z analysis using thermo scientific xcalibur 4 1 software all mathematically possible formulas for each ion were calculated with a mass tolerance of 10 ppm the estrogenic activity of the cdbpas before and after photodegradation was measured by a yeast two hybrid assay text s3 2 4 laser flash photolysis experiments transient absorption experiments were carried out with laser flash photolysis lfp setup using the third harmonic 355 nm of an nd yag laser sli 10 continuum electro optics inc u s a as an excitation source pulse duration 6 ns pulse energy 1 10 mj time resolution ca 50 ns that was previously described in previous studies makunina et al 2015 yurkova et al 2013 a 150 w xenon lamp was adopted as the probe light to prevent quenching of the excited triplet species by dissolved oxygen nitrogen was bubbled to the solutions during the lfp experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of bpa fig s2 and s3 show the degradation profile of bpa peak intensity and formation of new peaks attributed to transformation products of bpa during chlorination in pure water and efom solution respectively according to the comparison with standard samples the concentration variation of bpa and its chlorinated derivatives with chlorination time under different conditions are presented in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a and c bpa disappeared rapidly during chlorination in dark in both pure water and efom solution meanwhile 3 clbpa rapidly increased to a maximum concentration of 8 3 μm in the first 0 5 min and then gradually decreased within the next 20 min simultaneously with the formation of 3 3 diclbpa and 3 5 diclbpa which increased over time to final concentrations of 0 6 and 6 1 μm respectively 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa were formed within the first 20 min of reaction the chlorination of bpa by naclo was in agreement with the previous studies hu et al 2002 lane et al 2015 the sum of bpa and cdbpas decreased slightly during chlorination in the dark condition fig 1a and c in contrast it was dramatically reduced upon irradiation of simulated sunlight fig 1b and d it is reported that solar photolysis of free available chlorine generates reactive species such as oh and chlorine radicals cl cheng et al 2019 which might contribute to the degradation of bpa nevertheless there was very little difference on the formation of intermediates under dark or simulated sunlight in the first 10 min of chlorination figs s2 and s3 suggesting that the solar chlorine system had little influence on the chlorination of bpa in this study besides the residual chlorine was negligible after 20 min of chlorination while cdbpas gradually decrease fig 1b and d indicating photodegradation was a significant pathway for the attenuation of cdbpas the attenuation of the sum of bpa and cdbpas was fitted to a pseudo first order reaction model showing rate constants of 0 019 and 0 036 min 1 in the pure water and efom solution respectively fig 1b and d therefore the efom significantly accelerated the photodegradation of cdbpas under simulated sunlight 3 2 direct photodegradation of cdbpas when exposed to simulated sunlight bpa was hardly degraded in pure water while an obvious loss of cdbpas was observed fig s4 the direct photodegradation rates of cdbpas increased with higher chlorine substitution in the order of 3 clbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa tcbpa the substitution of chlorine on the benzene ring of bpa leads to the p π conjugation effect and thus causes a bathochromic shift of the uv absorption to the terrestrial solar spectrum and also an increase of acid dissociation constants fig 2 and table s1 for instance the pk a1 values were 9 6 9 1 8 8 8 1 7 8 and 7 5 for bpa 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively table s1 the decrease of pk a facilitates the dissociation to anion forms in neutral ph conditions which in turn increases the uv absorption bathochromic shift and direct photodegradation fig 3 further shows that the direct photodegradation of cdbpas increased with ph corresponding to the increase of the fraction of deprotonated forms of cdbpas in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s5 indicating that anion forms contributed to the direct photodegradation 3 3 photosensitization effect of efom fig s6 shows that the photodegradation of cdbpas was remarkably enhanced in the efom solution compared to that in pure water the observed photodegradation rate constants of 3 clbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa increased from 0 007 0 008 0 012 0 013 and 0 018 min 1 in pure water to 0 011 0 020 0 023 0 036 and 0 095 min 1 in efom solution at ph 7 0 respectively fig 4 which suggested that indirect photodegradation played a crucial role in the efom solution the efom had absorbance at λ 300 nm fig s7 indicating that the light screening or photosensitization effect by efom could be involved during light exposure the total light screening factor of efom ŝ λ was then calculated according to eq 1 gomis et al 2014 walse et al 2004 1 s ˆ λ i λ 1 10 α λ ε λ c l ε λ c α λ ε λ c i λ 1 10 ε λ c l where i λ is the lamp irradiance at a specific wavelength c and ε λ are the concentration and molar extinction coefficient of cdbpas respectively α λ is the absorption coefficient of the efom solution and l is the path length the calculated ŝ λ values increased with the increasing concentration of cdbpas table s2 accordingly the indirect photodegradation rate constant k in of cdbpas sensitized by efom can be calculated by eq 2 zhang et al 2010 y n zhang et al 2018 2 k in k obs efom k di efom k obs efom ŝ λ k di where k obs efom is the total observed photodegradation rate constant of cdbpas in efom solution k di and k di efom are the direct photodegradation rate constants of cdbpas in pure water and efom solution respectively the k in values were calculated as 0 005 0 013 0 013 0 025 0 080 min 1 which account for 43 0 57 1 65 3 70 3 and 84 4 of the k obs efom of 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively fig 4 besides the photodegradation of cdbpas and the contribution of indirect photodegradation increased with the decrease of initial cdbpas concentration fig s8 further indicating the indirect photodegradation sensitized by efom played a primary role in the photodegradation of cdbpas 3 4 quenching experiments to examine the mechanism of the direct and indirect photodegradation of cdbpas a series of quenching experiments were performed as shown in fig 5 a the addition of 1o2 quencher nan3 and oh inhibitor isopropanol exhibited negligible effects on the photodegradation of cdbpas in pure water which excluded the role of 1o2 and oh for the direct photodegradation in contrast the presence of triplet state quencher sorbic acid markedly decreased the photodegradation by approximately 60 fig 5a indicating the excited triplet states of cdbpas 3cdbpa were significant reactive species involving in the direct photodegradation moreover the n2 sparging deoxygenation led to a pronounced increase of the pseudo first order rate constants k obs fig 5a since oxygen is a quencher of excited triplet states of most organic compounds lian et al 2017 the deoxygenation increased the concentration and lifetime of excited triplet states allowing a higher fraction of 3cdbpa to be transformed therefore the direct photodegradation was mainly ascribed to the decomposition of 3cdbpa for the photodegradation of cdbpas in efom solution similar results were observed during the quenching and deoxygenation experiments fig 5b previous studies have shown that the photoinduced of 1o2 and oh from efom were important reactive species for the transformation of organic contaminants bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 thus the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss and oh oh ss in the efom solution under simulated sunlight were determined using furfuryl alcohol and terephthalate as chemical probes text s4 and fig s9 and found to be 1 83 0 17 10 13 and 1 21 0 22 10 16 m for 1o2 ss and oh ss respectively the generation of 1o2 and oh was also confirmed by electron spin resonance esr spectrometry fig s10 which was consistent with the transformation of probe molecules fig s9 the bimolecular reaction rate constants of each cdbpa with 1o2 and oh were determined by competition kinetics text s4 figs s11 and s12 the 1o2 and oh reaction rate constants for cdbpas were in the range of 0 25 3 29 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 18 6 55 109 m 1 s 1 respectively table s3 the pseudo first order rate constants for the reaction of cdbpas with 1o2 and oh were then calculated to be 0 45 6 03 10 5 and 1 43 7 92 10 7 s 1 thus 1o2 and oh accounted for approximately 3 6 and 0 2 of the total degradation of cdbpas in the efom solution respectively which was consistent with the quenching effect of nan3 and isopropanol on reaction fig 5b therefore 1o2 and oh contributed little to the indirect photodegradation of cdbpas in efom solution in contrast the photodegradation rate of cdbpas in efom solution decreased obviously after the addition of sorbic acid indicating that 3efom was the primary reactive species for indirect photodegradation the enhanced photodegradation in the deoxygenated efom solution further confirmed that the indirect photodegradation was mainly attributed to 3efom 3 5 energy transfer mechanism it is well known that 3dom can react directly with organic pollutants via electron or energy transfer interaction for the electron transfer case previous studies have shown that the reaction of phenolic compounds with 3dom is initiated via charge transfer from the o electrons of the phenols to 3dom canonica et al 2000 1995 however the chlorine substitution remarkably increases the one electron oxidation potential e cdbpa cdbpa of cdbpas text s5 and table s4 thus the electron donating ability of cdbpas decreased with the increasing number of cl substituents which was in the contrary order for the photosensitization effect of efom fig 4 besides the e cdbpa cdbpa values 1 9 2 3 v vs she were higher than the one electron reduction potential of most 3dom e 3dom dom 1 4 1 9 v vs she mcneill and canonica 2016 therefore the electron transfer from cdbpas to 3efom could be ruled out on the other hand we further examined the possibility of energy transfer interaction between cdbpas and 3efom the phosphorescence spectra of bpa cdbpas and efom were recorded at 77 k fig s13 interestingly cdbpas showed a much longer peak wavelength 500 nm of the 0 0 level for t1 s0 transition than that of bpa 389 nm and efom 413 nm indicating that the triplet state energy of bpa decreased markedly after chlorination and thus render the energy transfer feasible from 3efom to cdbpas the calculated lowest triplet state energy e t1 of bpa and cdbpas was in agreement with the phosphorescence spectra table s4 and fig s13 moreover the addition of sorbic acid a high energy triplet states 239 247 kj mol 1 quencher mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2019 inhibited the photodegradation of cdbpas by approximately 90 in efom solution fig 5b this result indicated that high energy 3efom was significantly responsible for the sensitization of cdbpas e t1 263 282 kj mol 1 and further verified the little contribution of low energy 3efom for cdbpas photodegradation via electron transfer reaction therefore the energy transfer was the main photosensitization pathway for indirect photodegradation of cdbpas 3 6 laser flash photolysis to further investigate the interaction between 3efom and cdbpas laser flash photolysis experiments were performed fig 6 a shows the transient absorption spectra of nitrogen saturated efom solution after excitation by a 355 nm laser pulse noted that direct photodegradation of cdbpas was excluded since no light absorption at this wavelength the broad unstructured absorption band centered at 440 nm was assigned to the 3efom absorption which was sensitive to o2 fig 6a inset the triplet lifetime of efom τ t was determined to be around 77 μs in nitrogen saturated solution as can be seen in fig s14a when tcbpa was added to the efom solution the absorption of 3efom at 440 nm decreased with the formation of a new absorption peak at 400 nm the calculated result shows that the absorption spectrum of the t1 state of tcbpa 3tcbpa has the main absorption band at around 390 nm fig s14b previous studies also showed that halogenophenols exhibit absorption peaks at 400 nm in the transient spectra bonnichon et al 2001 grabner et al 1994 pelras et al 2017 accordingly the absorption band at 400 nm was attributed to the 3tcbpa formed by energy transfer from 3efom the decay of the 3efom was further monitored in the presence of different concentrations of tcbpa fig 6b by the plot of the rate of decay at 440 nm against tcbpa concentration fig 6b inset the rate constant of interaction between 3efom and tcbpa was calculated to be 1 64 108 m 1 s 1 based on the quenching experiments and lfp results the interaction between 3efom and cdbpas in the deoxygenated efom solution involves the following reactions efom h v k f e 3 fom e 3 fom reaction 1 e 3 fom k d efom reaction 2 e 3 fom cdbpa k q efom c 3 dbpa reaction 3 c 3 dbpa k d cdbpa reaction 4 c 3 dbpa k r products reaction 5 accordingly the indirect photodegradation rate of cdbpas sensitized by 3efom r in 3 efom can be given by eq 3 3 r in e 3 fom d cdbpa d t k in e 3 fom cdbpa k q e 3 fom cdbpa k d c 3 dbpa where k in 3 efom is the indirect photodegradation rate constants of cdbpas sensitized by 3efom k q m 1 s 1 is the second order reaction rate constant for the reaction between 3efom and cdbpas assuming that the formation rate of 3efom k f 3 efom was constant in the irradiated efom solution the steady state concentration of the transient intermediates 3efom and 3cdbpa in the system can be provided as follows 4 e 3 fom ss k f e 3 fom efom k d k q cdbpa 5 c 3 dbpa ss k q e 3 fom cdbpa k d k r where k d is the oxygen independent decay of 3efom 1 3 104 s 1 according to triplet lifetime k d and k r are the observed deactivation and degradation rate constants of 3cdbpa respectively substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3

investigate the reaction between 3efom and cdbpas a 340 nm filter cut off below 340 nm was used to avoid the direct photodegradation of cdbpas fig s15a based on the indirect photodegradation kinetics of cdbpas in the deoxygenated efom solution fig s15b and table s5 the fitting of eq 7 to the experimental data is shown in fig 7 the solid lines r2 0 99 p 0 05 according to the ratios of y intercept to slope of the fitted lines the k q values were calculated to be 6 01 108 8 41 108 8 22 108 1 09 109 and 1 74 109 m 1 s 1 for 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa respectively with an average value of 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 the k q values obtained were higher than the quenching rate constants between 3efom and tcbpa determination by lfp 1 64 108 m 1 s 1 which was attributed to the higher formation of triplets when using simulated sunlight 340 nm as the light source compared to the laser radiation 355 nm the cdbpa with a higher degree of chlorination exhibited higher reaction rate constant with 3efom which was in accordance with the indirect photodegradation sensitized by efom fig 4 3 7 photodegradation products and pathway the photodegradation products of cdbpas were identified using hr lc ms ms fig s16 s25 based on the analysis of the mass spectra the photoproducts were identified as shown in table s6 s10 similar photoproducts were observed when cdbpas were irradiated in pure water and efom solution indicating that cdbpas underwent similar pathways in the absence and presence of efom this result further confirms the energy transfer occurred from 3efom to cdbpas fig 8 demonstrates the formation of main photodegradation products in the efom solution during irradiation for each of cdbpas the hydroxylated intermediates i e products a1 b4 c1 d2 and e2 were determined to be major photoproducts which were rapidly formed in the first stage of simulated sunlight exposure and then gradually decreased fig 8 besides the dechlorination oxygenation i e products a5 b2 c3 and d3 and ring opening i e products a6 b3 and c4 intermediates were also detected as minor photoproducts for cdbpas these results indicated that the photodegradation of cdbpas proceeded by the cleavage of the c cl bond and hydroxylation followed by the cleavage of benzene rings besides the t1 states of cdbpas were optimized by density functional theory dft calculation text s5 and table s11 as can be seen one c cl bond was broken in the t1 state of cdbpas suggesting that dechlorination was likely to occur easily during photodegradation of cdbpas which was in accord with the photoproducts determination based on the identified photodegradation products and the analysis of the reaction intermediates the proposed photodegradation pathways of cdbpas in efom solution are shown in scheme 1 for the mono chlorinated derivative of bpa when exposed to simulated sunlight 3 clbpa was excited to form a triplet state directly or sensitized by 3efom then the cleavage of the c cl bond occurred initially yielding the hydroxyphenyl radical followed by hydroxyl substitution to yield hydroxylated intermediate a1 m z 243 1025 major or free radical hydrogen abstraction to yield dechlorinated product bpa m z 227 1074 minor meanwhile in the presence of oxygen the hydroxyphenyl radicals could also be attacked by o2 to form peroxy radicals and subsequently yield benzoquinone intermediate a5 m z 241 0868 which could be further oxidized to ring opening product a6 m z 275 0926 besides 3 clbpa could deprotonate in the excited state and rearrange with loss of a chloride ion to give a cco group which further transformed to carboxyl with h2o yielding product a7 m z 243 1024 a similar process has been previously reported for the photolysis of 2 chlorophenol czaplicka 2006 for the di tri and tetra chlorinated derivatives of bpa they underwent similar photodegradation pathways to yield the corresponding products as shown in scheme 1 3 8 estrogenic activity attenuation after photodegradation the estrogenic activity of the photodegradation products of edcs is considered to be an important factor impacting aquatic ecosystems pahigian and zuo 2018 roberts et al 2017 fig s26 shows the results of the yeast two hybrid estrogenic activity assay of bpa and cdbpas in pure water before photolysis bpa and cdbpas conformed to s shaped dose response relationships the ec50 values of bpa 3 clbpa 3 3 diclbpa 3 5 diclbpa 3 3 5 triclbpa and tcbpa were 11 05 0 71 1 31 0 53 2 20 and 0 77 μm respectively cdbpas exhibited higher estrogenic activity than bpa itself which was in agreement with previous studies fukazawa et al 2002 hu et al 2002 however the estrogenic activity of cdbpas was nearly not detected after photodegradation suggesting the photodegradation effectively decreased the capacity of cdbpas to bind the estrogen receptor therefore the photodegradation of cdbpas significantly reduced their estrogenic activity and the photodegradation products have little secondary risk to the aquatic environment 4 conclusion in this study for the first time the environmental fate of bpa and its chlorinated derivatives in the wwtps effluent was investigated the chlorination of bpa leads to the formation of cdbpas with higher estrogenic activity which exhibits a higher risk to the aquatic ecosystems however the introduction of chlorine substituent to the benzene ring of bpa causes a bathochromic shift of uv absorption to partly overlap with sunlight spectrum resulting in rapid direct photolysis under sunlight irradiation here photodegradation was presented to be the significant elimination pathway of cdbpas under simulated sunlight a higher degree of chlorination facilitates the photodegradation moreover the efom from the wastewater effluent significantly accelerated the attenuation of cdbpas via photosensitization effect 3efom was the main reactive species involved in the photodegradation of cdbpas with a rate constant 109 m 1 s 1 the other edcs widely detected in wwtps such as estrone estradiol 17α ethynyl estradiol diethylstilbestrol 4 nonylphenol 4 octylphenol and di n butyl phthalate typically exhibit n π transition with a characteristic uv absorption peak at 280 nm and tailing into 300 nm close to the initial wavelength of terrestrial sunlight fig s27 these edcs cannot undergo noticeable direct photodegradation according to grotthuss draper s law like cdbpas the chlorination of these edcs in wwtps thus results in chlorinated derivatives that are photolabile moreover since chlorine disinfection is the most conventional and frequent process for effluents in wwtps before being discharged into natural waters the ubiquitous dom in the surface waters also exhibits a similar photosensitization effect for the chlorinated derivatives the subsequent direct and indirect photodegradation become important attenuation pathways for the chlorinated derivatives and thus diminish their estrogenic activity future work with the addition of common ions in the wastewater effluent could provide further insight into the direct and indirect photodegradation of cdbpas in the actual effluents declaration of competing
