7780,study region koshi river basin eastern nepal study focus climate change is increasingly evident as the global surface temperature is warming with erratic rainfall patterns across the globe in this regard the koshi basin in the himalayan region is also impacted and it is important to understand the spatio temporal details of the impact in the basin under future climate change this study assessed the potential climate change and its impact on the hydrological regime using the soil and water assessment tool swat and indicators of hydrological alteration iha based on rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of ensemble downscaled cmip5 gcm runs new hydrological insights for this region results show the upper part of the basin warming faster than the lower part the pre monsoon season warming more than other seasons there is no clear uniform trend in precipitation however the southeastern part of the basin will get more precipitation sub basins will get more precipitation during the post monsoon under rcp4 5 and during the monsoon under rcp8 5 the annual water availability will not decline but water availability within seasons and regions is projected to be highly variable there is also a change in the spatial pattern of river discharge and the western part of the basin is likely to experience more impact therefore these findings will be valuable in identifying how particular sub basins within the koshi basin will be impacted by climate change and in stipulating effective planning and management of water resources for the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological regime koshi basin rcp 4 5 and 8 5 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the himalayas are one of the world s regions that are highly sensitive to changing climates yao et al 2019 there is a noticeable increase in temperatures in the himalayas higher than the global average with an increase in erratic rainfall patterns sharma et al 2019 the area has warmed by around 1 8 c over the past half century considerably higher than the warming rates for the northern hemisphere and the global mean yang et al 2014 kang et al 2010 liu and chen 2000 seasonal and annual temperatures have also risen in higher elevation areas across the himalayas yao et al 2019 liu and chen 2000 this fast warming has had a great effect on the himalayan environment and most noticeably in the rapid retreat of himalayan glaciers and shrinking snow areas kulkarni et al 2013 similarly earlier studies have reported that hindu kush himalayan hkh region and tibetan plateau have experienced a significant change in precipitation events over the past decades zhan et al 2017 however some studies have revealed a significant change in recent extreme precipitation events in some regions of the hkh zhan et al 2017 these changes in the temperature and precipitation ultimately affect the volume and timing of river flows more broadly climate change has notably altered the hydrological cycle the shift in snowline water availability water balance flow regime and soil moisture in the himalayan region temperature is one of the vital factors and also the most sensitive parameter in climate science an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at nasa reported the average global temperature on earth has increased by about 1 1 c since 1880 source https earthobservatory nasa gov world of change global temperatures in addition the global annual average temperature rises by 1 c in 2016 and 0 98 c in 2020 resulting in the first and second warmest year since 1880 noaa 2021 looking at the rate of change it can be projected that there is likely to be an ongoing significant increase in temperature in the himalayan region in the future earlier studies indicate projected temperature change but those changes might vary according to space and time in terms of magnitude and rate of change kulkarni et al 2013 knutti and sedláček 2013 lutz et al 2016a for instance kulkarni et al 2013 highlighted that warming was projected to rise by 4 6 c in western himalayas 4 3 c in central himalayas and 4 1 c in eastern himalayas by 2100 as far as the koshi basin the mean temperature is likely to increase by 4 6 c under rcp4 5 while 7 c under rcp8 5 by 2100 kaini et al 2019 precipitation in the himalayan region is most affected by the indian summer monsoon as well as the winter westerlies precipitation and varies according to space and time the monsoon decreases from southeast to northwest whereas the influence of the westerlies decreases from west to east nie et al 2021 precipitation is the major freshwater contribution to the hydrological system in the himalayan region perry et al 2020 kulkarni et al 2013 showed that indian summer monsoon precipitation is likely to increase by 20 40 at the end of this century in the koshi basin most studies project that rainfall is likely to increase during the monsoon and decrease during winter while the increase is likely to be more in the southern part compared to the northern part kaini et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2016 furthermore there is likely to be an increase in the future frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events for instance the number of dry days consecutive dry days and very wet days overall several studies suggest that the irregularities in precipitation are expected to increase in the coming periods kulkarni et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2012 kumar et al 2011 jeelani et al 2012 projected changes in the temperature along with precipitation patterns and intensity are likely to change river flow regimes resulting in flow variability and uncertainty in water availability dixit et al 2009 the visible impact of climate change is even more palpable in the upstream part of the himalayan region immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007 however the response of changing climate to river flow is likely to differ within the basins of the himalayas due to the source of runoff and hydrological processes varying by location and season immerzeel et al 2012 for instance the runoff is governed by snow and glacier melt in most of the upper part of the himalayan basin whereas the runoff in the lower part of the basin is governed by rainfall and groundwater with minimal contribution of snow and glacier melt climate change is likely to impact the long term monthly seasonal and annual flow of rivers together with changes in the timing of peak flow and variability of high and low river flows under future climate scenarios stagl and hattermann 2016 thus changes in river flows have an important impact on water such as water availability irrigation flood management and overall water resources planning furthermore changes in water availability can affect the water dependent ecosystem and its associated services hydropower fisheries irrigated agriculture etc which will influence many people s livelihoods depending on riverine ecosystem services the koshi basin is one of the most populated basins in nepal where the livelihood of these communities is mainly dependent upon the hydrological regime and its associated river ecosystem services studies suggest that there are likely to be considerable impacts on water resources with severe consequences for the livelihoods of communities in the koshi basin due to climate change projection macchi and icimod 2010 bhatta et al 2015 thus there is an urgent need to understand the potential climate change and its impact on the hydrological regime in the koshi river basin the koshi basin is characterized by extreme topographic and climate heterogeneity the orography mountain land altitude and lapse rate the rate at which air temperature falls with increasing altitude in the koshi basin differ vastly across the sub basins from the southern plains to the northern himalayas as well as from the eastern to the western region of the basin this means the regional differences in climate in the koshi basin thus changes in climate and their impacts will vary across the sub basins of the koshi basin as well as regional differences in the response of flow in the basin detail regional studies highlighted that himalayan regions are likely to experience noticeable climate change with an increase in temperature and erratic rainfall that will lead to significant hydrological changes but what is unknown is how much of a spatio temporal impact koshi basin will have in future in terms of climate change as well as what will be the response of the hydrological regime to this changing climate in this regard the major consequences of climate change will depend on the temporal and spatial scales therefore we hypothesize that the impacts of climate change are scale dependent and impacts are likely to be highly variable depending on temporal intra seasonal and local spatial scale rather than being uniform across the entire basin and on an annual scale furthermore most climate change studies to date have considered the koshi basin as an entirety mofe 2019 as well as only occasional consideration of future climate change scenarios up to 2100 including comparisons among different sub basins therefore spatiotemporal impact assessment and comprehensive multi scale assessments are needed to understand the nature and extent of the expected climate change as well as the response of the hydrological regime and that s what this paper is all about 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the koshi basin is a lifeline for local inhabitants because it provides fresh water for household use irrigation farming and livestock shrestha et al 2017 the basin has a large potential for hydropower development and plays a key role in the irrigation of downstream areas it contains rich biodiversity and is a source of valuable ecosystem services that directly sustain the lives and livelihoods of the 40 million basin residents including the population in the indian part of the basin wahid et al 2017 it is a transboundary basin shared by china nepal and india in this study we included only the chinese and nepalese parts until the koshi river flows into the plains fig 1 it has a catchment area of 55 930 km2 at nepal india border of which approximately 51 is in china and 49 in nepal the river originates in the tibetan plateau passing across eastern nepal and ultimately joining the ganges within the basin the elevation varies from about 65 m in the southern region to 8848 m mount everest peak in the northern regions above the mean sea level the slopes in the basin range from 0 in the south to 84 in the north mishra et al 2019 this variation in elevation results in vastly different climatic zones from humid tropical in the lower plain area to arctic in the high himalayas dixit et al 2009 in the nepalese section there are four distinct climatic seasons winter december february pre monsoon march may monsoon june september and post monsoon october november the koshi river basin is comprised of six major physiographic zones the tibetan plateau high himalaya high mountains middle mountain siwalik and terai each with unique geology topography and climate the koshi basin is characterized by extreme topography climate heterogeneity and seasonal flow variability the orography and lapse rates of the koshi basin differ vastly within the basin pandey et al 2020a furthermore the basin is influenced by two synoptic circulation systems i e easterlies south asian monsoon precipitation during summer and westerlies winter precipitation during winter the climate in the southern part of the basin is strongly influenced by the south asian monsoon whereas the northern part of the basin tibetan plateau lies in a rain shadow area as a result precipitation varies from 207 mm per year in the trans himalaya region to 3000 mm per year in the eastern mountains shrestha et al 2017 winter precipitation plays a vital role in the accumulation and melt of snow and ice about 80 of the precipitation occurs in the monsoon season intense with large local variation because of orographic effects kaini et al 2019 a large southern part of the basin in nepal receives an average annual precipitation of about 1800 mm bhatt et al 2014 the upper part of the basin contains a huge amount of snow and glacier as a freshwater reserve shrestha et al 2017 the total glaciated area in the basin was 2984 km2 with an estimated ice reserve of 295 km3 and the total snow cover area was 5458 km2 khadka et al 2016 bajracharya et al 2011 the annual average discharge in the khurkot hydrological station at sun koshi is 469 m3 s and in the chatara hydrological station at sapta koshi is 1545 m3 s sinha et al 2019 the elevation variation within the basin is very sharp within a short areal distance from 65 300 m a s l in the southern plains to 100 300 m a s l in the foothills of the siwalik region while the middle mountain region has steep slopes and deep cut valleys with an elevation of 1000 3000 m a s l the northern himalayas with elevations above 3000 m a s l up to 8848 m a s l is generally above the snow line dhital 2015 temperature varies considerably in the basin according to elevation the northern part of the basin is very cold with temperatures reaching 19 c dingri meteorological station in winter and the southern lower part of the basin is very warm with the temperature reaching 45 c rajbiraj meteorological station in summer the mountains record the maximum temperature in may while the southern plains terai reach the maximum in april the annual evapotranspiration et rates are generally less than 1000 mm however some parts of the basin such as sun koshi have extremely high potential evapotranspiration and suffer from frequent droughts and soil erosion wahid et al 2017 there is also a diversity of land use across the basin there is a clear dominance of grasslands 40 34 followed by native forests 24 45 and then agriculture 12 45 other land use types include barren land 11 26 snow glaciers 9 45 shrubland 1 52 natural water bodies 0 5 and urban areas 0 03 uddin et al 2015 2 2 observed and historical data climate data temperature and precipitation in nepal was collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal additional climate data from nielamu and dingri stations within the chinese part of the koshi basin was acquired from the tibet meteorological bureau the network of temperature precipitation and hydrological stations used in the swat model is given in fig 1 overall daily data for the period of 1981 2010 from 11 temperature stations 21 precipitation stations and 2 hydrological stations khurkot and chatara was used in this analysis the land use data for 2010 at a 30 m resolution was obtained from international centre for integrated mountain development uddin et al 2015 the soil data was obtained from the soil and terrain database programme soter dijkshoorn and huting 2009 srtm dem of 90 m 90 m resolution was used to delineate the watershed in the model 2 3 future climate scenario for the basin for this study we used a 10 km resolution future climate scenario dataset developed by lutz et al 2016a for the indus ganges and brahmaputra igb domains as a part of the himalayan adaptation water and resilience hi aware project in this dataset the gcms were tested using ar5 data downloaded from the cmip5 model archive in total 94 gcms were tested for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 69 for rcp8 5 lutz et al 2016b this ensures that the entire range of possible future climates in terms of temperature and precipitation change is included for each model run the normal annual difference in temperature and precipitation for future 2071 2100 climate conditions over a reference period 1971 2000 was determined in terms of temperature anomaly t and percentage change of precipitation p respectively lutz et al 2016b based on the 10th and 90th percentile values of these projected changes four combinations of climatic conditions dry and cold dry and warm wet and cold and wet and warm were derived for each rcp finally the model runs that were closest to the percentile values were selected to be included in the model ensemble used for the climate change impact study as well as the percentile values were used to avoid outlier gcms which are likely to be unreliable rajbhandari et al 2016 finally eight gcms were selected table 1 four for rcp4 5 and four for rcp8 5 based on the average annual response changes in extreme behaviour in precipitation and temperature as well as validation of model performance to climatic reference data these climate models cover a wide range of possible futures and are also able to replicate the most important processes in the region lutz et al 2016b overall the following methods were used for the selection of climate models which perform better for the igb domain lutz a b et al 2016 1 the initial selection of the climate model from the entire pool of climate models is based on changes in mean air temperature and annual precipitation mean sum 2 refined selection based on the projected change in four indices for climatic extremes 3 final selection based on model skills in simulating the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation the selected climate scenario data was statistically downscaled and bias corrected using the quantile mapping qm method the bias corrected data was downscaled to 10 10 km spatial resolution by applying bilinear interpolation the downscaled climate scenario data from lutz et al 2016a can be downloaded from http rds icimod org clim for a detailed description of model selection statistical downscaling and bias correction method of climate data readers are suggested to refer to kaini et al 2019 mofe 2019 trzaska and schnarr 2014 and lutz et al 2016a b the koshi river basin is a part of the ganges basin and lutz et al 2016a dataset was clipped by our study area for climate change analysis the selected eight gcm data were used to prepare an ensemble average of the four gcms for each rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this provided two ensemble average data each one for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these average ensemble data were prepared for daily time steps for analysis an ensemble average can reduce the overall uncertainty in model predictions pandey et al 2019 among four rcps we used only two rcps i extreme rcp8 5 which assumes the increased radiative forcing will stabilize at 8 5 w m2 in 2100 and ii medium stabilization scenario rcp4 5 considers stabilization at 4 5 w m2 in 2100 we chose not to include rcp2 6 in the climate model ensemble because robust realistic climate change scenarios are required to support adaptation planning as rcp2 6 requires that carbon dioxide co2 emissions start declining by 2020 and go to zero by 2100 which is highly unlikely furthermore we excluded rcp6 scenarios too because the range of changes from rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios covers the entire range of radiative forcing resulting from rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 lutz et al 2016b table 1 shows the chosen climate model used for the study the climate change impact over the sub basins was investigated by using future climate scenario data up to 2100 we used the gcm climate dataset 1995 s 1981 2010 as the reference data period and 2025 s 2011 2040 2055 s 2041 2070 and 2085 s 2071 2100 as the projected future data period covering 30 years to determine the change in climate as well as its response on hydrology between the reference and future projection in the koshi basin 2 4 uncertainty analysis there will always be some degree of uncertainty in future climate projections because of the different representation of atmospheric processes in the gcms and the development of future socio economic pathways as well as a lack of understanding of atmospheric processes and observation limitations in the structure of gcm models and highly variable simulation uncertainty also contribute to the overall uncertainty in projection scenarios considering these uncertainties in climate change projections is important for decision making and developing adaptation strategies mofe 2019 the uncertainties in the future projections can be understood using responses among the selected models and the rcps change 2014 in this study uncertainty analysis for precipitation and temperature projections was carried out based on the following approaches 1 the uncertainties are represented by the responses among the models for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 the uncertainties are represented by the inter quantile range among the models for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the different time periods 3 agreement on decrease or increase in the change of climate variables among multiple models compared to the reference period 2 5 hydrological modelling the hydrological model swat winchell et al 2013 arnold et al 1998 was used to simulate the hydrological processes under present and future climate conditions it is the combination of the basin scale model with gis srinivasan and arnold 1994 and uses spatial data soil type land cover land use and elevation and temporal data climate data to represent the hydrological performance of the heterogeneous catchments it is a complete model incorporating surface land and channel environmental processes as well as combining studies of water quality water quantity and climate change it is capable of simulating hourly daily monthly and yearly data over long periods picchio et al 2020 the final outlet was defined at the chatara hydrology station to delineate the sub basins of the koshi river basin fig 1 this resulted in the creation of 27 sub basins and 35 hydrological response units hru hru is the smallest unit of the basin and is a combination of unique soil types land features and slope classification shrestha et al 2016 from 27 sub basins we selected only six sub basins 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 these sub basins were spatially distributed in the koshi basin from east to west and north to south where sub basin 1 is the northern sub basin 2 is the western sub basin 3 is the eastern sub basin 4 is the central sub basin 5 is the southwestern sub basin and 6 is the southeastern sub basin in the lower outlet in koshi fig 1 the reason for selecting these sub basins compared to other sub basins was based on the criteria of influence of monsoon east to west and south to north precipitation gradients and the criteria of influence temperature variability north to south as well as these sub basins represent the trans himalayan high himalayas middle mountain and southern plain the physiographic region of the basin most sub basins where no observation and monitoring stations are excluded from analysis and reporting for instance the northern part of the sub basins fig 1 elevation bands were created to model the process of snowmelt and orographic distribution from temperature and precipitation in swat the model generates the elevation band automatically based on the area coverage percentage an elevation band helps in discretizing the topographic influence of temperature and precipitation on snowmelt and discharge bajracharya et al 2018 each sub basin in the model was divided into ten elevation bands and each band was assigned a mean elevation and area coverage percentage the swat model applies the following mass balance equation arnold et al 1998 to simulate the hydrology within a sub basin 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 n r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt

melted water from snowfall and snow cover dynamics in the hydrological analysis swat classifies precipitation as rain or snow by comparing the mean daily temperature with the user defined air temperature threshold the snowmelt in swat is calculated as a linear function of the difference between average snowpack maximum air temperature and snowmelt threshold temperature by using the following formula neitsch et al 2011 2 s n o m l t b m l t s n o cov θ t s n o w t max 2 t m l t where snomlt daily snowmelt amount mm bmlt daily melt factor mm day c snocov the fraction of hru area

evaluation is essential to measure the consistency of its output it is considered reliable if the evaluation statistics fall within an acceptable limit moriasi et al 2007 accordingly a model is considered suitable for monthly river flow simulation if percent bias pbias is within 15 and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse is above 0 75 bajracharya et al 2018 we calculated the pbias nse and coefficient of determination r2 to verify our swat results the swat model was calibrated and validated at two points the khurkot hydrological station on sun koshi river which is the tributary of the koshi river and the chatara hydrological station on the sapta koshi which is the main outlet of the koshi basin fig 1 swat was calibrated for 1986 1994 and validated for 2000 2008 at khurkot hydrological station furthermore swat was also calibrated for 1986 2001 and validated for 2002 2010 at chatara hydrological station on a daily scale the following suggestion was made by fontaine et al 2002 we used a warm up period of 5 years for calibration to develop suitable initial conditions for groundwater and soil water storage the model was calibrated by using swat cup abbaspour 2013 swat cup enables sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of swat models calibration parameters were based on literature review volume baseflow and adjustment of peak flows during calibration lapse rate water capacity of the soil layer scs runoff curve number manning n and snowmelt were found to be the most sensitive parameters the temperature lapse rate was adjusted to 5 6 c km based on khadka et al 2014 the scs curve number varied from 40 to 90 based on land use type the manning n for the main channel was calibrated from 0 03 to 0 06 snowmelt parameters such as snowfall temperature and minimum snowmelt rate were adjusted to the values of 0ºc and 7 mm ºc day respectively bajracharya et al 2018 the calibrated and validated swat model was forced with historical ensemble climate variables from the period of 1981 2010 the discharge obtained from the simulated swat model for this period was treated as baseline data to evaluate changes in future flow 2 7 capabilities and limitations of the swat model for a heterogeneous river basin like the koshi it requires calibrating and validating the model if not for every sub basin but for a cluster of sub basins or large watersheds to simulate a reliable result the key difficulty of calibrating and validating a hydrological model developed in a river basin like koshi with limited data availability is the absence of observed streamflow data due to the unavailability of observed data and accurate information on snowmelt and glacier melt in the high himalayan areas of tibet and nepal results may have limitations even though the model performs all its estimates at a very small areal unit the model has not been built and calibrated to simulate small catchments furthermore swat s snow glacier component is relatively weaker than the rainfall runoff component pandey et al 2020b bharati et al 2019 thus the use of other snow glacier models is recommended if these components are important and need to be analyzed in detail adnan et al 2019 bharati et al 2019 however the model was capable to reproduce or capture reasonably the hydrograph patterns average flow conditions high flow conditions and flow duration curves in the koshi basin the calibration and validation statistics based on available data mostly downstream show the satisfactory performance of the swat model in khurkot and chatara the hills and terai of nepal hydrological stations and the results obtained from these stations can be confidently used for further activities our results are in line with earlier studies done in the koshi basin bharati et al 2014 2016 2019 devkota and gyawali 2015 kaini et al 2021 2 8 indicators of hydrological alteration the indicators of hydrological alteration iha version 7 1 tool the nature conservancy 2009 was used to calculate parametric statistics of flow components from daily time series river flow data as mentioned by richter et al 1996 in parametric statistics the assumption is that data are normally distributed and the data are characterized by a mean and standard deviation parametric statistics with advanced calibration were used to compare reference period flow datasets pre impact with future climate change scenario flow datasets post impact the advanced calibration will involve adjusting up to four parameters i the high flow threshold ii the low flow threshold iii the high flow starts rate threshold and iv the high flow end rate threshold whereas non advanced calibration only a single flow parameter the high flow threshold the nature conservancy 2009 this software can calculate a total of 67 statistical parameters these parameters are subdivided into 2 groups the 33 iha parameters median and coefficient of dispersion corresponding to 5 fundamental characteristics of the flow regime magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change and 34 environmental flow components efc parameters corresponding to 5 fundamental characteristics of the flow regime extreme low flow low flows high flow pulses small floods and large floods as per the suggestion made by wijngaard et al 2017 high and low flow indices are used to evaluate changes in hydrological extremes thus we used only two components of flow i extreme low flow and ii large flood high flow out of five characteristics as hydrological extremes an extreme low flow was defined as a flow value less than or equal to the 10th percentile of the daily average flows of the period and a large flood event was defined as an initial high flow with a peak flow greater than 10 years return interval event in other words future changes in the 90th percentile of daily discharge levels and the discharge levels of high flow events with a return period of 10 years wijngaard et al 2017 the software finds the flow value equal to or less than the 10th percentile of all annual minimum flow as well as the 90th percentile of all annual maximum flood peaks bharati et al 2019 the nature conservancy 2009 mathews and richter 2007 for in depth parameters and characteristics of the flow regime readers are suggested to refer to the indicators of hydrological alterations user s manual the nature conservancy 2009 overall the method for a systematic approach for investigating climate change and its potential impact on the hydrological regime in the koshi river basin is presented in fig 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the swat model result shows a good agreement between simulated and observed stream values at the two hydrological stations the daily simulation results at chatara showed that peaks matched for most of the years however they were underestimated for a few years between 1992 and 1995 for calibration the model performance for the chatara outlet is shown in fig 3 a b based on hydrograph and statistical evaluations the model was able to simulate the flow during calibration and validation and correlated well with the observed data the goodness of fit statistics showed that both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 are above 0 75 and percent bias pbias is within 15 in both stations which makes the model a good representative of the koshi river basin this result is consistent with the findings of shrestha et al 2016 and bharati et al 2014 therefore it showed that the swat model was able to simulate the discharge at the outlet of the catchment with reasonably high accuracy the calibration and validation output value of nse r2 and pbias is provided in table 2 3 2 the projected changes in temperature this study quantifies the change in future temperature concerning the reference period across the sub basins over time under two projection scenarios our results indicate an increase in the average temperature across the sub basins in the future timeline annual average temperatures are expected to increase over time across the six sub basins and the increase will be greater under the rcp 8 5 climate scenario for example the temperature is likely to increase by 2 3 2 7 c in sub basins under rcp4 5 while by 3 8 4 9 c in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 increases in annual temperatures differ among the six sub basins under both scenarios over time the increase in temperature will be highest in sub basin 1 followed by sub basins 3 2 4 5 and sub basin 6 under both rcps fig 4 overall the increase in average annual temperature will be greater in the northern sub basins compared to the southern sub basins which might most likely be attributed to elevation dependent warming yao et al 2019 this finding is consistent with the findings of kaini et al 2019 shrestha et al 2019 2017 rajbhandari et al 2016 bharati et al 2014 yao et al 2019 and wijngaard et al 2018 the increasing temperature in the northern part means the upward shift of the snowline as a result the proportion of precipitation fall as rainfall instead of snowfall which decrease the accumulation and storage of snow at high altitude in addition increase temperature will accelerate the melting rate of remaining deposited snow and reduces the spatial extension of snow cover thus a temperature change will change the snow cover area as well as changes in the snowmelt rate which will impact the contribution of snowmelt and the shift in discharge and flow regime temperature increases will vary among the four seasons across the six sub basins in both rcps the projected increases in temperature will likely be higher in the pre monsoon and less during the monsoon season for all sub basins and both scenarios for example temperature increases in sub basin 1 will be greater in the pre monsoon 3 c compared to the winter 2 9 c post monsoon 2 4 c and monsoon season 2 4 c under the rcp4 5 scenario by 2100 table 3 this finding is consistent with the finding of pandey et al 2020a in the karnali mohana basin in western nepal the rates of increase in temperature vary among time periods and sub basins for instance annual temperature increases are projected to double between 2025 s and 2055 s for all sub basins under the rcp4 5 scenario however for the rcp8 5 scenario all sub basins experience an approximate doubling of annual temperature increase between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as again between 2055 s and 2085 s fig 4 furthermore seasonal temperature increases are projected to be around double across all sub basins under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 by 2100 3 3 the projected changes in precipitation precipitation increases vary among the sub basins for instance overall precipitation is likely to increase by 12 9 15 4 in sub basins under rcp4 5 while increasing by 23 7 33 4 in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 the increase of annual precipitation will be highest in sub basin 5 followed by sub basins 2 6 4 3 and sub basin 1 under rcp4 5 in comparison the increase of annual precipitation will be greatest in sub basin 6 followed by sub basins 3 4 5 2 and finally sub basin 1 under rcp8 5 fig 5 those sub basins in the southeast sub basins 3 and 6 will experience more precipitation than northwestern regions sub basin 1 which might be because sub basins 3 and 6 are impacted by the monsoon season first the rate of increases in average annual precipitation in future across the six sub basins for both climate scenarios increases greater in the rcp8 5 scenario annual and seasonal precipitations are projected to double between 2055 s and 2085 s for all sub basins under the rcp4 5 scenario however for the rcp 8 5 scenario all sub basins will experience a doubling of annual and seasonal precipitations except for dry season between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as between 2055 s and 2085 s the projected precipitation changes show larger variations in seasons than on an annual basis for both scenarios winter season precipitation is expected to decrease under rcp4 5 but increase for rcp8 5 for most of the basin the precipitation during the monsoon is projected to increase in all sub basins for all time periods under both rcps post monsoon precipitation is expected to increase for all time periods except for rcp8 5 in 2025 s when four out of six sub basins show a decrease the projected changes in precipitation during monsoon and post monsoon are in line with the finding by rajbhandari et al 2017 across the koshi basin overall results show that it is likely to be a potential decline in precipitation in winter and an increase in other seasons especially the rainy season therefore it can be predicted that the dry season is likely to be drier and the wet season is likely to be wetter under rcp4 5 in contrast there is likely to increase precipitation in all seasons under rcp8 5 therefore all seasons are likely to be wetter in the mid and end of the twenty first century under rcp8 5 except for sub basin 5 in the winter season the projections for precipitation show an annual increasing trend for both scenarios by 2100 this could positively affect on the riverine landscape ecosystem services however climate change is likely to disrupt precipitation regimes with alternating erratic rainfall and droughts resulting in more repeated floods and droughts for instance the number of rainy days and consecutive wet days was projected to decrease whereas consecutive dry days were projected to increase in the koshi basin furthermore the number of very wet days was projected to increase in koshi basin kaini et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2017 changes in the frequencies of extreme rainfall events might impact land degradation processes such as mass movements soil erosions and removal of top fertile soil which might reduce fertile land ultimately change will impact the lives and livelihood of the people depending on agriculture in the koshi basin 3 4 the potential impact of climate change on river discharge increases in annual discharge are projected across all sub basins and these will be greater under rcp8 5 84 compared to rcp4 5 61 by 2100 the annual discharge is likely to increase by 19 151 in sub basins under rcp4 5 while by 43 171 in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 the increase in annual discharge is projected to be highest in sub basin 2 followed by sub basins 3 4 5 6 and sub basin 1 under rcp4 5 in comparison the increase in annual discharge is projected to be greater in sub basin 2 followed by sub basins 3 4 6 5 and sub basin 1 under rcp8 5 by 2100 fig 6 overall there is a slight east west spatial trend in annual discharge with an increase to the east to a decrease to the west in terms of the future change in discharge sub basin 3 and sub basin 2 dominate all other sub basins in the degree of change under both rcps the discharge in sub basin 2 is relatively low during the reference period 13 26 m3 s annual mean discharge but is projected to increase up to 150 171 by 2100 under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 sub basin 2 shows a higher projected discharge than other sub basins it reflects that small absolute increases in sub basin 2 can result in large relative increases sub basin 3 also shows high relative increases in discharge under both rcps it might be a reason that around 24 of the sub basin 3 area is covered by snow and glacier being higher than the other sub basins khadka et al 2020 khadka et al 2016 for instance sub basin 3 upper part of tamor basin consists of 358 sq km of glacier area khadka et al 2020 and 784 sq km of snow cover area khadka et al 2016 due to an increase in temperature the contribution of snow and glacier melt combined with monsoon rainfall will increase surface discharge thus sub basin 3 is the only basin that does not show any decrease in discharge in annual and seasonal intervals for all time periods up to 2100 compared to the reference period under both rcps seasonal changes in discharge will differ among the four seasons the winter discharge is projected to decrease under rcp4 5 in 2025 s and 2055 s as well as under rcp8 5 in 2025 s for all sub basins except for sub basin 3 pre monsoon discharge is projected to increase in most sub basins except in sub basin 2 under both rcps in 2025 s and 2085 s in addition discharge in sub basin 4 is projected to decrease during pre monsoon under both rcps in 2055 s as well as under rcp4 5 in 2025 s there is a marked increase in discharge in monsoon and post monsoon seasons under both rcps where the highest increase is in the post monsoon season under rcp4 5 and in the monsoon season under rcp8 5 the rate of change of annual discharges is projected to increase by 2100 for instance the annual discharge between 2025 s and 2055 s in all sub basins is projected to at least double whereas the annual discharge in three sub basins 1 2 and 5 is projected to more than double between 2055 s and 2085 s under rcp4 5 seasonal discharge change is more variable for both time periods under rcp4 5 however for the rcp 8 5 scenario all sub basins will experience significant increases in annual and seasonal discharges between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as between 2055 s and 2085 s the rate of increase of discharge in monsoon might be an increase in monsoon precipitation combined with an increase in meltwater after mid century in the koshi basin khadka et al 2020 wijngaard et al 2018 overall the result shows that there is an increase in annual discharge albeit with a large variation in seasonal discharge there might be water stress during the winter season but surplus water during the monsoon season simulated flow results show that the annual flow is still dominated by monsoon flow in the future even under the impact of climate change fig 6 furthermore most sub basins show an increase in average seasonal flow except during the winter season the decrease in winter river flow might be due to decreases in winter precipitation this decrease in winter river flow and precipitation might impact highly winter cultivation 3 5 the potential impact of climate change on flow extremes climate change is projected to influence components of the flow regime in each sub basin the response of flow alteration varies according to sub basins and season for the different periods under both rcps the flow alteration results show that the magnitude and frequency of peak discharge in all sub basins are projected to increase under both rcps over all periods except for sub basins 2 and 5 in 2025 s under rcp8 5 furthermore the duration of low flow as well as high flow are likely to increase under both rcps for all periods except for sub basin 3 in terms of low flows fig 7a in other words hydrological extremes high flow and low flow are projected to occur more frequently in all sub basins in the koshi basin the change in the number of extremely low flow days varies from 15 100 days under rcp4 5 and 8 60 days under rcp8 5 across sub basins by 2100 similarly the change in the number of large flood days varies from 5 to 18 days under rcp4 5 and 7 28 days under rcp8 5 across sub basins by 2100 the spatial change in hydrological extremes across the sub basins is shown in fig 7 a b the increase in the duration of low flow is greater than the high flow the projected changes in flow extremes are in line with the finding by nie et al 2021 in the himalayas wijngaard et al 2018 for the upper igb river basins wijngaard et al 2017 for the upper ganges and bharati et al 2019 2016 and khadka et al 2016 for koshi however at the beginning of climate change in the 2025 s there will most likely be influence on low flow than high flow but it will then reverse as time passes low flow duration will be shortened whereas high flow duration will be extended during the low flow season the surface water availability will be low which is likely to affect the environmental flow requirement and lead to high water demand resulting in high competition between water users wijngaard et al 2018 this might impact people who rely on water dependent ecosystem services furthermore the timing of the projected average monthly discharge will also change for instance the most flow generating month may shift for one month from july to august in 2085 s in sub basin 4 and 5 under rcp8 5 fig 8 whereas for the other remaining sub basins the projected average monthly discharge period timing remains the same this finding is supported by studies by bajracharya et al 2018 of the kaligandaki basin adjacent to the koshi basin and by khadka et al 2016 of the koshi basin overall the flow regime in the koshi basin is projected to be significantly impacted by climate change the frequency in occurrence of high and extremely low flow events demonstrates the too much or too little water problem this means the basin is vulnerable to both floods and drought resulting in a high risk to people and their livelihood furthermore the change in flow regime will in all probability change the biological and physical processes of the river which will have an effect on quality quantity hydro geomorphology and biodiversity in riverine ecosystems bharati et al 2016 3 6 uncertainties in climate projection we used the robust hi aware datasets of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of 8 gcms 4 each for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as input data for the swat model to simulate the future scenarios for the study basin however there is uncertainty in the climate data as these trajectories are dependent upon many factors including human intervention atmospheric processes as well as international climate negotiations to account for these uncertainties the models were selected based on simulating the four corners of the projection spectrum i e one each for cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet condition of the future for each rcp and their ensemble was used as representative of the future states however there are significant uncertainties within the projections in the study area for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios cui et al 2018 reported that the uncertainties from climate models together with the uncertainty from a hydrological model pose a great challenge to the accurate projection of hydrological regime alteration therefore we should cautiously use the output of the model results considering the uncertainty range given by all datasets these uncertainties can be understood from the ensemble plot in fig 9a where it can be seen that even though the projection for both precipitation and temperature increases the response of models has higher variability for precipitation than for temperature for both rcps also fig 9b suggests that there is more variability in projection for 2085 s than for 2025 s or 2055 s the future projection for precipitation shows higher uncertainties in rcp4 5 than in rcp8 5 however for temperature the uncertainties are similar for both rcps although lower than those for precipitation this can be understood by the higher value of the coefficient of variation in precipitation than in temperature in table 4 for example the coefficient of variation for precipitation is 0 11 0 18 for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 in 2085 s suggesting the range of projected change in precipitation is large in the case of temperature the coefficient of variation is 0 05 0 07 for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 in the 2085 s projections of mean air temperature indicate an increase ranging from 1 3 c to 4 9 c between 1995 s and 2085 s with stronger warming at higher altitudes the maximum range of uncertainty in the change of temperature is observed during the 2085 s under the rcp8 5 scenario whereas it is the least during the 2025 s under the rcp4 5 scenario the uncertainty in future precipitation is also large with projections ranging from 7 to 33 between 1995 s and 2085 s the uncertainty range is expected to be small in the winter season and more during the monsoon season because during winter basin receives only around 2 5 of total rainfall the range is expected to be highest during the 2085 s under both scenarios the range of uncertainty in temperature is not expected to vary much unlike precipitation but is expected to increase towards the 2085 s the finding of our result is consistent with the findings of kaini et al 2019 mofe 2019 bajracharya et al 2018 and lutz et al 2016a 4 conclusion this study assessed changes in the future climate and their influence on hydrology in six sub basins in the koshi basin we use the swat model to simulate the surface hydrology of the koshi basin up to the chatara hydrological station and the iha v7 1 tool to assess the characteristics of the flow regime as hydrological extremes the hydrological model is forced with an ensemble of downscaled gcms representing a wide range of regional rcp4 5 and 8 5 climate conditions for 2025 s 2055 s and 2085 s the model output was analyzed in terms of projected change in temperature precipitation river discharge and flow extremes overall the results show the sub basins are likely to be markedly affected by changing temperature and precipitation as well as the response of river flow in the three time periods under both scenarios furthermore the responses are varied among sub basins with impacts being more noticeable at local and seasonal scales the impacts strongly accelerate with increasing annual mean temperature and precipitation will result in an altered flow regime up to 2100 with the largest projected increases for rcp8 5 scenarios temperature rise showed differences among the sub basins with the greatest increase in the northern sub basin sub basin 1 and the least increase in the southern sub basin sub basin 6 under both scenarios by 2085 s the increase in temperature clearly showed a north south trend regarding the seasonal warming most sub basins showed that pre monsoon is most likely to increase temperature faster than the rest of the seasons under both scenarios an increase in temperature is likely to be lower in the monsoon season compared to other seasons under both rcps furthermore among all sub basins and seasons the eastern sub basin sub basin 3 showed the highest warming during winter annual precipitation showed an increasing trend among all basins under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the southwestern sub basin sub basin 5 is likely to get more precipitation at the end of the century compared to other basins under rcp4 5 whereas the southern sub basin is likely to get more precipitation under rcp8 5 however the seasonal breakdown of the precipitation showed different aspects the dry season is drying more and the wet season is becoming wetter under rcp4 5 whereas all seasons are becoming wetter under rcp8 5 except for pre monsoon and post monsoon in 2025 s in both rcps the annual flow at the outlet of the sub basins is expected to increase significantly in the 2055 s and 2085 s compared to the 2025 s but there is high variability in seasonal discharge among sub basins most sub basins show a decrease in flow during the winter season in all time periods except in 2085 s under both rcps the western sub basin sub basins 2 and eastern sub basin are most likely to get surplus water under both scenarios compared to other basins in the 2085 s as the discharge in the western sub basin is projected to be a significant increase in some seasons as well as a significant decrease in other seasons under both rcps it will most likely face the issue of too much or too little water scenario the western sub basin will most likely be more vulnerable to climate change than other sub basins furthermore the eastern sub basin is likely to have a surplus of water under both scenarios by 2085 s there is a shift in average monthly flow in the central sub basin sub basin 4 and the southwestern sub basin during the 2085 s under rcp8 5 our findings also show that there will be an increase in extreme events i e extremely low flows and large floods in future for all sub basins finally our findings show that water availability during the century is likely to increase in sub basins at an annual scale but water availability within inter annual and seasonal periods will become highly variable it seems climate change is expected to have greater effects seasonally rather than annually this change in hydrology could affect water distribution timing and quantity in the basin for instance a month shift of the average monthly discharge will impact the riverine ecosystem functions that rely on appropriately timed high flows thus affecting the dispersal of seeds onto the floodplain survival of certain fish species and water demand of crops etc are likely to heavily impact our results suggest that the impacts of climate change are scale dependent in terms of temperature precipitation and river flow response however there are still large uncertainties associated with the quantitative estimates for future time periods thus the impact of climate change can only be understood if uncertainties are also considered the finding of this study will be valuable in identifying how sub basins are likely to be impacted by climate change and in stipulating effective planning and management of water resources in the future decades 4 1 limitations the major limitations of the present study lie with the spatial coverage of ground based monitoring stations as well as the availability of time series observed hydrometeorological data in the koshi basin the network of hydrometeorological stations is sparse fig 1 for instance most parts of the northern basin do not have meteorological stations even though on the nepal side the stations are extremely uneven and the number of gauge stations is also small this is indeed a limitation for understanding the larger variability of the precipitation patterns as well as it is difficult to infer the high altitude precipitation in rugged topography furthermore limitations for understanding the snow and glacier hydrology of a river basin in mountainous terrain as well as difficulty for model calibration and validation thus we took only two stations fig 1 for calibration and validation of the hydrological model it is well known that the more observed data is available the chance of

7780,study region koshi river basin eastern nepal study focus climate change is increasingly evident as the global surface temperature is warming with erratic rainfall patterns across the globe in this regard the koshi basin in the himalayan region is also impacted and it is important to understand the spatio temporal details of the impact in the basin under future climate change this study assessed the potential climate change and its impact on the hydrological regime using the soil and water assessment tool swat and indicators of hydrological alteration iha based on rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of ensemble downscaled cmip5 gcm runs new hydrological insights for this region results show the upper part of the basin warming faster than the lower part the pre monsoon season warming more than other seasons there is no clear uniform trend in precipitation however the southeastern part of the basin will get more precipitation sub basins will get more precipitation during the post monsoon under rcp4 5 and during the monsoon under rcp8 5 the annual water availability will not decline but water availability within seasons and regions is projected to be highly variable there is also a change in the spatial pattern of river discharge and the western part of the basin is likely to experience more impact therefore these findings will be valuable in identifying how particular sub basins within the koshi basin will be impacted by climate change and in stipulating effective planning and management of water resources for the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change hydrological regime koshi basin rcp 4 5 and 8 5 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the himalayas are one of the world s regions that are highly sensitive to changing climates yao et al 2019 there is a noticeable increase in temperatures in the himalayas higher than the global average with an increase in erratic rainfall patterns sharma et al 2019 the area has warmed by around 1 8 c over the past half century considerably higher than the warming rates for the northern hemisphere and the global mean yang et al 2014 kang et al 2010 liu and chen 2000 seasonal and annual temperatures have also risen in higher elevation areas across the himalayas yao et al 2019 liu and chen 2000 this fast warming has had a great effect on the himalayan environment and most noticeably in the rapid retreat of himalayan glaciers and shrinking snow areas kulkarni et al 2013 similarly earlier studies have reported that hindu kush himalayan hkh region and tibetan plateau have experienced a significant change in precipitation events over the past decades zhan et al 2017 however some studies have revealed a significant change in recent extreme precipitation events in some regions of the hkh zhan et al 2017 these changes in the temperature and precipitation ultimately affect the volume and timing of river flows more broadly climate change has notably altered the hydrological cycle the shift in snowline water availability water balance flow regime and soil moisture in the himalayan region temperature is one of the vital factors and also the most sensitive parameter in climate science an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at nasa reported the average global temperature on earth has increased by about 1 1 c since 1880 source https earthobservatory nasa gov world of change global temperatures in addition the global annual average temperature rises by 1 c in 2016 and 0 98 c in 2020 resulting in the first and second warmest year since 1880 noaa 2021 looking at the rate of change it can be projected that there is likely to be an ongoing significant increase in temperature in the himalayan region in the future earlier studies indicate projected temperature change but those changes might vary according to space and time in terms of magnitude and rate of change kulkarni et al 2013 knutti and sedláček 2013 lutz et al 2016a for instance kulkarni et al 2013 highlighted that warming was projected to rise by 4 6 c in western himalayas 4 3 c in central himalayas and 4 1 c in eastern himalayas by 2100 as far as the koshi basin the mean temperature is likely to increase by 4 6 c under rcp4 5 while 7 c under rcp8 5 by 2100 kaini et al 2019 precipitation in the himalayan region is most affected by the indian summer monsoon as well as the winter westerlies precipitation and varies according to space and time the monsoon decreases from southeast to northwest whereas the influence of the westerlies decreases from west to east nie et al 2021 precipitation is the major freshwater contribution to the hydrological system in the himalayan region perry et al 2020 kulkarni et al 2013 showed that indian summer monsoon precipitation is likely to increase by 20 40 at the end of this century in the koshi basin most studies project that rainfall is likely to increase during the monsoon and decrease during winter while the increase is likely to be more in the southern part compared to the northern part kaini et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2016 furthermore there is likely to be an increase in the future frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events for instance the number of dry days consecutive dry days and very wet days overall several studies suggest that the irregularities in precipitation are expected to increase in the coming periods kulkarni et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2012 kumar et al 2011 jeelani et al 2012 projected changes in the temperature along with precipitation patterns and intensity are likely to change river flow regimes resulting in flow variability and uncertainty in water availability dixit et al 2009 the visible impact of climate change is even more palpable in the upstream part of the himalayan region immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007 however the response of changing climate to river flow is likely to differ within the basins of the himalayas due to the source of runoff and hydrological processes varying by location and season immerzeel et al 2012 for instance the runoff is governed by snow and glacier melt in most of the upper part of the himalayan basin whereas the runoff in the lower part of the basin is governed by rainfall and groundwater with minimal contribution of snow and glacier melt climate change is likely to impact the long term monthly seasonal and annual flow of rivers together with changes in the timing of peak flow and variability of high and low river flows under future climate scenarios stagl and hattermann 2016 thus changes in river flows have an important impact on water such as water availability irrigation flood management and overall water resources planning furthermore changes in water availability can affect the water dependent ecosystem and its associated services hydropower fisheries irrigated agriculture etc which will influence many people s livelihoods depending on riverine ecosystem services the koshi basin is one of the most populated basins in nepal where the livelihood of these communities is mainly dependent upon the hydrological regime and its associated river ecosystem services studies suggest that there are likely to be considerable impacts on water resources with severe consequences for the livelihoods of communities in the koshi basin due to climate change projection macchi and icimod 2010 bhatta et al 2015 thus there is an urgent need to understand the potential climate change and its impact on the hydrological regime in the koshi river basin the koshi basin is characterized by extreme topographic and climate heterogeneity the orography mountain land altitude and lapse rate the rate at which air temperature falls with increasing altitude in the koshi basin differ vastly across the sub basins from the southern plains to the northern himalayas as well as from the eastern to the western region of the basin this means the regional differences in climate in the koshi basin thus changes in climate and their impacts will vary across the sub basins of the koshi basin as well as regional differences in the response of flow in the basin detail regional studies highlighted that himalayan regions are likely to experience noticeable climate change with an increase in temperature and erratic rainfall that will lead to significant hydrological changes but what is unknown is how much of a spatio temporal impact koshi basin will have in future in terms of climate change as well as what will be the response of the hydrological regime to this changing climate in this regard the major consequences of climate change will depend on the temporal and spatial scales therefore we hypothesize that the impacts of climate change are scale dependent and impacts are likely to be highly variable depending on temporal intra seasonal and local spatial scale rather than being uniform across the entire basin and on an annual scale furthermore most climate change studies to date have considered the koshi basin as an entirety mofe 2019 as well as only occasional consideration of future climate change scenarios up to 2100 including comparisons among different sub basins therefore spatiotemporal impact assessment and comprehensive multi scale assessments are needed to understand the nature and extent of the expected climate change as well as the response of the hydrological regime and that s what this paper is all about 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the koshi basin is a lifeline for local inhabitants because it provides fresh water for household use irrigation farming and livestock shrestha et al 2017 the basin has a large potential for hydropower development and plays a key role in the irrigation of downstream areas it contains rich biodiversity and is a source of valuable ecosystem services that directly sustain the lives and livelihoods of the 40 million basin residents including the population in the indian part of the basin wahid et al 2017 it is a transboundary basin shared by china nepal and india in this study we included only the chinese and nepalese parts until the koshi river flows into the plains fig 1 it has a catchment area of 55 930 km2 at nepal india border of which approximately 51 is in china and 49 in nepal the river originates in the tibetan plateau passing across eastern nepal and ultimately joining the ganges within the basin the elevation varies from about 65 m in the southern region to 8848 m mount everest peak in the northern regions above the mean sea level the slopes in the basin range from 0 in the south to 84 in the north mishra et al 2019 this variation in elevation results in vastly different climatic zones from humid tropical in the lower plain area to arctic in the high himalayas dixit et al 2009 in the nepalese section there are four distinct climatic seasons winter december february pre monsoon march may monsoon june september and post monsoon october november the koshi river basin is comprised of six major physiographic zones the tibetan plateau high himalaya high mountains middle mountain siwalik and terai each with unique geology topography and climate the koshi basin is characterized by extreme topography climate heterogeneity and seasonal flow variability the orography and lapse rates of the koshi basin differ vastly within the basin pandey et al 2020a furthermore the basin is influenced by two synoptic circulation systems i e easterlies south asian monsoon precipitation during summer and westerlies winter precipitation during winter the climate in the southern part of the basin is strongly influenced by the south asian monsoon whereas the northern part of the basin tibetan plateau lies in a rain shadow area as a result precipitation varies from 207 mm per year in the trans himalaya region to 3000 mm per year in the eastern mountains shrestha et al 2017 winter precipitation plays a vital role in the accumulation and melt of snow and ice about 80 of the precipitation occurs in the monsoon season intense with large local variation because of orographic effects kaini et al 2019 a large southern part of the basin in nepal receives an average annual precipitation of about 1800 mm bhatt et al 2014 the upper part of the basin contains a huge amount of snow and glacier as a freshwater reserve shrestha et al 2017 the total glaciated area in the basin was 2984 km2 with an estimated ice reserve of 295 km3 and the total snow cover area was 5458 km2 khadka et al 2016 bajracharya et al 2011 the annual average discharge in the khurkot hydrological station at sun koshi is 469 m3 s and in the chatara hydrological station at sapta koshi is 1545 m3 s sinha et al 2019 the elevation variation within the basin is very sharp within a short areal distance from 65 300 m a s l in the southern plains to 100 300 m a s l in the foothills of the siwalik region while the middle mountain region has steep slopes and deep cut valleys with an elevation of 1000 3000 m a s l the northern himalayas with elevations above 3000 m a s l up to 8848 m a s l is generally above the snow line dhital 2015 temperature varies considerably in the basin according to elevation the northern part of the basin is very cold with temperatures reaching 19 c dingri meteorological station in winter and the southern lower part of the basin is very warm with the temperature reaching 45 c rajbiraj meteorological station in summer the mountains record the maximum temperature in may while the southern plains terai reach the maximum in april the annual evapotranspiration et rates are generally less than 1000 mm however some parts of the basin such as sun koshi have extremely high potential evapotranspiration and suffer from frequent droughts and soil erosion wahid et al 2017 there is also a diversity of land use across the basin there is a clear dominance of grasslands 40 34 followed by native forests 24 45 and then agriculture 12 45 other land use types include barren land 11 26 snow glaciers 9 45 shrubland 1 52 natural water bodies 0 5 and urban areas 0 03 uddin et al 2015 2 2 observed and historical data climate data temperature and precipitation in nepal was collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal additional climate data from nielamu and dingri stations within the chinese part of the koshi basin was acquired from the tibet meteorological bureau the network of temperature precipitation and hydrological stations used in the swat model is given in fig 1 overall daily data for the period of 1981 2010 from 11 temperature stations 21 precipitation stations and 2 hydrological stations khurkot and chatara was used in this analysis the land use data for 2010 at a 30 m resolution was obtained from international centre for integrated mountain development uddin et al 2015 the soil data was obtained from the soil and terrain database programme soter dijkshoorn and huting 2009 srtm dem of 90 m 90 m resolution was used to delineate the watershed in the model 2 3 future climate scenario for the basin for this study we used a 10 km resolution future climate scenario dataset developed by lutz et al 2016a for the indus ganges and brahmaputra igb domains as a part of the himalayan adaptation water and resilience hi aware project in this dataset the gcms were tested using ar5 data downloaded from the cmip5 model archive in total 94 gcms were tested for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 69 for rcp8 5 lutz et al 2016b this ensures that the entire range of possible future climates in terms of temperature and precipitation change is included for each model run the normal annual difference in temperature and precipitation for future 2071 2100 climate conditions over a reference period 1971 2000 was determined in terms of temperature anomaly t and percentage change of precipitation p respectively lutz et al 2016b based on the 10th and 90th percentile values of these projected changes four combinations of climatic conditions dry and cold dry and warm wet and cold and wet and warm were derived for each rcp finally the model runs that were closest to the percentile values were selected to be included in the model ensemble used for the climate change impact study as well as the percentile values were used to avoid outlier gcms which are likely to be unreliable rajbhandari et al 2016 finally eight gcms were selected table 1 four for rcp4 5 and four for rcp8 5 based on the average annual response changes in extreme behaviour in precipitation and temperature as well as validation of model performance to climatic reference data these climate models cover a wide range of possible futures and are also able to replicate the most important processes in the region lutz et al 2016b overall the following methods were used for the selection of climate models which perform better for the igb domain lutz a b et al 2016 1 the initial selection of the climate model from the entire pool of climate models is based on changes in mean air temperature and annual precipitation mean sum 2 refined selection based on the projected change in four indices for climatic extremes 3 final selection based on model skills in simulating the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation the selected climate scenario data was statistically downscaled and bias corrected using the quantile mapping qm method the bias corrected data was downscaled to 10 10 km spatial resolution by applying bilinear interpolation the downscaled climate scenario data from lutz et al 2016a can be downloaded from http rds icimod org clim for a detailed description of model selection statistical downscaling and bias correction method of climate data readers are suggested to refer to kaini et al 2019 mofe 2019 trzaska and schnarr 2014 and lutz et al 2016a b the koshi river basin is a part of the ganges basin and lutz et al 2016a dataset was clipped by our study area for climate change analysis the selected eight gcm data were used to prepare an ensemble average of the four gcms for each rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this provided two ensemble average data each one for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these average ensemble data were prepared for daily time steps for analysis an ensemble average can reduce the overall uncertainty in model predictions pandey et al 2019 among four rcps we used only two rcps i extreme rcp8 5 which assumes the increased radiative forcing will stabilize at 8 5 w m2 in 2100 and ii medium stabilization scenario rcp4 5 considers stabilization at 4 5 w m2 in 2100 we chose not to include rcp2 6 in the climate model ensemble because robust realistic climate change scenarios are required to support adaptation planning as rcp2 6 requires that carbon dioxide co2 emissions start declining by 2020 and go to zero by 2100 which is highly unlikely furthermore we excluded rcp6 scenarios too because the range of changes from rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios covers the entire range of radiative forcing resulting from rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 lutz et al 2016b table 1 shows the chosen climate model used for the study the climate change impact over the sub basins was investigated by using future climate scenario data up to 2100 we used the gcm climate dataset 1995 s 1981 2010 as the reference data period and 2025 s 2011 2040 2055 s 2041 2070 and 2085 s 2071 2100 as the projected future data period covering 30 years to determine the change in climate as well as its response on hydrology between the reference and future projection in the koshi basin 2 4 uncertainty analysis there will always be some degree of uncertainty in future climate projections because of the different representation of atmospheric processes in the gcms and the development of future socio economic pathways as well as a lack of understanding of atmospheric processes and observation limitations in the structure of gcm models and highly variable simulation uncertainty also contribute to the overall uncertainty in projection scenarios considering these uncertainties in climate change projections is important for decision making and developing adaptation strategies mofe 2019 the uncertainties in the future projections can be understood using responses among the selected models and the rcps change 2014 in this study uncertainty analysis for precipitation and temperature projections was carried out based on the following approaches 1 the uncertainties are represented by the responses among the models for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 the uncertainties are represented by the inter quantile range among the models for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the different time periods 3 agreement on decrease or increase in the change of climate variables among multiple models compared to the reference period 2 5 hydrological modelling the hydrological model swat winchell et al 2013 arnold et al 1998 was used to simulate the hydrological processes under present and future climate conditions it is the combination of the basin scale model with gis srinivasan and arnold 1994 and uses spatial data soil type land cover land use and elevation and temporal data climate data to represent the hydrological performance of the heterogeneous catchments it is a complete model incorporating surface land and channel environmental processes as well as combining studies of water quality water quantity and climate change it is capable of simulating hourly daily monthly and yearly data over long periods picchio et al 2020 the final outlet was defined at the chatara hydrology station to delineate the sub basins of the koshi river basin fig 1 this resulted in the creation of 27 sub basins and 35 hydrological response units hru hru is the smallest unit of the basin and is a combination of unique soil types land features and slope classification shrestha et al 2016 from 27 sub basins we selected only six sub basins 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 these sub basins were spatially distributed in the koshi basin from east to west and north to south where sub basin 1 is the northern sub basin 2 is the western sub basin 3 is the eastern sub basin 4 is the central sub basin 5 is the southwestern sub basin and 6 is the southeastern sub basin in the lower outlet in koshi fig 1 the reason for selecting these sub basins compared to other sub basins was based on the criteria of influence of monsoon east to west and south to north precipitation gradients and the criteria of influence temperature variability north to south as well as these sub basins represent the trans himalayan high himalayas middle mountain and southern plain the physiographic region of the basin most sub basins where no observation and monitoring stations are excluded from analysis and reporting for instance the northern part of the sub basins fig 1 elevation bands were created to model the process of snowmelt and orographic distribution from temperature and precipitation in swat the model generates the elevation band automatically based on the area coverage percentage an elevation band helps in discretizing the topographic influence of temperature and precipitation on snowmelt and discharge bajracharya et al 2018 each sub basin in the model was divided into ten elevation bands and each band was assigned a mean elevation and area coverage percentage the swat model applies the following mass balance equation arnold et al 1998 to simulate the hydrology within a sub basin 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 n r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt

melted water from snowfall and snow cover dynamics in the hydrological analysis swat classifies precipitation as rain or snow by comparing the mean daily temperature with the user defined air temperature threshold the snowmelt in swat is calculated as a linear function of the difference between average snowpack maximum air temperature and snowmelt threshold temperature by using the following formula neitsch et al 2011 2 s n o m l t b m l t s n o cov θ t s n o w t max 2 t m l t where snomlt daily snowmelt amount mm bmlt daily melt factor mm day c snocov the fraction of hru area

evaluation is essential to measure the consistency of its output it is considered reliable if the evaluation statistics fall within an acceptable limit moriasi et al 2007 accordingly a model is considered suitable for monthly river flow simulation if percent bias pbias is within 15 and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse is above 0 75 bajracharya et al 2018 we calculated the pbias nse and coefficient of determination r2 to verify our swat results the swat model was calibrated and validated at two points the khurkot hydrological station on sun koshi river which is the tributary of the koshi river and the chatara hydrological station on the sapta koshi which is the main outlet of the koshi basin fig 1 swat was calibrated for 1986 1994 and validated for 2000 2008 at khurkot hydrological station furthermore swat was also calibrated for 1986 2001 and validated for 2002 2010 at chatara hydrological station on a daily scale the following suggestion was made by fontaine et al 2002 we used a warm up period of 5 years for calibration to develop suitable initial conditions for groundwater and soil water storage the model was calibrated by using swat cup abbaspour 2013 swat cup enables sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of swat models calibration parameters were based on literature review volume baseflow and adjustment of peak flows during calibration lapse rate water capacity of the soil layer scs runoff curve number manning n and snowmelt were found to be the most sensitive parameters the temperature lapse rate was adjusted to 5 6 c km based on khadka et al 2014 the scs curve number varied from 40 to 90 based on land use type the manning n for the main channel was calibrated from 0 03 to 0 06 snowmelt parameters such as snowfall temperature and minimum snowmelt rate were adjusted to the values of 0ºc and 7 mm ºc day respectively bajracharya et al 2018 the calibrated and validated swat model was forced with historical ensemble climate variables from the period of 1981 2010 the discharge obtained from the simulated swat model for this period was treated as baseline data to evaluate changes in future flow 2 7 capabilities and limitations of the swat model for a heterogeneous river basin like the koshi it requires calibrating and validating the model if not for every sub basin but for a cluster of sub basins or large watersheds to simulate a reliable result the key difficulty of calibrating and validating a hydrological model developed in a river basin like koshi with limited data availability is the absence of observed streamflow data due to the unavailability of observed data and accurate information on snowmelt and glacier melt in the high himalayan areas of tibet and nepal results may have limitations even though the model performs all its estimates at a very small areal unit the model has not been built and calibrated to simulate small catchments furthermore swat s snow glacier component is relatively weaker than the rainfall runoff component pandey et al 2020b bharati et al 2019 thus the use of other snow glacier models is recommended if these components are important and need to be analyzed in detail adnan et al 2019 bharati et al 2019 however the model was capable to reproduce or capture reasonably the hydrograph patterns average flow conditions high flow conditions and flow duration curves in the koshi basin the calibration and validation statistics based on available data mostly downstream show the satisfactory performance of the swat model in khurkot and chatara the hills and terai of nepal hydrological stations and the results obtained from these stations can be confidently used for further activities our results are in line with earlier studies done in the koshi basin bharati et al 2014 2016 2019 devkota and gyawali 2015 kaini et al 2021 2 8 indicators of hydrological alteration the indicators of hydrological alteration iha version 7 1 tool the nature conservancy 2009 was used to calculate parametric statistics of flow components from daily time series river flow data as mentioned by richter et al 1996 in parametric statistics the assumption is that data are normally distributed and the data are characterized by a mean and standard deviation parametric statistics with advanced calibration were used to compare reference period flow datasets pre impact with future climate change scenario flow datasets post impact the advanced calibration will involve adjusting up to four parameters i the high flow threshold ii the low flow threshold iii the high flow starts rate threshold and iv the high flow end rate threshold whereas non advanced calibration only a single flow parameter the high flow threshold the nature conservancy 2009 this software can calculate a total of 67 statistical parameters these parameters are subdivided into 2 groups the 33 iha parameters median and coefficient of dispersion corresponding to 5 fundamental characteristics of the flow regime magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change and 34 environmental flow components efc parameters corresponding to 5 fundamental characteristics of the flow regime extreme low flow low flows high flow pulses small floods and large floods as per the suggestion made by wijngaard et al 2017 high and low flow indices are used to evaluate changes in hydrological extremes thus we used only two components of flow i extreme low flow and ii large flood high flow out of five characteristics as hydrological extremes an extreme low flow was defined as a flow value less than or equal to the 10th percentile of the daily average flows of the period and a large flood event was defined as an initial high flow with a peak flow greater than 10 years return interval event in other words future changes in the 90th percentile of daily discharge levels and the discharge levels of high flow events with a return period of 10 years wijngaard et al 2017 the software finds the flow value equal to or less than the 10th percentile of all annual minimum flow as well as the 90th percentile of all annual maximum flood peaks bharati et al 2019 the nature conservancy 2009 mathews and richter 2007 for in depth parameters and characteristics of the flow regime readers are suggested to refer to the indicators of hydrological alterations user s manual the nature conservancy 2009 overall the method for a systematic approach for investigating climate change and its potential impact on the hydrological regime in the koshi river basin is presented in fig 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the swat model result shows a good agreement between simulated and observed stream values at the two hydrological stations the daily simulation results at chatara showed that peaks matched for most of the years however they were underestimated for a few years between 1992 and 1995 for calibration the model performance for the chatara outlet is shown in fig 3 a b based on hydrograph and statistical evaluations the model was able to simulate the flow during calibration and validation and correlated well with the observed data the goodness of fit statistics showed that both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 are above 0 75 and percent bias pbias is within 15 in both stations which makes the model a good representative of the koshi river basin this result is consistent with the findings of shrestha et al 2016 and bharati et al 2014 therefore it showed that the swat model was able to simulate the discharge at the outlet of the catchment with reasonably high accuracy the calibration and validation output value of nse r2 and pbias is provided in table 2 3 2 the projected changes in temperature this study quantifies the change in future temperature concerning the reference period across the sub basins over time under two projection scenarios our results indicate an increase in the average temperature across the sub basins in the future timeline annual average temperatures are expected to increase over time across the six sub basins and the increase will be greater under the rcp 8 5 climate scenario for example the temperature is likely to increase by 2 3 2 7 c in sub basins under rcp4 5 while by 3 8 4 9 c in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 increases in annual temperatures differ among the six sub basins under both scenarios over time the increase in temperature will be highest in sub basin 1 followed by sub basins 3 2 4 5 and sub basin 6 under both rcps fig 4 overall the increase in average annual temperature will be greater in the northern sub basins compared to the southern sub basins which might most likely be attributed to elevation dependent warming yao et al 2019 this finding is consistent with the findings of kaini et al 2019 shrestha et al 2019 2017 rajbhandari et al 2016 bharati et al 2014 yao et al 2019 and wijngaard et al 2018 the increasing temperature in the northern part means the upward shift of the snowline as a result the proportion of precipitation fall as rainfall instead of snowfall which decrease the accumulation and storage of snow at high altitude in addition increase temperature will accelerate the melting rate of remaining deposited snow and reduces the spatial extension of snow cover thus a temperature change will change the snow cover area as well as changes in the snowmelt rate which will impact the contribution of snowmelt and the shift in discharge and flow regime temperature increases will vary among the four seasons across the six sub basins in both rcps the projected increases in temperature will likely be higher in the pre monsoon and less during the monsoon season for all sub basins and both scenarios for example temperature increases in sub basin 1 will be greater in the pre monsoon 3 c compared to the winter 2 9 c post monsoon 2 4 c and monsoon season 2 4 c under the rcp4 5 scenario by 2100 table 3 this finding is consistent with the finding of pandey et al 2020a in the karnali mohana basin in western nepal the rates of increase in temperature vary among time periods and sub basins for instance annual temperature increases are projected to double between 2025 s and 2055 s for all sub basins under the rcp4 5 scenario however for the rcp8 5 scenario all sub basins experience an approximate doubling of annual temperature increase between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as again between 2055 s and 2085 s fig 4 furthermore seasonal temperature increases are projected to be around double across all sub basins under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 by 2100 3 3 the projected changes in precipitation precipitation increases vary among the sub basins for instance overall precipitation is likely to increase by 12 9 15 4 in sub basins under rcp4 5 while increasing by 23 7 33 4 in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 the increase of annual precipitation will be highest in sub basin 5 followed by sub basins 2 6 4 3 and sub basin 1 under rcp4 5 in comparison the increase of annual precipitation will be greatest in sub basin 6 followed by sub basins 3 4 5 2 and finally sub basin 1 under rcp8 5 fig 5 those sub basins in the southeast sub basins 3 and 6 will experience more precipitation than northwestern regions sub basin 1 which might be because sub basins 3 and 6 are impacted by the monsoon season first the rate of increases in average annual precipitation in future across the six sub basins for both climate scenarios increases greater in the rcp8 5 scenario annual and seasonal precipitations are projected to double between 2055 s and 2085 s for all sub basins under the rcp4 5 scenario however for the rcp 8 5 scenario all sub basins will experience a doubling of annual and seasonal precipitations except for dry season between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as between 2055 s and 2085 s the projected precipitation changes show larger variations in seasons than on an annual basis for both scenarios winter season precipitation is expected to decrease under rcp4 5 but increase for rcp8 5 for most of the basin the precipitation during the monsoon is projected to increase in all sub basins for all time periods under both rcps post monsoon precipitation is expected to increase for all time periods except for rcp8 5 in 2025 s when four out of six sub basins show a decrease the projected changes in precipitation during monsoon and post monsoon are in line with the finding by rajbhandari et al 2017 across the koshi basin overall results show that it is likely to be a potential decline in precipitation in winter and an increase in other seasons especially the rainy season therefore it can be predicted that the dry season is likely to be drier and the wet season is likely to be wetter under rcp4 5 in contrast there is likely to increase precipitation in all seasons under rcp8 5 therefore all seasons are likely to be wetter in the mid and end of the twenty first century under rcp8 5 except for sub basin 5 in the winter season the projections for precipitation show an annual increasing trend for both scenarios by 2100 this could positively affect on the riverine landscape ecosystem services however climate change is likely to disrupt precipitation regimes with alternating erratic rainfall and droughts resulting in more repeated floods and droughts for instance the number of rainy days and consecutive wet days was projected to decrease whereas consecutive dry days were projected to increase in the koshi basin furthermore the number of very wet days was projected to increase in koshi basin kaini et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2017 changes in the frequencies of extreme rainfall events might impact land degradation processes such as mass movements soil erosions and removal of top fertile soil which might reduce fertile land ultimately change will impact the lives and livelihood of the people depending on agriculture in the koshi basin 3 4 the potential impact of climate change on river discharge increases in annual discharge are projected across all sub basins and these will be greater under rcp8 5 84 compared to rcp4 5 61 by 2100 the annual discharge is likely to increase by 19 151 in sub basins under rcp4 5 while by 43 171 in sub basins under the rcp8 5 scenario by 2100 the increase in annual discharge is projected to be highest in sub basin 2 followed by sub basins 3 4 5 6 and sub basin 1 under rcp4 5 in comparison the increase in annual discharge is projected to be greater in sub basin 2 followed by sub basins 3 4 6 5 and sub basin 1 under rcp8 5 by 2100 fig 6 overall there is a slight east west spatial trend in annual discharge with an increase to the east to a decrease to the west in terms of the future change in discharge sub basin 3 and sub basin 2 dominate all other sub basins in the degree of change under both rcps the discharge in sub basin 2 is relatively low during the reference period 13 26 m3 s annual mean discharge but is projected to increase up to 150 171 by 2100 under rcp4 5 rcp8 5 sub basin 2 shows a higher projected discharge than other sub basins it reflects that small absolute increases in sub basin 2 can result in large relative increases sub basin 3 also shows high relative increases in discharge under both rcps it might be a reason that around 24 of the sub basin 3 area is covered by snow and glacier being higher than the other sub basins khadka et al 2020 khadka et al 2016 for instance sub basin 3 upper part of tamor basin consists of 358 sq km of glacier area khadka et al 2020 and 784 sq km of snow cover area khadka et al 2016 due to an increase in temperature the contribution of snow and glacier melt combined with monsoon rainfall will increase surface discharge thus sub basin 3 is the only basin that does not show any decrease in discharge in annual and seasonal intervals for all time periods up to 2100 compared to the reference period under both rcps seasonal changes in discharge will differ among the four seasons the winter discharge is projected to decrease under rcp4 5 in 2025 s and 2055 s as well as under rcp8 5 in 2025 s for all sub basins except for sub basin 3 pre monsoon discharge is projected to increase in most sub basins except in sub basin 2 under both rcps in 2025 s and 2085 s in addition discharge in sub basin 4 is projected to decrease during pre monsoon under both rcps in 2055 s as well as under rcp4 5 in 2025 s there is a marked increase in discharge in monsoon and post monsoon seasons under both rcps where the highest increase is in the post monsoon season under rcp4 5 and in the monsoon season under rcp8 5 the rate of change of annual discharges is projected to increase by 2100 for instance the annual discharge between 2025 s and 2055 s in all sub basins is projected to at least double whereas the annual discharge in three sub basins 1 2 and 5 is projected to more than double between 2055 s and 2085 s under rcp4 5 seasonal discharge change is more variable for both time periods under rcp4 5 however for the rcp 8 5 scenario all sub basins will experience significant increases in annual and seasonal discharges between 2025 s and 2055 s as well as between 2055 s and 2085 s the rate of increase of discharge in monsoon might be an increase in monsoon precipitation combined with an increase in meltwater after mid century in the koshi basin khadka et al 2020 wijngaard et al 2018 overall the result shows that there is an increase in annual discharge albeit with a large variation in seasonal discharge there might be water stress during the winter season but surplus water during the monsoon season simulated flow results show that the annual flow is still dominated by monsoon flow in the future even under the impact of climate change fig 6 furthermore most sub basins show an increase in average seasonal flow except during the winter season the decrease in winter river flow might be due to decreases in winter precipitation this decrease in winter river flow and precipitation might impact highly winter cultivation 3 5 the potential impact of climate change on flow extremes climate change is projected to influence components of the flow regime in each sub basin the response of flow alteration varies according to sub basins and season for the different periods under both rcps the flow alteration results show that the magnitude and frequency of peak discharge in all sub basins are projected to increase under both rcps over all periods except for sub basins 2 and 5 in 2025 s under rcp8 5 furthermore the duration of low flow as well as high flow are likely to increase under both rcps for all periods except for sub basin 3 in terms of low flows fig 7a in other words hydrological extremes high flow and low flow are projected to occur more frequently in all sub basins in the koshi basin the change in the number of extremely low flow days varies from 15 100 days under rcp4 5 and 8 60 days under rcp8 5 across sub basins by 2100 similarly the change in the number of large flood days varies from 5 to 18 days under rcp4 5 and 7 28 days under rcp8 5 across sub basins by 2100 the spatial change in hydrological extremes across the sub basins is shown in fig 7 a b the increase in the duration of low flow is greater than the high flow the projected changes in flow extremes are in line with the finding by nie et al 2021 in the himalayas wijngaard et al 2018 for the upper igb river basins wijngaard et al 2017 for the upper ganges and bharati et al 2019 2016 and khadka et al 2016 for koshi however at the beginning of climate change in the 2025 s there will most likely be influence on low flow than high flow but it will then reverse as time passes low flow duration will be shortened whereas high flow duration will be extended during the low flow season the surface water availability will be low which is likely to affect the environmental flow requirement and lead to high water demand resulting in high competition between water users wijngaard et al 2018 this might impact people who rely on water dependent ecosystem services furthermore the timing of the projected average monthly discharge will also change for instance the most flow generating month may shift for one month from july to august in 2085 s in sub basin 4 and 5 under rcp8 5 fig 8 whereas for the other remaining sub basins the projected average monthly discharge period timing remains the same this finding is supported by studies by bajracharya et al 2018 of the kaligandaki basin adjacent to the koshi basin and by khadka et al 2016 of the koshi basin overall the flow regime in the koshi basin is projected to be significantly impacted by climate change the frequency in occurrence of high and extremely low flow events demonstrates the too much or too little water problem this means the basin is vulnerable to both floods and drought resulting in a high risk to people and their livelihood furthermore the change in flow regime will in all probability change the biological and physical processes of the river which will have an effect on quality quantity hydro geomorphology and biodiversity in riverine ecosystems bharati et al 2016 3 6 uncertainties in climate projection we used the robust hi aware datasets of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of 8 gcms 4 each for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as input data for the swat model to simulate the future scenarios for the study basin however there is uncertainty in the climate data as these trajectories are dependent upon many factors including human intervention atmospheric processes as well as international climate negotiations to account for these uncertainties the models were selected based on simulating the four corners of the projection spectrum i e one each for cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet condition of the future for each rcp and their ensemble was used as representative of the future states however there are significant uncertainties within the projections in the study area for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios cui et al 2018 reported that the uncertainties from climate models together with the uncertainty from a hydrological model pose a great challenge to the accurate projection of hydrological regime alteration therefore we should cautiously use the output of the model results considering the uncertainty range given by all datasets these uncertainties can be understood from the ensemble plot in fig 9a where it can be seen that even though the projection for both precipitation and temperature increases the response of models has higher variability for precipitation than for temperature for both rcps also fig 9b suggests that there is more variability in projection for 2085 s than for 2025 s or 2055 s the future projection for precipitation shows higher uncertainties in rcp4 5 than in rcp8 5 however for temperature the uncertainties are similar for both rcps although lower than those for precipitation this can be understood by the higher value of the coefficient of variation in precipitation than in temperature in table 4 for example the coefficient of variation for precipitation is 0 11 0 18 for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 in 2085 s suggesting the range of projected change in precipitation is large in the case of temperature the coefficient of variation is 0 05 0 07 for rcp4 5 rcp8 5 in the 2085 s projections of mean air temperature indicate an increase ranging from 1 3 c to 4 9 c between 1995 s and 2085 s with stronger warming at higher altitudes the maximum range of uncertainty in the change of temperature is observed during the 2085 s under the rcp8 5 scenario whereas it is the least during the 2025 s under the rcp4 5 scenario the uncertainty in future precipitation is also large with projections ranging from 7 to 33 between 1995 s and 2085 s the uncertainty range is expected to be small in the winter season and more during the monsoon season because during winter basin receives only around 2 5 of total rainfall the range is expected to be highest during the 2085 s under both scenarios the range of uncertainty in temperature is not expected to vary much unlike precipitation but is expected to increase towards the 2085 s the finding of our result is consistent with the findings of kaini et al 2019 mofe 2019 bajracharya et al 2018 and lutz et al 2016a 4 conclusion this study assessed changes in the future climate and their influence on hydrology in six sub basins in the koshi basin we use the swat model to simulate the surface hydrology of the koshi basin up to the chatara hydrological station and the iha v7 1 tool to assess the characteristics of the flow regime as hydrological extremes the hydrological model is forced with an ensemble of downscaled gcms representing a wide range of regional rcp4 5 and 8 5 climate conditions for 2025 s 2055 s and 2085 s the model output was analyzed in terms of projected change in temperature precipitation river discharge and flow extremes overall the results show the sub basins are likely to be markedly affected by changing temperature and precipitation as well as the response of river flow in the three time periods under both scenarios furthermore the responses are varied among sub basins with impacts being more noticeable at local and seasonal scales the impacts strongly accelerate with increasing annual mean temperature and precipitation will result in an altered flow regime up to 2100 with the largest projected increases for rcp8 5 scenarios temperature rise showed differences among the sub basins with the greatest increase in the northern sub basin sub basin 1 and the least increase in the southern sub basin sub basin 6 under both scenarios by 2085 s the increase in temperature clearly showed a north south trend regarding the seasonal warming most sub basins showed that pre monsoon is most likely to increase temperature faster than the rest of the seasons under both scenarios an increase in temperature is likely to be lower in the monsoon season compared to other seasons under both rcps furthermore among all sub basins and seasons the eastern sub basin sub basin 3 showed the highest warming during winter annual precipitation showed an increasing trend among all basins under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the southwestern sub basin sub basin 5 is likely to get more precipitation at the end of the century compared to other basins under rcp4 5 whereas the southern sub basin is likely to get more precipitation under rcp8 5 however the seasonal breakdown of the precipitation showed different aspects the dry season is drying more and the wet season is becoming wetter under rcp4 5 whereas all seasons are becoming wetter under rcp8 5 except for pre monsoon and post monsoon in 2025 s in both rcps the annual flow at the outlet of the sub basins is expected to increase significantly in the 2055 s and 2085 s compared to the 2025 s but there is high variability in seasonal discharge among sub basins most sub basins show a decrease in flow during the winter season in all time periods except in 2085 s under both rcps the western sub basin sub basins 2 and eastern sub basin are most likely to get surplus water under both scenarios compared to other basins in the 2085 s as the discharge in the western sub basin is projected to be a significant increase in some seasons as well as a significant decrease in other seasons under both rcps it will most likely face the issue of too much or too little water scenario the western sub basin will most likely be more vulnerable to climate change than other sub basins furthermore the eastern sub basin is likely to have a surplus of water under both scenarios by 2085 s there is a shift in average monthly flow in the central sub basin sub basin 4 and the southwestern sub basin during the 2085 s under rcp8 5 our findings also show that there will be an increase in extreme events i e extremely low flows and large floods in future for all sub basins finally our findings show that water availability during the century is likely to increase in sub basins at an annual scale but water availability within inter annual and seasonal periods will become highly variable it seems climate change is expected to have greater effects seasonally rather than annually this change in hydrology could affect water distribution timing and quantity in the basin for instance a month shift of the average monthly discharge will impact the riverine ecosystem functions that rely on appropriately timed high flows thus affecting the dispersal of seeds onto the floodplain survival of certain fish species and water demand of crops etc are likely to heavily impact our results suggest that the impacts of climate change are scale dependent in terms of temperature precipitation and river flow response however there are still large uncertainties associated with the quantitative estimates for future time periods thus the impact of climate change can only be understood if uncertainties are also considered the finding of this study will be valuable in identifying how sub basins are likely to be impacted by climate change and in stipulating effective planning and management of water resources in the future decades 4 1 limitations the major limitations of the present study lie with the spatial coverage of ground based monitoring stations as well as the availability of time series observed hydrometeorological data in the koshi basin the network of hydrometeorological stations is sparse fig 1 for instance most parts of the northern basin do not have meteorological stations even though on the nepal side the stations are extremely uneven and the number of gauge stations is also small this is indeed a limitation for understanding the larger variability of the precipitation patterns as well as it is difficult to infer the high altitude precipitation in rugged topography furthermore limitations for understanding the snow and glacier hydrology of a river basin in mountainous terrain as well as difficulty for model calibration and validation thus we took only two stations fig 1 for calibration and validation of the hydrological model it is well known that the more observed data is available the chance of developing a more accurate model is increased funding this research received no external funding credit authorship contribution statement s r b conceptualised the research study s r b s p a b s and r

7781,study region the cronómetro lake basin situated east of the andes in argentina s patagonian andean pre range environment study focus we analyzed the interannual fluctuation in the surface area of cronómetro lake january 2000 to january 2021 we also studied the periods of humidity and drought and the anthropogenic activities in the lake basin to understand their impact on water availability within the basin new hydrological insights for the region the area of cronómetro lake decreased by 34 in the last ten years the lake s area reduction started in 2012 which coincides with the construction of fourteen channels perpendicular to one of its main tributaries the sn1 stream the channelization of the sn1 stream in its upper basin prevents its water from reaching the cronómetro lake from 2012 2021 we have not observed a decrease in local rainfall or an increase in periods of drought therefore we suggest the channelization of the sn1 stream is the cause of the lake shrinkage the reduction of the lake s surface generated the disconnection of the lake from its outflow which dried currently the cronómetro lake basin has become endorheic the reduction in water availability in the cronómetro lake basin causes loss of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem services with negative implications for local economic activities graphical abstract ga1 keywords human impact lake surface

sentinels of climate variability and human impact in their basins adrian et al 2009 williamson et al 2008 2009 lake levels naturally fluctuate due to stream inflows precipitation evaporation human extraction and outflows discharge wine et al 2019 the natural fluctuation in the volume of the lakes is an essential hydrological process for maintaining the system s ecology wang et al 2022 at present climate warming and human demand are postulated as the leading cause of water resources degradation and lake shrinkage in semi arid areas liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 scordo et al 2020a chen et al 2020 çolak et al 2022 nevertheless human intervention particularly water subtraction for agricultural irrigation is the most influential factor in the reduction of lake volume worldwide beeton 2002 liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 wine et al 2019 wine and laronne 2020 human pressure can lead to significant variations in the water balance affecting factors such as lake size and depth such morphological changes in lakes can modify their physical and chemical conditions pushing the ecosystem into abrupt ecological changes scheffer et al 1993 beklioglu et al 2001 coops et al 2003 jeppesen et al 2015 the argentinian patagonia is an extended 800 000 km2 semi arid region with numerous rivers and lakes coronato et al 2017 some of these waterbodies are almost pristine while others are significantly impacted by human activities such hydroelectric and agricultural production oil and gas extraction and tourism alfonso et al 2020 scordo et al 2020a 2020b the argentinian patagonia locates at the southern end of south america and east of the andean range the rivers and lakes especially in the patagonian plains are the only source of water for human consumption and the development of economic activities furthermore the population in patagonia is increasing with a higher demand and impact on water resources indec 2001 2010 for example increased water demand for human use has reduced the surface area and depth of the musters lake in central patagonia scordo et al 2017 2018a 2018b also human pressure on water resources caused the disappearance of the colhué huapí lake a patagonian waterbody that had an area of 800 km2 in 2007 scordo et al 2017 2018a 2018b 2020a due to the reduction in the surface area of the colhué huapí its outflow the chico river dried resulting in water scarcity problems in a region of 17 600 km2 scordo et al 2020a climate variability can also cause a reduction in lake surface area and depth el niño southern oscillation and the antarctic oscillation cause dry and wet periods in patagonia pasquini et al 2008 scordo et al 2018a lake surface area and depth decrease when the dry periods are long more than a year pasquini et al 2008 scordo et al 2018a 2020a studies that analyzed time series of lake level or surface area in combination with climatic trends and anthropogenic impacts are needed to identify if lakes are disappearing in patagonia if lakes are disappearing it is necessary to know if the causes are climatic anthropogenic or a combination of both despite the socio economic importance and the need to preserve argentinian patagonia rivers and lakes implementing in situ monitoring programs of high temporal resolution of the water resources in this extended region is impossible due to its logistics and costs scordo 2018 when implementing an in situ monitoring program is not feasible studies based on the analysis of remote sensing images can be an alternative for evaluating various aspects of hydrology and water resources over extended areas peng et al 2005 soti et al 2009 remote sensing techniques allow studying fluctuations in lake surface area bohn et al 2016 chen et al 2020 water quality harma et al 2001 wu et al 2009 and snow distribution lopez et al 2008 in patagonia remote sensing based studies showed that changes in lake area extension are indicators of climate variability and human impact scordo 2018 scordo et al 2018a fuentealba et al 2021 therefore remote sensing techniques could be used to improve lake and river monitoring in remote areas of patagonia in this study we determine the causes that reduced the water availability in the cronómetro lake basin leading to a decrease in the surface area of the lake and a deterioration in the vegetation status on its shores the surface area of cronómetro lake reached its minimum extent in 2021 the reduction in the cronómetro lake area has deteriorated its ecology and the surrounding vegetation negatively impacting economic activities such as fish farming and sheep cattle farming the inhabitants of the region claim the lake shrinkage is due to the channelization of one of the main tributaries of the lake however the reduction in the surface area and depth of lakes in patagonia can be due to climate variability pasquini et al 2008 human intervention or a combination of both climatic and human factors scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a therefore we examined whether the reduction in the cronómetro lake area responds to climatic conditions trends or is related to anthropogenic impact we analyzed the time series from 2000 to 2021 of the lake area vegetation status precipitation and a climatic index before and after the construction of channels in the headwater of the basin 1 1 study area the cronómetro lake basin 43 249874 s 71 086230 o is located east of the andes in the patagonian andean pre range environment in the chubut province argentina fig 1a and b the cronómetro lake with an elevation 850 m a s l has a surface area of 3 04 km2 by the year 2000 and a maximum depth of 4 4 m quirós 1988 the lake has a fluvio glacial origin and is surrounded by high elevation 1200 m a s l on its northern and southern coasts haller et al 2010 fig 1c and d several intermittent streams discharge into the cronómetro lake the intermittent streams have their headwater in the mountain systems cordón la grasa on the southern coast of the lake and cerro curva del león on the northern coast fig 1c and d the two main tributaries of the conómetro lake are the intermittent streams sin nombre 1 sn1 and sin nombre 2 sn2 fig 1c both streams originate at the cordón la garsa and meet 1 5 km to the east of the lake forming an alluvial fan that discharges into the cronómetro lake fig 1c the lake is located within an area characterized by a cold sub humid climate coronato et al 2017 annual precipitation ranges between 400 and 500 mm precipitations occurs predominantly during the winter where 20 25 snowfalls occur on average mean maximum temperature is 30 c and mean minimum temperature is 22 c with large thermal amplitudes coronato et al 2017 the prevailing wind direction is from the west with high speeds 29 km h coronato et al 2017 the streams in the basins have two maximum flow discharges a lower one in july august from winter precipitation and a higher one in october and november from snowmelt in the basin bruniard 1992 in dry years the streams remain dry from march to may cronómetro lake reaches its maximum level between december and january after all the snow in the basin melts until 2010 several authors valladares 2004 haller et al 2010 considered the cronómetro lake basin exorheic since through a permanent stream on its western coast it discharges into the corintos river one of the main tributaries of the futaleufú river that flows into the pacific ocean fig 1c and d 2 material and methods we analyzed the interannual fluctuation in the surface area of cronómetro lake and the deterioration of vegetation status in the alluvial fan located on the eastern shore of the lake january 2000 to january 2021 we also studied the periods of humidity and drought and the anthropic modifications made in the basin of the lake to understand their impact on the extension of the lake area and the vegetation status we delineated the boundaries of the cronómetro lake basin and the sn1

geológico minero argentino to identify and delineate the human made channels perpendicular to the sn1 stream we used maxar images with a more detailed spatial resolution 30 cm on the horizontal plane and 15 cm resolution on the vertical plane we downloaded the maxar images from google earth which were available for 2010 2011 2013 and 2019 we also identified the boundaries of private land using a cadastral map of the chubut province fig 1c we complemented this work with a fieldwork campaign in may 2022 we followed the procedures described by knight et al 2011 for geomorphological field mapping we corrected the limits of the landforms and the correlations among landforms based on geographic positioning that we obtained from a gps garmin etrex vista datum wgs84 furthermore in the field we made a photographic record of the surveyed landforms and made field notes about their characteristics we integrated all the information using the software arcgis 10 0 we used landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli images to analyze interannual fluctuations in lake surface area and the vegetation status in the alluvial fan although the landsat images have a temporal resolution of 16 days not all the available images were useful because of a high percentage of cloud cover however these images are freely available and have a high spatial resolution 30 30 m one satellite image per year was processed to analyze the interannual lake area fluctuations we analyzed one landsat satellite image per year 22 in total for 2000 2021 using mostly summer images from december and january the highest river discharge occurred during spring oct and nov and its effects on lake area extension can be best observed during summer additionally summer images contained less cloud cover we used landsat collection

human made horseshoe shaped channels crossing the sn1 stream transversally in its upper basin within estancia cronómetro boundaries fig 2a b and c these channels were built between 2011 and 2012 and modified the floodplains and the hydrology of the sn1 stream fig 2d and e fig 3b1 and b2 the human made channels are 1 3 m wide 250 850 m long and 0 5 m deep and the space between them ranges from 25 to 50 m fig 2d these channels spread the water of the sn1 stream towards the margins generating a broader floodplain and impeding the sn1 stream from continuing its natural flow fig 3 b1 and b2 cattle use these floodplains for feeding while flooding land to generate pastures is a common practice in patagonia constructing channels that prevent a stream from continuing its natural riverbed is not a usual or accepted practice the fourteen channels that cross the riverbed of the sn1 stream were built between february 2011 and september 2012 the high resolution maxar images show that in february 2011 no channels crossed the riverbed of the sn1 stream however estancias las piedras inhabitants reported these channels presence in september 2012 the maxar image from 2013 shows the channels crossing the riverbed of the sn1 stream fig 3b2 confirming what the inhabitants of estancia las piedras reported in 2012 the sn1 stream flowed naturally in its riverbed and the width of the stream floodplain was 30 m on average before the construction of the channels before 2012 fig 3b1 while after the channels were built the riverbed of the sn1 stream was no longer continuous and its floodplain width increased to 70 m after 2012 fig 3b2 on the contrary in all the analyzed images we observed water flowing on the sn2 stream and its floodplain width 50 m on average remained unchanged the photos we took during our fieldwork fig 2e and f corroborated what we observed in the remote sensing images the sn1 stream flow is interrupted by the human made channels while water flows through the sn2 stream which has no anthropogenic intervention the sn1 stream sub basin has an area of 7 8 km2 representing 20 39 3 km2 of the total cronómetro lake drainage basin therefore if the sn1 stream dries because its channelization it may deprive cronómetro lake of 20 of the surface contributions it received before the construction of the channels furthermore due to the channelization of the sn1 stream headwaters its flow does not reach the alluvial fan before the lake therefore the streams of the alluvial fan that before 2012 remained with water for most of the year today are primarily dry

channelization of the sn1 stream the precipitation in 2008 was 45 lower than the average precipitation after the channelization of the sn1 stream from 2012 to 2021 however the surface area of the lake during the year 2008 2 88 km2 was 6 higher than during 2012 2021 fig 4a this indicates that even under extremely low rainfall conditions the area of the cronómetro lake should not have decreased to its present values 3 5 standardized precipitation and evaporation index spei the spei data reveal no extreme drought conditions from 2014 to 2021 in the region of the cronómetro lake fig 6 from 2001 2011 28 of the months presented dry conditions 48 presented humid conditions and 24 presented normal conditions from 2012 2021 only 5 of the months were dry 55 were humid and 40 presented normal conditions this analysis shows that drought conditions did not prevail after 2012 therefore drought conditions were not the cause of the reduction in the lake area and vegetation status 4 discussion our study shows anthropogenic impact is the leading cause of the reduction in the cronómetro lake area the area of cronómetro lake decreased by 34 in the last ten years the reduction in the lake area started in 2012 which coincides with the construction of fourteen channels perpendicular to the riverbed of the sn1 stream the sn1 stream is one of the main tributaries of cronómetro lake the channelization of the sn1 stream in its upper basin prevents its water from reaching the cronómetro lake from 2012 2021 we have not observed a decrease in local rainfall or an increase in the severity or duration of drought periods therefore we suggest that the channelization of the sn1 stream is the cause of the lake s morphometric and hydrological changes the cronómetro lake used to have an outflow draining westerly toward the corintos river basin fig 1c 3e1 and fig 5 however the reduction of the lake s surface generated the disconnection from its outflow and consequently the disconnection from the corintos river basin fig 3a and e2 and fig 5 currently the cronómetro lake basin is endorheic also reduced water availability has deteriorated vegetation on the eastern shore of the lake the water captured for irrigation in the headwaters of the cronómetro lake basin caused hydrological and morphological modifications in the basin there are several examples of anthropogenic actions to favor agricultural activity that resulted in lake surface reduction and river desiccation in other basins in argentinian patagonia scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a and worldwide micklin 2007 liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 the aral sea desiccation is the most iconic case of environmental degradation due to water extraction for economic development boroffka et al 2006 micklin 2007 gaybullaev et al 2012 among other cases of lakes that tend to desiccation due to human actions denominated as lakes with aral sea syndrome are lake urmia irak aghakouchak et al 2015 lake chad africa coe and foley 2001 great salt lake usa wurtsbaugh et al 2017 lake poopó bolivia south america satgé et al 2017 acuelo lagoon chile valdés pineda et al 2022 and colhué huapí argentina scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a the cronometro lake reduction due to anthropogenic activity occurred in the context where human activities such as hydroelectric and agricultural production oil and gas extraction introduction of non native species and tourism are degrading other patagonian lakes ortubay et al 2006 alfonso et al 2020 scordo et al 2020a b the rivers and lakes especially in the patagonian plains are the only water source for human consumption and the development of economic activities furthermore the population in patagonia is increasing with higher demand and impact on water resources indec 2001 2010 for example human pressure on water resources and infrastructure built without a previous environmental impact study caused the disappearance of the colhué huapí lake the largest lake in the patagonian plains scordo et al 2020a the drought of the colhué huapí resulted in water scarcity problems for agricultural activities and fisher families relocation tejedo 2003 in argentine patagonia there are almost no water management committees to work toward defining water uses at a basin level the extensive patagonian territories added to the lack of controls on water use favor excessive water extraction without penalties scordo 2018 in particular the cronómetro lake basin does not have a water management committee that controls water use implementing a committee working at the basin level could generate consensus on the use of water that would prevent cronometro lake from disappearing the diversion of water from the sn1 stream caused a loss of hydrological connectivity preventing the transport of water nutrients and sediment toward the cronómetro lake and rivers downstream which reduced wildlife habitat the design of the water diversion channels did not consider a return of the exceeding water to the sn1 stream therefore water entering the irrigation channel decreases its flow and remains available for evaporation infiltration and groundwater recharge flow reduction by water diversion increases the water residence times and the ratio between channel surface area and volume resulting in a larger surface area that favors evaporation wine et al 2019 alger et al 2021 also when the stream flow decrease affects the exchange between the surface and groundwater potentially depressing the base flows and accelerating the summer discharge recession alger et al 2021 the design of the diversion channels over the riverbed of the sn1 is inefficient for semi arid regions due to the high evaporation rate low rainfall and high water demand for vegetation coes and pool 2005 this is evident in our study case where after the construction of the channels the sn1 stream lost hydrological connectivity and is prone to desiccation in contrast water flows for extended periods on the sn2 stream which has not been impacted by human construction water diversion from intermittent streams particularly in the headwater area of an arid or semi arid region like the sn1 stream should consider its cumulative impacts on the hydrology biogeochemistry and ecology of the entire watershed miller 2005 wipfli 2005 levick et al 2008 small scale reservoirs and low volume water diversions with an incorrect design and without control can reduce watershed connectivity like a large scale dam deitch et al 2008 bauer et al 2015 ephemeral and intermittent streams provide the same ecological and hydrological functions as perennial streams by moving water nutrients and sediment throughout the watershed levick et al 2008 when the hydrological connectivity of the streams is altered they cannot function properly and lose their ecological functions to maintain vegetation and wildlife habitat abundance and diversity and water quality and quantity levick et al 2008 alger et al 2021 the reduction in water availability in the cronómetro lake basin caused loss of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem services with negative implications for local economic activities for example in cronómetro lake rainbow trout s artisanal fish farming industry ended when the lake lost its connection with its outflow and some of its tributaries also before 2012 the institute for continental fishing of the chubut province used the cronómetro lake to raise trout which then were used to stock lakes across the region this activity also ended when the lake lost its connection with its outflow and tributaries rainbow trout spawn almost exclusively in rivers raleigh 1984 local fishers claim the number of fish and the quality of the meat decreased after the cronómetro lake area decreased and trout could no longer use the streams for spawning furthermore since 2012 the sheep cattle economy of the three farms that surround the lake in the lower basin has declined according to their owners due to the deterioration of the vegetation our remote sensing analysis lined up with the farm owners claims as we observed vegetation status has worsened on the east coast of the lake since 2012 furthermore lake area retreats cause loss of bird habitats and more frequent dust storms that threaten human health wurtsbaugh et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify the tradeoffs between the direct benefits of consumptive water use in the upper basin and ecosystem services provided by lakes in the lower basin wurtsbaugh et al 2017 our study shows that human water subtraction for agronomic activities is the predominant factor in reducing the area of the cronómetro lake water scarcity is a growing problem worldwide with agronomic activities concentrating 70 of the water demand fao 2017 scott et al 2020 moreover future projections expect irrigation expansion will be more significant in low income countries like argentina fao 2017 in this scenario we highlight the importance of calculating a basin water balance before permitting human water diversions to develop economic activities a water balance allows identifying whether the causes of lake area reduction are water diversions or climate variability wurtsbaugh et al 2017 also with a water balance is it possible to define the water inflow needed to maintain lake ecology wurtsbaugh et al 2017 without a water balance natural variability can be an excuse for overlooking a human driven natural disaster wurtsbaugh et al 2017 5 conclusion we found that water capture for irrigation in the headwaters of the cronómetro lake basin caused the reduction in water availability leading to a decrease in the surface area of the lake and the drought of its outflow therefore the cronómetro lake basin lost its connection with the corintos river basin and became endorheic these hydrological changes in the basin negatively impacted the ecosystem of the lake and the economic activities in the lower basin while this study presents evidence that anthropogenic impact is the leading cause of the reduction in the cronómetro lake area we acknowledge the limitations of our work there are no data of stream discharge precipitation and snow deposition within the basin the precipitation data we used correspond to a weather station located 20 km west of cronómetro lake patagonia has a strong precipitation gradient from west to east fifty kilometers east of the andes precipitation is 1000 mm lower than in the range the lack of measurement of stream discharge did not allow us to calculate a water balance for the basin or account for the changes in the stream discharge before and after the construction of the channels we also found no official records regarding the number of trout in the lake or the number of sheep in the farms lacking such crucial data did not allow a more specific analysis as regards the economic impact that the hydrological modifications in the upper basin caused in the lower basin furthermore our calculations of lake surface area have uncertainty associated with the pixel size of the landsat images the variation in the surface area of lakes is sometimes slight and can be challenging to detect with a 30 30 m pixel size in addition we did not study how lake areas varied intra annually using images such as sentinel with higher time resolution and smaller pixel size may allow another level of detail for further research therefore if society wishes to restore or preserve cronómetro lake additional resources are desperately needed to install a weather station promote a stream monitoring program within the basin and produce new remote sensing studies water subtraction for agricultural irrigation caused the disappearance of other rivers and lakes in argentinian patagonian and other regions with arid and semi arid climates in such environments lakes and rivers can be the only water source life depends on our study shows that remote sensing techniques are a feasible monitoring tool for extended and remote areas when in situ measurements are impossible due to logistics and costs we suggest using remote sensing techniques to analyze if lakes are at risk of disappearing worldwide in arid and semi arid regions with increasing agricultural activities credit authorship contribution statement facundo scordo conceptualization

7781,study region the cronómetro lake basin situated east of the andes in argentina s patagonian andean pre range environment study focus we analyzed the interannual fluctuation in the surface area of cronómetro lake january 2000 to january 2021 we also studied the periods of humidity and drought and the anthropogenic activities in the lake basin to understand their impact on water availability within the basin new hydrological insights for the region the area of cronómetro lake decreased by 34 in the last ten years the lake s area reduction started in 2012 which coincides with the construction of fourteen channels perpendicular to one of its main tributaries the sn1 stream the channelization of the sn1 stream in its upper basin prevents its water from reaching the cronómetro lake from 2012 2021 we have not observed a decrease in local rainfall or an increase in periods of drought therefore we suggest the channelization of the sn1 stream is the cause of the lake shrinkage the reduction of the lake s surface generated the disconnection of the lake from its outflow which dried currently the cronómetro lake basin has become endorheic the reduction in water availability in the cronómetro lake basin causes loss of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem services with negative implications for local economic activities graphical abstract ga1 keywords human impact lake surface

extraction and outflows discharge wine et al 2019 the natural fluctuation in the volume of the lakes is an essential hydrological process for maintaining the system s ecology wang et al 2022 at present climate warming and human demand are postulated as the leading cause of water resources degradation and lake shrinkage in semi arid areas liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 scordo et al 2020a chen et al 2020 çolak et al 2022 nevertheless human intervention particularly water subtraction for agricultural irrigation is the most influential factor in the reduction of lake volume worldwide beeton 2002 liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 wine et al 2019 wine and laronne 2020 human pressure can lead to significant variations in the water balance affecting factors such as lake size and depth such morphological changes in lakes can modify their physical and chemical conditions pushing the ecosystem into abrupt ecological changes scheffer et al 1993 beklioglu et al 2001 coops et al 2003 jeppesen et al 2015 the argentinian patagonia is an extended 800 000 km2 semi arid region with numerous rivers and lakes coronato et al 2017 some of these waterbodies are almost pristine while others are significantly impacted by human activities such hydroelectric and agricultural production oil and gas extraction and tourism alfonso et al 2020 scordo et al 2020a 2020b the argentinian patagonia locates at the southern end of south america and east of the andean range the rivers and lakes especially in the patagonian plains are the only source of water for human consumption and the development of economic activities furthermore the population in patagonia is increasing with a higher demand and impact on water resources indec 2001 2010 for example increased water demand for human use has reduced the surface area and depth of the musters lake in central patagonia scordo et al 2017 2018a 2018b also human pressure on water resources caused the disappearance of the colhué huapí lake a patagonian waterbody that had an area of 800 km2 in 2007 scordo et al 2017 2018a 2018b 2020a due to the reduction in the surface area of the colhué huapí its outflow the chico river dried resulting in water scarcity problems in a region of 17 600 km2 scordo et al 2020a climate variability can also cause a reduction in lake surface area and depth el niño southern oscillation and the antarctic oscillation cause dry and wet periods in patagonia pasquini et al 2008 scordo et al 2018a lake surface area and depth decrease when the dry periods are long more than a year pasquini et al 2008 scordo et al 2018a 2020a studies that analyzed time series of lake level or surface area in combination with climatic trends and anthropogenic impacts are needed to identify if lakes are disappearing in patagonia if lakes are disappearing it is necessary to know if the causes are climatic anthropogenic or a combination of both despite the socio economic importance and the need to preserve argentinian patagonia rivers and lakes implementing in situ monitoring programs of high temporal resolution of the water resources in this extended region is impossible due to its logistics and costs scordo 2018 when implementing an in situ monitoring program is not feasible studies based on the analysis of remote sensing images can be an alternative for evaluating various aspects of hydrology and water resources over extended areas peng et al 2005 soti et al 2009 remote sensing techniques allow studying fluctuations in lake surface area bohn et al 2016 chen et al 2020 water quality harma et al 2001 wu et al 2009 and snow distribution lopez et al 2008 in patagonia remote sensing based studies showed that changes in lake area extension are indicators of climate variability and human impact scordo 2018 scordo et al 2018a fuentealba et al 2021 therefore remote sensing techniques could be used to improve lake and river monitoring in remote areas of patagonia in this study we determine the causes that reduced the water availability in the cronómetro lake basin leading to a decrease in the surface area of the lake and a deterioration in the vegetation status on its shores the surface area of cronómetro lake reached its minimum extent in 2021 the reduction in the cronómetro lake area has deteriorated its ecology and the surrounding vegetation negatively impacting economic activities such as fish farming and sheep cattle farming the inhabitants of the region claim the lake shrinkage is due to the channelization of one of the main tributaries of the lake however the reduction in the surface area and depth of lakes in patagonia can be due to climate variability pasquini et al 2008 human intervention or a combination of both climatic and human factors scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a therefore we examined whether the reduction in the cronómetro lake area responds to climatic conditions trends or is related to anthropogenic impact we analyzed the time series from 2000 to 2021 of the lake area vegetation status precipitation and a climatic index before and after the construction of channels in the headwater of the basin 1 1 study area the cronómetro lake basin 43 249874 s 71 086230 o is located east of the andes in the patagonian andean pre range environment in the chubut province argentina fig 1a and b the cronómetro lake with an elevation 850 m a s

southern coasts haller et al 2010 fig 1c and d several intermittent streams discharge into the cronómetro lake the intermittent streams have their headwater in the mountain systems cordón la grasa on the southern coast of the lake and cerro curva del león on the northern coast fig 1c and d the two main tributaries of the conómetro lake are the intermittent streams sin nombre 1 sn1 and sin nombre 2 sn2 fig 1c both streams originate at the cordón la garsa and meet 1 5 km to the east of the lake forming an alluvial fan that discharges into the cronómetro lake fig 1c the lake is located within an area characterized by a cold sub humid climate coronato et al 2017 annual precipitation ranges between 400 and 500 mm precipitations occurs predominantly during the winter where 20 25 snowfalls occur on average mean maximum temperature is 30 c and mean minimum temperature is 22 c with large thermal amplitudes coronato et al 2017 the prevailing wind direction is from the west with high speeds 29 km h coronato et al 2017 the streams in the basins have two maximum flow discharges a lower one in july august from winter precipitation and a higher one in october and november from snowmelt in the basin bruniard 1992 in dry years the streams remain dry from march to may cronómetro lake reaches its maximum level between december and january after all the snow in the basin melts until 2010 several authors valladares 2004 haller et al 2010 considered the cronómetro lake basin exorheic since through a permanent stream on its western coast it discharges into the corintos river one of the main tributaries of the futaleufú river that flows into the pacific ocean fig 1c and d 2 material and methods we analyzed the interannual fluctuation in the surface area of cronómetro lake and the deterioration of vegetation status in the alluvial fan located on the eastern shore of the lake january 2000 to january 2021 we also studied the periods of humidity and drought and the anthropic modifications made in the basin of the lake to understand their impact on the extension of the lake area and the vegetation status we delineated the boundaries of the cronómetro lake basin and the sn1

geológico minero argentino to identify and delineate the human made channels perpendicular to the sn1 stream we used maxar images with a more detailed spatial resolution 30 cm on the horizontal plane and 15 cm resolution on the vertical plane we downloaded the maxar images from google earth which were available for 2010 2011 2013 and 2019 we also identified the boundaries of private land using a cadastral map of the chubut province fig 1c we complemented this work with a fieldwork campaign in may 2022 we followed the procedures described by knight et al 2011 for geomorphological field mapping we corrected the limits of the landforms and the correlations among landforms based on geographic positioning that we obtained from a gps garmin etrex vista datum wgs84 furthermore in the field we made a photographic record of the surveyed landforms and made field notes about their characteristics we integrated all the information using the software arcgis 10 0 we used landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli images to analyze interannual fluctuations in lake surface area and the vegetation status in the alluvial fan although the landsat images have a temporal resolution of 16 days not all the available images were useful because of a high percentage of cloud cover however these images are freely available and have a high spatial resolution 30 30 m one satellite image per year was processed to analyze the interannual lake area fluctuations we analyzed one landsat satellite image per year 22 in total for 2000 2021 using mostly summer images from december and january the highest river discharge occurred during spring oct and nov and its effects on lake area extension can be best observed during summer additionally summer images contained less cloud cover we used landsat collection

human made horseshoe shaped channels crossing the sn1 stream transversally in its upper basin within estancia cronómetro boundaries fig 2a b and c these channels were built between 2011 and 2012 and modified the floodplains and the hydrology of the sn1 stream fig 2d and e fig 3b1 and b2 the human made channels are 1 3 m wide 250 850 m long and 0 5 m deep and the space between them ranges from 25 to 50 m fig 2d these channels spread the water of the sn1 stream towards the margins generating a broader floodplain and impeding the sn1 stream from continuing its natural flow fig 3 b1 and b2 cattle use these floodplains for feeding while flooding land to generate pastures is a common practice in patagonia constructing channels that prevent a stream from continuing its natural riverbed is not a usual or accepted practice the fourteen channels that cross the riverbed of the sn1 stream were built between february 2011 and september 2012 the high resolution maxar images show that in february 2011 no channels crossed the riverbed of the sn1 stream however estancias las piedras inhabitants reported these channels presence in september 2012 the maxar image from 2013 shows the channels crossing the riverbed of the sn1 stream fig 3b2 confirming what the inhabitants of estancia las piedras reported in 2012 the sn1 stream flowed naturally in its riverbed and the width of the stream floodplain was 30 m on average before the construction of the channels before 2012 fig 3b1 while after the channels were built the riverbed of the sn1 stream was no longer continuous and its floodplain width increased to 70 m after 2012 fig 3b2 on the contrary in all the analyzed images we observed water flowing on the sn2 stream and its floodplain width 50 m on average remained unchanged the photos we took during our fieldwork fig 2e and f corroborated what we observed in the remote sensing images the sn1 stream flow is interrupted by the human made channels while water flows through the sn2 stream which has no anthropogenic intervention the sn1 stream sub basin has an area of 7 8 km2 representing 20 39 3 km2 of the total cronómetro lake drainage basin therefore if the sn1 stream dries because its channelization it may deprive cronómetro lake of 20 of the surface contributions it received before the construction of the channels furthermore due to the channelization of the sn1 stream headwaters its flow does not reach the alluvial fan before the lake therefore the streams of the alluvial fan that before 2012 remained with water for most of the year today are primarily dry

channelization of the sn1 stream the precipitation in 2008 was 45 lower than the average precipitation after the channelization of the sn1 stream from 2012 to 2021 however the surface area of the lake during the year 2008 2 88 km2 was 6 higher than during 2012 2021 fig 4a this indicates that even under extremely low rainfall conditions the area of the cronómetro lake should not have decreased to its present values 3 5 standardized precipitation and evaporation index spei the spei data reveal no extreme drought conditions from 2014 to 2021 in the region of the cronómetro lake fig 6 from 2001 2011 28 of the months presented dry conditions 48 presented humid conditions and 24 presented normal conditions from 2012 2021 only 5 of the months were dry 55 were humid and 40 presented normal conditions this analysis shows that drought conditions did not prevail after 2012 therefore drought conditions were not the cause of the reduction in the lake area and vegetation status 4 discussion our study shows anthropogenic impact is the leading cause of the reduction in the cronómetro lake area the area of cronómetro lake decreased by 34 in the last ten years the reduction in the lake area started in 2012 which coincides with the construction of fourteen channels perpendicular to the riverbed of the sn1 stream the sn1 stream is one of the main tributaries of cronómetro lake the channelization of the sn1 stream in its upper basin prevents its water from reaching the cronómetro lake from 2012 2021 we have not observed a decrease in local rainfall or an increase in the severity or duration of drought periods therefore we suggest that the channelization of the sn1 stream is the cause of the lake s morphometric and hydrological changes the cronómetro lake used to have an outflow draining westerly toward the corintos river basin fig 1c 3e1 and fig 5 however the reduction of the lake s surface generated the disconnection from its outflow and consequently the disconnection from the corintos river basin fig 3a and e2 and fig 5 currently the cronómetro lake basin is endorheic also reduced water availability has deteriorated vegetation on the eastern shore of the lake the water captured for irrigation in the headwaters of the cronómetro lake basin caused hydrological and morphological modifications in the basin there are several examples of anthropogenic actions to favor agricultural activity that resulted in lake surface reduction and river desiccation in other basins in argentinian patagonia scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a and worldwide micklin 2007 liu et al 2013 fazel et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 the aral sea desiccation is the most iconic case of environmental degradation due to water extraction for economic development boroffka et al 2006 micklin 2007 gaybullaev et al 2012 among other cases of lakes that tend to desiccation due to human actions denominated as lakes with aral sea syndrome are lake urmia irak aghakouchak et al 2015 lake chad africa coe and foley 2001 great salt lake usa wurtsbaugh et al 2017 lake poopó bolivia south america satgé et al 2017 acuelo lagoon chile valdés pineda et al 2022 and colhué huapí argentina scordo et al 2017 2018a 2020a the cronometro lake reduction due to anthropogenic activity occurred in the context where human activities such as hydroelectric and agricultural production oil and gas extraction introduction of non native species and tourism are degrading other patagonian lakes ortubay et al 2006 alfonso et al 2020 scordo et al 2020a b the rivers and lakes especially in the patagonian plains are the only water source for human consumption and the development of economic activities furthermore the population in patagonia is increasing with higher demand and impact on water resources indec 2001 2010 for example human pressure on water resources and infrastructure built without a previous environmental impact study caused the disappearance of the colhué huapí lake the largest lake in the patagonian plains scordo et al 2020a the drought of the colhué huapí resulted in water scarcity problems for agricultural activities and fisher families relocation tejedo 2003 in argentine patagonia there are almost no water management committees to work toward defining water uses at a basin level the extensive patagonian territories added to the lack of controls on water use favor excessive water extraction without penalties scordo 2018 in particular the cronómetro lake basin does not have a water management committee that controls water use implementing a committee working at the basin level could generate consensus on the use of water that would prevent cronometro lake from disappearing the diversion of water from the sn1 stream caused a loss of hydrological connectivity preventing the transport of water nutrients and sediment toward the cronómetro lake and rivers downstream which reduced wildlife habitat the design of the water diversion channels did not consider a return of the exceeding water to the sn1 stream therefore water entering the irrigation channel decreases its flow and remains available for evaporation infiltration and groundwater recharge flow reduction by water diversion increases the water residence times and the ratio between channel surface area and volume resulting in a larger surface area that favors evaporation wine et al 2019 alger et al 2021 also when the stream flow decrease affects the exchange between the surface and groundwater potentially depressing the base flows and accelerating the summer discharge recession alger et al 2021 the design of the diversion channels over the riverbed of the sn1 is inefficient for semi arid regions due to the high evaporation rate low rainfall and high water demand for vegetation coes and pool 2005 this is evident in our study case where after the construction of the channels the sn1 stream lost hydrological connectivity and is prone to desiccation in contrast water flows for extended periods on the sn2 stream which has not been impacted by human construction water diversion from intermittent streams particularly in the headwater area of an arid or semi arid region like the sn1 stream should consider its cumulative impacts on the hydrology biogeochemistry and ecology of the entire watershed miller 2005 wipfli 2005 levick et al 2008 small scale reservoirs and low volume water diversions with an incorrect design and without control can reduce watershed connectivity like a large scale dam deitch et al 2008 bauer et al 2015 ephemeral and intermittent streams provide the same ecological and hydrological functions as perennial streams by moving water nutrients and sediment throughout the watershed levick et al 2008 when the hydrological connectivity of the streams is altered they cannot function properly and lose their ecological functions to maintain vegetation and wildlife habitat abundance and diversity and water quality and quantity levick et al 2008 alger et al 2021 the reduction in water availability in the cronómetro lake basin caused loss of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem services with negative implications for local economic activities for example in cronómetro lake rainbow trout s artisanal fish farming industry ended when the lake lost its connection with its outflow and some of its tributaries also before 2012 the institute for continental fishing of the chubut province used the cronómetro lake to raise trout which then were used to stock lakes across the region this activity also ended when the lake lost its connection with its outflow and tributaries rainbow trout spawn almost exclusively in rivers raleigh 1984 local fishers claim the number of fish and the quality of the meat decreased after the cronómetro lake area decreased and trout could no longer use the streams for spawning furthermore since 2012 the sheep cattle economy of the three farms that surround the lake in the lower basin has declined according to their owners due to the deterioration of the vegetation our remote sensing analysis lined up with the farm owners claims as we observed vegetation status has worsened on the east coast of the lake since 2012 furthermore lake area retreats cause loss of bird habitats and more frequent dust storms that threaten human health wurtsbaugh et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify the tradeoffs between the direct benefits of consumptive water use in the upper basin and ecosystem services provided by lakes in the lower basin wurtsbaugh et al 2017 our study shows that human water subtraction for agronomic activities is the predominant factor in reducing the area of the cronómetro lake water scarcity is a growing problem worldwide with agronomic activities concentrating 70 of the water demand fao 2017 scott et al 2020 moreover future projections expect irrigation expansion will be more significant in low income countries like argentina fao 2017 in this scenario we highlight the importance of calculating a basin water balance before permitting human water diversions to develop economic activities a water balance allows identifying whether the causes of lake area reduction are water diversions or climate variability wurtsbaugh et al 2017 also with a water balance is it possible to define the water inflow needed to maintain lake ecology wurtsbaugh et al 2017 without a water balance natural variability can be an excuse for overlooking a human driven natural disaster wurtsbaugh et al 2017 5 conclusion we found that water capture for irrigation in the headwaters of the cronómetro lake basin caused the reduction in water availability leading to a decrease in the surface area of the lake and the drought of its outflow therefore the cronómetro lake basin lost its connection with the corintos river basin and became endorheic these hydrological changes in the basin negatively impacted the ecosystem of the lake and the economic activities in the lower basin while this study presents evidence that anthropogenic impact is the leading cause of the reduction in the cronómetro lake area we acknowledge the limitations of our work there are no data of stream discharge precipitation and snow deposition within the basin the precipitation data we used correspond to a weather station located 20 km west of cronómetro lake patagonia has a strong precipitation gradient from west to east fifty kilometers east of the andes precipitation is 1000 mm lower than in the range the lack of measurement of stream discharge did not allow us to calculate a water balance for the basin or account for the changes in the stream discharge before and after the construction of the channels we also found no official records regarding the number of trout in the lake or the number of sheep in the farms lacking such crucial data did not allow a more specific analysis as regards the economic impact that the hydrological modifications in the upper basin caused in the lower basin furthermore our calculations of lake surface area have uncertainty associated with the pixel size of the landsat images the variation in the surface area of lakes is sometimes slight and can be challenging to detect with a 30 30 m pixel size in addition we did not study how lake areas varied intra annually using images such as sentinel with higher time resolution and smaller pixel size may allow another level of detail for further research therefore if society wishes to restore or preserve cronómetro lake additional resources are desperately needed to install a weather station promote a stream monitoring program within the basin and produce new remote sensing studies water subtraction for agricultural irrigation caused the disappearance of other rivers and lakes in argentinian patagonian and other regions with arid and semi arid climates in such environments lakes and rivers can be the only water source life depends on our study shows that remote sensing techniques are a feasible monitoring tool for extended and remote areas when in situ measurements are impossible due to logistics and costs we suggest using remote sensing techniques to analyze if lakes are at risk of disappearing worldwide in arid and semi arid regions with increasing agricultural activities credit authorship contribution statement facundo scordo conceptualization

7782,study region reservoir system on the han river and wei river basins china study focus interbasin water transfer ibwt projects are an important means for solving uneven water resource distribution the water supply efficiency of ibwt is affected by the original project conditions and runoff therefore this study proposes a new form of ibwt which is called interbasin water transfer with connected tunnel ibwtwct for solving this problem and the synchronous asynchronous encounter sae probability of rich poor runoff is calculated in order to reveal the process of operation and the function of the connected tunnel new hydrological insights 1 regarding giving full play to the runoff characteristics and existing engineering regulation performance ibwtwct possesses obvious advantages over typical interbasin water transfer tibwt the annual average water transfer increases by 105 million m³ and it basically fulfills total water demand 2 the connected tunnel can fully exploit the multi year regulation performance of the reservoir reservoir water level drop reaching the maximum of 5 86 in february during a dry year 3 the sae probability of rich poor runoff significantly impacts the interbasin water transfer project and the connected tunnel provides a maximum of 209 million m3 water supply for reservoirs in ibwtwct while also improving the operational process of the entire system this research is not limited to improving the comprehensive benefit of the project and could be extended to other interbasin water transfer systems of similar structures graphical abstract ga1 keywords operation interbasin water transfer connected tunnel water supply synchronous asynchronous encounter 1 introduction as world population increases and rapid industrial development continues water demand is increasing in many regions however with the changing environment and due to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources the imbalance between water resource supply and demand in certain areas has become a bottleneck factor that restricts the sustainable development of society and the economy zhou et al 2017 interbasin water transfer projects have become an important measure for guaranteeing water resource security in various countries through the artificial regulation of water resource distribution thereby alleviating water shortage in some regions while also promoting the sustainable development of water resources gupta and van der zaag 2008 there are currently over 160 large scale interbasin water transfer projects globally including the representative snow mountain project in australia ghassemi and white 2007 the north to south water transfer project in california zhang and dong hui 2007 and the south to north water transfer project in china zhao et al 2017 a tibwt project generally includes water supply area wsa water transfer pipeline and water receiving area wra it makes full use of incoming water and solves water shortage in the wra through the water transfer pipeline as hydraulic engineering and water resources operation technology continue to be developed an increasing number of structures and forms of interbasin water transfer project have appeared jafarzadegan et al 2014 comprehensively considered a combined application of surface water and groundwater in ibwt the water transfer system including a water transfer reservoir and several wras similarly wan et al 2018 investigated a complex ibwt system simultaneously including multiple reservoirs and wra in addition yevjevich 2001 proposed two way ibwt where dependent on the operation strategy the wsa could also be used as the wra for other regions at the same time ma et al 2020 discussed a type of dual ibwt where an additional wsa is added based on the original wsa generally reservoirs in the wsa mostly exist in the same basin either in series or in parallel each reservoir transports water to the nodes of the wra by internal hydraulic connection and regulation cheng et al 2020 as the social economy has expanded and human activity has intensified extreme weather has become more frequent the runoff uncertainty of tibwt increases greatly and the operation process of strong hydraulic connection can easily be destroyed zhang et al 2012 however an ibwt project with the aforementioned structure and form is only limited to scheduling and water supply of the planning objectives when the internal failure of its scheduling system occurs a hydraulic connection cannot be generated with other water transfer projects the water supply process is prone to damage and there is poor robustness in the operation system therefore establishing a multiunit operation system with internal hydraulic connection is essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of the scheduling system in order to satisfy the water demand of the overall project furthermore tibwt is often limited by the original conditions of the project and the impact of runoff can change increasing material living standards leads to greater requirements for water demand and when the regulation performance of existing projects fails to meet the increased water demand this may lead to a serious water shortage in the wra duan et al 2022 murgatroyd and hall 2020 arunkumar and jothiprakash 2017 at the same time improper reservoir operation process can cause an imbalance in the water supply process for example it may not be possible for reservoirs to store enough water during the excessive water supply in the wet season to supply water during the dry season which fails to satisfy water supply demand cai et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 on this basis to alleviate water shortage in the wra optimize the water supply process and strengthen the hydraulic connection of the multiunit operation system this paper proposes ibwtwct the connected tunnel in ibwtwct can connect two independent systems and the wsa with strong regulating performance can exploit the advantage of supplying water to another wra while simultaneously fulfilling its own water demand the essence of ibwt is transferring inflow from the wsa to the wra if there are multiple water supply objects the sae probability of rich poor runoff will have a direct and major influence on the water transfer and operation scheme in recent years some experts have advocated the construction of the sae model framework and the probability calculation of multi water sources guan et al 2021 proposed a multi objective allocation model that is based on the sae of wet dry probability chen 2012 applied the general circulation model for analyzing the effect climate change has on the probability of sae qian et al 2022 calculated the sae probability of rich poor precipitation in two regions zhang et al 2014 discussed the risk of sae probability of rich poor runoff and sediment by copula however the majority of this research is limited to studying calculation methods and probability calculation and no research exists on the impact sae has on ibwt more specifically in the case of obtaining the relevant sae probability the impact on the entire system operation process has not been analyzed including water supply changes in different water resources and the decision making of operation scheme therefore the impact sae analysis has on ibwtwct is more conducive to helping decision makers formulate operation plans with ibwtwct two independent systems establish a hydraulic connection through the connected tunnel reducing the potential long distance water transport instability of tibwt in addition the demand for other unnecessary water supply sources is avoided when the water supply is insufficient thereby reducing project costs significantly however the water transfer capacity of ibwtwct is limited by the connected tunnel size and the sae probability of the wsa so satisfying water demand to the greatest possible extent with unfavorable water conditions and limited hardware conditions is a major challenge in summary taking the htwdp as the research object this paper proposes a new form of ibwt the main research objectives are as follows 1 to establish the tibwt and ibwtwct models and obtain the solution by ga 2 to analyze various data such as water supply and water level change 3 to explore the impact the sae probability of rich poor runoff has on the water supply the main components of this study are as follows section 2 provides an introduction to the project in terms of study area and data sources section 3 describes the establishment of the model and solution strategy section 4 offers analysis of the results and presents a discussion and section 5 generalizes the main findings of the research 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the htwdp includes the han river basin and the wei river basin which are the wsa and wra respectively the project fully utilizes the abundance of water resources in the han river basin for the alleviation of water shortage in the wei river basin where there is a scarcity of water resources it has been estimated that annual average water transfer is 15 108 m3 the hei river water supply hws is another research object of this paper with an annual average water demand is 4 25 108 m3 2 1 1 wei river basin the wei river is located in the guanzhong area in central shaanxi province it is the largest primary tributary of the yellow river and spans gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces the basin area is approximately 136 thousand km2 the total length of the main river is 818 km and annual precipitation is 572 mm however continuous industrial development and drastic climate changes have reduced the runoff of the wei river which has resulted in several natural disasters seriously affecting regional economic development and ecological environment construction the utilization rate of irrigation water is quite low and the waste of industrial and domestic water is also quite serious at the same time as a result of the gradual decline of surface water resources and water pollution groundwater exploitation in this area is increasing continuously according to statistics the annual average over exploitation of groundwater is 459 million m3 in the wei river basin reaching 500 million m3 in some drier years in addition the problem of urban water consumption affects some agricultural water an issue that is becoming of greater prominence therefore taking corresponding measures for the alleviation of water shortage caused by the aforementioned problems is essential 2 1 2 han river basin the han river is a major tributary of the middle reaches of the yangtze river it has a basin area of 159 thousand km2 a mild and humid climate and annual precipitation of 873 mm leading to a relatively abundant volume of water however there is an uneven annual distribution and large interannual variation the han river basin area in shaanxi accounts for just 26 7 of the total for the province while average annual runoff volume is 24 7 billion m3 which accounts for 56 6 of annual runoff volume in the province it is the most abundant river in shaanxi province and making full use of the abundant water resources in the han river basin is a key issue for the promotion of economic and ecological development in shaanxi province 2 2 project introduction there are two parts to the project the han river to wei river diversion project htwdp and the hei river water supply hws the htwdp aims to transfer water from the han river basin with its relatively rich water resources to the wei river basin where there is a serious water shortage it is anticipated that it will transfer 15 108 m3 of water in the long term and will solve the water shortage issue in the guanzhong area while also alleviating the over exploitation of groundwater and the large amount of occupying agricultural water by urban water the project has three main parts wsa qinling water conveyance tunnel and wra the huangjinxia reservoir hjx and sanhekou reservoir shk are important parts of the wsa the hjx is the main water source and can be regulated on a daily basis whereas the shk has multi year regulation capacity both of these reservoirs have pumping stations and power stations hjx transfers water by pumping station and shk transfers water by flowing automatically the operational rule of the project is to make full use of the abundant water in hjx while the shk water supply situation is dependent on whether the hjx water supply satisfies the water demand of the wra when the hjx water supply exceeds water demand the shk pumping station will pump excess water via the qinling water conveyance tunnel as water demand increases the hws must supply water 4 25 108 m3 from the hei river to xi an in the long term as it is the only water source for hws heihejinpen reservoir hh plays an essential role during the construction of the htwdp a one way connected tunnel that is reserved in the huangchigou water distribution junction as an emergency water source for hws is part of the second phase of htwdp this will enable htwdp to transfer water to the wra b of hws potentially optimizing the early water supply of htwdp improving water supply assurance rate and fully exploiting the benefits of htwdp as quickly as possible this means that htwdp and hws can achieve system interconnection while failure will not affect the normal operation of the huangchigou water distribution junction the running state of the connected tunnel is dependent on the water supply situation for the three reservoirs hh hjx and shk each reservoir must prioritize meeting the water demand of its own wra if there is any surplus water following htwdp water supply this can be transferred to the hws wra via the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model used in this research is based on this connected tunnel the specific parameters of each reservoir can be seen in table 1 while the runoff parameters of each water supply unit and the balance of water supply and demand can be seen in table 2 as the htwdp is still under construction and no actual water supply has been conducted the balance of water supply and demand is based on the operation simulation results of the allowable water transfer 2 3 data the operation process of the ibwt is studied using the natural monthly runoff series of hjx shk and hh between 1954 and 2010 in this study the observed runoff data is provided by the shaanxi province institute of water resources and electric power investigation and design and is the key input for the following model 3 methodology the main innovation of this study is that the tibwt and ibwtwct models have been established for the innovative application of the connected tunnel in the ibwt project and the ga has been applied to solve them their water supply and water level changes are comprehensively compared finally the impact the sae probability of rich poor runoff has on the ibwt process is comprehensively analyzed the specific process for each part is shown in fig 2 the optimization model for this part includes the tibwt and ibwtwct models as can be seen in fig 3 in the tibwt model both systems are independent of each other and the connected tunnel does not work at this time based on the reservoir characteristics of different wsa water is supplied to the corresponding wra at the same time based on the tibwt model and through the role of the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model helps two independent water supply systems establish hydraulic relations and achieve the goal of water supply previous research on ibwt has generally taken the eco environmental as the objective zhuang 2016 but this research is based on fulfilling the requirements of multi regional water supply in order to facilitate the comparison and analysis of operation results the aim of both models is to minimize water deficit the specific contents of each model are as follows 3 1 typical interbasin water transfer tibwt model hh in the tibwt model independently supplies water to b in the wra while hjx and shk jointly transfer water to a in the wra the two water supply routes operate independently and do not have a hydraulic connection the main process of model establishment is shown in the fig 4 and the objective function of optimal operation with minimum water deficit is as follows 1 v s m i n t 1 t q d b t q

tunnel 3 2 interbasin water transfer with connected tunnel tibwt model in comparison to the ibwt model the connected tunnel is able to transfer the inflow from the water conveyance tunnel to another wra and both systems form a close hydraulic relationship giving full play to their hydraulic characteristics through the coordinated operation of each reservoir realizing the joint operation of the entire project and satisfying the water demand of two wras simultaneously in order to maintain consistent operation results the model aims to minimize the water deficit the main process of model establishment is shown in the fig 5 and the objective function of optimal operation with minimum water deficit is as follows 7 v s m i n t 1 t q d b t q d a t q t h h t q t h j x a t q t s h k a t q t

been applied in research on reservoir operation and water resource allocation including the particle swarm optimization algorithm ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm in order to solve the issues of multi constraint multi dimension and non linearity in reservoir operation ebrahimi and shourian 2022 constructed a new model that was based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm to satisfy the demand for water quantity and quality in the downstream li et al 2022 used the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimizing water resource operation ma et al 2018 applied particle swarm optimization for optimizing the model he et al 2014 proposed an improved chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm effectively improving the efficiency of solving the model at the same time many scholars have conducted in depth research on the ant colony algorithm the genetic algorithm ga is different to other optimization algorithms and does not easy to fall into local optimization when ga is applied in the operational research of reservoir groups it can effectively avoid a series of problems that are caused by traditional conventional operation algorithms ren et al 2022 used the improved genetic algorithm for optimizing the flood control operation process based on the genetic algorithm and neuro fuzzy algorithm pinthong et al 2009 reduced the difficulty of local optimization with the model the ga algorithm can also be used to solve the model by turning a multi objective problem into a single objective problem hu et al 2014 the ibwtwct model is characterized by multi water source multi reservoir and multi water demand area and has a complex internal hydraulic relationship therefore this paper chooses the ga algorithm for optimizing multiple models as a means of ensuring optimal results while also considering efficiency taking the ibwtwct model as an example the water diversion flows of hh hjx and shk are taken as decision variables for calculation in this paper and the allowable water volume of three reservoirs in each period is set based on this the decimal system is adopted for encoding the decision variables and the minimum water deficit is taken as the fitness function with the optimization algorithm population size is 200 chromosome length is 672 and generations of iterative operation is 10 000 so the global optimum can ultimately be found in addition sae probability analysis has a significant impact on the study of how the ibwt complements wet and dry seasons in different wsas the traditional hydrological events encounter is mainly based on measured data for establishing the relationship between variables for analysis or the typical year method for analyzing the relationship between water inflow levels in each basin however the complex linear and nonlinear correlation is often observed between various random variables in the hydrological science field it is difficult for the two variable probability model that is based on linear correlation to accurately describe the joint probability distribution characteristics of nonlinear relational variables traditional methods can only provide a rough estimate of sae probability in the basin and accurately quantifying sae probability under various conditions is quite difficult during the late 1990 s copula theory attracted the attention of many scholars and was widely used in the fields of finance and insurance it is an excellent mathematical tool for solving multivariable probability problems and it has no limit on the marginal distribution of a single random variable in addition to its excellent characteristics of flexible multivariable joint distribution it divides the multivariable joint distribution into marginal distribution and correlation structure handling them separately and overcomes the shortcomings of traditional multivariable hydrological analysis methods the copula function has recently been widely used for issues such as rainstorms floods and droughts jin et al 2022 used it when performing a joint probability analysis of water and sediment zhang et al 2019 constructed the joint probability distribution of water supply and demand in an irrigation district based on the copula function however there is little further analysis of the impact these joint distributions have on the project pearson type iii distribution applicable to the chinese watershed is chosen as the marginal distribution function in this study and clayton function is chosen as the connection function for jointly forming the copula function for the analysis of sae probability all programs are compiled using matlab software the 56 year runoff series of hh hjx and shk is used as the input for determining wet normal and dry years the joint distribution picture between the first two reservoirs and the sae probability of the third reservoir are obtained using program calculation from the joint operation results the impact sae probability has on ibwtwct in each scenario is comprehensively analyzed and compared 4 results in order to verify the role of the connected tunnel plays in the joint operation of ibwt tibwt and ibwtwct models were built the operation results of the two models can then be compared at the same time the analysis of the sae probability of the three reservoirs can effectively compare the role each reservoir has played in different years 4 1 water supply of different water resources from the description of the function of the connected tunnel that was provided in section 3 1 it can be seen that there are two types of water supplied by the ibwtwct model the original water supply and the indirect water supply this makes it different to the tibwt model table 3 displays the water supply results for the tibwt and ibwtwct models the annual average water supply of htwdp is 1 49 billion m³ which satisfies the water demand of 1 50 billion this is consistent with previous research results wu et al 2019 it should be noted that hws is involved in this paper so a separate operational simulation it was conducted this found the annual average water supply of hh to be 312 million m³ and the average water deficit to be 113 million m³ which far from satisfies the water demand of b with the ibwtwct model the two wras are regarded as a whole the results showing the annual average water supply of the model to be 1 908 billion m³ and the total amount of water deficit to be just 17 million m³ this significantly delays the water shortage in the wra the combined water supply of hjx and shk is 1 597 billion m³ and under the condition of keeping their own water supplies basically unchanged the water supply to b is 105 million m³ through the connected tunnel the water supply of hjx to b is 60 million m³ and the water supply of shk to b is 45 million m³ therefore thanks to the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model fully exploits the water supply of hjx and shk to satisfy the water demand of two regions fig 6 shows the water supply process for 56 years between tibwt and ibwtwct with the tibwt model the htwdp basically satisfies its own water demand while without hydraulic connection with the htwdp hh is affected by inflow and regulating storage capacity failing to satisfy its own water demand with an annual average water deficit of 113 million m³ particularly during the 1970s and 2000s the water supply was damaged to a great extent as a result of continuous dry years with the ibwtwct model the comprehensive total annual water deficit is reduced to 17 million m³ and the guarantee rate of comprehensive water supply increases significantly the connected tunnel enables an annual average regulation capacity of 105 million m³ greatly reducing the water shortage issue in the wra but due to the impact of sae probability of rich poor runoff the phenomenon of water supply destruction was still observed from the 1970s to the 2000s both water supply units combine to form a complete operation system in this study with the tibwt model due to the long term inability of hws to satisfy the water demand of b the water supply assurance rate of the entire system does not meet the requirements at the same time with the ibwtwct model the water demand of a and b is considered as a whole and the three reservoirs use the connected tunnel as a coordinated operation significantly improving ibwt water supply efficiency and increasing the water supply guarantee rate of the water transfer system to 91 07 in order to further clarify the role of the connected tunnel in joint operation three typical years are chosen from a long series of joint operation results a wet year a normal year and a dry year the results of water supply in typical years are essential for analyzing joint operation during a wet year there is an abundance of water from each source which can a large volume of abandoned water at the same time during a dry year due to the lack of water from the source water supply destruction can easily be caused therefore selecting an appropriate typical year is essential in the observation of the role of the connected tunnel in joint operation in fig 7 the monthly water supply process in different typical years can be seen the differences between the two models for different typical years are as follows 1 the water source in the wet year is sufficient and each month satisfies the water demand with a water supply from hjx to b of 90 million m³ and a water supply from shk to b of 30 million m³ hjx makes use of abundant inflow for supplying water during most months during the dry period shk makes use of multi year regulation performance and the connected tunnel for supplying water 2 during the dry year as a result of the low inflow of the three reservoirs hh does not meet the water demand of b while hjx and shk prioritize the water supply to a and shk plays a significant role in the monthly water supply process at this point there is no excess water to supplement b and the water supply is damaged so the water demand requirements cannot be met each month therefore the system has certain requirements for water from the wta which is also the weak point of the model if there is a water shortage in both wtas this will significantly affect water transfer capacity 3 during the normal year the two wras can satisfy water demand through joint operation in the dry month shk utilizes the multi year regulation performance to satisfy the water demand of a and b simultaneously through the connected tunnel at this point hjx supplies 50 million m³ to b and shk supplies 133 million m³ to b the water supply of the shk to b is 343 33 higher than that of the wet year the regulation performance of the connected tunnel reaches 183 million m³ therefore in the joint operation process where multi source water resources and regulation capacity are made full use of the connected tunnel plays a crucial role significantly reducing water shortage and the damage depth of water supply in the wra 4 2 water level change the change in water level directly reflects the dynamic process of operation which helps workers better achieve the objective of water supply by controlling water level for analyzing the utilization of the connected tunnel to each reservoir this paper examines the water level changes of shk and hh in both models for typical years fig 8 shows that the water level of shk shows a downward trend in each typical year as a result of participating in supplying water to b and the change of water level is less affected by joint operation in normal and wet years during the dry year shk water level demonstrates obvious decline in august reaches dead water level in may and the maximum water level drop of 35 71 m occurs in february with a decrease of 5 86 during the entire stage of water level decline shk makes use of the water storage in the wet months to compensate for the shortage of water supply in hjx due to the characteristics of multi year regulation capacity and after the water demand of a is satisfied the regulated water is further transported to b via a connected tunnel conversely under the action of joint operation and affected by water supply from htwdp hh water level increases by varying degrees each typical year the water level being less affected during the normal and wet years and a high water level is maintained during the dry year the water levels of hh and shk provide continuous water supply to the wra through regulation capacity at this point shk supplies an appropriate amount of water to b via the connected tunnel the declining trend of hh water level is alleviated to a certain extent in comparison to other typical years but due to the lack of water supply for each source hh still reaches the dead water level in april and the water supply is destroyed at this time it follows that the connected tunnel plays a positive role in the optimization of the water supply process and improving water level changes in reservoirs with a smaller regulation capacity making full use of the regulation performance of each reservoir and maximizing operational coordination for each reservoir as a means of meeting the water demand of the wra in addition the water supply capacity of the connected tunnel is limited by the inflow situation of each source to a certain extent as each source prioritizes meeting the water demand of its own wra when the inflow of all wsas is low the water supply effect of the connected tunnel is reduced 4 3 analysis of synchronous asynchronous encounter sae probability of rich poor runoff precipitation variation in the wsa is closely linked to the water resources operation project directly affecting the transferable water quantity of the ibwt project with the joint operation of multiple water sources the sae probability of rich poor runoff is an important consideration for ibwt it is a combined event where abundant and low water changes may occur in different regions during the same period as a result of time changes and uneven spatial distribution it also has an important impact on the planning design and reliability of the ibwt project therefore analyzing the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the wsa has hugely significant in the ibwtwct model the copula function method jing et al 2018 is applied for analyzing the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the hjx shk and hh from the three dimensional contour map of runoff between hjx shk and hh the probability of various encounter combinations among the three reservoirs can be checked both intuitively and quantitatively as can be seen in fig 9 the probability of synchronous encounter between the two reservoirs is large with a relatively high correlation while the asynchronous probability is relatively low previous studies on the sae probability of rich poor runoff have tended to focus on the comparison between two objectives cui et al 2011 april zhao and zhang 2019 therefore this paper compares three objectives in two basins simultaneously table 4 shows the sae frequency of rich poor runoff for three reservoirs the total frequency of synchronous encounters of the three reservoirs is 64 31 with the highest frequency of 30 03 in the normal year in addition for ibwt projects each water source is most disadvantageous during the dry year the frequency reaching 16 02 the total asynchronous encounter frequency of the three reservoirs is 35 69 with the highest frequency of the5 normal normal dry combination hjx shk in the normal year hh in the dry year being 3 4 while the lowest frequency of the dry wet dry combination hjx hh in the dry year shk in the dry year is 0 02 affected by the short length of runoff series for each source there is a lack of combination in the actual sae combination including hjx and shk in the wet year and hh in the dry year in order to further analyze the maximum role of the connected tunnel in the water supply process three n n d combinations are selected in this study for comparative discussion as can be seen in fig 10 there are similar water supply laws for each of the three combinations hjx plays a significant role in water supply during the wet month satisfying the water demands of a and b at the same time and during the dry month shk makes full use of its regulation performance for supplying water to the two wras all three of these combinations are able to meet the total water demand in the 1969 combination the maximum water supply transferred by hjx and shk to b was 209 million m³ which accounts for 49 18 of the water demand of b and the water supply of shk reached 169 million m³ which accounts for 80 86 shk supplied water to a and b from november and the amount of water supply increased each month achieving a peak of 143 million m³ in may whereby 27 million m³ was supplied by shk to b which accounts for 18 88 of the total water supply for that month the above analysis demonstrates that the water supply effect of the connected tunnel is significant in the n n d combination basically satisfying the water demands of the two wras hjx plays a crucial water supply role during wet months and shk does so during dry months from the limited runoff series data it can be seen that the connected tunnel plays the role of water supply each month and water supply quantity increases gradually after the dry month the maximum water supply capacity is 209 million m³ making full use of the rich inflow of hjx and the great regulation performance of shk and satisfying the water demand of the two wras simultaneously 5 discussion the ibwt project aims to fulfill the water demand of the wra using the coordinated operation between reservoirs more effectively is the key for studying ibwt most previous ibwt research has focused on the operation mode of reservoirs in the wta ouyang et al 2020 gu et al 2017 this research also studied the water transfer mode of three reservoirs in two wtas but water sources such as reservoirs and groundwater in the wra also participate in the entire operation system therefore comprehensive consideration of the joint regulation of water sources in the wta and wra is more consistent with the actual ibwt situation there is also a time lag effect of water flow in the evolution of the water transmission network and its impact on water supply projects should be considered in future research so that the accuracy of ibwt projects on a smaller time scale can be improved the ibwt project fully exploits the abundance of water resources and the regulation performance of the reservoir in the wta which is helpful for improving the water transfer process and alleviating the water shortage in the wra research by sun et al 2021 showed that china s ibwt project has alleviated the water shortage of 53 of the population of the country ma et al 2021 demonstrated that the optimal operation method can be used for satisfying the water demand of the htwdp the results of that study are similar to those obtained in this paper based on tibwt this study established the ibwtwct model the results showing that the annual average water supply of the system has increased by 105 million m³ and the water supply assurance rate of the overall system has increased to 91 07 this demonstrates that the water transfer process between reservoirs has been optimized and provides a new operation mode for ibwt this operation mode is affected by the inflow from the wta to a certain extent during the dry year the water supply system cannot meet the water demand and tibwt has a greater likelihood of causing water supply damage under the same conditions which means that ibwtwct is superior to tibwt in every aspect sae probability study is an indispensable part of hydrological analysis gu et al 2018 proposed a hydraulic frequency analysis method that was based on the copula function for analyzing the possibility of drought synchronization huang et al 2015 compared the synchronization of the relationship between flood and drought in the wta using sae probability and analyzed the potential for hydrological compensation from the wta to the wra these research results are consistent with the content of this study to a certain extent by calculating the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the wta the synchronization of wet and dry years among the three reservoirs in the wta was found to be as high as 64 31 on this basis with a specific combination of the asynchronization of wet and dry years the ibwtwct provides the system with a maximum additional water supply of 209 million m³ optimizing the water transfer process however due to the impact of insufficient runoff series length and the high synchronous probability of wet and dry years in the wta further study of the maximum water supply function of the connected tunnel is required 6 conclusions ibwt projects have gradually become an effective means for solving the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources on a global scale tibwt projects are limited by existing projects and hydrological environment taking the htwdp in china as an example this study mainly discussed how the problem of insufficient water supply in wra could be alleviated through the existing conditions this research has clarified the relationship between the system nodes and based on the tibwt model the ibwtwct model was proposed and solved using the ga algorithm the results have verified the superiority of the ibwtwct model which is reflected in the effective mitigation of insufficient water supply and the effective improvement of the operation process the following are the main conclusions 1 following the application of the connected tunnel the water shortage in the two wras was effectively alleviated the annual average water deficit was reduced from 122 million m³ to 17 million m³ and the guarantee rate of water supply increased to 91 07 2 the connected tunnel fully utilizes the rich inflow of the hjx and the large regulation capacity of the shk it provides an annual average of 105 million m³ regulation capacity for the entire project and the water level fluctuation of the hh reservoir was effectively improved in terms of operation process 3 considering the influence of the sae of the water source the frequency of synchronous encounters of the three reservoirs is relatively high with the optimal operation of a long series of measured runoff data the connected tunnel plays a significant water regulation role in the normal normal dry hjx shk hh combination and the maximum amount of water that can be transferred to the wra is 209 million m³ more importantly the ibwtwct provides guidance for other water transfer projects and the alleviation of the phenomenon of water shortage in the wra that is caused by the conditions of the project generally the water transfer mode effectively improves water supply in the wra optimizes the ibwt operation process reduces project costs and improves water supply efficiency however certain limitations of this study need to be addressed firstly due to the lack of runoff data on time scale the water transfer capacity of the connected tunnel under extreme sae of rich poor runoff conditions could not be explored in addition the impact the connected tunnel has on the overall economic benefits of the project is also crucial therefore these aspects will be discussed in future research where it will be necessary to expand the length of the runoff series discuss the maximum effect the connected tunnel has on water supply improvement and further analyze the impact runoff uncertainty has on water supply efficiency and the economic benefits of ibwt credit authorship contribution statement

7782,study region reservoir system on the han river and wei river basins china study focus interbasin water transfer ibwt projects are an important means for solving uneven water resource distribution the water supply efficiency of ibwt is affected by the original project conditions and runoff therefore this study proposes a new form of ibwt which is called interbasin water transfer with connected tunnel ibwtwct for solving this problem and the synchronous asynchronous encounter sae probability of rich poor runoff is calculated in order to reveal the process of operation and the function of the connected tunnel new hydrological insights 1 regarding giving full play to the runoff characteristics and existing engineering regulation performance ibwtwct possesses obvious advantages over typical interbasin water transfer tibwt the annual average water transfer increases by 105 million m³ and it basically fulfills total water demand 2 the connected tunnel can fully exploit the multi year regulation performance of the reservoir reservoir water level drop reaching the maximum of 5 86 in february during a dry year 3 the sae probability of rich poor runoff significantly impacts the interbasin water transfer project and the connected tunnel provides a maximum of 209 million m3 water supply for reservoirs in ibwtwct while also improving the operational process of the entire system this research is not limited to improving the comprehensive benefit of the project and could be extended to other interbasin water transfer systems of similar structures graphical abstract ga1 keywords operation interbasin water transfer connected tunnel water supply synchronous asynchronous encounter 1 introduction as world population increases and rapid industrial development continues water demand is increasing in many regions however with the changing environment and due to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources the imbalance between water resource supply and demand in certain areas has become a bottleneck factor that restricts the sustainable development of society and the economy zhou et al 2017 interbasin water transfer projects have become an important measure for guaranteeing water resource security in various countries through the artificial regulation of water resource distribution thereby alleviating water shortage in some regions while also promoting the sustainable development of water resources gupta and van der zaag 2008 there are currently over 160 large scale interbasin water transfer projects globally including the representative snow mountain project in australia ghassemi and white 2007 the north to south water transfer project in california zhang and dong hui 2007 and the south to north water transfer project in china zhao et al 2017 a tibwt project generally includes water supply area wsa water transfer pipeline and water receiving area wra it makes full use of incoming water and solves water shortage in the wra through the water transfer pipeline as hydraulic engineering and water resources operation technology continue to be developed an increasing number of structures and forms of interbasin water transfer project have appeared jafarzadegan et al 2014 comprehensively considered a combined application of surface water and groundwater in ibwt the water transfer system including a water transfer reservoir and several wras similarly wan et al 2018 investigated a complex ibwt system simultaneously including multiple reservoirs and wra in addition yevjevich 2001 proposed two way ibwt where dependent on the operation strategy the wsa could also be used as the wra for other regions at the same time ma et al 2020 discussed a type of dual ibwt where an additional wsa is added based on the original wsa generally reservoirs in the wsa mostly exist in the same basin either in series or in parallel each reservoir transports water to the nodes of the wra by internal hydraulic connection and regulation cheng et al 2020 as the social economy has expanded and human activity has intensified extreme weather has become more frequent the runoff uncertainty of tibwt increases greatly and the operation process of strong hydraulic connection can easily be destroyed zhang et al 2012 however an ibwt project with the aforementioned structure and form is only limited to scheduling and water supply of the planning objectives when the internal failure of its scheduling system occurs a hydraulic connection cannot be generated with other water transfer projects the water supply process is prone to damage and there is poor robustness in the operation system therefore establishing a multiunit operation system with internal hydraulic connection is essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of the scheduling system in order to satisfy the water demand of the overall project furthermore tibwt is often limited by the original conditions of the project and the impact of runoff can change increasing material living standards leads to greater requirements for water demand and when the regulation performance of existing projects fails to meet the increased water demand this may lead to a serious water shortage in the wra duan et al 2022 murgatroyd and hall 2020 arunkumar and jothiprakash 2017 at the same time improper reservoir operation process can cause an imbalance in the water supply process for example it may not be possible for reservoirs to store enough water during the excessive water supply in the wet season to supply water during the dry season which fails to satisfy water supply demand cai et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 on this basis to alleviate water shortage in the wra optimize the water supply process and strengthen the hydraulic connection of the multiunit operation system this paper proposes ibwtwct the connected tunnel in ibwtwct can connect two independent systems and the wsa with strong regulating performance can exploit the advantage of supplying water to another wra while simultaneously fulfilling its own water demand the essence of ibwt is transferring inflow from the wsa to the wra if there are multiple water supply objects the sae probability of rich poor runoff will have a direct and major influence on the water transfer and operation scheme in recent years some experts have advocated the construction of the sae model framework and the probability calculation of multi water sources guan et al 2021 proposed a multi objective allocation model that is based on the sae of wet dry probability chen 2012 applied the general circulation model for analyzing the effect climate change has on the probability of sae qian et al 2022 calculated the sae probability of rich poor precipitation in two regions zhang et al 2014 discussed the risk of sae probability of rich poor runoff and sediment by copula however the majority of this research is limited to studying calculation methods and probability calculation and no research exists on the impact sae has on ibwt more specifically in the case of obtaining the relevant sae probability the impact on the entire system operation process has not been analyzed including water supply changes in different water resources and the decision making of operation scheme therefore the impact sae analysis has on ibwtwct is more conducive to helping decision makers formulate operation plans with ibwtwct two independent systems establish a hydraulic connection through the connected tunnel reducing the potential long distance water transport instability of tibwt in addition the demand for other unnecessary water supply sources is avoided when the water supply is insufficient thereby reducing project costs significantly however the water transfer capacity of ibwtwct is limited by the connected tunnel size and the sae probability of the wsa so satisfying water demand to the greatest possible extent with unfavorable water conditions and limited hardware conditions is a major challenge in summary taking the htwdp as the research object this paper proposes a new form of ibwt the main research objectives are as follows 1 to establish the tibwt and ibwtwct models and obtain the solution by ga 2 to analyze various data such as water supply and water level change 3 to explore the impact the sae probability of rich poor runoff has on the water supply the main components of this study are as follows section 2 provides an introduction to the project in terms of study area and data sources section 3 describes the establishment of the model and solution strategy section 4 offers analysis of the results and presents a discussion and section 5 generalizes the main findings of the research 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the htwdp includes the han river basin and the wei river basin which are the wsa and wra respectively the project fully utilizes the abundance of water resources in the han river basin for the alleviation of water shortage in the wei river basin where there is a scarcity of water resources it has been estimated that annual average water transfer is 15 108 m3 the hei river water supply hws is another research object of this paper with an annual average water demand is 4 25 108 m3 2 1 1 wei river basin the wei river is located in the guanzhong area in central shaanxi province it is the largest primary tributary of the yellow river and spans gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces the basin area is approximately 136 thousand km2 the total length of the main river is 818 km and annual precipitation is 572 mm however continuous industrial development and drastic climate changes have reduced the runoff of the wei river which has resulted in several natural disasters seriously affecting regional economic development and ecological environment construction the utilization rate of irrigation water is quite low and the waste of industrial and domestic water is also quite serious at the same time as a result of the gradual decline of surface water resources and water pollution groundwater exploitation in this area is increasing continuously according to statistics the annual average over exploitation of groundwater is 459 million m3 in the wei river basin reaching 500 million m3 in some drier years in addition the problem of urban water consumption affects some agricultural water an issue that is becoming of greater prominence therefore taking corresponding measures for the alleviation of water shortage caused by the aforementioned problems is essential 2 1 2 han river basin the han river is a major tributary of the middle reaches of the yangtze river it has a basin area of 159 thousand km2 a mild and humid climate and annual precipitation of 873 mm leading to a relatively abundant volume of water however there is an uneven annual distribution and large interannual variation the han river basin area in shaanxi accounts for just 26 7 of the total for the province while average annual runoff volume is 24 7 billion m3 which accounts for 56 6 of annual runoff volume in the province it is the most abundant river in shaanxi province and making full use of the abundant water resources in the han river basin is a key issue for the promotion of economic and ecological development in shaanxi province 2 2 project introduction there are two parts to the project the han river to wei river diversion project htwdp and the hei river water supply hws the htwdp aims to transfer water from the han river basin with its relatively rich water resources to the wei river basin where there is a serious water shortage it is anticipated that it will transfer 15 108 m3 of water in the long term and will solve the water shortage issue in the guanzhong area while also alleviating the over exploitation of groundwater and the large amount of occupying agricultural water by urban water the project has three main parts wsa qinling water conveyance tunnel and wra the huangjinxia reservoir hjx and sanhekou reservoir shk are important parts of the wsa the hjx is the main water source and can be regulated on a daily basis whereas the shk has multi year regulation capacity both of these reservoirs have pumping stations and power stations hjx transfers water by pumping station and shk transfers water by flowing automatically the operational rule of the project is to make full use of the abundant water in hjx while the shk water supply situation is dependent on whether the hjx water supply satisfies the water demand of the wra when the hjx water supply exceeds water demand the shk pumping station will pump excess water via the qinling water conveyance tunnel as water demand increases the hws must supply water 4 25 108 m3 from the hei river to xi an in the long term as it is the only water source for hws heihejinpen reservoir hh plays an essential role during the construction of the htwdp a one way connected tunnel that is reserved in the huangchigou water distribution junction as an emergency water source for hws is part of the second phase of htwdp this will enable htwdp to transfer water to the wra b of hws potentially optimizing the early water supply of htwdp improving water supply assurance rate and fully exploiting the benefits of htwdp as quickly as possible this means that htwdp and hws can achieve system interconnection while failure will not affect the normal operation of the huangchigou water distribution junction the running state of the connected tunnel is dependent on the water supply situation for the three reservoirs hh hjx and shk each reservoir must prioritize meeting the water demand of its own wra if there is any surplus water following htwdp water supply this can be transferred to the hws wra via the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model used in this research is based on this connected tunnel the specific parameters of each reservoir can be seen in table 1 while the runoff parameters of each water supply unit and the balance of water supply and demand can be seen in table 2 as the htwdp is still under construction and no actual water supply has been conducted the balance of water supply and demand is based on the operation simulation results of the allowable water transfer 2 3 data the operation process of the ibwt is studied using the natural monthly runoff series of hjx shk and hh between 1954 and 2010 in this study the observed runoff data is provided by the shaanxi province institute of water resources and electric power investigation and design and is the key input for the following model 3 methodology the main innovation of this study is that the tibwt and ibwtwct models have been established for the innovative application of the connected tunnel in the ibwt project and the ga has been applied to solve them their water supply and water level changes are comprehensively compared finally the impact the sae probability of rich poor runoff has on the ibwt process is comprehensively analyzed the specific process for each part is shown in fig 2 the optimization model for this part includes the tibwt and ibwtwct models as can be seen in fig 3 in the tibwt model both systems are independent of each other and the connected tunnel does not work at this time based on the reservoir characteristics of different wsa water is supplied to the corresponding wra at the same time based on the tibwt model and through the role of the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model helps two independent water supply systems establish hydraulic relations and achieve the goal of water supply previous research on ibwt has generally taken the eco environmental as the objective zhuang 2016 but this research is based on fulfilling the requirements of multi regional water supply in order to facilitate the comparison and analysis of operation results the aim of both models is to minimize water deficit the specific contents of each model are as follows 3 1 typical interbasin water transfer tibwt model hh in the tibwt model independently supplies water to b in the wra while hjx and shk jointly transfer water to a in the wra the two water supply routes operate independently and do not have a hydraulic connection the main process of model establishment is shown in the fig 4 and the objective function of optimal operation with minimum water deficit is as follows 1 v s m i n t 1 t q d b t q

tunnel 3 2 interbasin water transfer with connected tunnel tibwt model in comparison to the ibwt model the connected tunnel is able to transfer the inflow from the water conveyance tunnel to another wra and both systems form a close hydraulic relationship giving full play to their hydraulic characteristics through the coordinated operation of each reservoir realizing the joint operation of the entire project and satisfying the water demand of two wras simultaneously in order to maintain consistent operation results the model aims to minimize the water deficit the main process of model establishment is shown in the fig 5 and the objective function of optimal operation with minimum water deficit is as follows 7 v s m i n t 1 t q d b t q d a t q t h h t q t h j x a t q t s h k a t q t

been applied in research on reservoir operation and water resource allocation including the particle swarm optimization algorithm ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm in order to solve the issues of multi constraint multi dimension and non linearity in reservoir operation ebrahimi and shourian 2022 constructed a new model that was based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm to satisfy the demand for water quantity and quality in the downstream li et al 2022 used the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimizing water resource operation ma et al 2018 applied particle swarm optimization for optimizing the model he et al 2014 proposed an improved chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm effectively improving the efficiency of solving the model at the same time many scholars have conducted in depth research on the ant colony algorithm the genetic algorithm ga is different to other optimization algorithms and does not easy to fall into local optimization when ga is applied in the operational research of reservoir groups it can effectively avoid a series of problems that are caused by traditional conventional operation algorithms ren et al 2022 used the improved genetic algorithm for optimizing the flood control operation process based on the genetic algorithm and neuro fuzzy algorithm pinthong et al 2009 reduced the difficulty of local optimization with the model the ga algorithm can also be used to solve the model by turning a multi objective problem into a single objective problem hu et al 2014 the ibwtwct model is characterized by multi water source multi reservoir and multi water demand area and has a complex internal hydraulic relationship therefore this paper chooses the ga algorithm for optimizing multiple models as a means of ensuring optimal results while also considering efficiency taking the ibwtwct model as an example the water diversion flows of hh hjx and shk are taken as decision variables for calculation in this paper and the allowable water volume of three reservoirs in each period is set based on this the decimal system is adopted for encoding the decision variables and the minimum water deficit is taken as the fitness function with the optimization algorithm population size is 200 chromosome length is 672 and generations of iterative operation is 10 000 so the global optimum can ultimately be found in addition sae probability analysis has a significant impact on the study of how the ibwt complements wet and dry seasons in different wsas the traditional hydrological events encounter is mainly based on measured data for establishing the relationship between variables for analysis or the typical year method for analyzing the relationship between water inflow levels in each basin however the complex linear and nonlinear correlation is often observed between various random variables in the hydrological science field it is difficult for the two variable probability model that is based on linear correlation to accurately describe the joint probability distribution characteristics of nonlinear relational variables traditional methods can only provide a rough estimate of sae probability in the basin and accurately quantifying sae probability under various conditions is quite difficult during the late 1990 s copula theory attracted the attention of many scholars and was widely used in the fields of finance and insurance it is an excellent mathematical tool for solving multivariable probability problems and it has no limit on the marginal distribution of a single random variable in addition to its excellent characteristics of flexible multivariable joint distribution it divides the multivariable joint distribution into marginal distribution and correlation structure handling them separately and overcomes the shortcomings of traditional multivariable hydrological analysis methods the copula function has recently been widely used for issues such as rainstorms floods and droughts jin et al 2022 used it when performing a joint probability analysis of water and sediment zhang et al 2019 constructed the joint probability distribution of water supply and demand in an irrigation district based on the copula function however there is little further analysis of the impact these joint distributions have on the project pearson type iii distribution applicable to the chinese watershed is chosen as the marginal distribution function in this study and clayton function is chosen as the connection function for jointly forming the copula function for the analysis of sae probability all programs are compiled using matlab software the 56 year runoff series of hh hjx and shk is used as the input for determining wet normal and dry years the joint distribution picture between the first two reservoirs and the sae probability of the third reservoir are obtained using program calculation from the joint operation results the impact sae probability has on ibwtwct in each scenario is comprehensively analyzed and compared 4 results in order to verify the role of the connected tunnel plays in the joint operation of ibwt tibwt and ibwtwct models were built the operation results of the two models can then be compared at the same time the analysis of the sae probability of the three reservoirs can effectively compare the role each reservoir has played in different years 4 1 water supply of different water resources from the description of the function of the connected tunnel that was provided in section 3 1 it can be seen that there are two types of water supplied by the ibwtwct model the original water supply and the indirect water supply this makes it different to the tibwt model table 3 displays the water supply results for the tibwt and ibwtwct models the annual average water supply of htwdp is 1 49 billion m³ which satisfies the water demand of 1 50 billion this is consistent with previous research results wu et al 2019 it should be noted that hws is involved in this paper so a separate operational simulation it was conducted this found the annual average water supply of hh to be 312 million m³ and the average water deficit to be 113 million m³ which far from satisfies the water demand of b with the ibwtwct model the two wras are regarded as a whole the results showing the annual average water supply of the model to be 1 908 billion m³ and the total amount of water deficit to be just 17 million m³ this significantly delays the water shortage in the wra the combined water supply of hjx and shk is 1 597 billion m³ and under the condition of keeping their own water supplies basically unchanged the water supply to b is 105 million m³ through the connected tunnel the water supply of hjx to b is 60 million m³ and the water supply of shk to b is 45 million m³ therefore thanks to the connected tunnel the ibwtwct model fully exploits the water supply of hjx and shk to satisfy the water demand of two regions fig 6 shows the water supply process for 56 years between tibwt and ibwtwct with the tibwt model the htwdp basically satisfies its own water demand while without hydraulic connection with the htwdp hh is affected by inflow and regulating storage capacity failing to satisfy its own water demand with an annual average water deficit of 113 million m³ particularly during the 1970s and 2000s the water supply was damaged to a great extent as a result of continuous dry years with the ibwtwct model the comprehensive total annual water deficit is reduced to 17 million m³ and the guarantee rate of comprehensive water supply increases significantly the connected tunnel enables an annual average regulation capacity of 105 million m³ greatly reducing the water shortage issue in the wra but due to the impact of sae probability of rich poor runoff the phenomenon of water supply destruction was still observed from the 1970s to the 2000s both water supply units combine to form a complete operation system in this study with the tibwt model due to the long term inability of hws to satisfy the water demand of b the water supply assurance rate of the entire system does not meet the requirements at the same time with the ibwtwct model the water demand of a and b is considered as a whole and the three reservoirs use the connected tunnel as a coordinated operation significantly improving ibwt water supply efficiency and increasing the water supply guarantee rate of the water transfer system to 91 07 in order to further clarify the role of the connected tunnel in joint operation three typical years are chosen from a long series of joint operation results a wet year a normal year and a dry year the results of water supply in typical years are essential for analyzing joint operation during a wet year there is an abundance of water from each source which can a large volume of abandoned water at the same time during a dry year due to the lack of water from the source water supply destruction can easily be caused therefore selecting an appropriate typical year is essential in the observation of the role of the connected tunnel in joint operation in fig 7 the monthly water supply process in different typical years can be seen the differences between the two models for different typical years are as follows 1 the water source in the wet year is sufficient and each month satisfies the water demand with a water supply from hjx to b of 90 million m³ and a water supply from shk to b of 30 million m³ hjx makes use of abundant inflow for supplying water during most months during the dry period shk makes use of multi year regulation performance and the connected tunnel for supplying water 2 during the dry year as a result of the low inflow of the three reservoirs hh does not meet the water demand of b while hjx and shk prioritize the water supply to a and shk plays a significant role in the monthly water supply process at this point there is no excess water to supplement b and the water supply is damaged so the water demand requirements cannot be met each month therefore the system has certain requirements for water from the wta which is also the weak point of the model if there is a water shortage in both wtas this will significantly affect water transfer capacity 3 during the normal year the two wras can satisfy water demand through joint operation in the dry month shk utilizes the multi year regulation performance to satisfy the water demand of a and b simultaneously through the connected tunnel at this point hjx supplies 50 million m³ to b and shk supplies 133 million m³ to b the water supply of the shk to b is 343 33 higher than that of the wet year the regulation performance of the connected tunnel reaches 183 million m³ therefore in the joint operation process where multi source water resources and regulation capacity are made full use of the connected tunnel plays a crucial role significantly reducing water shortage and the damage depth of water supply in the wra 4 2 water level change the change in water level directly reflects the dynamic process of operation which helps workers better achieve the objective of water supply by controlling water level for analyzing the utilization of the connected tunnel to each reservoir this paper examines the water level changes of shk and hh in both models for typical years fig 8 shows that the water level of shk shows a downward trend in each typical year as a result of participating in supplying water to b and the change of water level is less affected by joint operation in normal and wet years during the dry year shk water level demonstrates obvious decline in august reaches dead water level in may and the maximum water level drop of 35 71 m occurs in february with a decrease of 5 86 during the entire stage of water level decline shk makes use of the water storage in the wet months to compensate for the shortage of water supply in hjx due to the characteristics of multi year regulation capacity and after the water demand of a is satisfied the regulated water is further transported to b via a connected tunnel conversely under the action of joint operation and affected by water supply from htwdp hh water level increases by varying degrees each typical year the water level being less affected during the normal and wet years and a high water level is maintained during the dry year the water levels of hh and shk provide continuous water supply to the wra through regulation capacity at this point shk supplies an appropriate amount of water to b via the connected tunnel the declining trend of hh water level is alleviated to a certain extent in comparison to other typical years but due to the lack of water supply for each source hh still reaches the dead water level in april and the water supply is destroyed at this time it follows that the connected tunnel plays a positive role in the optimization of the water supply process and improving water level changes in reservoirs with a smaller regulation capacity making full use of the regulation performance of each reservoir and maximizing operational coordination for each reservoir as a means of meeting the water demand of the wra in addition the water supply capacity of the connected tunnel is limited by the inflow situation of each source to a certain extent as each source prioritizes meeting the water demand of its own wra when the inflow of all wsas is low the water supply effect of the connected tunnel is reduced 4 3 analysis of synchronous asynchronous encounter sae probability of rich poor runoff precipitation variation in the wsa is closely linked to the water resources operation project directly affecting the transferable water quantity of the ibwt project with the joint operation of multiple water sources the sae probability of rich poor runoff is an important consideration for ibwt it is a combined event where abundant and low water changes may occur in different regions during the same period as a result of time changes and uneven spatial distribution it also has an important impact on the planning design and reliability of the ibwt project therefore analyzing the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the wsa has hugely significant in the ibwtwct model the copula function method jing et al 2018 is applied for analyzing the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the hjx shk and hh from the three dimensional contour map of runoff between hjx shk and hh the probability of various encounter combinations among the three reservoirs can be checked both intuitively and quantitatively as can be seen in fig 9 the probability of synchronous encounter between the two reservoirs is large with a relatively high correlation while the asynchronous probability is relatively low previous studies on the sae probability of rich poor runoff have tended to focus on the comparison between two objectives cui et al 2011 april zhao and zhang 2019 therefore this paper compares three objectives in two basins simultaneously table 4 shows the sae frequency of rich poor runoff for three reservoirs the total frequency of synchronous encounters of the three reservoirs is 64 31 with the highest frequency of 30 03 in the normal year in addition for ibwt projects each water source is most disadvantageous during the dry year the frequency reaching 16 02 the total asynchronous encounter frequency of the three reservoirs is 35 69 with the highest frequency of the5 normal normal dry combination hjx shk in the normal year hh in the dry year being 3 4 while the lowest frequency of the dry wet dry combination hjx hh in the dry year shk in the dry year is 0 02 affected by the short length of runoff series for each source there is a lack of combination in the actual sae combination including hjx and shk in the wet year and hh in the dry year in order to further analyze the maximum role of the connected tunnel in the water supply process three n n d combinations are selected in this study for comparative discussion as can be seen in fig 10 there are similar water supply laws for each of the three combinations hjx plays a significant role in water supply during the wet month satisfying the water demands of a and b at the same time and during the dry month shk makes full use of its regulation performance for supplying water to the two wras all three of these combinations are able to meet the total water demand in the 1969 combination the maximum water supply transferred by hjx and shk to b was 209 million m³ which accounts for 49 18 of the water demand of b and the water supply of shk reached 169 million m³ which accounts for 80 86 shk supplied water to a and b from november and the amount of water supply increased each month achieving a peak of 143 million m³ in may whereby 27 million m³ was supplied by shk to b which accounts for 18 88 of the total water supply for that month the above analysis demonstrates that the water supply effect of the connected tunnel is significant in the n n d combination basically satisfying the water demands of the two wras hjx plays a crucial water supply role during wet months and shk does so during dry months from the limited runoff series data it can be seen that the connected tunnel plays the role of water supply each month and water supply quantity increases gradually after the dry month the maximum water supply capacity is 209 million m³ making full use of the rich inflow of hjx and the great regulation performance of shk and satisfying the water demand of the two wras simultaneously 5 discussion the ibwt project aims to fulfill the water demand of the wra using the coordinated operation between reservoirs more effectively is the key for studying ibwt most previous ibwt research has focused on the operation mode of reservoirs in the wta ouyang et al 2020 gu et al 2017 this research also studied the water transfer mode of three reservoirs in two wtas but water sources such as reservoirs and groundwater in the wra also participate in the entire operation system therefore comprehensive consideration of the joint regulation of water sources in the wta and wra is more consistent with the actual ibwt situation there is also a time lag effect of water flow in the evolution of the water transmission network and its impact on water supply projects should be considered in future research so that the accuracy of ibwt projects on a smaller time scale can be improved the ibwt project fully exploits the abundance of water resources and the regulation performance of the reservoir in the wta which is helpful for improving the water transfer process and alleviating the water shortage in the wra research by sun et al 2021 showed that china s ibwt project has alleviated the water shortage of 53 of the population of the country ma et al 2021 demonstrated that the optimal operation method can be used for satisfying the water demand of the htwdp the results of that study are similar to those obtained in this paper based on tibwt this study established the ibwtwct model the results showing that the annual average water supply of the system has increased by 105 million m³ and the water supply assurance rate of the overall system has increased to 91 07 this demonstrates that the water transfer process between reservoirs has been optimized and provides a new operation mode for ibwt this operation mode is affected by the inflow from the wta to a certain extent during the dry year the water supply system cannot meet the water demand and tibwt has a greater likelihood of causing water supply damage under the same conditions which means that ibwtwct is superior to tibwt in every aspect sae probability study is an indispensable part of hydrological analysis gu et al 2018 proposed a hydraulic frequency analysis method that was based on the copula function for analyzing the possibility of drought synchronization huang et al 2015 compared the synchronization of the relationship between flood and drought in the wta using sae probability and analyzed the potential for hydrological compensation from the wta to the wra these research results are consistent with the content of this study to a certain extent by calculating the sae probability of rich poor runoff in the wta the synchronization of wet and dry years among the three reservoirs in the wta was found to be as high as 64 31 on this basis with a specific combination of the asynchronization of wet and dry years the ibwtwct provides the system with a maximum additional water supply of 209 million m³ optimizing the water transfer process however due to the impact of insufficient runoff series length and the high synchronous probability of wet and dry years in the wta further study of the maximum water supply function of the connected tunnel is required 6 conclusions ibwt projects have gradually become an effective means for solving the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources on a global scale tibwt projects are limited by existing projects and hydrological environment taking the htwdp in china as an example this study mainly discussed how the problem of insufficient water supply in wra could be alleviated through the existing conditions this research has clarified the relationship between the system nodes and based on the tibwt model the ibwtwct model was proposed and solved using the ga algorithm the results have verified the superiority of the ibwtwct model which is reflected in the effective mitigation of insufficient water supply and the effective improvement of the operation process the following are the main conclusions 1 following the application of the connected tunnel the water shortage in the two wras was effectively alleviated the annual average water deficit was reduced from 122 million m³ to 17 million m³ and the guarantee rate of water supply increased to 91 07 2 the connected tunnel fully utilizes the rich inflow of the hjx and the large regulation capacity of the shk it provides an annual average of 105 million m³ regulation capacity for the entire project and the water level fluctuation of the hh reservoir was effectively improved in terms of operation process 3 considering the influence of the sae of the water source the frequency of synchronous encounters of the three reservoirs is relatively high with the optimal operation of a long series of measured runoff data the connected tunnel plays a significant water regulation role in the normal normal dry hjx shk hh combination and the maximum amount of water that can be transferred to the wra is 209 million m³ more importantly the ibwtwct provides guidance for other water transfer projects and the alleviation of the phenomenon of water shortage in the wra that is caused by the conditions of the project generally the water transfer mode effectively improves water supply in the wra optimizes the ibwt operation process reduces project costs and improves water supply efficiency however certain limitations of this study need to be addressed firstly due to the lack of runoff data on time scale the water transfer capacity of the connected tunnel under extreme sae of rich poor runoff conditions could not be explored in addition the impact the connected tunnel has on the overall economic benefits of the project is also crucial therefore these aspects will be discussed in future research where it will be necessary to expand the length of the runoff series discuss the maximum effect the connected tunnel has on water supply improvement and further analyze the impact runoff uncertainty has on water supply efficiency and the economic benefits of ibwt credit authorship contribution statement

7783,study region the athabasca river basin arb canada study focus this study investigates the dynamic interactions that occur between surface water and groundwater systems within the athabasca river basin arb the integrated surface subsurface model of the arb was first calibrated under monthly normal transient flow conditions to observed surface water and groundwater data after which the model was forced with monthly average transient data to evaluate model performance from these results groundwater contribution to the athabasca river system was calculated using simulated surface water groundwater exchange fluxes these estimates are compared to those obtained from an isotope based balance analysis which also estimated groundwater contribution to the athabasca river new hydrological insights for the region the results from this study suggest that the groundwater system in the basin has a high degree of interaction with the surface water system specifically the groundwater contribution to the surface water system along the athabasca river ranges from 34 high flow season to 63 low flow season with an overall average annual groundwater contribution of 45 these results indicate that the groundwater system needs to be considered when analyzing potential climate change impacts on future water availability and extreme hydroclimatic events graphical abstract ga1 keywords athabasca river basin integrated hydrologic model surface water groundwater interaction parametric uncertainty groundwater contribution seasonal water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding and adequately representing the complex physical processes of water resource systems is key to developing policies for sustaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies there is a recognized need in the literature to assess the interaction between surface water and groundwater systems using an integrated approach chen et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 because the athabasca river basin arb located in alberta canada is of significant importance both environmentally and economically there have been numerous studies to characterize the physical chemical and ecological aspects of this region price et al 2005 lima and wrona 2019 a key research focus in the most recent decade has been the climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the water resources system in the arb lima and wrona 2019 because there are numerous factors affecting the water quantity and quality of the arb a holistic approach is essential to understanding complex and synergetic interactions between multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors ketcheson et al 2017 spennato et al 2018 lima and wrona 2019 volik et al 2020 gupta et al 2021 also emphasized the importance of using an integrated environmental modelling approach for estimating complex physicochemical and biological hydrologic conditions affected by climatic and anthropogenic stresses to date several studies have been conducted to gain further insight into the potential impact of both short and long term climate change on the hydrologic characteristics of the arb eum et al 2014 eum et al 2017 dibike et al 2018 dibike et al 2019 belvederesi et al 2020 recent studies have demonstrated that an integrated approach which combines both surface water and groundwater in a single analysis is necessary for evaluating the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic stressors on the water cycle erler et al 2019 erler et al 2019a b hwang et al 2019 boko et al 2020 chen et al 2020 persaud et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 xu et al 2020 additionally the important role of peatlands is also supported by other studies for example autio et al 2020 investigated the effect of peat characteristics e g geometry hydraulic conductivity hill slope etc on surface water and groundwater interactions using various conceptual models and concluded that the exchange of water between surface water and groundwater systems or exchange flux is highly affected by peat soil characteristics specifically the presence of peat changes the spatial distributions of surface water and groundwater interactions and peat hydraulic conductivity affects the exchange flux magnitudes because of the challenging characteristics of the arb basin scale surface water groundwater interactions have rarely been quantified recently hwang et al 2018 used a steady state integrated flow model of the arb to analyze long term water balance over the basin using a subbasin wise spatial water balance for land classification they suggested that the peatlands and forestlands over the arb play a key role in controlling the hydrologic processes of the surface subsurface system however the focus of the study was on steady state conditions which do not account for dynamic hydrologic and climatic conditions across the basin in addition gibson et al 2016 quantified the dynamic surface water groundwater interactions along the athabasca river and its tributaries using stable isotopes they found that spatiotemporal groundwater contribution to the rivers increases in the downstream region of the arb and as a result groundwater is a significant component of the surface water system therefore a transient basin scale model is necessary to quantify the surface water and groundwater interactions in the arb in this study based on the work by hwang et al 2018 we developed a transient integrated surface subsurface model of the arb to gain insight on basin scale dynamic interactions between the surface water and groundwater systems it is noted that an ensemble of 89 parameter sets was applied to evaluate the sensitivity of surface water and groundwater interactions by accounting for parametric uncertainty 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the arb is located in northern alberta canada and its area is approximately 160 000 km2 fig 1 the athabasca river is one of the longest undammed rivers in the world and flows from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountain to lake athabasca with an approximate length of 1200 km the hydrological processes in the arb are dominated by three factors topographic climatic and hydrogeologic characteristics the topographic changes in the upstream of the athabasca river are relatively large compared to its mid and downstream areas the arb is located in a cold continental climate region with large temperature changes between winter and summer and thus the dynamic seasonal climatic conditions play a significant role in the hydrology of the arb the stream flows in the arb are significantly affected by winter processes during the winter and spring periods as approximately one quarter of the average annual precipitation falls as snow eum et al 2017 eum and gupta 2019 for the hydrogeologic aspects wetlands including both mineral soil wetlands and peatlands in the arb are characterized by highly contrasting hydraulic conductivities with depths and types of wetlands such that wetlands also play an important role in the spatiotemporal interactions between the atmosphere surface water and groundwater systems price et al 2005 devito et al 2017 kettridge et al 2017 hokanson et al 2020 approximately 70 of the arb is covered by peatlands spatial density 20 tarnocai et al 2000 and thus wetlands can represent a key hydrogeologic feature of the arb additionally the alberta oil sand region in the arb is characterized by low density of sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost conditions which the hydrologic and hydrogeologic processes may be potentially affected by permafrost thaw vitt et al 2000 gibson et al 2019a b spence et al 2020 volik et al 2020 2 2 data set the arb model was forced with gridded climate data from the climate research unit cru dataset at 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 this dataset is entirely based on in situ observations e g rain gauges and among other variables provides total precipitation as well as potential evapotranspiration pet based on the penman monteith formulation harris et al 2014 2 3 athabasca river basin model the basin scale integrated surface subsurface model developed by hwang et al 2018 was used for this study fig 1 the subsurface domain of the arb consists of 12 geological units and topsoil units with 22 numerical layers the surface domain consists of five zones boreal uplands boreal foothills boreal mixedwood peatlands and water and the evapotranspiration et domain consists of three zones forestlands peatlands and water based on the calibrated steady state model developed by hwang et al 2018 we performed a total of 89 simulations based on a combination of parameter values related to topsoil and peatland hydraulic properties for variably saturated flow and evapotranspiration the topsoil and evapotranspiration parameter ranges obtained by hwang et al 2018 are presented in table 1 and were applied for 89 simulations other parameter values are the same as those suggested by hwang et al 2018 in this study the material zones important for surface water and groundwater interactions include mineral soils peats highly conductive zones and riverbed materials the mineral and peat soil parameters were determined based on studies from huang et al 2011 and rezanezhad et al 2012 respectively the hydraulic conductivities for the riverbeds and highly conductive zones are in ranges of 1 42 10 4 9 6 10 3 m s and 1 8 10 3 6 1 10 3 m s respectively the et parameters for the forestlands and peatlands are assigned based on huang et al 2011 and ala aho et al 2015 respectively the transpiration partitioning factors for the forestlands and peatlands controls the ratio of transpiration to evaporation as described in hwang et al 2018 the initial conditions of the arb model were set using dynamic equilibrium conditions which are the quasi steady state over monthly average transient flows from january to december the dynamic equilibrium was obtained through 50 year simulations with monthly normal forcing see next section it is noted that glacial melt river routing and transboundary groundwater flow were not considered in this study details on the boundary condition setup are in following sections 2 4 climate forcing and transient simulations the arb model was forced with gridded climate data from the climate research unit cru dataset at 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 in order to analyze seasonal and annual surface water and groundwater interactions in the arb we performed two types of time dependent simulations one with periodic monthly normal forcing representing an average seasonal cycle erler et al 2019 and one using transient monthly average climate forcings processed for a 15 year period from 1979 to 1993 the monthly normal forcing was prepared by averaging the climate data for each calendar months over 15 years from 1979 to 1993 because the monthly normal forcing can represent an average seasonal cycle at monthly sampling rate we used the forcing data to obtain the dynamic equilibrium conditions which are the quasi steady state over an average year at monthly sampling rate from january to december the fully transient monthly average climate forcing was prepared by averaging the climate data for each month over the simulation period resulting in a total of 180 spatially distributed forcing timesteps for each data type e g rainfall snowfall pet etc for the time dependent model calibration the transient simulations with monthly normal forcing were employed to calibrate the snowmelt contribution during the winter season and then we evaluated the overall performance of the model with the calibrated parameter sets provided by hwang et al 2018 for simulations with transient monthly average forcing we analyzed the validity of the transient flow model with the same parameter sets obtained from the monthly normal model calibration and investigated the characteristics of the hydrologic responses of the arb over the 15 year period 2 5 snowmelt and accumulation model snowmelt runoff in a permafrost region is a dominant hydrological mechanism that contributes to groundwater and the surface water flow systems carey and quinton 2004 gibson et al 2019a b snow accumulation and melt were computed on the basis of minimum and maximum temperatures and total precipitation using a simple temperature index model degree day because the cru dataset does not provide snowmelt or snow water equivalent in hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2020 hwang et al 2014 the spatiotemporal snow accumulation is modeled on the basis of mass conservation ignoring lateral snow transport the energy and mass balance of the snowpack at a grid point can be written as koren et al 1999 1 d m snow dt q snow μ snow q melt where m snow is the mass of the snowpack per unit area m l 2 q snow and μ snow represent the rates of snow or solid precipitation and sublimation per unit surface area m l 2 t 1 and q melt is the snow melt rate m l 2 t 1 at the base of the snowpack q melt is assumed to be linearly proportional to a melting constant or degree day factor for snowmelt η m l 2 k 1 t 1 importantly q melt can only occur as long as snow is on the ground m snow 0 and is otherwise zero furthermore the melt rate is also proportional to the difference between air temperature t air k and a threshold temperature t threshold k when t air t threshold and otherwise zero i e η 0 when t air t threshold 2 q melt η t air t threshold the winter process portion of the arb model was calibrated using eqs 1 and 2 in this study μ snow was neglected because hgs already has a similar loss factor in the form of surface evaporation which remains active despite the presence of snow cover the initial estimates of surface subsurface flow and evapotranspiration parameters for the arb model were obtained based on the steady state calibration results performed by hwang et al 2018 the cru monthly normal climate data i e total precipitation and temperature for the period from 1979 to 1993 were used for model calibration four gauging stations were obtained from the hydat 2010 surface water dataset jasper ja hinton ht athabasca at and fort mcmurray fm and were set as calibration targets see gauge stations in fig 2 for the purpose of snowmelt runoff modelling the simulation domain was split into two snowmelt zones of which zone 1 covers the ja to at sub basins and zone 2 covers the remaining area to the end of the arb fig 2 both zones have the same snowmelt properties except for the melting threshold temperature table 2 specifically the melting constants for both zones were set to 3 46 10 2 kg m 2 c 1 d 1 and the threshold temperature was chosen to be 2 5 c for snowmelt zone 1 and 1 0 c for snow melt zone 2 during the calibration of the temperature index snowmelt model the parameter values for the variably saturated flow and evapotranspiration models were the same as those used in hwang et al 2018 it is noted that the upstream and downstream snowmelt zones applied in this study are mainly for model calibration purpose but the different snowmelt zones indicate that the climatic and topographic factors in the upstream and downstream portions are different for example compared to the downstream zone the characteristics of the upstream region is mountainous topography and alpine hydrologic conditions dibike et al 2018 2 6 model performance evaluation the performance of the arb model with the monthly normal and monthly average forcings was evaluated using statistical methods including root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias which are described as 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q ˆ i 2 4 nse 1 i 1 n q i q ˆ i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 5 pbias i 1 n y i y ˆ i i 1 n y i 100 where n denotes the number of observation datasets y i is the observed value and y ˆ i is the corresponding simulated value at an observation point i q ˆ i and q i represent the simulated and observed data respectively q corresponds to the mean observation value rmse provides information on the level of overall agreement between simulations and observations in original measurement units nse provides an estimation error variance ranging generally from 0 to 1 nse 0 indicates that the simulation results are close to the mean of the observation data and nse 1 represents a perfect match of simulated flow to observation datasets pbias provides a percentage of a bias in simulation results compared to observations pbias 0 for no bias pbias 0 for overestimation and pbias 0 for underestimation of simulation results 3 results 3 1 monthly normal forcing simulation results with monthly normal forcing were compared to observed stream flows and groundwater depths at the upstream stations the simulated flow rates notably underestimated the amplitude of the differences between the low and high flow seasons however those in the downstream areas matched well with the observations and the arb model with monthly normal forcing was able to reproduce the seasonal variability of stream flows in addition the simulated groundwater table also matched well with the annual observed depths to the water table except for the oil sand mining areas because the mining operations were not accounted for in this study while there were some mismatches with the observed stream flows in the upstream areas the overall model performance of the integrated model was such that the seasonal water balance and spatial distribution of the ground water system in the basin were reproduced the detailed monthly normal simulation results are described in section 2 in the supporting information 3 2 monthly transient hydrologic responses similar to the monthly normal simulation results described in the supporting information there is a close agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs at the four stations while the hydrographs at ja and ht match only the seasonal cycle because they are not sensitive to year to year differences in the forcing data fig 3 specifically there is a slight overestimation during the low flow season and an underestimation during the high flow season however the timings of the simulated snowmelt runoff and seasonal peak stream flow match well with the observations during the simulation period fig 3 as described in the previous section the surface flow sensitivity to topsoil and et zone material properties during the low flow season is relatively low compared to the high flow season the simulated surface flow at ht also shows the similar seasonal cycle with relatively less variations during the low flow seasons in the midstream and downstream areas the simulated surface flow at at and fm shows more dynamic responses in the surface flow indicating that the sensitivity of surface flow to surface subsurface material properties is relatively high based on the simulation results one of the main reasons for this sensitive surface flow is that the water table in this area is shallow and thus changes in the material properties can lead to different hydrograph responses during the low flow season the river flow at at is somewhat overestimated by 30 40 but during high flow season the simulated flow matches the mean observed flow well table 3 lists the model performance for the monthly average forcing simulations these values represent averages over the simulation results of the parametric uncertainty analysis the rmse values for the stations increase with downstream distance from the headwaters the rmses at ja and ht are 61 6 m3 s and 112 4 m3 s respectively in the downstream areas rmse for at and fm increase to 277 7 m3 s and 322 5 m3 s respectively the pbias of the simulated hydrographs is 3 1 at ja 2 1 at ht 43 5 at at and 29 3 at fm which indicates that there is an overestimation overall and the degree of the overestimation at at is larger compared to the other stations additionally nse at each station ranges from 0 42 to 0 55 the nse values in the upstream stations are 0 55 while those for the downstream area are slightly lower however the nse value at all stations is 0 65 indicating that the arb model with the overall et and material property parameter sets are more or less acceptable it is noted that total nse is higher than that at each station because the variance of all the observed data increases much greater than the error variance between the observed and simulated data based on the stream flow comparison the mean stream flow simulations over the surface subsurface parameter sets match well with the mean observations however the differences in seasonal hydrologic responses suggest that seasonal water balance based on the cru datasets does not reflect hydrological processes in the upstream and midstream areas specifically in the rocky mountains ja and ht and foothills at a more sophisticated snowmelt model and intra annual freeze thaw cycles during the winter period may be required for improving the hydrologic and hydrogeological responses in the arb additionally it is also likely that there are biases and interpolation errors in the cru datasets over the rocky mountains for example no temperature lapse rate adjustment has been performed over topography it is noted that there are several limitations on this model although the integrated surface subsurface flow model of the arb has been calibrated and validated with the monthly normal and monthly average transient flow conditions the model performance in the upstream is relatively low compared to that in the downstream due to several limitations related to the model representation observation data and freeze thaw process 1 relatively low model resolution is not able to capture detailed local scale processes in the mountainous areas as well as the regional uplands such as caribou birch muskeg and stony mountains 2 hydrologic hydrogeologic information in head water area is limited which reduces the ability to calibrate the hydrogeologic model and climate conditions in the area and 3 the simulated stream flow does not account for soil freeze thaw process and therefore there are notable differences between the simulated and observed stream flow in the upstream stations 3 3 characteristics of transient flow conditions transient surface water and groundwater flow characteristics were analyzed using all simulations performed for the uncertainty analysis the spatial distribution of depth to groundwater and evapotranspiration conditions were analyzed with respect to the averages of annual flow and low and high flow seasons 3 3 1 groundwater system fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the mean depth to the water table for the average annual condition fig 4a and differences in depth to water table between the average annual and low flow season fig 4b and high flow season fig 4c the average annual mean depth to the water table shown in fig 4a ranges approximately from 0 to 200 m with the upstream area having deeper water table conditions than the downstream area in the rocky mountains area the simulated water table depth increases up to 200 m because the topographic relief is high relative to model resolution which may affect the accuracy of the water table location however except for this the groundwater system in mountain valley areas is simulated with a mean depth of 11 m the standard deviation of the water table depth in this area ranges approximately from 0 to 2 m with lake and stream areas having almost static conditions and hill slope and near stream areas have relatively large groundwater level changes σ 2 m in the midstream area the maximum water table depth in the high elevation regions is approximately 150 m which is similar to that in the upstream area but the change in the water table is relatively low i e σ 0 5 m the stream and near stream areas in the midstream region show similar means and standard deviations of water table depths in the downstream areas the water table depths are shallower than the upstream areas due mainly to the relatively flat topography spatially it is noted that the groundwater depths in the peatlands are shallower than those in other topsoil types such as mineral soils because of topographic and hydrogeologic factors 1 peatlands tend to form in conditions where the water table is at or near surface and the topography is flat and 2 the hydraulic conductivities of the peatlands below 0 5 m are relatively lower than those of the mineral topsoil similar to the average annual water table depth distributions the simulation results of the low fig 4b and high flow fig 4c seasons show that the water table differences between the average annual and low and high flow seasons are less than a mean of 0 5 m over the domain which indicates that the seasonal variability of the groundwater levels is minor it is noted that the water table changes along the rivers in the domain are relatively high due mainly to relatively high conductivities assigned to the rivers and their riparian zones for both low and high flow seasons the water table changes in the upstream areas are also relatively greater than those in the mid and downstream areas due mainly to snow accumulation and melt effects additionally in the downstream areas the temporal water table change is minor because of the relatively shallow groundwater system with the water table depth change being less than 0 5 m except for the stream areas 3 3 2 evapotranspiration the simulated mean actual evapotranspiration aet for the average annual condition ranges from approximately 50 to 650 mm y fig 5a spatially relatively low aet 100 mm y was simulated around riparian zones along the mid and downstream of the athabasca river because the mean groundwater table depths in the areas are relatively deep compared to the surrounding areas however it is noted that the low aet simulated around the riparian zones may not be realistic if the actual groundwater levels near the area are shallower than the simulated ones the inter annual variation of the simulated aet is approximately 50 mm y on the other hand relatively high aet 600 mm y is simulated along the athabasca river and lakes with an inter annual variation of 300 400 mm y because of high inter annual variability in pet based on the simulated mean aet the rivers and water bodies in the arb have relatively high dynamic responses to the evapotranspiration conditions compared to the riparian zones the mean aet rate over the basin ranges from 190 mm y for the low flow season to 490 mm y for the high flow season for both low and high flow seasons the aet tends to increase from the upstream jasper and hinton to mid and downstream areas athabasca and fort mcmurray of the basin the lower aet in the alpine headwater region is primarily derived from lower pet while in the mid to downstream areas it is mainly driven by water availability both surface water and groundwater relatively low aet occurs consistently along the riparian zones of the rivers due mainly to the deep water table similarly relatively high aet occurs mainly around ponding and peatlands areas where the surface water is relatively deep or the water table is close to the ground surface 3 3 3 surface water groundwater interactions the interactions between surface water and groundwater over the arb are represented by the spatial distributions of the net exchange flux and their seasonal changes as shown in fig 6 the net exchange flux was obtained by taking the difference between the exchange flux and the actual evapotranspiration the net exchange flux consists of two components net infiltration or water recharging the subsurface infiltration minus surface evaporation negative sign red and net exfiltration or groundwater discharging to surface exfiltration minus subsurface evaporation and transpiration positive sign blue and the strength of each flux is represented by the darkness of each color for example dark red and dark blue correspond to high infiltration and exfiltration fluxes compared to light red and light blue colors respectively the average annual mean net exchange fluxes over the simulation period are shown in fig 6a the exfiltration fluxes are mostly dominant along the athabasca river and its branches while the infiltration fluxes are dominant in the other areas such as uplands in the forest areas see also the inset of fig 6a there is a correlation between the magnitude of the exchange flux and its variability specifically seasonal variations in the vicinity of the rivers including the riparian zones are relatively high due to changes in infiltration and exfiltration conditions the spatial distribution of the mean net exchange fluxes for the low fig 6b and high fig 6c flow seasons is similar to that of the average annual result but there are clear differences in the magnitudes of the mean net exchange fluxes between the low and high flow seasons although there are slight differences in the magnitudes and spatial distributions of the infiltration areas the mean net infiltration rates in the lakes and ponding areas during the low and high flow seasons range approximately from 0 to 300 mm y which suggests that the groundwater recharge in these areas is constant over the annual cycle regarding the seasonal differences in the infiltration fluxes the magnitude of fluxes in the infiltration areas is significantly larger during the high flow season than the low flow season these relatively large seasonal variations in infiltration are likely the result of the seasonal pattern of precipitation in the upland areas and the lack of variation in the lowland areas is likely due to saturation excess 3 3 4 groundwater contribution the groundwater contribution to surface water flow was quantified using the net exfiltration fluxes or groundwater seepage along the athabasca river it is noted that the net exfiltration fluxes at some river nodes are about one order of magnitude higher than those at their upstream and downstream river nodes due to the relatively low mesh resolution i e 1 5 km compared to the average resolution i e 0 5 km the low resolution can cause drastic changes in topographic elevations between their surrounding nodes e g rivers and riparian zones and large influential areas that are accounted for in computing the groundwater contributions therefore in order to avoid drastic changes in the groundwater contributions net exfiltration fluxes that change greater than one order of magnitude were excluded from the groundwater contribution analysis additionally because of being a snapshot in time the net exfiltration flux along the river course was not tracked from origin to discharge and thus the groundwater contribution estimates suggested in this study may contain uncertainty fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of river flow blue and groundwater seepage red rates along the length of the athabasca river the annual rates of the river flow and groundwater seepage rates are shown in fig 7a the simulated mean annual river flow and groundwater seepage gradually increase with distance from the headwaters at the athabasca river confluence areas such as near athabasca and fort mcmurray both surface flow and groundwater seepage rates increase drastically due to the inflows from the tributaries such as the mcleod pembina lesser slave christina and clearwater rivers see fig 7d the mean total rates for river flow and groundwater seepage are 878 σ 495 and 395 σ 128 m3 s at the end of the athabasca river respectively groundwater seepage represents 45 of the mean river flow with an annual variation of 15 indicating that the groundwater seepage is more or less static compared to the changes in river flows over the simulation period it is also noted that the lower standard deviation of the river flow in the mid and downstream areas is equal to or slightly lower than the upper standard deviation of the groundwater seepage this indicates that groundwater contribution to the athabasca river can be significant during dry conditions similarly during the low flow season fig 7b the mean groundwater seepage contribution to the river flow is 63 of the mean surface flow 561 m3 s and its standard deviation is 18 of the mean river flow which indicates that the groundwater seepage contribution ratio is greater during the low flow season than the rest of the year during the high flow season fig 7c the mean and standard deviation of the surface flow are about two times greater than those of the low flow season the mean groundwater seepage rate at the end of the river is about 34 of its corresponding mean river flow rate 1322 m3 s the ratio of the standard deviation of the groundwater seepage to the mean river flow is aproximately 10 which is about two times lower than that for the low flow season 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal water balance analysis in order to characterize the average annual water balance conditions over the arb the aridity index ai ratio of liquid forcing to pet and actual aridity index aai ratio of liquid forcing to aet were compared based on the average annual condition the average annual ai shown in fig 8a ranges approximately from 0 7 in ea to 1 6 in ja based on the sub basin average ai the spatial distribution of ai tends to decrease with distance downstream of ja with a basin average ai of approximately 1 6 in the ja and ht sub basins the average ai values are greater than 1 2 indicating that these sub basins are in wet conditions with liquid water forcing being more than 20 greater than pet in the downstream areas including the wf at fm and ea sub basins the water balance changes to drier conditions with the sub basin average ai decreasing from 0 89 in wf to 0 66 in ea the main reason for this is a decrease of precipitation and increase of pet in the downstream area for the average annual aai shown in fig 8b the overall basin average aai is approximately 1 9 indicating that wet conditions are prevalent over the arb the ja ht and wf sub basins are in highly wet conditions with a sub basin average aai of greater than 2 0 although the downstream regions below wf are partly in drier conditions in the lake and peatland areas the sub basin average aai in ea is higher than 1 7 which indicates water surplus conditions overall the spatial trends of aai are similar to those of ai such that sub basin average aai decreases in the downstream regions with a range of from 3 92 in ja to 1 74 in ea however the spatial distribution of aai values is significantly different from that of ai because of the simulated aet being about 40 of pet and following a spatial pattern associated with wetlands and drainage patterns 4 2 comparison of groundwater contributions to athabasca river the estimated groundwater contributions to river flow were compared to gibson et al 2016 who quantified the groundwater contribution to the athabasca river using hydrograph separations based on a stable isotope mass balance model table 4 lists the seasonal and annual groundwater contributions at the at and fm stations in this study the estimated groundwater contribution ratios at at range from 29 for the high flow season to 52 for the low flow season with an annual ratio of 38 however those at the fm station increase only by 2 7 due to surface water input from the clearwater river which is a surface water dominated tributary gibson et al 2016 in comparison gibson et al 2016 suggested that the annual groundwater contribution to river flow ranges from 39 at fm to 45 at at and those for low and high flow seasons are in a range of 37 5 at fm to 47 at at our estimated annual groundwater contribution ratios based on the monthly average simulations tend to be slightly underestimated by 7 18 during the high flow season and overestimated by 10 22 during the low flow season compared to those suggested by gibson et al 2016 the ranges of the seasonal groundwater contributions are relatively greater in this study due mainly to the uncertainty associated with the various model parameter settings used here however the annual groundwater contribution ratios at at and fm are in a similar range with those reported by gibson et al 2016 and therefore both estimation results indicate that groundwater contribution to the athabasca river is significant and groundwater can be an important water source for surface flow during extremely dry conditions 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated the dynamic interaction between the surface water and groundwater systems of the arb using a fully integrated surface subsurface model the performance of the integrated model was first evaluated under periodic monthly normal forcings and then seasonal and annual surface water and groundwater interactions were quantified using monthly average climate forcing from 1979 to 1993 in order to account for uncertainty in the surface subsurface model parameterization an ensemble of 89 input parameter sets obtained from a steady state arb model was applied to examine model sensitivity of topsoil layer parameters where surface water and groundwater interactions are expected to be highly sensitive in order to evaluate transient hydrologic processes of the surface subsurface flow system we performed simulations with monthly average flows for 15 years from 1979 to 1993 as in the monthly normal simulations the amplitude of seasonal variability in simulated surface water flow at the upstream gauge stations was overestimated during low flow conditions and underestimated during high flow conditions however the snowmelt runoff and seasonal flow peak times matched well with the observations in the downstream areas there was also close agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs as well as snowmelt and peak flow timings based on the transient simulation results with interannual variability it was found that groundwater seepage is an important source to the athabasca river the estimated inter seasonal groundwater contribution ratios ranged from 34 to 63 with an average annual ratio of 45 it is noted that the estimated annual groundwater contribution ratios are in a similar range as those suggested based on isotope water balance analysis gibson et al 2016 although the estimated ranges are somewhat larger this is likely related to the relatively large uncertainty associated with the temporal aggregation of the climate data and the physical parameters used in the ensemble arb model simulations nevertheless both integrated modelling and isotope analysis confirm that the groundwater contribution along the athabasca river is significant and thus the groundwater system plays a role in sustaining environmental flow during dry flow periods the simulated stream flows in the mid and downstream areas of the arb model were more responsive during the sensitivity analysis as compared to the upstream stations the stream flow variations for mid and downstream areas were computed to be much larger during the high flow seasons than those during the low flow seasons parameter sensitivity during the high flow seasons was found to be high andprovided better constraints to the range of possible topsoil property values for the surface flow model on the other hand relatively low sensitivities estimated during the low flow seasons over the basin suggested that improved model physics are required for enhancing the model performance in particular including the physics of seasonal freeze thaw cycles may be necessary to reproduce low stream flows during the winter and spring seasons furthermore higher resolution climate forcing that includes an altitude dependent temperature lapse rate correction as well as a physics based snow model will significantly improve the simulations in the upstream areas credit

7783,study region the athabasca river basin arb canada study focus this study investigates the dynamic interactions that occur between surface water and groundwater systems within the athabasca river basin arb the integrated surface subsurface model of the arb was first calibrated under monthly normal transient flow conditions to observed surface water and groundwater data after which the model was forced with monthly average transient data to evaluate model performance from these results groundwater contribution to the athabasca river system was calculated using simulated surface water groundwater exchange fluxes these estimates are compared to those obtained from an isotope based balance analysis which also estimated groundwater contribution to the athabasca river new hydrological insights for the region the results from this study suggest that the groundwater system in the basin has a high degree of interaction with the surface water system specifically the groundwater contribution to the surface water system along the athabasca river ranges from 34 high flow season to 63 low flow season with an overall average annual groundwater contribution of 45 these results indicate that the groundwater system needs to be considered when analyzing potential climate change impacts on future water availability and extreme hydroclimatic events graphical abstract ga1 keywords athabasca river basin integrated hydrologic model surface water groundwater interaction parametric uncertainty groundwater contribution seasonal water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction understanding and adequately representing the complex physical processes of water resource systems is key to developing policies for sustaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies there is a recognized need in the literature to assess the interaction between surface water and groundwater systems using an integrated approach chen et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 because the athabasca river basin arb located in alberta canada is of significant importance both environmentally and economically there have been numerous studies to characterize the physical chemical and ecological aspects of this region price et al 2005 lima and wrona 2019 a key research focus in the most recent decade has been the climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the water resources system in the arb lima and wrona 2019 because there are numerous factors affecting the water quantity and quality of the arb a holistic approach is essential to understanding complex and synergetic interactions between multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors ketcheson et al 2017 spennato et al 2018 lima and wrona 2019 volik et al 2020 gupta et al 2021 also emphasized the importance of using an integrated environmental modelling approach for estimating complex physicochemical and biological hydrologic conditions affected by climatic and anthropogenic stresses to date several studies have been conducted to gain further insight into the potential impact of both short and long term climate change on the hydrologic characteristics of the arb eum et al 2014 eum et al 2017 dibike et al 2018 dibike et al 2019 belvederesi et al 2020 recent studies have demonstrated that an integrated approach which combines both surface water and groundwater in a single analysis is necessary for evaluating the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic stressors on the water cycle erler et al 2019 erler et al 2019a b hwang et al 2019 boko et al 2020 chen et al 2020 persaud et al 2020 simmons et al 2020 xu et al 2020 additionally the important role of peatlands is also supported by other studies for example autio et al 2020 investigated the effect of peat characteristics e g geometry hydraulic conductivity hill slope etc on surface water and groundwater interactions using various conceptual models and concluded that the exchange of water between surface water and groundwater systems or exchange flux is highly affected by peat soil characteristics specifically the presence of peat changes the spatial distributions of surface water and groundwater interactions and peat hydraulic conductivity affects the exchange flux magnitudes because of the challenging characteristics of the arb basin scale surface water groundwater interactions have rarely been quantified recently hwang et al 2018 used a steady state integrated flow model of the arb to analyze long term water balance over the basin using a subbasin wise spatial water balance for land classification they suggested that the peatlands and forestlands over the arb play a key role in controlling the hydrologic processes of the surface subsurface system however the focus of the study was on steady state conditions which do not account for dynamic hydrologic and climatic conditions across the basin in addition gibson et al 2016 quantified the dynamic surface water groundwater interactions along the athabasca river and its tributaries using stable isotopes they found that spatiotemporal groundwater contribution to the rivers increases in the downstream region of the arb and as a result groundwater is a significant component of the surface water system therefore a transient basin scale model is necessary to quantify the surface water and groundwater interactions in the arb in this study based on the work by hwang et al 2018 we developed a transient integrated surface subsurface model of the arb to gain insight on basin scale dynamic interactions between the surface water and groundwater systems it is noted that an ensemble of 89 parameter sets was applied to evaluate the sensitivity of surface water and groundwater interactions by accounting for parametric uncertainty 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the arb is located in northern alberta canada and its area is approximately 160 000 km2 fig 1 the athabasca river is one of the longest undammed rivers in the world and flows from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountain to lake athabasca with an approximate length of 1200 km the hydrological processes in the arb are dominated by three factors topographic climatic and hydrogeologic characteristics the topographic changes in the upstream of the athabasca river are relatively large compared to its mid and downstream areas the arb is located in a cold continental climate region with large temperature changes between winter and summer and thus the dynamic seasonal climatic conditions play a significant role in the hydrology of the arb the stream flows in the arb are significantly affected by winter processes during the winter and spring periods as approximately one quarter of the average annual precipitation falls as snow eum et al 2017 eum and gupta 2019 for the hydrogeologic aspects wetlands including both mineral soil wetlands and peatlands in the arb are characterized by highly contrasting hydraulic conductivities with depths and types of wetlands such that wetlands also play an important role in the spatiotemporal interactions between the atmosphere surface water and groundwater systems price et al 2005 devito et al 2017 kettridge et al 2017 hokanson et al 2020 approximately 70 of the arb is covered by peatlands spatial density 20 tarnocai et al 2000 and thus wetlands can represent a key hydrogeologic feature of the arb additionally the alberta oil sand region in the arb is characterized by low density of sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost conditions which the hydrologic and hydrogeologic processes may be potentially affected by permafrost thaw vitt et al 2000 gibson et al 2019a b spence et al 2020 volik et al 2020 2 2 data set the arb model was forced with gridded climate data from the climate research unit cru dataset at 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 this dataset is entirely based on in situ observations e g rain gauges and among other variables provides total precipitation as well as potential evapotranspiration pet based on the penman monteith formulation harris et al 2014 2 3 athabasca river basin model the basin scale integrated surface subsurface model developed by hwang et al 2018 was used for this study fig 1 the subsurface domain of the arb consists of 12 geological units and topsoil units with 22 numerical layers the surface domain consists of five zones boreal uplands boreal foothills boreal mixedwood peatlands and water and the evapotranspiration et domain consists of three zones forestlands peatlands and water based on the calibrated steady state model developed by hwang et al 2018 we performed a total of 89 simulations based on a combination of parameter values related to topsoil and peatland hydraulic properties for variably saturated flow and evapotranspiration the topsoil and evapotranspiration parameter ranges obtained by hwang et al 2018 are presented in table 1 and were applied for 89 simulations other parameter values are the same as those suggested by hwang et al 2018 in this study the material zones important for surface water and groundwater interactions include mineral soils peats highly conductive zones and riverbed materials the mineral and peat soil parameters were determined based on studies from huang et al 2011 and rezanezhad et al 2012 respectively the hydraulic conductivities for the riverbeds and highly conductive zones are in ranges of 1 42 10 4 9 6 10 3 m s and 1 8 10 3 6 1 10 3 m s respectively the et parameters for the forestlands and peatlands are assigned based on huang et al 2011 and ala aho et al 2015 respectively the transpiration partitioning factors for the forestlands and peatlands controls the ratio of transpiration to evaporation as described in hwang et al 2018 the initial conditions of the arb model were set using dynamic equilibrium conditions which are the quasi steady state over monthly average transient flows from january to december the dynamic equilibrium was obtained through 50 year simulations with monthly normal forcing see next section it is noted that glacial melt river routing and transboundary groundwater flow were not considered in this study details on the boundary condition setup are in following sections 2 4 climate forcing and transient simulations the arb model was forced with gridded climate data from the climate research unit cru dataset at 0 5 degree resolution harris et al 2014 in order to analyze seasonal and annual surface water and groundwater interactions in the arb we performed two types of time dependent simulations one with periodic monthly normal forcing representing an average seasonal cycle erler et al 2019 and one using transient monthly average climate forcings processed for a 15 year period from 1979 to 1993 the monthly normal forcing was prepared by averaging the climate data for each calendar months over 15 years from 1979 to 1993 because the monthly normal forcing can represent an average seasonal cycle at monthly sampling rate we used the forcing data to obtain the dynamic equilibrium conditions which are the quasi steady state over an average year at monthly sampling rate from january to december the fully transient monthly average climate forcing was prepared by averaging the climate data for each month over the simulation period resulting in a total of 180 spatially distributed forcing timesteps for each data type e g rainfall snowfall pet etc for the time dependent model calibration the transient simulations with monthly normal forcing were employed to calibrate the snowmelt contribution during the winter season and then we evaluated the overall performance of the model with the calibrated parameter sets provided by hwang et al 2018 for simulations with transient monthly average forcing we analyzed the validity of the transient flow model with the same parameter sets obtained from the monthly normal model calibration and investigated the characteristics of the hydrologic responses of the arb over the 15 year period 2 5 snowmelt and accumulation model snowmelt runoff in a permafrost region is a dominant hydrological mechanism that contributes to groundwater and the surface water flow systems carey and quinton 2004 gibson et al 2019a b snow accumulation and melt were computed on the basis of minimum and maximum temperatures and total precipitation using a simple temperature index model degree day because the cru dataset does not provide snowmelt or snow water equivalent in hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2020 hwang et al 2014 the spatiotemporal snow accumulation is modeled on the basis of mass conservation ignoring lateral snow transport the energy and mass balance of the snowpack at a grid point can be written as koren et al 1999 1 d m snow dt q snow μ snow q melt where m snow is the mass of the snowpack per unit area m l 2 q snow and μ snow represent the rates of snow or solid precipitation and sublimation per unit surface area m l 2 t 1 and q melt is the snow melt rate m l 2 t 1 at the base of the snowpack q melt is assumed to be linearly proportional to a melting constant or degree day factor for snowmelt η m l 2 k 1 t 1 importantly q melt can only occur as long as snow is on the ground m snow 0 and is otherwise zero furthermore the melt rate is also proportional to the difference between air temperature t air k and a threshold temperature t threshold k when t air t threshold and otherwise zero i e η 0 when t air t threshold 2 q melt η t air t threshold the winter process portion of the arb model was calibrated using eqs 1 and 2 in this study μ snow was neglected because hgs already has a similar loss factor in the form of surface evaporation which remains active despite the presence of snow cover the initial estimates of surface subsurface flow and evapotranspiration parameters for the arb model were obtained based on the steady state calibration results performed by hwang et al 2018 the cru monthly normal climate data i e total precipitation and temperature for the period from 1979 to 1993 were used for model calibration four gauging stations were obtained from the hydat 2010 surface water dataset jasper ja hinton ht athabasca at and fort mcmurray fm and were set as calibration targets see gauge stations in fig 2 for the purpose of snowmelt runoff modelling the simulation domain was split into two snowmelt zones of which zone 1 covers the ja to at sub basins and zone 2 covers the remaining area to the end of the arb fig 2 both zones have the same snowmelt properties except for the melting threshold temperature table 2 specifically the melting constants for both zones were set to 3 46 10 2 kg m 2 c 1 d 1 and the threshold temperature was chosen to be 2 5 c for snowmelt zone 1 and 1 0 c for snow melt zone 2 during the calibration of the temperature index snowmelt model the parameter values for the variably saturated flow and evapotranspiration models were the same as those used in hwang et al 2018 it is noted that the upstream and downstream snowmelt zones applied in this study are mainly for model calibration purpose but the different snowmelt zones indicate that the climatic and topographic factors in the upstream and downstream portions are different for example compared to the downstream zone the characteristics of the upstream region is mountainous topography and alpine hydrologic conditions dibike et al 2018 2 6 model performance evaluation the performance of the arb model with the monthly normal and monthly average forcings was evaluated using statistical methods including root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias which are described as 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q ˆ i 2 4 nse 1 i 1 n q i q ˆ i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 5 pbias i 1 n y i y ˆ i i 1 n y i 100 where n denotes the number of observation datasets y i is the observed value and y ˆ i is the corresponding simulated value at an observation point i q ˆ i and q i represent the simulated and observed data respectively q corresponds to the mean observation value rmse provides information on the level of overall agreement between simulations and observations in original measurement units nse provides an estimation error variance ranging generally from 0 to 1 nse 0 indicates that the simulation results are close to the mean of the observation data and nse 1 represents a perfect match of simulated flow to observation datasets pbias provides a percentage of a bias in simulation results compared to observations pbias 0 for no bias pbias 0 for overestimation and pbias 0 for underestimation of simulation results 3 results 3 1 monthly normal forcing simulation results with monthly normal forcing were compared to observed stream flows and groundwater depths at the upstream stations the simulated flow rates notably underestimated the amplitude of the differences between the low and high flow seasons however those in the downstream areas matched well with the observations and the arb model with monthly normal forcing was able to reproduce the seasonal variability of stream flows in addition the simulated groundwater table also matched well with the annual observed depths to the water table except for the oil sand mining areas because the mining operations were not accounted for in this study while there were some mismatches with the observed stream flows in the upstream areas the overall model performance of the integrated model was such that the seasonal water balance and spatial distribution of the ground water system in the basin were reproduced the detailed monthly normal simulation results are described in section 2 in the supporting information 3 2 monthly transient hydrologic responses similar to the monthly normal simulation results described in the supporting information there is a close agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs at the four stations while the hydrographs at ja and ht match only the seasonal cycle because they are not sensitive to year to year differences in the forcing data fig 3 specifically there is a slight overestimation during the low flow season and an underestimation during the high flow season however the timings of the simulated snowmelt runoff and seasonal peak stream flow match well with the observations during the simulation period fig 3 as described in the previous section the surface flow sensitivity to topsoil and et zone material properties during the low flow season is relatively low compared to the high flow season the simulated surface flow at ht also shows the similar seasonal cycle with relatively less variations during the low flow seasons in the midstream and downstream areas the simulated surface flow at at and fm shows more dynamic responses in the surface flow indicating that the sensitivity of surface flow to surface subsurface material properties is relatively high based on the simulation results one of the main reasons for this sensitive surface flow is that the water table in this area is shallow and thus changes in the material properties can lead to different hydrograph responses during the low flow season the river flow at at is somewhat overestimated by 30 40 but during high flow season the simulated flow matches the mean observed flow well table 3 lists the model performance for the monthly average forcing simulations these values represent averages over the simulation results of the parametric uncertainty analysis the rmse values for the stations increase with downstream distance from the headwaters the rmses at ja and ht are 61 6 m3 s and 112 4 m3 s respectively in the downstream areas rmse for at and fm increase to 277 7 m3 s and 322 5 m3 s respectively the pbias of the simulated hydrographs is 3 1 at ja 2 1 at ht 43 5 at at and 29 3 at fm which indicates that there is an overestimation overall and the degree of the overestimation at at is larger compared to the other stations additionally nse at each station ranges from 0 42 to 0 55 the nse values in the upstream stations are 0 55 while those for the downstream area are slightly lower however the nse value at all stations is 0 65 indicating that the arb model with the overall et and material property parameter sets are more or less acceptable it is noted that total nse is higher than that at each station because the variance of all the observed data increases much greater than the error variance between the observed and simulated data based on the stream flow comparison the mean stream flow simulations over the surface subsurface parameter sets match well with the mean observations however the differences in seasonal hydrologic responses suggest that seasonal water balance based on the cru datasets does not reflect hydrological processes in the upstream and midstream areas specifically in the rocky mountains ja and ht and foothills at a more sophisticated snowmelt model and intra annual freeze thaw cycles during the winter period may be required for improving the hydrologic and hydrogeological responses in the arb additionally it is also likely that there are biases and interpolation errors in the cru datasets over the rocky mountains for example no temperature lapse rate adjustment has been performed over topography it is noted that there are several limitations on this model although the integrated surface subsurface flow model of the arb has been calibrated and validated with the monthly normal and monthly average transient flow conditions the model performance in the upstream is relatively low compared to that in the downstream due to several limitations related to the model representation observation data and freeze thaw process 1 relatively low model resolution is not able to capture detailed local scale processes in the mountainous areas as well as the regional uplands such as caribou birch muskeg and stony mountains 2 hydrologic hydrogeologic information in head water area is limited which reduces the ability to calibrate the hydrogeologic model and climate conditions in the area and 3 the simulated stream flow does not account for soil freeze thaw process and therefore there are notable differences between the simulated and observed stream flow in the upstream stations 3 3 characteristics of transient flow conditions transient surface water and groundwater flow characteristics were analyzed using all simulations performed for the uncertainty analysis the spatial distribution of depth to groundwater and evapotranspiration conditions were analyzed with respect to the averages of annual flow and low and high flow seasons 3 3 1 groundwater system fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the mean depth to the water table for the average annual condition fig 4a and differences in depth to water table between the average annual and low flow season fig 4b and high flow season fig 4c the average annual mean depth to the water table shown in fig 4a ranges approximately from 0 to 200 m with the upstream area having deeper water table conditions than the downstream area in the rocky mountains area the simulated water table depth increases up to 200 m because the topographic relief is high relative to model resolution which may affect the accuracy of the water table location however except for this the groundwater system in mountain valley areas is simulated with a mean depth of 11 m the standard deviation of the water table depth in this area ranges approximately from 0 to 2 m with lake and stream areas having almost static conditions and hill slope and near stream areas have relatively large groundwater level changes σ 2 m in the midstream area the maximum water table depth in the high elevation regions is approximately 150 m which is similar to that in the upstream area but the change in the water table is relatively low i e σ 0 5 m the stream and near stream areas in the midstream region show similar means and standard deviations of water table depths in the downstream areas the water table depths are shallower than the upstream areas due mainly to the relatively flat topography spatially it is noted that the groundwater depths in the peatlands are shallower than those in other topsoil types such as mineral soils because of topographic and hydrogeologic factors 1 peatlands tend to form in conditions where the water table is at or near surface and the topography is flat and 2 the hydraulic conductivities of the peatlands below 0 5 m are relatively lower than those of the mineral topsoil similar to the average annual water table depth distributions the simulation results of the low fig 4b and high flow fig 4c seasons show that the water table differences between the average annual and low and high flow seasons are less than a mean of 0 5 m over the domain which indicates that the seasonal variability of the groundwater levels is minor it is noted that the water table changes along the rivers in the domain are relatively high due mainly to relatively high conductivities assigned to the rivers and their riparian zones for both low and high flow seasons the water table changes in the upstream areas are also relatively greater than those in the mid and downstream areas due mainly to snow accumulation and melt effects additionally in the downstream areas the temporal water table change is minor because of the relatively shallow groundwater system with the water table depth change being less than 0 5 m except for the stream areas 3 3 2 evapotranspiration the simulated mean actual evapotranspiration aet for the average annual condition ranges from approximately 50 to 650 mm y fig 5a spatially relatively low aet 100 mm y was simulated around riparian zones along the mid and downstream of the athabasca river because the mean groundwater table depths in the areas are relatively deep compared to the surrounding areas however it is noted that the low aet simulated around the riparian zones may not be realistic if the actual groundwater levels near the area are shallower than the simulated ones the inter annual variation of the simulated aet is approximately 50 mm y on the other hand relatively high aet 600 mm y is simulated along the athabasca river and lakes with an inter annual variation of 300 400 mm y because of high inter annual variability in pet based on the simulated mean aet the rivers and water bodies in the arb have relatively high dynamic responses to the evapotranspiration conditions compared to the riparian zones the mean aet rate over the basin ranges from 190 mm y for the low flow season to 490 mm y for the high flow season for both low and high flow seasons the aet tends to increase from the upstream jasper and hinton to mid and downstream areas athabasca and fort mcmurray of the basin the lower aet in the alpine headwater region is primarily derived from lower pet while in the mid to downstream areas it is mainly driven by water availability both surface water and groundwater relatively low aet occurs consistently along the riparian zones of the rivers due mainly to the deep water table similarly relatively high aet occurs mainly around ponding and peatlands areas where the surface water is relatively deep or the water table is close to the ground surface 3 3 3 surface water groundwater interactions the interactions between surface water and groundwater over the arb are represented by the spatial distributions of the net exchange flux and their seasonal changes as shown in fig 6 the net exchange flux was obtained by taking the difference between the exchange flux and the actual evapotranspiration the net exchange flux consists of two components net infiltration or water recharging the subsurface infiltration minus surface evaporation negative sign red and net exfiltration or groundwater discharging to surface exfiltration minus subsurface evaporation and transpiration positive sign blue and the strength of each flux is represented by the darkness of each color for example dark red and dark blue correspond to high infiltration and exfiltration fluxes compared to light red and light blue colors respectively the average annual mean net exchange fluxes over the simulation period are shown in fig 6a the exfiltration fluxes are mostly dominant along the athabasca river and its branches while the infiltration fluxes are dominant in the other areas such as uplands in the forest areas see also the inset of fig 6a there is a correlation between the magnitude of the exchange flux and its variability specifically seasonal variations in the vicinity of the rivers including the riparian zones are relatively high due to changes in infiltration and exfiltration conditions the spatial distribution of the mean net exchange fluxes for the low fig 6b and high fig 6c flow seasons is similar to that of the average annual result but there are clear differences in the magnitudes of the mean net exchange fluxes between the low and high flow seasons although there are slight differences in the magnitudes and spatial distributions of the infiltration areas the mean net infiltration rates in the lakes and ponding areas during the low and high flow seasons range approximately from 0 to 300 mm y which suggests that the groundwater recharge in these areas is constant over the annual cycle regarding the seasonal differences in the infiltration fluxes the magnitude of fluxes in the infiltration areas is significantly larger during the high flow season than the low flow season these relatively large seasonal variations in infiltration are likely the result of the seasonal pattern of precipitation in the upland areas and the lack of variation in the lowland areas is likely due to saturation excess 3 3 4 groundwater contribution the groundwater contribution to surface water flow was quantified using the net exfiltration fluxes or groundwater seepage along the athabasca river it is noted that the net exfiltration fluxes at some river nodes are about one order of magnitude higher than those at their upstream and downstream river nodes due to the relatively low mesh resolution i e 1 5 km compared to the average resolution i e 0 5 km the low resolution can cause drastic changes in topographic elevations between their surrounding nodes e g rivers and riparian zones and large influential areas that are accounted for in computing the groundwater contributions therefore in order to avoid drastic changes in the groundwater contributions net exfiltration fluxes that change greater than one order of magnitude were excluded from the groundwater contribution analysis additionally because of being a snapshot in time the net exfiltration flux along the river course was not tracked from origin to discharge and thus the groundwater contribution estimates suggested in this study may contain uncertainty fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of river flow blue and groundwater seepage red rates along the length of the athabasca river the annual rates of the river flow and groundwater seepage rates are shown in fig 7a the simulated mean annual river flow and groundwater seepage gradually increase with distance from the headwaters at the athabasca river confluence areas such as near athabasca and fort mcmurray both surface flow and groundwater seepage rates increase drastically due to the inflows from the tributaries such as the mcleod pembina lesser slave christina and clearwater rivers see fig 7d the mean total rates for river flow and groundwater seepage are 878 σ 495 and 395 σ 128 m3 s at the end of the athabasca river respectively groundwater seepage represents 45 of the mean river flow with an annual variation of 15 indicating that the groundwater seepage is more or less static compared to the changes in river flows over the simulation period it is also noted that the lower standard deviation of the river flow in the mid and downstream areas is equal to or slightly lower than the upper standard deviation of the groundwater seepage this indicates that groundwater contribution to the athabasca river can be significant during dry conditions similarly during the low flow season fig 7b the mean groundwater seepage contribution to the river flow is 63 of the mean surface flow 561 m3 s and its standard deviation is 18 of the mean river flow which indicates that the groundwater seepage contribution ratio is greater during the low flow season than the rest of the year during the high flow season fig 7c the mean and standard deviation of the surface flow are about two times greater than those of the low flow season the mean groundwater seepage rate at the end of the river is about 34 of its corresponding mean river flow rate 1322 m3 s the ratio of the standard deviation of the groundwater seepage to the mean river flow is aproximately 10 which is about two times lower than that for the low flow season 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal water balance analysis in order to characterize the average annual water balance conditions over the arb the aridity index ai ratio of liquid forcing to pet and actual aridity index aai ratio of liquid forcing to aet were compared based on the average annual condition the average annual ai shown in fig 8a ranges approximately from 0 7 in ea to 1 6 in ja based on the sub basin average ai the spatial distribution of ai tends to decrease with distance downstream of ja with a basin average ai of approximately 1 6 in the ja and ht sub basins the average ai values are greater than 1 2 indicating that these sub basins are in wet conditions with liquid water forcing being more than 20 greater than pet in the downstream areas including the wf at fm and ea sub basins the water balance changes to drier conditions with the sub basin average ai decreasing from 0 89 in wf to 0 66 in ea the main reason for this is a decrease of precipitation and increase of pet in the downstream area for the average annual aai shown in fig 8b the overall basin average aai is approximately 1 9 indicating that wet conditions are prevalent over the arb the ja ht and wf sub basins are in highly wet conditions with a sub basin average aai of greater than 2 0 although the downstream regions below wf are partly in drier conditions in the lake and peatland areas the sub basin average aai in ea is higher than 1 7 which indicates water surplus conditions overall the spatial trends of aai are similar to those of ai such that sub basin average aai decreases in the downstream regions with a range of from 3 92 in ja to 1 74 in ea however the spatial distribution of aai values is significantly different from that of ai because of the simulated aet being about 40 of pet and following a spatial pattern associated with wetlands and drainage patterns 4 2 comparison of groundwater contributions to athabasca river the estimated groundwater contributions to river flow were compared to gibson et al 2016 who quantified the groundwater contribution to the athabasca river using hydrograph separations based on a stable isotope mass balance model table 4 lists the seasonal and annual groundwater contributions at the at and fm stations in this study the estimated groundwater contribution ratios at at range from 29 for the high flow season to 52 for the low flow season with an annual ratio of 38 however those at the fm station increase only by 2 7 due to surface water input from the clearwater river which is a surface water dominated tributary gibson et al 2016 in comparison gibson et al 2016 suggested that the annual groundwater contribution to river flow ranges from 39 at fm to 45 at at and those for low and high flow seasons are in a range of 37 5 at fm to 47 at at our estimated annual groundwater contribution ratios based on the monthly average simulations tend to be slightly underestimated by 7 18 during the high flow season and overestimated by 10 22 during the low flow season compared to those suggested by gibson et al 2016 the ranges of the seasonal groundwater contributions are relatively greater in this study due mainly to the uncertainty associated with the various model parameter settings used here however the annual groundwater contribution ratios at at and fm are in a similar range with those reported by gibson et al 2016 and therefore both estimation results indicate that groundwater contribution to the athabasca river is significant and groundwater can be an important water source for surface flow during extremely dry conditions 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated the dynamic interaction between the surface water and groundwater systems of the arb using a fully integrated surface subsurface model the performance of the integrated model was first evaluated under periodic monthly normal forcings and then seasonal and annual surface water and groundwater interactions were quantified using monthly average climate forcing from 1979 to 1993 in order to account for uncertainty in the surface subsurface model parameterization an ensemble of 89 input parameter sets obtained from a steady state arb model was applied to examine model sensitivity of topsoil layer parameters where surface water and groundwater interactions are expected to be highly sensitive in order to evaluate transient hydrologic processes of the surface subsurface flow system we performed simulations with monthly average flows for 15 years from 1979 to 1993 as in the monthly normal simulations the amplitude of seasonal variability in simulated surface water flow at the upstream gauge stations was overestimated during low flow conditions and underestimated during high flow conditions however the snowmelt runoff and seasonal flow peak times matched well with the observations in the downstream areas there was also close agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs as well as snowmelt and peak flow timings based on the transient simulation results with interannual variability it was found that groundwater seepage is an important source to the athabasca river the estimated inter seasonal groundwater contribution ratios ranged from 34 to 63 with an average annual ratio of 45 it is noted that the estimated annual groundwater contribution ratios are in a similar range as those suggested based on isotope water balance analysis gibson et al 2016 although the estimated ranges are somewhat larger this is likely related to the relatively large uncertainty associated with the temporal aggregation of the climate data and the physical parameters used in the ensemble arb model simulations nevertheless both integrated modelling and isotope analysis confirm that the groundwater contribution along the athabasca river is significant and thus the groundwater system plays a role in sustaining environmental flow during dry flow periods the simulated stream flows in the mid and downstream areas of the arb model were more responsive during the sensitivity analysis as compared to the upstream stations the stream flow variations for mid and downstream areas were computed to be much larger during the high flow seasons than those during the low flow seasons parameter sensitivity during the high flow seasons was found to be high andprovided better constraints to the range of possible topsoil property values for the surface flow model on the other hand relatively low sensitivities estimated during the low flow seasons over the basin suggested that improved model physics are required for enhancing the model performance in particular including the physics of seasonal freeze thaw cycles may be necessary to reproduce low stream flows during the winter and spring seasons furthermore higher resolution climate forcing that includes an altitude dependent temperature lapse rate correction as well as a physics based snow model will significantly improve the simulations in the upstream areas credit

7784,fresh water supply is critical along the andes where drought conditions over the past decade are projected to persist at high andean headwater catchments frozen ground conditions are assumed to modulate groundwater flow paths and their hydrological signals at different timescales however knowledge of hydrological connections in subtropical andean catchments is still very sparse this study assessed hydrological connections and their impacts on groundwater contribution to baseflow in a headwater proglacial aquifer located in central chile at 33 s and 3600 m a s l we collected and analyzed snow glacial stream and groundwater spring water samples between 2019 and 2021 we combined of water isotope and metagenomic proxies with the hydraulic parameterization of the catchment to deliver mean transit time distributions through the proglacial aquifer the new hydrological insights for the region include the finding that groundwater spring signals delivered sub decadal transit times implying likely origins from glacial or interstitial ice additionally the stable isotope signature showed that groundwater consistently differs from snow and surface runoff the 16s rrna metabarcoding analyses demonstrated the presence of psychrophilic microorganisms in groundwater springs supporting the idea of a late warm season activation of interstitial ice due to thawing events associated with a differential relative abundance of specific cryophilic bacteria finally our results suggest hydrological connections and dampening timeframes between glaciers proglacial areas and

introduction millions of people depend on freshwater provided by the mountain cryosphere along the andean mountain range barnett et al 2005 desa 2013 the andes mountains between 30 and 38 s have had a

baseflow groundwater ranges between 32 and 52 at glacierized headwater catchments liu et al 2004 baraer et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2014 evans et al 2015 such mountainous areas are often dominated by sedimentary disturbance regimes indirectly conditioned by glacial influence slaymaker 2009 implying that coarse grained features may buffer snowmelt transmission kurylyk and hayashi 2017 and constitute conduits for groundwater somers and mckenzie 2020 consequently groundwater recharge via coarse slope deposits and moraines can be ultimately delayed by finer sediments and discharge to

2022 under the rcp8 5 scenario groundwater recharge at 33 s is mainly due to snowmelt while at 27 s it is expected to be more driven by evapotranspiration wu et al 2020 hence snowmelt partitioning

water stresses evans et al 2018 that could generate less streamflow as infiltration fills previously depleted parts of the system alvarez garreton et al 2021 hence assessing changes in groundwater recharge sources and rates is critical for understanding the vulnerability of the cryolithic water environment to a changing climate upon permafrost degradation hiyama et al 2013 for example in permafrost degrading areas baseflow would increase due to higher transmissivity recharge and storage while in warmer areas under permafrost conditions baseflow increases due to more increased regional horizontal and vertical connectivity rerouting evans et al 2020 this study focuses on the in situ characterization of a mountain cryosphere system in a warming semi arid region under current ice front retreat and an ongoing precipitation decline we investigate whether the seasonal signature from groundwater springs can be associated with thawing sources and multiannual storage at proglacial aquifers delivering insights on hydrological connections therein we assessed a proglacial aquifer under permafrost conditions within the aconcagua catchment in central chile at 33 s expecting isotopic signals to drift from late spring to early autumn as snowmelt influence fades out the novelty and representativity of the current work are bound to deliver insight into hydrological connections present in mountain paraglacial environments where non glacial processes are directly conditioned by glaciation slaymaker 2009 and under permafrost conditions such settings represent current day landscapes at the aconcagua basin and other glacierized catchments in permafrost regions like the himalayas the alps and even svalbard where proglacial aquifer buffering processes are still difficult to assess 2 methods we propose a methodological strategy using different proxies to understand the timeframes and connections involved in groundwater storage the strategy takes advantage of the complementarity of hydrochemical and biological proxies to establish hydrological interpretations we utilized anthropogenic gases water isotope enrichment deuterium and 18o and decay tritium as they have been used for decades to analyze snow runoff in mountain dinçer et al 1970 and lowland permafrost environments burn and michel 1988 to further differentiate groundwater sources we looked at microbial composition bochet et al 2020 ramírez et al 2020 found in alpine environments frey et al 2016 presenting unique niche dependent sequences of proteobacteria sajjad et al 2021 consequently we

storage time flow pathway heterogeneity and hydrological source within the catchment mcdonnell et al 2010 we investigated whether groundwater spring samples contained a biological signature 16s rrna metabarcoding associated with thawing sources a cryotic microenvironment the system assumption considered a steady state influx of multiyear multi entry points for surface infiltrations from an upper reservoir roughly analogous to the vadose zone with either a surface runoff outflux stream or seasonal quickflow from a lower reservoir saturated zone to groundwater springs fig 2 the recharge

ice cored moraines langston et al 2011 we consider that sources feeding groundwater springs could contain a thawing fraction θ from multiannual storage and are significantly distinct from surface water isotope and genetic makeup composition by using a linear steady state mixing approach we differentiated isotope background concentrations as snow precipitation signals ß from surface γ fractions flowing through reservoirs in the catchment fig 2 we followed a simple conceptualization by rose 2007 where fractions γ of the total volume of the groundwater reservoir are released to base flow while the remaining fractions 1 γ thoroughly mix with new inputs from the upper precipitation mixing reservoir water isotope analysis requires controlling atmospheric precipitation background levels for the andes houston 2007 and considering that different transit time estimations are produced from equivalent 3h concentrations due to radioactive decay stewart et al 2010 since the catchment is under

subsurface water mix with multiannual storage signal water isotope concentrations can be the input for calibrating the transit time distribution by fitting to measured tracer sampling output concentration maloszewski and zuber 1996 we chose to parametrize all inputs and outputs using a lumped parameter approach which estimates a system s dynamic specifically piston to exponential system

the ratio of the piston to exponential flow epm aquifer area ranging from 1 to 6 the epm is the ratio of the piston to exponential flow aquifer area and the piston flow component can represent young groundwater that traveled vertically within the recharge zone the mean transit time residence time is integrated throughout different flow regime assumptions in eq 2 values considered the lowest measured tritium uncertainty and a more comprehensive range considering two half lives from the snow background level the value range for as τ m inputs considered up to 60 years following other methodologies using tritium hiyama et al 2013 kralik 2015 the complex distribution of catchment flow paths is represented by a distribution of transit times describing tracer transport through the catchment the assumption is that an annual hydrological flush promotes seasonal and multiannual isotopic stability for a steady state isotope balance model gibson et al 2015 and no concentration gradient throughout the catchment or at least from the lower reservoir to the sampling output for example average groundwater residence time estimates between 14 and 18 years have been associated with

ice and glacial water human emitted gas cfc s and sf6 s concentrations aid the interpretation of surface subsurface connection cfc and sf6 concentrations in groundwater spring samples were measured at gns science in new zealand by gas chromatography method with electron capture uncertainty for cfc and sf6 was 1 2 and 3 respectively if the system is closed the gas concentrations will be theoretically higher than current atmospheric levels still if the system is partially open levels will be equivalent to the current atmospheric ones 2 6 environmental genetic analyses in this study we utilized a biological proxy to understand the hydrological origin and connectivity of groundwater springs in paraglacial environments at least two kilometers away from glacier termini the diversity and composition of the prokaryotic community were analyzed from two spring sources where water was collected in april 2019 a hundred liters of water from each spring 1 and spring 2 fig 1 were pumped through a 50 µm polyester net to exclude large organisms and particles and transported in darkness to the microbial ecology of extreme systems laboratory pontificia universidad católica de chile santiago chile in the laboratory samples were subjected to serial filtration using a peristaltic pump 6 600 rpm pressure up to 2 bar through 3 µm polycarbonate filters and 0 22 µm sterivex filters millipore filters were maintained at 80 c until nucleic acids extraction dna extraction used both filter fractions using a commercial dneasy powersoil qiagen kit dna quantification was performed using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa quality assessment utilized spectrophotometry a260 a280 ratio and integrity by standard agarose gel electrophoresis subsequently pcr amplifications

sequences of the 16s rrna gene were imported to the qiime2 platform v2019 7 bokulich et al 2018 bolyen et al 2019 caporaso et al 2010 and demultiplexed q2 demux plugin then the paired end sequences were trimmed and merged using dada2 callahan et al 2016 to obtain the amplicon sequencing variants asvs asvs taxonomy was assigned with the q2 feature classifier classify consensus vsearch rognes et al 2016 using the silva132 database quast et al 2012 asvs classified as mitochondria or chloroplast were filtered out for the analysis of the bacteria and archaea community sequences from 3 and 0 2 µm fractions were mixed for each source js1 and js2 finally to remove singletons and rare taxa asvs were filtered by frequency asvs with 2 counts and by taxonomy phyla with 2 asvs in the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 team 2020 alpha diversity analysis was performed on the clean reads with phyloseq and vegan packages oksanen et al 2019 considering observed diversity from shannon and simpson indexes wagner et al 2018 3 results 3 1 flow system characterization from water sample analyses we considered that at least 15 of the monos de agua catchment area is currently under permafrost conditions fig 1 c predominantly above 4200 m a s l ruiz pereira et al 2021 with negative mean annual ground surface temperatures below 2 c between 3900 and 4200 m a s l permafrost exists intermittently on shaded south facing slopes the seasonal comparison between december and april 2019 shows similar deuterium levels for both sources in december but very different in april samples additional table 3 the 18o concentration also changed significantly with differences between sources diverging from december to april additionally the average δ18o between surface sources springs and stream and snow increased by 28 towards the end of the warm season of 2019 additional table 7 comparing the 2019 and 2020 warm seasons the isotopic signal d and 18o for groundwater springs and glacial stream showed distinct concentrations for hydrological sources table 1 additional fig 3a the stable isotope levels measured for spring 1 and the glacial stream showed an enriched signal the tritium values for the snow composite september november 2018 and april 2020 were 6 39 2 66 tu which we considered the background the average tritium for groundwater springs spring 1 and 2 sampled in april 2019 2020 was 2 38 0 44 tu while the glacial stream was 2 13 1 04 tu table 1 and additional fig 3c between 2019 and 2021 the multiannual tritium signal for spring 2 changed by 10 while spring 1 up to 60 additional table 3 the water isotope concentration ratios table 1 additional table 3 showed that groundwater springs and stream samples are significantly lighter than the snow background in tritium but only showed a tendency in stable isotope levels even though results indicate spring 2 as a more differentiated source in late austral summer april the overall difference between groundwater springs and the stream samples is not statistically conclusive 3 2 metagenomic analysis the prokaryotic 16s rrna gene sequence taxonomic composition evidenced the presence and abundance of psychrophiles low temperature adapted obtained from groundwater spring samples the estimated diversity values for 50 nm 0 2 µm size fraction prokaryotic communities were similar between springs for asvs and shannon index however differences in the presence and relative abundance of some populations between springs fig 3 are shown in additional table 5 the taxonomic identity fig 3a showed the highest relative abundance for phylum proteobacteria mainly represented by betaproteobacteriales seconded by phyla bacteroidetes with flavobacteriales dominating the phylum fig 3b shows genera representing 1 of prokaryotic bacteria and archaea communities per spring minor and rare genera in fig 3c show the 30 most abundant 1 venn plots show shared and unique taxa represented by asvs for springs at phylum fig 3d genera 1 fig 3e and genera 1 or uncultured taxa fig 3f levels at the phylum level there were 522 shared asvs but only 66 asvs assigned to the 1 genera communities the most abundant and exclusive spring 1 asvs from 1 genera were thalassospira 2 9 flavobacterium 1 9 and halomonas 1 5 for spring 2 they were flavobacterium 1 3 and polaromonas 2 6 the most abundant asvs in common for both springs were from genera representing 1 affiliated to gallionella sideroxydans thiobacillus flavobacterium rhodoferax and polaromonas each of these asvs was similarly abundant for both springs representing 1 5 of the community but the asvs assigned to polaromonas and rhodoferax were substantially more abundant in spring 2 fig 3b the high number of unique asvs observed between springs denotes the differences in bacterial community composition polaromonas is a known psychrophile some species of rhodoferax could also be considered psychrotolerant and grow near 0 c like r antarcticus recovered from glacial habitats madigan et al 2000 or r ferrireducens isolated from anaerobic subsurface aquifer sediments finneran et al 2003 the other shared genera thiobacillus gallionella syderoxidans are chemolithotrophic nitrifying betaproteobacteriales commonly associated with iron oxidation and found in dark and iced environments likely as primary producers fixing carbon and weathering minerals thus explaining how a such microbial ecosystem can be sustained in ice toubes rodrigo et al 2017 additionally other nitrifiers and fe redox bacterial genera were present within the minor and rare 1 group spring 1 differed by showing a higher relative abundance of bacteroidetes flavobacteriales and sphingobacteriales orders and twice as many cyanobacteria fig 3a b the dominant bacterial members of spring 2 polaromonas and rhodoferax together with other taxa also shared with spring 1 are associated with a biogeochemical role in c cycling as primary producers mainly as nitrifiers in n cycling in this environment 3 3 transit time analysis isotope derived transit time 3h 18o d estimation additional table 3 resulted in 4 77 2 05 years the lumped parameter approach had a system response g t with a n ratio epm value 4 17 1 17 the convolution outputs in fig 4 show a predominant peak around five years of mean transit time with only tritium outputs spanning longer than a decade which is consistent with the truncation hypothesis stewart et al 2021 this range of transit time values does fall within the hydraulic turnover time estimation from eq 1 was 13 67 20 09 years additional fig 4 especially with the longer tails of tritium outputs beyond a decade 3 4 interstitial water volume under cryogenic conditions the volume associated with thawing outflowing at groundwater springs between 2019 and 2020 considered streamflow measurements apparent transmissivity and porosity data from field samples and literature additional table 1 and 2 the streamflow was measured at 0 14 0 02 m3 s for spring 1 and 0 14 0 01 m3 s for spring 2 the total possible volume of groundwater stored in the aquifer was calculated using a conservative estimate ó dochartaigh et al 2019 of average aquifer porosity additional figs 1 and 2 above 3600 m a s l and corresponded to 2 52 km3 additional fig 2 consequently considering a mean spring streamflow of 0 141 m3 s the estimated annual volume per a minimal ninety day thawing season is at least 0 004 km3 assuming the average travel time of around four years with no additional recharge therefore spring 2 accounts for approximately 0 004 km3 associated with warm season thawing groundwater and representing less than a 0 2 of the total vadose volume 4 discussion we estimated timescales for groundwater flow dampening at a proglacial foreland under permafrost conditions implying recharge from glacial melt and snow infiltration later outflowing through groundwater springs an inferred multiannual storage indicated glacier permafrost connections evidenced through thawing signals during the late warm season using isotopic and biological analyses the evidence supports our interpretation of a dampened downstream flow signal in proglacial aquifer areas which could alter long term hydrologic trends over heterogeneous landscapes chezik et al 2017 spring 2 represented a thawing cryogenic source during the warm season it is inactive during early austral summer from our observations and ground surface temperature data at that location showed negative temperatures starting in may ruiz pereira et al 2021 since spring 2 had this late warm season activation we argue that the two groundwater springs should have different origins different reservoir fig 2 and that spring 1 is more connected to the surface and less likely related to thawing sources than spring 2 the anthropogenic gas levels cfcs sf6 from springs resulted in equivalent to atmospheric levels for both springs additional table 4 additional fig 3b and therefore cannot be used in the lumped parameter approach to estimate residence times however they partially confirm that the groundwater systems are connected to the surface under a seasonal dynamic groundwater springs and stream samples show stable isotope seasonality between early and late summer 2019 this can be explained by the loss of a snow dominated signal from flow path convergence and a high proportion of young water leray et al 2016 for late summer sampling between 2019 and 2021 average groundwater spring tritium content of 2 38 0 67 tu could constitute a mixture of only glacial melt and snow as the glacial stream has a content of 2 08 0 77 tu and snow is higher than both nevertheless since stable isotopes in groundwater springs are lighter than in the glacial stream a strictly seasonal non interannual storage glacial origin for groundwater springs is not supported by linear mixing therefore an additional mixing input from thawing is implied assumed to have a different storage time and or hydrological origin if groundwater springs are glacial melt flowing underground and emerging in late summer the tritium content should not differ from that of the glacial stream however if spring samples are only mixtures of snow and interstitial ice thawing input ice tritium content should be higher than the current background cauquoin et al 2015 houston 2007 lászló et al 2020 to match the stable isotope levels in fact tritium from spring 2 is less depleted than the surface runoff signal stream table 1 and has a lighter d 18o content implying an intermediate mixture moreover stable water isotopes from the glacial stream are equal to or more enriched than snow precipitation δ 18o 0 which is consistent with water balance processes modifying initial precipitation isotope signatures gibson et al 2020 and a signal of thawing environments wan et al 2019 yi et al 2018 therefore the average residence time implies that the largest outflux fraction belongs to young groundwater kazemi et al 2006 with multiannual storage under permafrost conditions nevertheless residence times beyond five decades could not be derived as tritium calibration curves are unavailable beyond such timescales for modern groundwater interpretations the positive δ18o values represent a seasonal thawing signal consistent with crespo et al 2017 and crespo et al 2020a 2020b in the same region additional table 7 the d excess values dansgaard 1964 zech et al 2013 shown in table 1 increased during warmer summer with both spring 1 and 2 having virtually the same excess these values are in concert with the increase in warm season mentioned by froehlich et al 2008 and crespo et al 2017 which also showed low d excess snow samples consistent with more evaporative conditions metagenomic analyses of 16s rrna allowed identification and comparison between springs showing differences in the presence and abundance of both major 1 of the total community and minor rare 1 taxa between springs reinforcing the idea that spring 2 may represent a seasonal thawing niche the finding is consistent with analyses from alaska where rhodoferax ferrireducens was abundant in permafrost hultman et al 2015 the swiss alps with betaproteobacteria such as polaromonas and rhodoferax associated with the permafrost layer frey et al 2016 and also 15 000 year old ice cores from the tibetan plateau zhong et al 2021 furthermore in permafrost areas of the dry andes 27 s aszalós et al 2016 and aszalós et al 2020 found rhodoferax ferrirreducens 6500 m a s l flavobacterium and polaromonas 5900 m a s l in cold water samples from shallow lakes these results imply that sequences from groundwater spring samples potentially come from a putative subsurface habitat with freezing thawing conditions and that groundwater spring connectivity should have a seasonal evolution as suggested by tritium and microbial metagenomic identity transit times derived from hydraulic and isotopic analyses under a year cochand et al 2020 are assumed from the upper reservoir fractions while longer tails fig 4 would be associated with a lower reservoir spring 2 can ultimately be recognized as coming from thawing frozen grounds in late summer but representing a sub decadal recharge meaning it is a mix of both snow and glacial water with multiannual storage this interpretation resembles spring water analyses in siberia showing bipartite composition containing older precipitation recharge and water partly sourced from thawing permafrost hiyama et al 2013 but not a true permafrost thawing origin modulating water input signals into discharge signals arenson et al 2022 in the future with earlier and lesser snowmelt musselman et al 2017 and increased frozen ground degradation evans and ge 2017 the hydrological connectivity could be disrupted by not exceeding necessary wetness thresholds and compromising groundwater storage dynamic green et al 2011 for example in proglacial areas under permafrost conditions the underestimation of river flow can be explained by groundwater temporarily buffering glacier melt somers et al 2019 but also by the neglect of groundwater flow from ephemeral streams draining from hillslopes as well as subsurface seepage from surrounding moraine systems ó dochartaigh et al 2019 these processes will affect the interannual variability of glacier meltwater saberi et al 2019 and future river flow estimations chezik et al 2017 hence the need for timeframes of interannual storage in glacial forelands furthermore as connectivity changes microbial habitats will also be affected for example an increasing temperature in frozen soils could increase the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes taxa luláková et al 2019 and condition microbial communities ballhausen et al 2020 therefore the current genetic taxonomic configuration of such communities then constitutes a proxy for subsurface variations as an indirect way of assessing the temporal variability of groundwater environments future bioinformatics analyses comparing ground ice microbial metagenomics should deliver more concrete ideas on what to expect from samples belonging to seasonal thawing the limitations of the presented methodological strategy require a higher temporal sampling resolution necessary to surpass uncertainties bound to interannual variations of precipitation and ground surface temperatures conditioning infiltration additionally the mixing possibilities for a proglacial aquifer system imply that the retrieved data does not allow discerning between the glacial stream and interstitial ice in terms of their spatiotemporal origin glacier and ground ice background isotopic signatures are also an ideal reference for refining results such as those obtained by the present work nevertheless to avoid the complexity and costs implied in high mountain prospection one complementary option is particle tracking simulations to obtain residence time distribution representing the different possibilities of groundwater storage and flow within a proglacial aquifer this may allow the statistical discretization of groundwater sources especially the subsurface structure which may include transitional layers amongst frozen grounds also subject to inter annual variability of surface temperatures and precipitation additionally the development of environmental tritium derived from atmospheric circulation models and ice cores could be complementary for understanding the variation of tritium as background beyond the scope of modern groundwater 5 conclusions our three year analysis determined multiannual groundwater storage at a proglacial aquifer under permafrost conditions at 33 s in the andes mountains during summer 2019 2021 groundwater springs at proglacial areas presented stable isotope enrichment depleted tritium content and indications of thawing one spring was activated during the late warm season only and its microbial metagenomic analysis by 16s metabarcoding showed taxa common to mountain glaciers and lowland permafrost environments polaromonas and rhodoferax indicating a thawing environment as a source sustaining such psychrophile diversity the hydraulic and isotope derived transit time equations delivered distributions suggesting multiannual groundwater storage under a decade results indicate that proglacial aquifer groundwater recharges from glacial meltwater precipitation and frozen ground sources such as interstitial ice the interpretation is a sub decadal dampening timescale of proglacial groundwater storage which should be considered in hydrological budgets that include paraglacial mountain areas under current ice retreat the integrative methodological strategy was adequate to unveil hydrological timeframes for hydric potential in rapidly evolving proglacial settings within water scarce regions using genetic proxies improves the understanding and interpretation of water samples by indirectly ascribing a likely origin such as a seasonal thawing source and represents a valuable tool to assess remote mountainous areas for preliminary interpretations of their hydrological connections for example if future snowmelt partitioning extends through newly available subsurface flow paths and increases hydrological connectivity then unique microbial habitats would also undergo selective pressure and may constitute a proxy for the subsurface biochemical evolution of frozen proglacial aquifers much work is still required to thoroughly assess complex mountain systems with interconnected cryosphere elements as they often evolve in a nonlinear fashion through different timescales hence the present methodological approach would greatly benefit from higher sampling resolution and further bioinformatic comparison with genetic results from ground and glacial ice samples but also integrating groundwater particle tracking

7784,fresh water supply is critical along the andes where drought conditions over the past decade are projected to persist at high andean headwater catchments frozen ground conditions are assumed to modulate groundwater flow paths and their hydrological signals at different timescales however knowledge of hydrological connections in subtropical andean catchments is still very sparse this study assessed hydrological connections and their impacts on groundwater contribution to baseflow in a headwater proglacial aquifer located in central chile at 33 s and 3600 m a s l we collected and analyzed snow glacial stream and groundwater spring water samples between 2019 and 2021 we combined of water isotope and metagenomic proxies with the hydraulic parameterization of the catchment to deliver mean transit time distributions through the proglacial aquifer the new hydrological insights for the region include the finding that groundwater spring signals delivered sub decadal transit times implying likely origins from glacial or interstitial ice additionally the stable isotope signature showed that groundwater consistently differs from snow and surface runoff the 16s rrna metabarcoding analyses demonstrated the presence of psychrophilic microorganisms in groundwater springs supporting the idea of a late warm season activation of interstitial ice due to thawing events associated with a differential relative abundance of specific cryophilic bacteria finally our results suggest hydrological connections and dampening timeframes between glaciers proglacial areas and

introduction millions of people depend on freshwater provided by the mountain cryosphere along the andean mountain range barnett et al 2005 desa 2013 the andes mountains between 30 and 38 s have had a declining precipitation trend between 1960 and 2016 boisier et al 2018 cordero et al 2019 and expect further snowpack loss of up to 75 85 by the year 2100 bozkurt et al 2018 as well as increasing

fast discharge recession after the recharge season e g snowmelt or rainfall events followed by a slow recession that sustains discharge over a long period hayashi 2020 for instance post freshet baseflow groundwater ranges between 32 and 52 at glacierized headwater catchments liu et al 2004 baraer et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2014 evans et al 2015 such mountainous areas are often dominated by sedimentary disturbance regimes indirectly conditioned by glacial influence slaymaker 2009 implying that coarse grained features may buffer snowmelt transmission kurylyk and hayashi 2017 and constitute conduits for groundwater somers and mckenzie 2020 consequently groundwater recharge via coarse slope deposits and moraines can be ultimately delayed by finer sediments and discharge to valley springs glas et al 2018 in mountainous periglacial environments the thawing of ground ice acting as a thermal aquitard affects ground hydraulic transmissivity and may deliver distinctive signatures in water content which could differ from that of precipitation and seasonal surface water sources thus permafrost degradation e g due to climate change influences surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions kurylyk et al 2014 water quality szopińska et al 2016 toohey et al 2016 and further determine the hydrologic behavior and water contribution of melting ground ice arenson et al 2022 under the rcp8 5 scenario groundwater recharge at 33 s is mainly due to snowmelt while at 27 s it is expected to be more driven by evapotranspiration wu et al 2020 hence snowmelt partitioning between surface runoff and groundwater flow soil ice saturation inversely proportional to effective permeability could increase storage in a thickening active layer evans and ge 2017 additionally under slower snowmelt rates due to season contraction hydrological connectivity may not exceed necessary wetness thresholds musselman et al 2017 leading to reduced streamflow increasing dry season water stresses evans et al 2018 that could generate less streamflow as infiltration fills previously depleted parts of the system alvarez garreton et al 2021 hence assessing changes in groundwater recharge sources and rates is critical for understanding the vulnerability of the cryolithic water environment to a changing climate upon permafrost degradation hiyama et al 2013 for example in permafrost degrading areas baseflow would increase due to higher transmissivity recharge and storage while in warmer areas under permafrost conditions baseflow increases due to more increased regional horizontal and vertical connectivity rerouting evans et al 2020 this study focuses on the in situ characterization of a mountain cryosphere system in a warming semi arid region under current ice front retreat and an ongoing precipitation decline we investigate whether the seasonal signature from groundwater springs can be associated with thawing sources and multiannual storage at proglacial aquifers delivering insights on hydrological connections therein we assessed a proglacial aquifer under permafrost conditions within the aconcagua catchment in central chile at 33 s expecting isotopic signals to drift from late spring to early autumn as snowmelt influence fades out the novelty and representativity of the current work are bound to deliver insight into hydrological connections present in mountain paraglacial environments where non glacial processes are directly conditioned by glaciation slaymaker 2009 and under permafrost conditions such settings represent current day landscapes at the aconcagua basin and other glacierized catchments in permafrost regions like the himalayas the alps and even svalbard where proglacial aquifer buffering processes are still difficult to assess 2 methods we propose a methodological strategy using different proxies to understand the timeframes and connections involved in groundwater storage the strategy takes advantage of the complementarity of hydrochemical and biological proxies to establish hydrological interpretations we utilized anthropogenic gases water isotope enrichment deuterium and 18o and decay tritium as they have been used for decades to analyze snow runoff in mountain dinçer et al 1970 and lowland permafrost environments burn and michel 1988 to further differentiate groundwater sources we looked at microbial composition bochet et al 2020 ramírez et al 2020 found in alpine environments frey et al 2016 presenting unique niche dependent sequences of proteobacteria sajjad et al 2021 consequently we considered that water samples from point locations streams and springs could be differentiated by biological representative of niche conditions and different isotopic gas signatures to the current

reservoir roughly analogous to the vadose zone with either a surface runoff outflux stream or seasonal quickflow from a lower reservoir saturated zone to groundwater springs fig 2 the recharge considers infiltration of glacial snow water above 3600 m a s l and discharge from snowmelt glacial melt or interstitial water from permafrost thaw through groundwater springs at 3600 m a s l groundwater spring streamflow measurements between 2019 and 2020 included cross sections at the closest flat surface from the ground outflow by float method we account for soil responsiveness hrachowitz et al 2009 from either aquitards transmissivity lag or aquicludes impervious barrier as discontinuous layers supporting perched groundwater hayashi 2020 coupled with multi entry proglacial ice cored moraines langston et al 2011 we consider that sources feeding groundwater springs could contain a thawing fraction θ from multiannual storage and are significantly distinct from surface water isotope and genetic makeup composition by using a linear steady state mixing approach we differentiated isotope background concentrations as snow precipitation signals ß from surface γ fractions flowing through reservoirs in the catchment fig 2 we followed a simple conceptualization by rose 2007 where fractions γ of the total volume of the groundwater reservoir are released to base flow while the remaining fractions 1 γ thoroughly mix with new inputs from the upper precipitation mixing reservoir water isotope analysis requires controlling atmospheric precipitation background levels for the andes houston 2007 and considering that different transit time estimations are produced from equivalent 3h concentrations due to radioactive decay stewart et al 2010 since the catchment is under mountain permafrost conditions heterogeneous distribution and there might be mean transit times of less than a year cochand et al 2020 we associated an expression integrating isotope tracer values and

the differentiation of hydrological fractions by hydrochemical analysis obeys two main criteria i origin within the hydrological cycle snow glacier frozen ground ii reservoir location limitations of using water stable isotopes for groundwater dating include that they are indicative of turnover times only under five years mcguire et al 2005 stewart et al 2010 as detectible variation in 18o is smaller than the measurement error stewart et al 2021 as an unstable hydrogen isotope tritium has the advantage of being subjected to radioactive decay a temporal difference easily calculated using regional calibration curves especially in the southern hemisphere cauquoin et al 2015 where the anthropogenic bomb peak did not exert such ambiguity as in canada russia and china gibson et al 2016 makarov 2016 yi et al 2018 additionally its short half life of 12 3 years makes it appropriate for young and very young groundwater newman et al 2010 this study measured stable and unstable water isotope concentrations from snow composite surface glacial stream and groundwater springs the sampling occurred between 3550 and 3590 m a s l and between september november 2018 austral spring and

subsurface water mix with multiannual storage signal water isotope concentrations can be the input for calibrating the transit time distribution by fitting to measured tracer sampling output concentration maloszewski and zuber 1996 we chose to parametrize all inputs and outputs using a lumped parameter approach which estimates a system s dynamic specifically piston to exponential system response ratio and describes integrated tracer transport through a catchment by discretizing physical constraints the lumped parameter may be explained by the following convolution integral dinçer et

the ratio of the piston to exponential flow epm aquifer area ranging from 1 to 6 the epm is the ratio of the piston to exponential flow aquifer area and the piston flow component can represent young groundwater that traveled vertically within the recharge zone the mean transit time residence time is integrated throughout different flow regime assumptions in eq 2 values considered the lowest measured tritium uncertainty and a more comprehensive range considering two half lives from the snow background level the value range for as τ m inputs considered up to 60 years following other methodologies using tritium hiyama et al 2013 kralik 2015 the complex distribution of catchment flow paths is represented by a distribution of transit times describing tracer transport through the catchment the assumption is that an annual hydrological flush promotes seasonal and multiannual isotopic stability for a steady state isotope balance model gibson et al 2015 and no concentration gradient throughout the catchment or at least from the lower reservoir to the sampling output for example average groundwater residence time estimates between 14 and 18 years have been associated with aquifers accounting for 10 20 m thick regolith 20 30 regolith bedrock porosity and hydraulic conductivity between 1 0e 08 1 2e 05 m s rose 2007 in the present case we estimated time related distributions from water isotope measurements 2h and 18o and 3h water stable isotopes were measured in the stable isotope laboratory of the andres bello university viña del mar chile tritium

surface snow samples as background tritium values were normalized eq 5 to their field sampling time yi et al 2018 as is a standard procedure houston 2007 in the southern hemisphere the tritium peak

seasonal thaw in addition to point source differentiation seasonal differences are also expected an isotopic separation between river water and precipitation δ18o will depend on elevation and mean

thaw or glacial melt with δ18o 0 for example in yukon canada gibson et al 2020 screened stable isotopes throughout areas under permafrost and found enrichment in streams from thawing grounds 2 5 open or closed groundwater system groundwater springs may constitute outputs from a closed system for example the thawing of interstitial ice or a rock glacier but also a mixed recharge from snow ground ice and glacial water human emitted gas cfc s and sf6 s concentrations aid the interpretation of surface subsurface connection cfc and sf6 concentrations in groundwater spring samples were measured at gns science in new zealand by gas chromatography method with electron capture uncertainty for cfc and sf6 was 1 2 and 3 respectively if the system is closed the gas concentrations will be theoretically higher than current atmospheric levels still if the system is partially open levels will be equivalent to the current atmospheric ones 2 6 environmental genetic analyses in this study we utilized a biological proxy to understand the hydrological origin and connectivity of groundwater springs in paraglacial environments at least two kilometers away from glacier termini the diversity and composition of the prokaryotic community were analyzed from two spring sources where water was collected in april 2019 a hundred liters of water from each spring 1 and spring 2 fig 1 were pumped through a 50 µm polyester net to exclude large organisms and particles and transported in darkness to the microbial ecology of extreme systems laboratory pontificia universidad católica de chile santiago chile in the laboratory samples were subjected to serial filtration using a peristaltic pump 6 600 rpm pressure up to 2 bar through 3 µm polycarbonate filters and 0 22 µm sterivex filters millipore filters were maintained at 80 c until nucleic acids extraction dna extraction used both filter fractions using a commercial dneasy powersoil qiagen kit dna quantification was performed using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa quality assessment utilized spectrophotometry a260 a280 ratio and integrity by standard agarose gel electrophoresis subsequently pcr amplifications

sequences of the 16s rrna gene were imported to the qiime2 platform v2019 7 bokulich et al 2018 bolyen et al 2019 caporaso et al 2010 and demultiplexed q2 demux plugin then the paired end sequences were trimmed and merged using dada2 callahan et al 2016 to obtain the amplicon sequencing variants asvs asvs taxonomy was assigned with the q2 feature classifier classify consensus vsearch rognes et al 2016 using the silva132 database quast et al 2012 asvs classified as mitochondria or chloroplast were filtered out for the analysis of the bacteria and archaea community sequences from 3 and 0 2 µm fractions were mixed for each source js1 and js2 finally to remove singletons and rare taxa asvs were filtered by frequency asvs with 2 counts and by taxonomy phyla with 2 asvs in the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 team 2020 alpha diversity analysis was performed on the clean reads with phyloseq and vegan packages oksanen et al 2019 considering observed diversity from shannon and simpson indexes wagner et al 2018 3 results 3 1 flow system characterization from water sample analyses we considered that at least 15 of the monos de agua catchment area is currently under permafrost conditions fig 1 c predominantly above 4200 m a s l ruiz pereira et al 2021 with negative mean annual ground surface temperatures below 2 c between 3900 and 4200 m a s l permafrost exists intermittently on shaded south facing slopes the seasonal comparison between december and april 2019 shows similar deuterium levels for both sources in december but very different in april samples additional table 3 the 18o concentration also changed significantly with differences between sources diverging from december to april additionally the average δ18o between surface sources springs and stream and snow increased by 28 towards the end of the warm season of 2019 additional table 7 comparing the 2019 and 2020 warm seasons the isotopic signal d and 18o for groundwater springs and glacial stream showed distinct concentrations for hydrological sources table 1 additional fig 3a the stable isotope levels measured for spring 1 and the glacial stream showed an enriched signal the tritium values for the snow composite september november 2018 and april 2020 were 6 39 2 66 tu which we considered the background the average tritium for groundwater springs spring 1 and 2 sampled in april 2019 2020 was 2 38 0 44 tu while the glacial stream was 2 13 1 04 tu table 1 and additional fig 3c between 2019 and 2021 the multiannual tritium signal for spring 2 changed by 10 while spring 1 up to 60 additional table 3 the water isotope concentration ratios table 1 additional table 3 showed that groundwater springs and stream samples are significantly lighter than the snow background in tritium but only showed a tendency in stable isotope levels even though results indicate spring 2 as a more differentiated source in late austral summer april the overall difference between groundwater springs and the stream samples is not statistically conclusive 3 2 metagenomic analysis the prokaryotic 16s rrna gene sequence taxonomic composition evidenced the presence and abundance of psychrophiles low temperature adapted obtained from groundwater spring samples the estimated diversity values for 50 nm 0 2 µm size fraction prokaryotic communities were similar between springs for asvs and shannon index however differences in the presence and relative abundance of some populations between springs fig 3 are shown in additional table 5 the taxonomic identity fig 3a showed the highest relative abundance for phylum proteobacteria mainly represented by betaproteobacteriales seconded by phyla bacteroidetes with flavobacteriales dominating the phylum fig 3b shows genera representing 1 of prokaryotic bacteria and archaea communities per spring minor and rare genera in fig 3c show the 30 most abundant 1 venn plots show shared and unique taxa represented by asvs for springs at phylum fig 3d genera 1 fig 3e and genera 1 or uncultured taxa fig 3f levels at the phylum level there were 522 shared asvs but only 66 asvs assigned to the 1 genera communities the most abundant and exclusive spring 1 asvs from 1 genera were thalassospira 2 9 flavobacterium 1 9 and halomonas 1 5 for spring 2 they were flavobacterium 1 3 and polaromonas 2 6 the most abundant asvs in common for both springs were from genera representing 1 affiliated to gallionella sideroxydans thiobacillus flavobacterium rhodoferax and polaromonas each of these asvs was similarly abundant for both springs representing 1 5 of the community but the asvs assigned to polaromonas and rhodoferax were substantially more abundant in spring 2 fig 3b the high number of unique asvs observed between springs denotes the differences in bacterial community composition polaromonas is a known psychrophile some species of rhodoferax could also be considered psychrotolerant and grow near 0 c like r antarcticus recovered from glacial habitats madigan et al 2000 or r ferrireducens isolated from anaerobic subsurface aquifer sediments finneran et al 2003 the other shared genera thiobacillus gallionella syderoxidans are chemolithotrophic nitrifying betaproteobacteriales commonly associated with iron oxidation and found in dark and iced environments likely as primary producers fixing carbon and weathering minerals thus explaining how a such microbial ecosystem can be sustained in ice toubes rodrigo et al 2017 additionally other nitrifiers and fe redox bacterial genera were present within the minor and rare 1 group spring 1 differed by showing a higher relative abundance of bacteroidetes flavobacteriales and sphingobacteriales orders and twice as many cyanobacteria fig 3a b the dominant bacterial members of spring 2 polaromonas and rhodoferax together with other taxa also shared with spring 1 are associated with a biogeochemical role in c cycling as primary producers mainly as nitrifiers in n cycling in this environment 3 3 transit time analysis isotope derived transit time 3h 18o d estimation additional table 3 resulted in 4 77 2 05 years the lumped parameter approach had a system response g t with a n ratio epm value 4 17 1 17 the convolution outputs in fig 4 show a predominant peak around five years of mean transit time with only tritium outputs spanning longer than a decade which is consistent with the truncation hypothesis stewart et al 2021 this range of transit time values does fall within the hydraulic turnover time estimation from eq 1 was 13 67 20 09 years additional fig 4 especially with the longer tails of tritium outputs beyond a decade 3 4 interstitial water volume under cryogenic conditions the volume associated with thawing outflowing at groundwater springs between 2019 and 2020 considered streamflow measurements apparent transmissivity and porosity data from field samples and literature additional table 1 and 2 the streamflow was measured at 0 14 0 02 m3 s for spring 1 and 0 14 0 01 m3 s for spring 2 the total possible volume of groundwater stored in the aquifer was calculated using a conservative estimate ó dochartaigh et al 2019 of average aquifer porosity additional figs 1 and 2 above 3600 m a s l and corresponded to 2 52 km3 additional fig 2 consequently considering a mean spring streamflow of 0 141 m3 s the estimated annual volume per a minimal ninety day thawing season is at least 0 004 km3 assuming the average travel time of around four years with no additional recharge therefore spring 2 accounts for approximately 0 004 km3 associated with warm season thawing groundwater and representing less than a 0 2 of the total vadose volume 4 discussion we estimated timescales for groundwater flow dampening at a proglacial foreland under permafrost conditions implying recharge from glacial melt and snow infiltration later outflowing through groundwater springs an inferred multiannual storage indicated glacier permafrost connections evidenced through thawing signals during the late warm season using isotopic and biological analyses the evidence supports our interpretation of a dampened downstream flow signal in proglacial aquifer areas which could alter long term hydrologic trends over heterogeneous landscapes chezik et al 2017 spring 2 represented a thawing cryogenic source during the warm season it is inactive during early austral summer from our observations and ground surface temperature data at that location showed negative temperatures starting in may ruiz pereira et al 2021 since spring 2 had this late warm season activation we argue that the two groundwater springs should have different origins different reservoir fig 2 and that spring 1 is more connected to the surface and less likely related to thawing sources than spring 2 the anthropogenic gas levels cfcs sf6 from springs resulted in equivalent to atmospheric levels for both springs additional table 4 additional fig 3b and therefore cannot be used in the lumped parameter approach to estimate residence times however they partially confirm that the groundwater systems are connected to the surface under a seasonal dynamic groundwater springs and stream samples show stable isotope seasonality between early and late summer 2019 this can be explained by the loss of a snow dominated signal from flow path convergence and a high proportion of young water leray et al 2016 for late summer sampling between 2019 and 2021 average groundwater spring tritium content of 2 38 0 67 tu could constitute a mixture of only glacial melt and snow as the glacial stream has a content of 2 08 0 77 tu and snow is higher than both nevertheless since stable isotopes in groundwater springs are lighter than in the glacial stream a strictly seasonal non interannual storage glacial origin for groundwater springs is not supported by linear mixing therefore an additional mixing input from thawing is implied assumed to have a different storage time and or hydrological origin if groundwater springs are glacial melt flowing underground and emerging in late summer the tritium content should not differ from that of the glacial stream however if spring samples are only mixtures of snow and interstitial ice thawing input ice tritium content should be higher than the current background cauquoin et al 2015 houston 2007 lászló et al 2020 to match the stable isotope levels in fact tritium from spring 2 is less depleted than the surface runoff signal stream table 1 and has a lighter d 18o content implying an intermediate mixture moreover stable water isotopes from the glacial stream are equal to or more enriched than snow precipitation δ 18o 0 which is consistent with water balance processes modifying initial precipitation isotope signatures gibson et al 2020 and a signal of thawing environments wan et al 2019 yi et al 2018 therefore the average residence time implies that the largest outflux fraction belongs to young groundwater kazemi et al 2006 with multiannual storage under permafrost conditions nevertheless residence times beyond five decades could not be derived as tritium calibration curves are unavailable beyond such timescales for modern groundwater interpretations the positive δ18o values represent a seasonal thawing signal consistent with crespo et al 2017 and crespo et al 2020a 2020b in the same region additional table 7 the d excess values dansgaard 1964 zech et al 2013 shown in table 1 increased during warmer summer with both spring 1 and 2 having virtually the same excess these values are in concert with the increase in warm season mentioned by froehlich et al 2008 and crespo et al 2017 which also showed low d excess snow samples consistent with more evaporative conditions metagenomic analyses of 16s rrna allowed identification and comparison between springs showing differences in the presence and abundance of both major 1 of the total community and minor rare 1 taxa between springs reinforcing the idea that spring 2 may represent a seasonal thawing niche the finding is consistent with analyses from alaska where rhodoferax ferrireducens was abundant in permafrost hultman et al 2015 the swiss alps with betaproteobacteria such as polaromonas and rhodoferax associated with the permafrost layer frey et al 2016 and also 15 000 year old ice cores from the tibetan plateau zhong et al 2021 furthermore in permafrost areas of the dry andes 27 s aszalós et al 2016 and aszalós et al 2020 found rhodoferax ferrirreducens 6500 m a s l flavobacterium and polaromonas 5900 m a s l in cold water samples from shallow lakes these results imply that sequences from groundwater spring samples potentially come from a putative subsurface habitat with freezing thawing conditions and that groundwater spring connectivity should have a seasonal evolution as suggested by tritium and microbial metagenomic identity transit times derived from hydraulic and isotopic analyses under a year cochand et al 2020 are assumed from the upper reservoir fractions while longer tails fig 4 would be associated with a lower reservoir spring 2 can ultimately be recognized as coming from thawing frozen grounds in late summer but representing a sub decadal recharge meaning it is a mix of both snow and glacial water with multiannual storage this interpretation resembles spring water analyses in siberia showing bipartite composition containing older precipitation recharge and water partly sourced from thawing permafrost hiyama et al 2013 but not a true permafrost thawing origin modulating water input signals into discharge signals arenson et al 2022 in the future with earlier and lesser snowmelt musselman et al 2017 and increased frozen ground degradation evans and ge 2017 the hydrological connectivity could be disrupted by not exceeding necessary wetness thresholds and compromising groundwater storage dynamic green et al 2011 for example in proglacial areas under permafrost conditions the underestimation of river flow can be explained by groundwater temporarily buffering glacier melt somers et al 2019 but also by the neglect of groundwater flow from ephemeral streams draining from hillslopes as well as subsurface seepage from surrounding moraine systems ó dochartaigh et al 2019 these processes will affect the interannual variability of glacier meltwater saberi et al 2019 and future river flow estimations chezik et al 2017 hence the need for timeframes of interannual storage in glacial forelands furthermore as connectivity changes microbial habitats will also be affected for example an increasing temperature in frozen soils could increase the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes taxa luláková et al 2019 and condition microbial communities ballhausen et al 2020 therefore the current genetic taxonomic configuration of such communities then constitutes a proxy for subsurface variations as an indirect way of assessing the temporal variability of groundwater environments future bioinformatics analyses comparing ground ice microbial metagenomics should deliver more concrete ideas on what to expect from samples belonging to seasonal thawing the limitations of the presented methodological strategy require a higher temporal sampling resolution necessary to surpass uncertainties bound to interannual variations of precipitation and ground surface temperatures conditioning infiltration additionally the mixing possibilities for a proglacial aquifer system imply that the retrieved data does not allow discerning between the glacial stream and interstitial ice in terms of their spatiotemporal origin glacier and ground ice background isotopic signatures are also an ideal reference for refining results such as those obtained by the present work nevertheless to avoid the complexity and costs implied in high mountain prospection one complementary option is particle tracking simulations to obtain residence time distribution representing the different possibilities of groundwater storage and flow within a proglacial aquifer this may allow the statistical discretization of groundwater sources especially the subsurface structure which may include transitional layers amongst frozen grounds also subject to inter annual variability of surface temperatures and precipitation additionally the development of environmental tritium derived from atmospheric circulation models and ice cores could be complementary for understanding the variation of tritium as background beyond the scope of modern groundwater 5 conclusions our three year analysis determined multiannual groundwater storage at a proglacial aquifer under permafrost conditions at 33 s in the andes mountains during summer 2019 2021 groundwater springs at proglacial areas presented stable isotope enrichment depleted tritium content and indications of thawing one spring was activated during the late warm season only and its microbial metagenomic analysis by 16s metabarcoding showed taxa common to mountain glaciers and lowland permafrost environments polaromonas and rhodoferax indicating a thawing environment as a source sustaining such psychrophile diversity the hydraulic and isotope derived transit time equations delivered distributions suggesting multiannual groundwater storage under a decade results indicate that proglacial aquifer groundwater recharges from glacial meltwater precipitation and frozen ground sources such as interstitial ice the interpretation is a sub decadal dampening timescale of proglacial groundwater storage which should be considered in hydrological budgets that include paraglacial mountain areas under current ice retreat the integrative methodological strategy was adequate to unveil hydrological timeframes for hydric potential in rapidly evolving proglacial settings within water scarce regions using genetic proxies improves the understanding and interpretation of water samples by indirectly ascribing a likely origin such as a seasonal thawing source and represents a valuable tool to assess remote mountainous areas for preliminary interpretations of their hydrological connections for example if future snowmelt partitioning extends through newly available subsurface flow paths and increases hydrological connectivity then unique microbial habitats would also undergo selective pressure and may constitute a proxy for the subsurface biochemical evolution of frozen proglacial aquifers much work is still required to thoroughly assess complex mountain systems with interconnected cryosphere elements as they often evolve in a nonlinear fashion through different timescales hence the present methodological approach would greatly benefit from higher sampling resolution and further bioinformatic comparison with genetic results from ground and glacial ice samples but also integrating groundwater particle tracking
