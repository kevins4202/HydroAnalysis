10 5 si 6 49 al 5 64 n 2 93 s 1 07 which is in accordance of the precursors present from which bionanocomposite is synthesized the sem b with edx of pb ii loaded bionanocomposite depicts the maximum loading of pb ii onto the surface of adsorbent as spherical beads showing the adherence of pb ii on the available binding sites of functional groups the edx of pb ii loaded bionanocomposite b shows the weight and presence of atoms present in bionanocomposite along with pb ii in the order o 43 25 c 33 51 na 7 43 si 6 54 al 5 38 n 2 90 pb 0 96 s 0 02 the tem image of bionanocomposite fig 2 shows the size ranges found to be in between 1 81 81 nm and 42 9 nm the xrd of bionanocomposite is depicted in fig 3 the xrd shows crystalline nature of bionanocomposite with 2θ values ranging from 7 416 to 73 029 with corresponding d values ranging from 11 91047 to 1 29456 a the large d value indicates the successful modification of zeolite with biopolymer the average crystallite size was found to be 18 96 nm the ftir of xanthan gum xg a zeolite zeo b bionanocomposite bn c and pb ii loaded bionanocomposite pb ii d spectra are depicted in fig 4 the peaks in the range of 3400 cm 1 corresponds to o h n h s h si oh stretching vibration present in xanthan gum glutathione zeolite and bionanocomposite the peaks present in the range of 2800 2900 cm 1 is due to the presence of ch2 stretching vibration in xg bn pb ii the peak in the range of 1600 2200 cm 1 corresponds to c o stretching oh deformation and nh bending vibration present in xg zeo glutathione bn the peak 1653 1637 cm 1 in bn c and pb ii d corresponds to amide linkage which provide evidence of crosslinking between carboxylic group and amine group by edc providing more chelation the peak at 1734 cm 1 corresponds to ester group present in xg a the peaks in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 corresponding ch2 bending vibration the absorption appeared in the region of 800 1200 cm 1 are resulted from stretching bending modes of si o al o present

vibration c c o c c h bending vibration jahangirian et al 2013 chong et al 2014 mollahosseni and toghroli 2015 there is slight shifting of peaks after loading with pb ii d which confirms the involvement of peaks in binding mechanism therefore from above conclusion it can be stated that bionanocomposite is synthesized successfully with ample binding sites for sequestering adsorbate molecules the tga thermogram fig 5 a indicates that the degradation occurs in multistep the xanthan gum xg degradation is explained as follows the initial weight loss occurs at 98 50 c is due to loss of free water the weight loss at 254 98 c is attributed to depolymerization and dehydration of saccharide rings the weight loss at 342 82 c is due to dehydration process scission of cross links and decarboxylation of anion the weight loss curve of bionanocomposite bn is continuous and is shifted towards higher temperature proving better thermal stability of bn as compared to xg and better intercalation of zeolite onto biopolymer matrix the derivative thermogram dtg of xg and bn is depicted in fig 5 b in the thermogram the melting temperature of xg is observed at 296 45 c while for bn tm is shifted at 286 64 c this shift in tm proves better thermal stability and reinforcement of zeolite onto biopolymer matrix mittal et al 2015 3 2 effect of operational factors on adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ph and point of zero charge ppzc the ph is the most important factor influencing the ionization degree and surface property of the adsorbent if the ph of adsorbate solution is more than ppzc favours adsorption of positively charged adsorbate and if ph ppzc favours adsorption of negatively charged adsorbate the ppzc of the bionanocomposite is found to be 8 2 which shows basic nature and hence lower acidity of the adsorbent surface the maximum adsorption capacity of congo red 40 mg g 1 ni ii 42 91 mg g 1 and pb ii 47 98 mg g 1 was found at ph 2 1 4 and 5 respectively at optimum contact time concentration 50 mg l 1 and 30 c the anionic dye removal could be explained as follows the maximum adsorption capacity is achieved in acidic medium because there is strong electrostatic attraction between the solution of congo red exists as cationic form and surface of adsorbent having negative charge as the ph is increased the solution of congo red exists as anionic form and hence there is strong electrostatic repulsion and also oh exists in the basic medium which further decreases the adsorption capacity salman et al 2015 abbas and trari 2015 the increased in adsorption capacity of metal ion with increased in ph may be explained on the basis of a decreased in competition between h and positively charged metal ion as ph increases positive charge decreases near the surface and hence repulsion decreases there is formation of lower solubility hydrolyzed product at ph 3 i e m oh and m oh 2 shuhong et al 2014 3 2 2 effect of contact time and kinetic study the maximum adsorption capacity for ni ii pb ii and congo red cr is reached in 120 min 120 min and 240 min respectively it is apparent that the adsorption of adsorbate is rapid at the initial stage and then become slow after equilibrium is reached this could be explained as there are large number of vacant active surface sites available for adsorption in initial stages that led to a fast mass transfer afterwards the decreased rate is attributed to the diminishing availability of the remaining active surface sites to analyze the rate mechanism and rate controlling step of adsorption behavior of adsorbate onto adsorbent various kinetic models were tested namely pseudo first order eq 3 pseudo second order eq 4 intraparticle diffusion eq 5 and elovich equation eq 6 the models were expressed by the following equations 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 4 t q t t q e q e 2 k 2 5 q t k i d t 1 2 c 6 q t a b ln t where qe qt are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 min 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 are pseudo first order and pseudo second order constants respectively kid mg g 1 min 1 2 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c is the intercept indicating the thickness of boundary layer a mg g 1 min 1 and b g mg 1 are elovich constants ahmad and mirza 2015 the parameters of various kinetic models were summarized in table 1 the correlation coefficient r2 was highest for pseudo second order model fig 6 in addition the values of qe cal obtained from pseudo second order model were much closer to the qe exp this however showed that the adsorption kinetic process fitted well with pseudo second order rate equation which indicated that overall process was controlled by chemisorption and involved valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent ahmad and mirza 2015 as the value of c is non zero proving adsorption involves a complex process and intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate determining steps the plot of intraparticle diffusion model shows multilinearity of adsorbate adsorption implying that two or more steps occurring in adsorption process the first linear portion is attributed to external diffusion while second linear stage ascribed to the intraparticle diffusion as a delayed process the third linear portion shows the equilibrium establishment kumar et al 2014a figure not shown 3 3 adsorption isotherms in order to investigate the nature of adsorption process various adsorption isotherm models were studied namely langmuir eq 7 freundlich eq 8 temkin eq 9 and dubinin radushkevich d r eq 10 at 30 c the expressions for these models respectively are given as follows 7 q e k f c e 1 n 8 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 9 q e b t ln k t c e 10 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qe and qm are the adsorption capacity mg g 1 at equilibrium and monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 c0 and ce are adsorbate initial and equilibrium concentration respectively mg l 1 kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich isotherm constant n is the indication of adsorption intensity kt l mg 1 and bt j mol 1 are temkin constants related to the equilibrium binding constant and the heat of adsorption respectively β is the isotherm constant related to parameter e mean free energy per molecule of adsorbate kj mol 1 as eq 11 11 e 1 2 β polanyi potential ɛ is related to ce as eq 12 12 ε r t 1 1 c e where r and t respectively are gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k foo and hameed 2010 the values of various isotherm parameters at 30 c were tabulated in table 1 it can be inferred from the value of r2 that the best fitted model for adsorption process is freundlich isotherm model implying heterogeneous surface of adsorbent fig 7 a value above 1 for n implies chemisorption process as depicted from this study the qm mg g 1 values from langmuir model for ni ii pb ii and congo red were 101 271 109 073 and 96 313 mg g 1 respectively the separation factor a dimensionless constant rl is defined as eq 13 13 r l 1 1 b c 0 the value of rl 0 rl 1 is lower reflecting favourable adsorption process abbas and trari 2015 the values of binding constant kt shows the more binding of pb ii than ni ii owing to its higher hydrated ionic radii and the electronegativity in aqueous solution of metallic species mobasherpour et al 2012 hernandez montoya et al 2013 as the value of e lies in between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption process is may occur by ion exchange process also barakat and kumar 2014 3 4 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic parameters including enthalpy δh kj mol 1 entropy δs kj k 1 mol 1 gibbs free energy δg kj mol 1 were calculated using the following eqs 14 16 14 k c c 0 c e c e 15 δ g r t ln k c 16 log k c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t where t is the absolute temperature k kc is the distribution coefficient r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 δg was calculated at temperature 30 c 40 c and 50 c the values of δh and δs were evaluated from a plot of log kc v s 1 t fig 8 the values of various thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 2 the values of thermodynamic parameters revealed that the process is endothermic in nature and increased randomness at solid liquid interface during adsorption of adsorbate on adsorbent as inferred from positive value of δh and δs kumar et al 2014b the lower magnitude of δh shows physical forces are involved in adsorption process kumar et al 2014b the negative values of δg with magnitude lower than 20 kj mol 1 shows physical adsorption reconfirming previous result with spontaneous nature and magnitude increasing with increasing temperature kumar et al 2014b 3 5 desorption with regeneration the desorption result shows that the best desorbing agent for pb ii ni ii are h2o and naoh for congo red the desorption of pb ii and ni ii in h2o suggests the involvement of physical forces in adsorption process affirming thermodynamic result in order to make the process more economical the adsorption desorption regeneration cycles were repeated for five cycles the regeneration lasts upto five cycles without appreciable loss of adsorption capacity the desorption in first cycle was almost 100 and it goes to approximately 60 in fifth cycle fig 9 3 6 comparison of monolayer adsorption capacity qm the comparison of monolayer adsorption capacity of various adsorbents on pb ii ni ii and congo red as reported in literature is presented in table 3 it is evident from the table that the present bionanocomposite exhibits excellent adsorption capacity among various other adsorbents reported earlier 4 conclusion the present study shows successful synthesis of novel xanthan gum glutathione zeolite bionanocomposite that have been explored for the sequestration of heavy metals pb ii and ni ii in accordance of hydrated ionic radii and anionic dye congo red respectively a contact time of 120 min 120 min and 240 min and ph of 4 5 and 2 1 is optimum value for attaining the maximum efficiencies of 42 91 47 98 and 40 mg g 1 for ni ii pb ii and congo red respectively the point of zero charge was observed at 8 2 which shows basic nature of adsorbent the kinetic data follows pseudo second order model suggesting that the chemisorption was the rate limiting step the freundlich isotherm model gave the best fit for the experimental data indicating heterogeneous nature of adsorbent the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities for pb ii ni ii and congo red were 109 07 101 27 96 31 mg g 1 respectively which is in harmony with the experimental result the thermodynamic studies shows endothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption with increased randomness at solid liquid interface the desorption and regeneration was best done by h2o for pb ii and ni ii and naoh for congo red with excellent regenerating power upto fifth cycle the overall mechanism of adsorption involves ion exchange process physical forces precipitation at higher ph and chemical forces are involved in sequestering adsorbate molecules with chemisorption as the rate limiting step in overall adsorption process therefore the present bionanocomposite have been proved to be an excellent and feasible adsorbent that can be explored for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the chairman

10 5 si 6 49 al 5 64 n 2 93 s 1 07 which is in accordance of the precursors present from which bionanocomposite is synthesized the sem b with edx of pb ii loaded bionanocomposite depicts the maximum loading of pb ii onto the surface of adsorbent as spherical beads showing the adherence of pb ii on the available binding sites of functional groups the edx of pb ii loaded bionanocomposite b shows the weight and presence of atoms present in bionanocomposite along with pb ii in the order o 43 25 c 33 51 na 7 43 si 6 54 al 5 38 n 2 90 pb 0 96 s 0 02 the tem image of bionanocomposite fig 2 shows the size ranges found to be in between 1 81 81 nm and 42 9 nm the xrd of bionanocomposite is depicted in fig 3 the xrd shows crystalline nature of bionanocomposite with 2θ values ranging from 7 416 to 73 029 with corresponding d values ranging from 11 91047 to 1 29456 a the large d value indicates the successful modification of zeolite with biopolymer the average crystallite size was found to be 18 96 nm the ftir of xanthan gum xg a zeolite zeo b bionanocomposite bn c and pb ii loaded bionanocomposite pb ii d spectra are depicted in fig 4 the peaks in the range of 3400 cm 1 corresponds to o h n h s h si oh stretching vibration present in xanthan gum glutathione zeolite and bionanocomposite the peaks present in the range of 2800 2900 cm 1 is due to the presence of ch2 stretching vibration in xg bn pb ii the peak in the range of 1600 2200 cm 1 corresponds to c o stretching oh deformation and nh bending vibration present in xg zeo glutathione bn the peak 1653 1637 cm 1 in bn c and pb ii d corresponds to amide linkage which provide evidence of crosslinking between carboxylic group and amine group by edc providing more chelation the peak at 1734 cm 1 corresponds to ester group present in xg a the peaks in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 corresponding ch2 bending vibration the absorption appeared in the region of 800 1200 cm 1 are resulted from stretching bending modes of si o al o present in zeolite framework ch2 wagging rocking vibration c n c o stretching vibration the bands in the range of 400 800 cm 1 corresponds to c s stretching c oh vibration si o si deformation al o si vibration c c o c c h bending vibration jahangirian et al 2013 chong et al 2014 mollahosseni and toghroli 2015 there is slight shifting of peaks after loading with pb ii d which confirms the involvement of peaks in binding mechanism therefore from above conclusion it can be stated that bionanocomposite is synthesized successfully with ample binding sites for sequestering adsorbate molecules the tga thermogram fig 5 a indicates that the degradation occurs in multistep the xanthan gum xg degradation is explained as follows the initial weight loss occurs at 98 50 c is due to loss of free water the weight loss at 254 98 c is attributed to depolymerization and dehydration of saccharide rings the weight loss at 342 82 c is due to dehydration process scission of cross links and decarboxylation of anion the weight loss curve of bionanocomposite bn is continuous and is shifted towards higher temperature proving better thermal stability of bn as compared to xg and better intercalation of zeolite onto biopolymer matrix the derivative thermogram dtg of xg and bn is depicted in fig 5 b in the thermogram the melting temperature of xg is observed at 296 45 c while for bn tm is shifted at 286 64 c this shift in tm proves better thermal stability and reinforcement of zeolite onto biopolymer matrix mittal et al 2015 3 2 effect of operational factors on adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ph and point of zero charge ppzc the ph is the most important factor influencing the ionization degree and surface property of the adsorbent if the ph of adsorbate solution is more than ppzc favours adsorption of positively charged adsorbate and if ph ppzc favours adsorption of negatively charged adsorbate the ppzc of the bionanocomposite is found to be 8 2 which shows basic nature and hence lower acidity of the adsorbent surface the maximum adsorption capacity of congo red 40 mg g 1 ni ii 42 91 mg g 1 and pb ii 47 98 mg g 1 was found at ph 2 1 4 and 5 respectively at optimum contact time concentration 50 mg l 1 and 30 c the anionic dye removal could be explained as follows the maximum adsorption capacity is achieved in acidic medium because there is strong electrostatic attraction between the solution of congo red exists as cationic form and surface of adsorbent having negative charge as the ph is increased the solution of congo red exists as anionic form and hence there is strong electrostatic repulsion and also oh exists in the basic medium which further decreases the adsorption capacity salman et al 2015 abbas and trari 2015 the increased in adsorption capacity of metal ion with increased in ph may be explained on the basis of a decreased in competition between h and positively charged metal ion as ph increases positive charge decreases near the surface and hence repulsion decreases there is formation of lower solubility hydrolyzed product at ph 3 i e m oh and m oh 2 shuhong et al 2014 3 2 2 effect of contact time and kinetic study the maximum adsorption capacity for ni ii pb ii and congo red cr is reached in 120 min 120 min and 240 min respectively it is apparent that the adsorption of adsorbate is rapid at the initial stage and then become slow after equilibrium is reached this could be explained as there are large number of vacant active surface sites available for adsorption in initial stages that led to a fast mass transfer afterwards the decreased rate is attributed to the diminishing availability of the remaining active surface sites to analyze the rate mechanism and rate controlling step of adsorption behavior of adsorbate onto adsorbent various kinetic models were tested namely pseudo first order eq 3 pseudo second order eq 4 intraparticle diffusion eq 5 and elovich equation eq 6 the models were expressed by the following equations 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 4 t q t t q e q e 2 k 2 5 q t k i d t 1 2 c 6 q t a b ln t where qe qt are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 min 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 are pseudo first order and pseudo second order constants respectively kid mg g 1 min 1 2 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c is the intercept indicating the thickness of boundary layer a mg g 1 min 1 and b g mg 1 are elovich constants ahmad and mirza 2015 the parameters of various kinetic models were summarized in table 1 the correlation coefficient r2 was highest for pseudo second order model fig 6 in addition the values of qe cal obtained from pseudo second order model were much closer to the qe exp this however showed that the adsorption kinetic process fitted well with pseudo second order rate equation which indicated that overall process was controlled by chemisorption and involved valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent ahmad and mirza 2015 as the value of c is non zero proving adsorption involves a complex process and intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate determining steps the plot of intraparticle diffusion model shows multilinearity of adsorbate adsorption implying that two or more steps occurring in adsorption process the first linear portion is attributed to external diffusion while second linear stage ascribed to the intraparticle diffusion as a delayed process the third linear portion shows the equilibrium establishment kumar et al 2014a figure not shown 3 3 adsorption isotherms in order to investigate the nature of adsorption process various adsorption isotherm models were studied namely langmuir eq 7 freundlich eq 8 temkin eq 9 and dubinin radushkevich d r eq 10 at 30 c the expressions for these models respectively are given as follows 7 q e k f c e 1 n 8 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 9 q e b t ln k t c e 10 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qe and qm are the adsorption capacity mg g 1 at equilibrium and monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 c0 and ce are adsorbate initial and equilibrium concentration respectively mg l 1 kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich isotherm constant n is the indication of adsorption intensity kt l mg 1 and bt j mol 1 are temkin constants related to the equilibrium binding constant and the heat of adsorption respectively β is the isotherm constant related to parameter e mean free energy per molecule of adsorbate kj mol 1 as eq 11 11 e 1 2 β polanyi potential ɛ is related to ce as eq 12 12 ε r t 1 1 c e where r and t respectively are gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k foo and hameed 2010 the values of various isotherm parameters at 30 c were tabulated in table 1 it can be inferred from the value of r2 that the best fitted model for adsorption process is freundlich isotherm model implying heterogeneous surface of adsorbent fig 7 a value above 1 for n implies chemisorption process as depicted from this study the qm mg g 1 values from langmuir model for ni ii pb ii and congo red were 101 271 109 073 and 96 313 mg g 1 respectively the separation factor a dimensionless constant rl is defined as eq 13 13 r l 1 1 b c 0 the value of rl 0 rl 1 is lower reflecting favourable adsorption process abbas and trari 2015 the values of binding constant kt shows the more binding of pb ii than ni ii owing to its higher hydrated ionic radii and the electronegativity in aqueous solution of metallic species mobasherpour et al 2012 hernandez montoya et al 2013 as the value of e lies in between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 indicating that the adsorption process is may occur by ion exchange process also barakat and kumar 2014 3 4 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic parameters including enthalpy δh kj mol 1 entropy δs kj k 1 mol 1 gibbs free energy δg kj mol 1 were calculated using the following eqs 14 16 14 k c c 0 c e c e 15 δ g r t ln k c 16 log k c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t where t is the absolute temperature k kc is the distribution coefficient r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 δg was calculated at temperature 30 c 40 c and 50 c the values of δh and δs were evaluated from a plot of log kc v s 1 t fig 8 the values of various thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 2 the values of thermodynamic parameters revealed that the process is endothermic in nature and increased randomness at solid liquid interface during adsorption of adsorbate on adsorbent as inferred from positive value of δh and δs kumar et al 2014b the lower magnitude of δh shows physical forces are involved in adsorption process kumar et al 2014b the negative values of δg with magnitude lower than 20 kj mol 1 shows physical adsorption reconfirming previous result with spontaneous nature and magnitude increasing with increasing temperature kumar et al 2014b 3 5 desorption with regeneration the desorption result shows that the best desorbing agent for pb ii ni ii are h2o and naoh for congo red the desorption of pb ii and ni ii in h2o suggests the involvement of physical forces in adsorption process affirming thermodynamic result in order to make the process more economical the adsorption desorption regeneration cycles were repeated for five cycles the regeneration lasts upto five cycles without appreciable loss of adsorption capacity the desorption in first cycle was almost 100 and it goes to approximately 60 in fifth cycle fig 9 3 6 comparison of monolayer adsorption capacity qm the comparison of monolayer adsorption capacity of various adsorbents on pb ii ni ii and congo red as reported in literature is presented in table 3 it is evident from the table that the present bionanocomposite exhibits excellent adsorption capacity among various other adsorbents reported earlier 4 conclusion the present study shows successful synthesis of novel xanthan gum glutathione zeolite bionanocomposite that have been explored for the sequestration of heavy metals pb ii and ni ii in accordance of hydrated ionic radii and anionic dye congo red respectively a contact time of 120 min 120 min and 240 min and ph of 4 5 and 2 1 is optimum value for attaining the maximum efficiencies of 42 91 47 98 and 40 mg g 1 for ni ii pb ii and congo red respectively the point of zero charge was observed at 8 2 which shows basic nature of adsorbent the kinetic data follows pseudo second order model suggesting that the chemisorption was the rate limiting step the freundlich isotherm model gave the best fit for the experimental data indicating heterogeneous nature of adsorbent the langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities for pb ii ni ii and congo red were 109 07 101 27 96 31 mg g 1 respectively which is in harmony with the experimental result the thermodynamic studies shows endothermic and spontaneous nature of adsorption with increased randomness at solid liquid interface the desorption and regeneration was best done by h2o for pb ii and ni ii and naoh for congo red with excellent regenerating power upto fifth cycle the overall mechanism of adsorption involves ion exchange process physical forces precipitation at higher ph and chemical forces are involved in sequestering adsorbate molecules with chemisorption as the rate limiting step in overall adsorption process therefore the present bionanocomposite have been proved to be an excellent and feasible adsorbent that can be explored for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the chairman

12366,lead contamination in groundwater has raised serious health concerns the traditional technologies available for lead removal are having several shortcomings hence biosorption is considered as a potential eco friendly alternative to the existing methods in the present work several ground water samples were collected from different lead contaminated regions of iii and iv phase of peenya industrial area from bengaluru district of karnataka india these ground water samples were used as a source to isolate bacteria with distinct morphological characteristics which were identified as bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 that were tested for their biosorption properties the interactive effect of initial lead concentration versus contact time was studied using response surface methodology rsm while the biosorbent dosage was kept constant the biosorption kinetics was investigated for the isolates and the results studies indicated that the biosorption charted pseudo second order kinetic model and it provided the best fit for the bacterial species for lead biosorption graphical

introduction on a global scale lead has emerged to be one of the most lethal contaminant present in the surroundings laidlaw et al 2017 in the past few years as a result of high amount of emissions in the atmosphere and effluent release into the soil reservoirs sediments and water bodies lead has caused an adverse effect on the environment and humans as a result of this several approaches and guidelines were introduced by environmental protection authorities and international organizations åberg et al 1999 naturally lead exists in four different stable isotopes of 204pb 206pb 207pb and 208pb according to garcia et al 1998 and juberg 2000 these stable molecules can act as tracing elements to study environmental lead metabolism several anthropogenic processes has disturbed the natural lead cycle that has occurred due to the sudden increase in lead ore processing units and greater release of aerosol emissions the world health organization has given the tolerable limit of lead intake in a week as 0 025 mg kg of the body weight järup 2003 and tyler 1982 in their studies stated that when present in water bodies this lead can be toxic to the organisms present in the water the plants and also to the people surrounding the contaminated sites as lead is more consistently distributed when compared to other metals lead is competently scavenged by surrounding particles resulting in effective transport of lead in particulate phases accounting for lead accumulation maring et al 1987 there are several factors such as ph organic matter and metal concentration in the soil that influences the accumulation of lead on the other hand when microbes are used for biosorption process then their biochemical composition size of the organism decomposition process and duration of contact also plays an important role lodenius et al 1981 zurera cosano et al 1989 some studies have also indicated that in humans the interfaces among calcium phosphorus iron zinc may play an important role in lead absorption the modifications in nucleic acid conformation the alteration of proteins and osmolality and disruption of membranes are few other reasons for lead induced toxicity jarosławiecka and piotrowska seget 2014 exhaustive human activities and environmental exploitation of natural deposits has led to metal resistant microbes that are able to uptake higher concentration of metals bruins et al 2000 lead can easily enter the ecosystem through metal smelting insecticides battery pigments paints etc the ground water can get contaminated mainly due to the lead pipes and soldering whereas volcanic emissions and lead mobilization can contribute only to a minor pollution spiro et al 2012 lee and schwab 2005 the health effects caused due to lead toxicity include anorexia diarrhea anemia osteoporosis emaciation and mainly neurodegenerative disorders as lead has high affinity towards calcium binding sites that replaces calcium in the prime regions such as the central nervous system swarup and dwivedi 2002 sonkusare et al 2005 goyer 1997 lead can readily bind with iron and thus result in iron deficiency in humans kwong et al 2004 sulfhydryl groups koivula and eeva 2010 and its association with zinc binding sites have been of certain significance in heme synthesis pathway schwalfenberg and genuis 2015 vakifahmetoglu norberg et al al 2017 it can also replace cations leading to inhibition of the associated enzymes such as anti oxidative enzyme inhibition protein kinase c activation aminolevulinic acid dehydratase alad inhibition and lead circulation in the body during calcium requirement french et al 2017 elias et al 1982 along with alteration of calcium facilitated cellular routes resulting in modifications of regulatory proteins deposition of lead in apatite matrices and membrane vesicles or loss of structural integrity pounds and cory slechta 1993 pounds et al 1991 being equivalent to calcium biogeochemically lead is incorporated into trophic and metabolic pathways burnett and patterson 1980 the significant site of lead exposure is the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems that accumulate the lead in soft tissues such as liver and kidney that affects the metabolic processes cell proliferation enzyme levels expression of neurotrophins cytochrome p4501a2 and aminopyrene n demethylase activity mudipalli 2007 higher concentration of lead in the blood has also been seen due to the occupational exposure that can further cause cognitive and behavioral abnormality peripheral neuropathy anemia and reproductive disorders goyer 1990 volatile components such as tetraethyl lead and tetra methyl lead are used widely as fuel additives lead is toxic and the environmental factors that contribute to this toxicity are lead sulphide ores that undergoes weathering and subsurface deposits that are rich in inert form of lead human intervention in activities such as smelting mining refining galvanization spray painting manufacturing and recycling allows the lead to get escaped into the water soil and air tong et al 2000 products that contain lead such as paints inks glazed pots battery casings water pipes and gasoline also add up to this yet another route of lead entering into the environment is through fertilizers and pesticides fuels used in combustion engines ceramic tablewares etc flora et al 2006 the presence of lead can be detected by destroying the organic matrix using oxidants and strong acids by implying methods such as colorimetry or spectrophotometry but these methods are not very sensitive due to which better processes such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas sperling et al 1992 and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icpaes became familiar ivaldi et al 1991 and yoshinaga 1996 the specificity of lead can be determined by its biomolecular species identification that can be done by nmr spectroscopy and ion chromatography systems wrackmeyer et al 1989 the two electrochemical procedures that are being widely used these days are differential pulse polarography dpp and anodic stripping voltammetry asv as suggested by wang 1982 and galus et al 1988 few other powerful analytical techniques to measure lead are x ray fluorescence xrf thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims glow discharge mass spectrometry gdms laser microprobe mass analysis spectrometry lamma proton induced x ray emission pixe is a relatively todd and chettle 1994 turnlund et al 1993 heumann et al 1998 koleleni 1998 electron x ray microprobe is one exceptional method by which regions of relatively high metal concentrations can be identified at the cellular and intracellular level inclusive of the cytosolic regions thomson et al 1985 there are several methods of lead removal which have been previously mentioned in various research articles but no method provides complete elimination various studies have been done where lead has been removed from water using micellar enhanced ultrafiltration gzara et al 2000 by fixed bed column exchange using natural zeolite clinoptilolite with sodium nitrate solution medvidović et al 2006 or by using cnt magnesium oxide composite in the column with a higher contact time saleh and gupta 2012 granular blast furnace slag gbfs packed columns also decreased the lead concentration selectively even in the occurrence of other metals as stated by dimitrova 2002 precipitation of lead aqueous solutions using sodium di n octyl phosphinate esalah et al 2000 alongwith coagulation and precipitation using seawater liquid bittern added to alkalized wastewater could culminate high amount of lead ayoub et al 2001 some other coagulants that can be used for this process are aluminium sulfate polyaluminium chloride and magnesium chloride by varying the ph of the solution pang et al 2011 use of carbon nanotubes is another efficient adsorber of lead li et al 2002 nano filtration can help in clearing good amount of lead but it requires bulky installation and heavy maintenance volesky 2001 biosorption of lead using living and non living biomass of bacteria fungi algae etc have been efficient and economic volesky and holan 1995 the adsorption process can be extracellular or it can be an accumulation process which takes places intracellularly this method can sequester target metal ions in industrial effluent treatment process where complex ion matrix or high volume of metal ions needs to be eliminated or removed earlier several bacteria have been used for biosorption process wong et al 2001 zouboulis et al 2004 srinath et al 2002 treated or modified activated carbon was used by operating static and column mode where effect of various process variables such as bed height hydraulic loading rate and initial feed concentration on the adsorption was studied followed by column regeneration using different molar concentration of nitric acid goel et al 2005 the adsorption of lead on valonia tannin resin was studied using a batch adsorber where the experimental isotherm data was analyzed using the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich equations özacar et al 2008 undaria pinnatifida was used for lead removal and it showed a remarkable lead uptake in the range of 3 4 due to the alginic acid present in its cell wall kim et al 1995 there are several studies where adsorption of lead has been studied using bacteria in one such study by rivera utrilla et al 2001 lead adsorption on activated carbon was studied in the presence of e coli bacteria was adsorbed the carbon to which the lead ions were bound to the biomass of pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21 was used to the study the sorption of lead copper and cadmium ions the kinetic models and desorption studies were done to reuse the biomass chang et al 1997 lead resistant bacterial strains were isolated from river sediments and were screened for their ability to produce bioflocculants bowman et al 2018 lead resistant providencia vermicola strain sj2a was isolated from the discard of a battery industry and it was found that there was a plasmid borne metallothionein gene that aided in resistance of lead sharma et al 2017 the initial minimum inhibitory concentration lead ions were examined to check its optimum concentration for the growth of sulfur reducing bacteria the optimization of various parameters was done using box behnken design model of response surface methodology verma et al 2017 hence in the present work the efficiency of bacterial biomass to accumulate lead ion is being studied bacteria were isolated from the ground water samples of peenya industrial area of bengaluru region in karnataka further studies were done to understand the relation between the initial lead concentration that was kept as 5 mg l and contact time using response surface methodology 2 methods 2 1 sample collection peenya industrial area of bengaluru urban district is located in the southeastern part of karnataka at a latitude of 13 0 54 66 n to 13 1 50 96 n and a longitude of 77 30 21 76 e to 77 31 21 1 e as shown in fig 1 and is spread across an area of peenya is known for its collection of metal textile leather and pharmaceutical industries and is also known for its groundwater contamination shankar et al 2008 ground water samples were collected from the iii and iv phase of peenya industrial area in cleaned polyethylene bottles by the method of random sampling the bottles were capped immediately to prevent air passage inhabitant bacteria native to the ground water were later isolated and its distinct morphological colony characters were studied 2 2 estimation of lead lead in ground water samples was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo jarrell ash usa whereas lead accumulation of bacteria was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas method lead nitrate was used for the preparation of a stock solution of lead 100 mg l by dissolving a suitable quantity in deionized water to be used for accumulation studies 2 3 isolation and screening of bacteria lead resistant bacterial strains were isolated from ground water samples of iii and iv phase of peenya industrial area from bengaluru district of karnataka india samples were serially diluted 10 10 000 fold in sterile distilled water and plated on different culture media such as nutrient agar peptone beef extract agar sodium chloride and distilled water that maintains the growth of non fastidious organisms tryptic soy agar digests of casein and soybean meal agar sodium chloride and distilled water that provides growth for anaerobes aerobes and micro aerophiles mannitol salt agar peptone d mannitol sodium chloride agar phenol red and distilled water which acts as a

water is used for the differentiation of enterobacteriaceae species and salmonella shigella agar beef extract enzymatic digest of casein and animal tissue lactose bile salts sodium citrate sodium thiosulfate ferric citrate brilliant green neutral red agar and distilled water that is a selective media for salmonella species to isolate resistant strains the media were amended with 50 mg l pb ii and a standard spread plate method was performed the inoculated plates were incubated for 24 48 h at 37 c after which larger identical colonies from each plate were isolated the most effective bacterial strains for the biosorption of pb ii were identified according to bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 2 4 identification of bacteria genomic dna isolation amplification and sequencing of bacterial samples was carried out using 16 s internal transcribed spacer s its primers the its region of bacterial dna was amplified using the specific primer set 27f agagtttgatcmtggctcag and 1492r tacggytaccttgttacgactt pcr was performed in a total volume of 50 µl and the reaction mixture contained 5 µl of 10x pcr buffer 2 µl of dntp mixture 1 µl of each primer and 1 µl of taq polymerase 5 µl of the template and diluted to a final volume of 35 µl with de ionized distilled water pcr was conducted using a thermal cycler geneamp pcr system 9700 perkin elmer ca usa to subject the reaction mix to 35 cycles of the following reaction conditions denaturation at 94 c for 30 s primer annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 1 min followed by final extension for 7 min at 72 c to ensure full extension of the products elfering et al 2002 100 bp g biosciences ladder was used the amplified pcr products were then analyzed in 1 0 w v agarose gel further the pcr products were purified with a pcr products purification kit aristogene pcr product purification kit and were sequenced by medauxin private limited bangalore to analyze the bacterial species dna sequence of the its 16s rrna related sequences were obtained from the genbank the sequence was compared with the blast program from the national center for biotechnological information ncbi for the identification of the species drancourt et al 2004 the organism was identified based on the highest homology of the sequence with sequence available in the database fig 2 indicates the flow diagram for isolation screening and identification of bacteria 2 5 bacterial characterization bacterial identification can be done by comparing the sequences of small sub units of rrna of the isolated strains the phylogeny obtained by aiming at the elongation factors alternate markers like larger subunits and atpases alongwith data retrieval from evolutionarily conserved molecules have proven that the 16 s rrna sequencing method based trees replicate the antiquity of the organisms globally ludwig and schleifer 1994 ludwig et al 1998 the tree topology can be based on various data sets markers and methods of tree creation here the genes susceptible to lateral gene transfer and gene duplication must be considered with care as their phylogeny may be different than the species under study and the orthologs should be in clear distinction to paralogs ludwig et al 1998 the homologous traits designate shared ancestry and can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary link between various species whereas the similar traits that are present in unrelated organisms are analogous after sorting out the homologs and analogs the organisms are grouped into a single section based on its common single ancestor this approach of organization is cladistics and all organisms having same ancestor fall into a single clade that originates from a single point on the tree which can vary in size then the evolutionary events that led to acquire a common trait are found out it is challenging to differentiate between the features that took place as a result of shared ancestry to the ones that ascended independently these traits can be lost or gained over the time and it varies in different branches but the amount of information what these trees give us is much bigger than the data obtained using physical traits and information acquired through gene or amino acid the 16s rrna sequencing method through a targeted approach can acquire data for the sequences that are homologous to the sequence of interest as well as align them being cost effective and accurate when compared to protein sequencing ludwig et al 1998 the protein based trees are unable to support the data of certain proteobacteria that have a common ancestor but as the sub classes get introduced into the phylogeny it stands in agreement with the rrna based trees ludwig et al 1993 the recent approach of phylogeny using tetra nucleotide frequencies have shown higher resemblance to the trees generated via 16s rrna sequencing takahashi et al 2009 classifying bacteria using oligonucleotide frequency method helps in establishing link with associated species one of the unnoticed issues has been the differences in the rrna gene regions of multiple operons in the same organism here the sequencing protocols based only on rrna or amplified rdna will not help but a combination of expressed rrna genes must be analyzed alongwith denaturing gradient electrophoresis and straight cloning of diverse rrna operons that would provide much reliable information ludwig et al 1993 ludwig et al 1998 sometimes to identify the minute differences at intra and interspecies levels the phylogenetic relationships along with the study of protein encoding genes is essential carrasco et al 2013 but there have been studies where it was difficult to identify the organisms at the species level on the basis of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis the bacteria were identified as bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 as represented in fig 3 a e the bacterial nucleotide sequences of these five species were submitted to the genbank of ncbi with the submission numbers as listed in table 1 2 6 selection of the bacterial species in this study isolation of different bacteria was done on the basis of the whole colony type such as circular rhizoid irregular or filamentous edges such as lobated undulated or curled surface such as smooth rough or wrinkled and finally on the basis of elevation such as flat raised or convexed around six different types of bacterial strains were identified isolated and cultured initially using nutrient agar 0 5 peptone 0 3 beef extract 1 5 agar 0 5 sodium chloride and distilled water the identified strains were escherichia coli bacillus toyonensis bacillus anthracis acinetobacter baumannii bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa species later these strains were treated with lead and the growth of these bacteria was monitored to select five lead resistant species that could be used for further studies 2 7 preparation of bacteria as a biosorbent all the five lead resistant bacterial species were grown aerobically using luria bertani broth 10 g l tryptone 10 g l sodium chloride and 5 g l yeast extract in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of media at 37 c for 40 h on a rotary shaker 140 rpm the obtained biomass was treated with varied concentrations of lead for experimental flasks whereas control sets were not treated with lead the bacterial pellets obtained after centrifugation and were separated washed with deionized water multiple times freeze dried and then used for biosorption experiments binupriya et al 2007 2 8 bio sorption experiments fifty milliliter solution of lead was prepared with pb no3 2 from sigma aldrich co at different concentrations ranging from 5 mg l to 15 mg l without adjusting ph lead concentration of 5 mg l to 15 mg l was taken as the bacterial strains could not grow above 15 mg l of lead the lowest concentration of metal that totally disallowed the growth of bacteria was the minimal inhibitory concentration mic lead concentrations below 5 mg l were considered to be very less to study effective biosorption experiments were carried out in 250 ml polypropylene flasks by adding a constant amount of biosorbent that was 0 1 gm to the desired concentrations of lead solutions and agitating the flasks at 200 rpm in a rotary shaker incubator for a specific period of time ranging from 60 min to 180 min at 25 c the solution was then filtered using 0 25 µm pore size filter to separate the biomass the filtrate was then analyzed for determining the lead concentration by aas saraswat and rai 2010 specific metal uptake by the cells was then calculated from the difference between the initial and final concentration of lead ions the percentage biosorption was calculated using eq 1 1 percentage of biosorption c 0 c e c 0 100 the amount of lead adsorbed or accumulated per gram of adsorbent after equilibrium qe was calculated using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where co and ce mg l represent the concentrations of the lead ion present initially and at equilibrium in the solution respectively v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g the response surface methodology was used to assess the interactive effect of lead concentration and contact time at more levels with minimal number of experiments suggested by central composite design effects and complex interactions of each process variable were later evaluated the results were analyzed by applying the contour plots and analysis of variance anova borror et al 2002 the quadratic equation model for predicting the optimal point was expressed according to eq 3 3 y β 0 i k β i x i i i k β i i x i 2 i j β i j x i x j where y is the predicted response xi xj refer to the independent variables and β0 βi βii βij are the regression coefficients biosorption depends upon the quantity or dosage of a biosorbent studies suggest that smaller quantity of biosorbent have resulted in higher uptake of metal ions aksu and çağatay 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2006 while using higher biosorbent dosage the accessible metal ions present in the solution become deficient to shield the existing exchangeable sites on the sorbent leading to lower uptake gadd and de rome 1988 tangaromsuk et al 2002 due to these reasons the biosorbent dosage was fixed as 0 1 gm and kept constant throughout the experiments 2 9 surface characterization of biosorbents to determine the nature of functional groups on the cell wall for metal sorption potentiometric titration of an aqueous cellular suspension and ir spectrum analysis of the solid phase biomass were performed fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of biosorbents before and after adsorption were recorded li et al 2017 the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and freeze dried overnight ftir analysis was carried out at room temperature on spectrum two in service lubricant analysis system from perkinelmer waltham ma at a resolution of 2 cm 1 in the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 for studying the chemical groups on the surface of the bacteria to evaluate the properties of functional groups we can consider a chemical model incorporating the reactions between the groups of bacteria and the protons in the solution the reactions and equilibrium constants ka kb of certain functional groups may be defined as given below in the eqs 4 and 5 4 ah a h k a a h ah 5 bh b h k b b h bh where a b and ah bh represent the concentration of deprotonated and protonated surface species respectively and h represents the activity of protons in solution 3 results 3 1 characterization of biosorbents the main functional groups present on bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 that were responsible for biosorption of lead ions were found using the ftir spectra hasson et al 1998 fig 4 a e depicts the ftir spectra of the bacterial biomass before and after lead biosorption the groups present on the biomass of bacillus toyonensis sce1 were similar to that of the strains sce4 and sce5 the broadband range of 3200 3400 cm 1 denotes the presence of n h bond of amino groups associated with oh groups the relative differences in band intensity are similar to the differences in the concentrations of the respective functional groups associated with the bands the broad band at 3200 3500 cm 1 regions specifies the interaction between amine and hydroxyl groups with biomass the small peak around 2850 cm 1 is due to the presence of alkyl group c h and at 1631 cm 1 may be due to the involvement of double bond structures such as c o or c c groups the peak in the region of 1535 cm 1 may be attributed to n h bending in the amine group or due to the absorption of nitrates the band observed at 1050 cm 1 denotes c o stretching of carboxylic acids thus the bacterial biomass is expected to possess hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups on its surface as significant sorption sites table 2 in the lead biosorbed bacterial biomass a significant manifested peak at 2925 cm 1 was observed indicating the interaction of c h groups whereas another peak at 1390 cm 1 implied the c o interface it was seen that the peaks for nh shifted slightly in the lead laden biomass this reduction in wavenumber may indicate the interaction of nh2 groups of the biomass with lead ions the hydrogen bonding in amines is weaker than that of hydroxyl groups so nh2 stretching bands are not as broad or intense as oh stretching bands a band at about 1246 cm 1 may represent so3 stretching a slight lengthening of the peak stretching in the lead biosorbed bacterial biomass at 2925 cm 1 may be due to hydrogen bonding between the protonated amine nh3 and lead ions smith 1998 or else this can also be due to asymmetric ch2 symmetric ch3 and ch2 stretching vibrations in the acinetobacter baumannii sce3 lead laden bacterial biomass one additional peak was observed at 517 cm 1 presenting the o c o in plane bending similar results were reported by other authors while studying lead sorption on streptomyces rimosus selatnia et al 2004 loaëc et al 1997 dobrowolski et al 2017 the prominent bands on the bacillus toyonensis sce1 biomass were of amine and carbonyl functional groups whereas in bacillus anthracis sce2 it was for amine and hydroxyl groups in the case of acinetobacter baumannii sce3 and bacillus toyonensis sce4 it was for methine group and in bacillus toyonensis sce5 it was methine and carbonyl groups that were very noticeable other bands representing hydroxyl sulfonyl sulfhydryl and carboxyl functional groups were seen for all the bacterial strains 3 2 kinetics of sorption in this study four different kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion were used to predict the biosorption kinetics of lead on bacterial biosorbents in order to obtain the data of concentration of lead versus time samples of solution were withdrawn at regular intervals of time 10 20 30 60 120 and 180 min during biosorption and analyzed for lead after separation of biomass by filtration the pseudo first order rate equation is given by eq 6 lagergren 1898 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts of lead adsorbed mg g at equilibrium and at time t min respectively and k1 l min is the adsorption rate constant of first order adsorption a straight line of ln qe qt versus t suggests the applicability of this kinetic model qe and k1 were determined from the intercept and slope of the plot the pseudo first order can be used to describe a model for a batch contact time process where the rate of sorption of lead ions on to the bacterial surface is proportional to the amount of lead sorbed from the solution phase the experimental results of the first order rate constants are presented in table 3 the adsorption data have a low regression coefficient which suggests that the adsorption of lead on biosorbent does not follow the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics it is realized from our model that when the initial concentration of solute is too high then the sorption process obeys pseudo first order kinetics the values indicate that the lead sorption by bacterial sorbent involved chemisorption happening due to the exchange of electrons in general the first order values are usually less for low surface concentrations of a solid sobkowsk and czerwinski 1974 in addition the experimental data was also applied to the pseudo second order kinetic model eq 7 ho and mckay 1999a 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order chemisorption g mg min the constants k2 and q2 can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the line obtained by plotting t qt versus t the pseudo second order kinetic model is based on the assumption that chemisorption is the rate determining step the results during our study showed that when the initial concentration of solute was not too high the sorption process obeyed the pseudo second order model this was found to be true even for the progressive higher concentrations of ions sano et al 1996 the data fits had extremely high correlation coefficients when the pseudo second order equation was applied the functional groups may be involved in chemical bonding and were responsible for the cation exchange in several studies it has been suggested that the concentration of metal varies marginally during the first few hours and the kinetic order and the rate of reaction was according to the number of available sites for the ion exchange and the quantity of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium although there are many factors which influence the adsorption capacity including the initial adsorbate concentration the reaction temperature the solution ph value the adsorbent particle size dosage of adsorbent and nature of the solute a kinetic model is concerned only with the effect of observable parameters on the overall rate the pseudo second order expression has been successfully applied to the adsorption of metal ions dyes herbicides oils and organic substances from aqueous solutions ho 2006 to understand the mechanism of the lead adsorption onto bacterial biomass intra particle diffusion based mechanism was studied as per the intra particle diffusion model the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t1 2 should be linear if intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step for the adsorption process and if these lines pass through the origin aksu 2005 as shown in fig 5 the intra particle diffusion equation can be described as in eq 8 8 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min the diffusion mechanism and the kinetic results were also analyzed by using the intra particle diffusion model which was initially developed by weber and morris weber and morris 1963 alongwith mckay and poots mckay and poota 1980 these parameters were employed in predicting the sorption mechanism the plot showed an initial sudden rise followed by a progressive linear and steep portion the linear plot of qt versus t1 2 is about 70 linear for bacillus anthracis sce2 at the initial sorption stages intra particle diffusion could be the foremost sorption mechanism in this region the advances of the plot was relaxed and probably under the control of an equilibrium diffusion mechanism ipd plots also directed towards the thickness of the bacterial species near to the boundary layer as per this model the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t1 2 should be linear if intraparticle diffusion is involved in the adsorption process and if these lines pass through the origin then intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step arami et al 2008 the adsorption rate of any adsorbate onto the adsorbent mainly depends on the various kinds of diffusion mechanisms such as film diffusion pore diffusion surface diffusion and simple adsorption that transport the adsorbate onto the surface of the adsorbent neretnieks 1976 at a given point of time any of these mechanisms individually or in a combined way can influence the rate of adsorption letterman et al 1974 when the plots do not pass through the origin this is symbolic of some degree of boundary layer control and this further show that the intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step but also other kinetic models may control the rate of adsorption all of which may be operating simultaneously here film diffusion may also have a role as per the obtained results the initial plots for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and bacillus anthracis sce2 were passing through origin and the other lines did not pass through the origin which indicates that the intra particle diffusion was not the only rate controlling step studies have suggested that the values of ipd decrease with increase in temperature as it stimulates the pore diffusion in sorbent and result in an improvement in the intra particle diffusion rate due to which a large number of ions diffuse into the pore before being adsorbed at higher temperatures the attraction between the functional groups and the biosorbent also gets stronger the elovich model assumes that the adsorbent surface is energetically heterogeneous and can also describe the chemisorption process zhang and stanforth 2005 the linearized equation is given by eq 9 9 q t β ln α β β ln t where α sorption rate mmol g min β desorption constant g mmol the elovich coefficients were computed from the plots qt versus ln t elovich equation has been used to define second order kinetic supposing that the surfaces are energetically heterogeneous but the equation does not suggest any certain mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent sparks 1986 zeldowitsch established the chemisorption law in 1934 which describe the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent zeldowitsch 1934 in the past years abundant applications of elovich s equation for the adsorption of gases onto heterogeneous solid systems have been mentioned in various studies ritchie 1977 tanaka and ogasawara 1970 aharoni and ungarish 1976 the elovich equation has also been used to describe the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions in recent years ho and mckay 1998 in our study the elovich model is used to study the initial adsorption rate and the influencing parameters that can be related to the extent of surface coverage and activation energy needed for the chemisorption process aharoni and ungarish 1976 zhang and stanforth 2005 all the five bacterial biosorbents followed the pseudo second order kinetic model with high r2 values as shown in table 3 as per this model the lead ions are expected to form covalent bonds by sharing or exchange of electrons with the biosorbent surface and thus lead removal takes place due to chemisorption ho and mckay 1999b the intra particle diffusion kinetic model also provides good correlation of the experimental data which means intra particle diffusion influences the lead adsorption onto biosorbents the calculated parameters of the model are summarized in table 3 the elovich equation provides good agreement with experimental data for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and acinetobacter baumannii sce3 table 3 which may be due to the presence of highly heterogeneous surfaces and also it shows that surface adsorption is a dominant phenomenon taking place but in a highly heterogeneous system along with surface adsorption chemisorptions ion exchange precipitation and intra particle diffusion are occurring concurrently however the correlation coefficients of elovich equation are lower than those of the pseudo second order equation and intra particle diffusion model zhang and stanforth 2005 the initial progressive linear steps seen for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and bacillus anthracis sce2 corresponds to the fast uptake of lead ions by the bacterial biomass the points where sorption rate was faster indicated the non consecutive diffusion of sorbate molecules of lead ions into the micropores of the bacteria this was a similar observation as described by biyan et al 2009 in the later stages the diffusion rate remains constant which suggests that the pores available on the bacterial surface were exhausted the bulkiness of the substrate may also affect the rate of sorption the movement of the sorbate that are lead ions during this study may also pass on from one point to the other during the biosorption process by the feature of concentration gradient shrihari et al 2005 the control on the boundary layer is implicited to be linked to the rate controlling mechanism and involves electrostatic interactions 3 3 statistical analysis experiments based on the ccd matrix were used to determine the effect of variables lead concentration 5 15 mg l and contact time 60 180 min with a fixed adsorbent dosage 0 1 g on the response y y represents the percentage lead biosorption second order polynomial equations drew the relationship between the independent variables of concentration and time along the response the regression equation coefficients were evaluated and fitted to a second order polynomial equation for lead removal using bacterial strains the optimal lead ion uptake by various bacterial strains used for biosorption in this study is being represented in table 4 the correlations between lead accumulation efficiency y and the above parameters in coded form developed by ccd are represented in eqs 10 14 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 respectively the results of anova for the removal of lead ions using bacterial biomass are shown in table 5 the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 and bacillus toyonensis sce4 are in reasonable agreement and very close to 1 0 this confirms that the model fits the experimental data well whereas the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 values for bacillus anthracis sce2 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 is 0 7552 and 0 9225 respectively that also fits well to the experimental data bacillus toyonensis sce1 10 y 0 0 878 1 65 a 0 0 833 b 0 1319 ab 1 86 a 2 0

independent variables that are lead concentration and contact time on the response that is adsorption are displayed in contour plots in fig 6 a e the biosorbent dosage was a significant factor with p values greater than 0 0001 for all the bacterial species as they greatly influenced the biosorption of lead ions the biosorption of lead concentration and contact time also play a significant role in the biosorption of lead ions the greater removal of lead ions with the increase in initial lead concentration is because of an increased concentration gradient for the mass transfer of lead ions the increase in contact time helps in greater lead removal as there is more time for adsorption to take place and to attain equilibrium conditions the percent removal of leads ions increased with time and the highest percent removal were observed at 150 min after which the removal of lead ions was found to decrease which suggest that before 150 min there were free spaces on the bacterial surface for the metal ions which were occupied later as time went on and beyond that desorption might have taken place desorption based on temperature introducing slits or pores nicholson 1999 and isotherms are the ways to assess the energetic heterogeneity of biomolecules or adsorbents as these methods favor entropy qin et al 2010 the heterogeneous surfaces of a solid and the effects on it can be studied by approximate condensation method and the analysis can be done by elovich equation whereas the gaussian functions can represent moderate heterogeneous surfaces any sort of distortion on the surface can result in varied sites of adsorption displaying the surrounding barriers around these sites molecules that get adsorbed on the sites have specific adsorption energy that explains their shape and energetic heterogeneity distribution rudzinski and panczyk 2000 the solution theory based on ideal adsorption has to be disobeyed by nullifying the interactions to explain the appropriate energetically heterogeneous adsorbent murthi and snurr 2004 the total amount of ions adsorbed in the micropores and mesopores of adsorbents can be calculated by the energy distribution function that can characterize the effects of heterogeneity in liquid solid interfaces podkościelny et al 2002 adhesion forces and presence of peripheral edifices like pili can also affect the morphology of the heterogeneous surfaces dorobantu et al 2008 but it has also been found that readsorption can resemble similar effects of surface energetic heterogeneity bragg williams method can be used to study the pooled effect of these interactions and energetic heterogeneity rudzinski et al 2000 surface heterogeneity can be studied by the deviation recorded between the bet model and existent isotherm that can be viewed through the isotherm curve balard 1997 a rate limiting film or surface effect may perhaps control the sorption at short time intervals this effect may be a film diffusion controlled process saturation of the adsorbent or an initial improved surface sorption due to extreme energetic heterogeneous sites present on the bacterial surface in general the gram negative bacteria consist of a periplasm which is surrounded by an inner and outer membrane the periplasm separates the peptidoglycan which acts as a cell wall from the inner membrane and is mainly involved in the targeting of proteins ezraty et al 2017 on the other hand in gram positive bacteria contains an outer cell wall made of peptidoglycan and an inner lipid membrane the periplasm is thin around 10 nm in these cells whereas in gram positive bacteria the periplasm is thick around 20 nm as studied by erickson 2017 the sulfhydryl compounds are ligands that influence metal speciation nell and fein 2017 there are several binding sites present on the cell envelope that provide high affinity for the metal ions to get adsorbed on the bacteria some other processes that promote metal binding are redox transformations and precipitation as perceived in the studies by gadd 2004 4 conclusion the biosorption process offers an eco friendly safe and economical technology for the lead removal from water the ftir analysis proposed that the most prominent functional groups present on the biomass and are probably actively involved in lead biosorption are the hydroxyl carbonyl and amine groups when initial concentration of lead increases the correlation coefficient r2 fitting the pseudo second order model decreases from 0 991 to 0 984 for acinetobacter baumannii sce3 on the other hand the correlation coefficient of fitting to the pseudo first order model increases from 0 832 to 0 845 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 the pseudo second order kinetic model showed the best fit for all the five bacterial species for lead biosorption than the other models studies suggest that there is single layer formation of lead onto the bacterial biosorbents and that the lead ions form covalent bonds by sharing or exchange of electrons with the biosorbent surface and hence lead removal takes place the biosorption efficiency as seen in the different bacterial strains were in the order bacillus toyonensis sce1 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 bacillus toyonensis sce5 bacillus toyonensis sce2 and the percentage of biosorption was 84 6 76 6 65 3 62 6 and 46 respectively the maximum lead uptake capacity is found to be 15 mg g for bacillus toyonensis sce1 species followed by 12 mg g for acinetobacter baumannii sce3 species for all of the systems studied chemical reaction seems significant in the rate controlling step and the pseudo second order chemical reaction kinetics provide the best correlation of the experimental data over a long period of time for all

12366,lead contamination in groundwater has raised serious health concerns the traditional technologies available for lead removal are having several shortcomings hence biosorption is considered as a potential eco friendly alternative to the existing methods in the present work several ground water samples were collected from different lead contaminated regions of iii and iv phase of peenya industrial area from bengaluru district of karnataka india these ground water samples were used as a source to isolate bacteria with distinct morphological characteristics which were identified as bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 that were tested for their biosorption properties the interactive effect of initial lead concentration versus contact time was studied using response surface methodology rsm while the biosorbent dosage was kept constant the biosorption kinetics was investigated for the isolates and the results studies indicated that the biosorption charted pseudo second order kinetic model and it provided the best fit for the bacterial species for lead biosorption graphical

introduction on a global scale lead has emerged to be one of the most lethal contaminant present in the surroundings laidlaw et al 2017 in the past few years as a result of high amount of emissions in the atmosphere and effluent release into the soil reservoirs sediments and water bodies lead has caused an adverse effect on the environment and humans as a result of this several approaches and guidelines were introduced by environmental protection authorities and international organizations åberg et al 1999 naturally lead exists in four different stable isotopes of 204pb 206pb 207pb and 208pb according to garcia et al 1998 and juberg 2000 these stable molecules can act as tracing elements to study environmental lead metabolism several anthropogenic processes has disturbed the natural lead cycle that has occurred due to the sudden increase in lead ore processing units and greater release of aerosol emissions the world health organization has given the tolerable limit of lead intake in a week as 0 025 mg kg of the body weight järup 2003 and tyler 1982 in their studies stated that when present in water bodies this lead can be toxic to the organisms present in the water the plants and also to the people surrounding the contaminated sites as lead is more consistently distributed when compared to other metals lead is competently scavenged by surrounding particles resulting in effective transport of lead in particulate phases accounting for lead accumulation maring et al 1987 there are several factors such as ph organic matter and metal concentration in the soil that influences the accumulation of lead on the other hand when microbes are used for biosorption process then their biochemical composition size of the organism decomposition process and duration of contact also plays an important role lodenius et al 1981 zurera cosano et al 1989 some studies have also indicated that in humans the interfaces among calcium phosphorus iron zinc may play an important role in lead absorption the modifications in nucleic acid conformation the alteration of proteins and osmolality and disruption of membranes are few other reasons for lead induced toxicity jarosławiecka and piotrowska seget 2014 exhaustive human activities and environmental exploitation of natural deposits has led to metal resistant microbes that are able to uptake higher concentration of metals bruins et al 2000 lead can easily enter the ecosystem through metal smelting insecticides battery pigments paints etc the ground water can get contaminated mainly due to the lead pipes and soldering whereas volcanic emissions and lead mobilization can contribute only to a minor pollution spiro et al 2012 lee and schwab 2005 the health effects caused due to lead toxicity include anorexia diarrhea anemia osteoporosis emaciation and mainly neurodegenerative disorders as lead has high affinity towards calcium binding sites that replaces calcium in the prime regions such as the central nervous system swarup and dwivedi 2002 sonkusare et al 2005 goyer 1997 lead can readily bind with iron and thus result in iron deficiency in humans kwong et al 2004 sulfhydryl groups koivula and eeva 2010 and its association with zinc binding sites have been of certain significance in heme synthesis pathway schwalfenberg and genuis 2015 vakifahmetoglu norberg et al al 2017 it can also replace cations leading to inhibition of the associated enzymes such as anti oxidative enzyme inhibition protein kinase c activation aminolevulinic acid dehydratase alad inhibition and lead circulation in the body during calcium requirement french et al 2017 elias et al 1982 along with alteration of calcium facilitated cellular routes resulting in modifications of regulatory proteins deposition of lead in apatite matrices and membrane vesicles or loss of structural integrity pounds and cory slechta 1993 pounds et al 1991 being equivalent to calcium biogeochemically lead is incorporated into trophic and metabolic pathways burnett and patterson 1980 the significant site of lead exposure is the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems that accumulate the lead in soft tissues such as liver and kidney that affects the metabolic processes cell proliferation enzyme levels expression of neurotrophins cytochrome p4501a2 and aminopyrene n demethylase activity mudipalli 2007 higher concentration of lead in the blood has also been seen due to the occupational exposure that can further cause cognitive and behavioral abnormality peripheral neuropathy anemia and reproductive disorders goyer 1990 volatile components such as tetraethyl lead and tetra methyl lead are used widely as fuel additives lead is toxic and the environmental factors that contribute to this toxicity are lead sulphide ores that undergoes weathering and subsurface deposits that are rich in inert form of lead human intervention in activities such as smelting mining refining galvanization spray painting manufacturing and recycling allows the lead to get escaped into the water soil and air tong et al 2000 products that contain lead such as paints inks glazed pots battery casings water pipes and gasoline also add up to this yet another route of lead entering into the environment is through fertilizers and pesticides fuels used in combustion engines ceramic tablewares etc flora et al 2006 the presence of lead can be detected by destroying the organic matrix using oxidants and strong acids by implying methods such as colorimetry or spectrophotometry but these methods are not very sensitive due to which better processes such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas sperling et al 1992 and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icpaes became familiar ivaldi et al 1991 and yoshinaga 1996 the specificity of lead can be determined by its biomolecular species identification that can be done by nmr spectroscopy and ion chromatography systems wrackmeyer et al 1989 the two electrochemical procedures that are being widely used these days are differential pulse polarography dpp and anodic stripping voltammetry asv as suggested by wang 1982 and galus et al 1988 few other powerful analytical techniques to measure lead are x ray fluorescence xrf thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims glow discharge mass spectrometry gdms laser microprobe mass analysis spectrometry lamma

relatively high metal concentrations can be identified at the cellular and intracellular level inclusive of the cytosolic regions thomson et al 1985 there are several methods of lead removal which have been previously mentioned in various research articles but no method provides complete elimination various studies have been done where lead has been removed from water using micellar enhanced ultrafiltration gzara et al 2000 by fixed bed column exchange using natural zeolite clinoptilolite with sodium nitrate solution medvidović et al 2006 or by using cnt magnesium oxide composite in the column with a higher contact time saleh and gupta 2012 granular blast furnace slag gbfs packed columns also decreased the lead concentration selectively even in the occurrence of other metals as stated by dimitrova 2002 precipitation of lead aqueous solutions using sodium di n octyl phosphinate esalah et al 2000 alongwith coagulation and precipitation using seawater liquid bittern added to alkalized wastewater could culminate high amount of lead ayoub et al 2001 some other coagulants that can be used for this process are aluminium sulfate polyaluminium chloride and magnesium chloride by varying the ph of the solution pang et al 2011 use of carbon nanotubes is another efficient adsorber of lead li et al 2002 nano filtration can help in clearing good amount of lead but it requires bulky installation and heavy maintenance volesky 2001 biosorption of lead using living and non living biomass of bacteria fungi algae etc have been efficient and economic volesky and holan 1995 the adsorption process can be extracellular or it can be an accumulation process which takes places intracellularly this method can sequester target metal ions in industrial effluent treatment process where complex ion matrix or high volume of metal ions needs to be eliminated or removed earlier several bacteria have been used for biosorption process wong et al 2001 zouboulis et al 2004 srinath et al 2002 treated or modified activated carbon was used by operating static and column mode where effect of various process variables such as bed height hydraulic loading rate and initial feed

studied using a batch adsorber where the experimental isotherm data was analyzed using the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich equations özacar et al 2008 undaria pinnatifida was used for lead removal and it showed a remarkable lead uptake in the range of 3 4 due to the alginic acid present in its cell wall kim et al 1995 there are several studies where adsorption of lead has been studied using bacteria in one such study by rivera utrilla et al 2001 lead adsorption on activated carbon was studied in the presence of e coli bacteria was adsorbed the carbon to which the lead ions were bound to the biomass of pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21 was used to the study the sorption of lead copper and cadmium ions the kinetic models and desorption studies were done to reuse the biomass

vermicola strain sj2a was isolated from the discard of a battery industry and it was found that there was a plasmid borne metallothionein gene that aided in resistance of lead sharma et al 2017 the initial minimum inhibitory concentration lead ions were examined to check its optimum concentration for the growth of sulfur reducing bacteria the optimization of various parameters was done using box

the ground water samples of peenya industrial area of bengaluru region in karnataka further studies were done to understand the relation between the initial lead concentration that was kept as 5 mg l and contact time using response surface methodology 2 methods 2 1 sample collection peenya industrial area of bengaluru urban district is located in the southeastern part of karnataka at a latitude of

polyethylene bottles by the method of random sampling the bottles were capped immediately to prevent air passage inhabitant bacteria native to the ground water were later isolated and its distinct morphological colony characters were studied 2 2 estimation of lead lead in ground water samples was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo jarrell ash usa whereas lead accumulation of bacteria was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry aas method lead nitrate was used for the preparation of a stock solution of lead 100 mg l by dissolving a suitable quantity in deionized water to be used for accumulation studies 2 3 isolation and screening of bacteria lead resistant bacterial strains were isolated from ground water samples of iii and iv

nutrient agar peptone beef extract agar sodium chloride and distilled water that maintains the growth of non fastidious organisms tryptic soy agar digests of casein and soybean meal agar sodium chloride and distilled water that provides growth for anaerobes aerobes and micro aerophiles mannitol salt agar peptone d mannitol sodium chloride agar phenol red and distilled water which acts as a

thiosulfate ferric citrate brilliant green neutral red agar and distilled water that is a selective media for salmonella species to isolate resistant strains the media were amended with 50 mg l pb ii and a standard spread plate method was performed the inoculated plates were incubated for 24 48 h at 37 c after which larger identical colonies from each plate were isolated the most effective bacterial strains for the biosorption of pb ii were identified according to bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 2 4 identification of bacteria genomic dna isolation amplification and sequencing of bacterial samples was carried out using 16 s internal transcribed spacer s its primers the its region of bacterial dna was amplified using the specific primer set 27f agagtttgatcmtggctcag and 1492r tacggytaccttgttacgactt pcr was performed in a total volume of 50 µl and the reaction mixture contained 5 µl of 10x pcr buffer 2 µl of dntp mixture 1 µl of each primer and 1 µl of taq polymerase 5 µl of the template and diluted to a final volume of 35 µl with de ionized distilled water pcr was conducted using a thermal cycler geneamp pcr system 9700 perkin elmer ca usa to subject the reaction mix to 35 cycles of the following reaction conditions denaturation at 94 c for 30 s primer annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 1 min followed by final extension for 7 min at 72 c to ensure full extension of the products elfering et al 2002 100 bp g biosciences ladder was used the amplified pcr products were then analyzed in 1 0 w v agarose gel further the pcr products were purified with a pcr products purification kit aristogene pcr product purification kit and were sequenced by medauxin private limited bangalore to analyze the bacterial species dna sequence of the its 16s rrna related sequences were obtained from the genbank the sequence was compared with the blast program from the national center for biotechnological information ncbi for the identification of the species drancourt et al 2004 the organism was identified based on the highest homology of the sequence with sequence available in the database fig 2 indicates the flow diagram for isolation screening and identification of bacteria 2 5 bacterial characterization bacterial identification can be done by comparing the sequences of small sub units of rrna of the isolated strains the phylogeny obtained by aiming at the elongation factors alternate markers like larger subunits and atpases alongwith data retrieval from evolutionarily conserved molecules have proven that the 16 s rrna sequencing method based trees replicate the antiquity of the organisms globally ludwig and schleifer 1994 ludwig et al 1998 the tree topology can be based on various data sets markers and methods of tree creation here the genes susceptible to lateral gene transfer and gene duplication must be considered with care as their phylogeny may be different than the species under study and the orthologs should be in clear distinction to paralogs ludwig et al 1998 the homologous traits designate shared ancestry and can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary link between various species whereas the similar traits that are present in unrelated organisms are analogous after sorting out the homologs and analogs the organisms are grouped into a single section based on its common single ancestor this approach of organization is cladistics and all organisms having same ancestor fall into a single clade that originates from a single point on the tree which can vary in size then the evolutionary events that led to acquire a common trait are found out it is challenging to differentiate between the features that took place as a result of shared ancestry to the ones that ascended independently these traits can be lost or gained over the time and it varies in different branches but the amount of information what these trees give us is much bigger than the data obtained using physical traits and information acquired through gene or amino acid the 16s rrna sequencing method through a targeted approach can acquire data for the sequences that are homologous to the sequence of interest as well as align them being cost effective and accurate when compared to protein sequencing ludwig et al 1998 the protein based trees are unable to support the data of certain proteobacteria that have a common ancestor but as the sub classes get introduced into the phylogeny it stands in agreement with the rrna based trees ludwig et al 1993 the recent approach of phylogeny using tetra nucleotide frequencies have shown higher resemblance to the trees generated via 16s rrna sequencing takahashi et al 2009 classifying bacteria using oligonucleotide frequency method helps in establishing link with associated species one of the unnoticed issues has been the differences in the rrna gene regions of multiple operons in the same organism here the sequencing protocols based only on rrna or amplified rdna will not help but a combination of expressed rrna genes must be analyzed alongwith denaturing gradient electrophoresis and straight cloning of diverse rrna operons that would provide much reliable information ludwig et al 1993 ludwig et al 1998 sometimes to identify the minute differences at intra and interspecies levels the phylogenetic relationships along with the study of protein encoding genes is essential carrasco et al 2013 but there have been studies where it was difficult to identify the organisms at the species level on the basis of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis the bacteria were identified as bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 as represented in fig 3 a e the bacterial nucleotide sequences of these five species were submitted to the genbank of ncbi with the submission numbers as listed in table 1 2 6 selection of the bacterial species in this study isolation of different bacteria was done on the basis of the whole colony type such as circular rhizoid irregular or filamentous edges such as lobated undulated or curled surface such as smooth rough or wrinkled and finally on the basis of elevation such as flat raised or convexed around six different types of bacterial strains were identified isolated and cultured initially using nutrient agar 0 5 peptone 0 3 beef extract 1 5 agar 0 5 sodium chloride and distilled water the identified strains were escherichia coli bacillus toyonensis bacillus anthracis acinetobacter baumannii bacillus cereus and pseudomonas aeruginosa species later these strains were treated with lead and the growth of these bacteria was monitored to select five lead resistant species that could be used for further studies 2 7 preparation of bacteria as a biosorbent all the five lead resistant bacterial species were grown aerobically using luria bertani broth 10 g l tryptone 10 g l sodium chloride and 5 g l yeast extract in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of media at 37 c for 40 h on a rotary shaker 140 rpm the obtained biomass was treated with varied concentrations of lead for experimental flasks whereas control sets were not treated with lead the bacterial pellets obtained after centrifugation and were separated washed with deionized water multiple times freeze dried and then used for biosorption experiments binupriya et al 2007 2 8 bio sorption experiments fifty milliliter solution of lead was prepared with pb no3 2 from sigma aldrich co at different concentrations ranging from 5 mg l to 15 mg l without adjusting ph lead concentration of 5 mg l to 15 mg l was taken as the bacterial strains could not grow above 15 mg l of lead the lowest concentration of metal that totally disallowed the growth of bacteria was the minimal inhibitory concentration mic lead concentrations below 5 mg l were considered to be very less to study effective biosorption experiments were carried out in 250 ml polypropylene flasks by adding a constant amount of biosorbent that was 0 1 gm to the desired concentrations of lead solutions and agitating the flasks at 200 rpm in a rotary shaker incubator for a specific period of time ranging from 60 min to 180 min at 25 c the solution was then filtered using 0 25 µm pore size filter to separate the biomass the filtrate was then analyzed for determining the lead concentration by aas saraswat and rai 2010 specific metal uptake by the cells was then calculated from the difference between the initial and final concentration of lead ions the percentage biosorption was calculated using eq 1 1 percentage of biosorption c 0 c e c 0 100 the amount of lead adsorbed or accumulated per gram of adsorbent after equilibrium qe was calculated using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where co and ce mg l represent the concentrations of the lead ion present initially and at equilibrium in the solution respectively v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g the response surface methodology was used to assess the interactive effect of lead concentration and contact time at more levels with minimal number of experiments suggested by central composite design effects and complex interactions of each process variable were later evaluated the results were analyzed by applying the contour plots and analysis of variance anova borror et al 2002 the quadratic equation model for predicting the optimal point was expressed according to eq 3 3 y β 0 i k β i x i i i k β i i x i 2 i j β i j x i x j where y is the predicted response xi xj refer to the independent variables and β0 βi βii βij are the regression coefficients biosorption depends upon the quantity or dosage of a biosorbent studies suggest that smaller quantity of biosorbent have resulted in higher uptake of metal ions aksu and çağatay 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2006 while using higher biosorbent dosage the accessible metal ions present in the solution become deficient to shield the existing exchangeable sites on the sorbent leading to lower uptake gadd and de rome 1988 tangaromsuk et al 2002 due to these reasons the biosorbent dosage was fixed as 0 1 gm and kept constant throughout the experiments 2 9 surface characterization of biosorbents to determine the nature of functional groups on the cell wall for metal sorption potentiometric titration of an aqueous cellular suspension and ir spectrum analysis of the solid phase biomass were performed fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of biosorbents before and after adsorption were recorded li et al 2017 the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and freeze dried overnight ftir analysis was carried out at room temperature on spectrum two in service lubricant analysis system from perkinelmer waltham ma at a resolution of 2 cm 1 in the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 for studying the chemical groups on the surface of the bacteria to evaluate the properties of functional groups we can consider a chemical model incorporating the reactions between the groups of bacteria and the protons in the solution the reactions and equilibrium constants ka kb of certain functional groups may be defined as given below in the eqs 4 and 5 4 ah a h k a a h ah 5 bh b h k b b h bh where a b and ah bh represent the concentration of deprotonated and protonated surface species respectively and h represents the activity of protons in solution 3 results 3 1 characterization of biosorbents the main functional groups present on bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 that were responsible for biosorption of lead ions were found using the ftir spectra hasson et al 1998 fig 4 a e depicts the ftir spectra of the bacterial biomass before and after lead biosorption the groups present on the biomass of bacillus toyonensis sce1 were similar to that of the strains sce4 and sce5 the broadband range of 3200 3400 cm 1 denotes the presence of n h bond of amino groups associated with oh groups the relative differences in band intensity are similar to the differences in the concentrations of the respective functional groups associated with the bands the broad band at 3200 3500 cm 1 regions specifies the interaction between amine and hydroxyl groups with biomass the small peak around 2850 cm 1 is due to the presence of alkyl group c h and at 1631 cm 1 may be due to the involvement of double bond structures such as c o or c c groups the peak in the region of 1535 cm 1 may be attributed to n h bending in the amine group or due to the absorption of nitrates the band observed at 1050 cm 1 denotes c o stretching of carboxylic acids thus the bacterial biomass is expected to possess hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups on its surface as significant sorption sites table 2 in the lead biosorbed bacterial biomass a significant manifested peak at 2925 cm 1 was observed indicating the interaction of c h groups whereas another peak at 1390 cm 1 implied the c o interface it was seen that the peaks for nh shifted slightly in the lead laden biomass this reduction in wavenumber may indicate the interaction of nh2 groups of the biomass with lead ions the hydrogen bonding in amines is weaker than that of hydroxyl groups so nh2 stretching bands are not as broad or intense as oh stretching bands a band at about 1246 cm 1 may represent so3 stretching a slight lengthening of the peak stretching in the lead biosorbed bacterial biomass at 2925 cm 1 may be due to hydrogen bonding between the protonated amine nh3 and lead ions smith 1998 or else this can also be due to asymmetric ch2 symmetric ch3 and ch2 stretching vibrations in the acinetobacter baumannii sce3 lead laden bacterial biomass one additional peak was observed at 517 cm 1 presenting the o c o in plane bending similar results were reported by other authors while studying lead sorption on streptomyces rimosus selatnia et al 2004 loaëc et al 1997 dobrowolski et al 2017 the prominent bands on the bacillus toyonensis sce1 biomass were of amine and carbonyl functional groups whereas in bacillus anthracis sce2 it was for amine and hydroxyl groups in the case of acinetobacter baumannii sce3 and bacillus toyonensis sce4 it was for methine group and in bacillus toyonensis sce5 it was methine and carbonyl groups that were very noticeable other bands representing hydroxyl sulfonyl sulfhydryl and carboxyl functional groups were seen for all the bacterial strains 3 2 kinetics of sorption in this study four different kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion were used to predict the biosorption kinetics of lead on bacterial biosorbents in order to obtain the data of concentration of lead versus time samples of solution were withdrawn at regular intervals of time 10 20 30 60 120 and 180 min during biosorption and analyzed for lead after separation of biomass by filtration the pseudo first order rate equation is given by eq 6 lagergren 1898 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts of lead adsorbed mg g at equilibrium and at time t min respectively and k1 l min is the adsorption rate constant of first order adsorption a straight line of ln qe qt versus t suggests the applicability of this kinetic model qe and k1 were determined from the intercept and slope of the plot the pseudo first order can be used to describe a model for a batch contact time process where the rate of sorption of lead ions on to the bacterial surface is proportional to the amount of lead sorbed from the solution phase the experimental results of the first order rate constants are presented in table 3 the adsorption data have a low regression coefficient which suggests that the adsorption of lead on biosorbent does not follow the pseudo first order adsorption kinetics it is realized from our model that when the initial concentration of solute is too high then the sorption process obeys pseudo first order kinetics the values indicate that the lead sorption by bacterial sorbent involved chemisorption happening due to the exchange of electrons in general the first order values are usually less for low surface concentrations of a solid sobkowsk and czerwinski 1974 in addition the experimental data was also applied to the pseudo second order kinetic model eq 7 ho and mckay 1999a 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order chemisorption g mg min the constants k2 and q2 can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the line obtained by plotting t qt versus t the pseudo second order kinetic model is based on the assumption that chemisorption is the rate determining step the results during our study showed that when the initial concentration of solute was not too high the sorption process obeyed the pseudo second order model this was found to be true even for the progressive higher concentrations of ions sano et al 1996 the data fits had extremely high correlation coefficients when the pseudo second order equation was applied the functional groups may be involved in chemical bonding and were responsible for the cation exchange in several studies it has been suggested that the concentration of metal varies marginally during the first few hours and the kinetic order and the rate of reaction was according to the number of available sites for the ion exchange and the quantity of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium although there are many factors which influence the adsorption capacity including the initial adsorbate concentration the reaction temperature the solution ph value the adsorbent particle size dosage of adsorbent and nature of the solute a kinetic model is concerned only with the effect of observable parameters on the overall rate the pseudo second order expression has been successfully applied to the adsorption of metal ions dyes herbicides oils and organic substances from aqueous solutions ho 2006 to understand the mechanism of the lead adsorption onto bacterial biomass intra particle diffusion based mechanism was studied as per the intra particle diffusion model the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t1 2 should be linear if intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step for the adsorption process and if these lines pass through the origin aksu 2005 as shown in fig 5 the intra particle diffusion equation can be described as in eq 8 8 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min the diffusion mechanism and the kinetic results were also analyzed by using the intra particle diffusion model which was initially developed by weber and morris weber and morris 1963 alongwith mckay and poots mckay and poota 1980 these parameters were employed in predicting the sorption mechanism the plot showed an initial sudden rise followed by a progressive linear and steep portion the linear plot of qt versus t1 2 is about 70 linear for bacillus anthracis sce2 at the initial sorption stages intra particle diffusion could be the foremost sorption mechanism in this region the advances of the plot was relaxed and probably under the control of an equilibrium diffusion mechanism ipd plots also directed towards the thickness of the bacterial species near to the boundary layer as per this model the plot of uptake qt versus the square root of time t1 2 should be linear if intraparticle diffusion is involved in the adsorption process and if these lines pass through the origin then intra particle diffusion is the rate controlling step arami et al 2008 the adsorption rate of any adsorbate onto the adsorbent mainly depends on the various kinds of diffusion mechanisms such as film diffusion pore diffusion surface diffusion and simple adsorption that transport the adsorbate onto the surface of the adsorbent neretnieks 1976 at a given point of time any of these mechanisms individually or in a combined way can influence the rate of adsorption letterman et al 1974 when the plots do not pass through the origin this is symbolic of some degree of boundary layer control and this further show that the intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step but also other kinetic models may control the rate of adsorption all of which may be operating simultaneously here film diffusion may also have a role as per the obtained results the initial plots for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and bacillus anthracis sce2 were passing through origin and the other lines did not pass through the origin which indicates that the intra particle diffusion was not the only rate controlling step studies have suggested that the values of ipd decrease with increase in temperature as it stimulates the pore diffusion in sorbent and result in an improvement in the intra particle diffusion rate due to which a large number of ions diffuse into the pore before being adsorbed at higher temperatures the attraction between the functional groups and the biosorbent also gets stronger the elovich model assumes that the adsorbent surface is energetically heterogeneous and can also describe the chemisorption process zhang and stanforth 2005 the linearized equation is given by eq 9 9 q t β ln α β β ln t where α sorption rate mmol g min β desorption constant g mmol the elovich coefficients were computed from the plots qt versus ln t elovich equation has been used to define second order kinetic supposing that the surfaces are energetically heterogeneous but the equation does not suggest any certain mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent sparks 1986 zeldowitsch established the chemisorption law in 1934 which describe the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent zeldowitsch 1934 in the past years abundant applications of elovich s equation for the adsorption of gases onto heterogeneous solid systems have been mentioned in various studies ritchie 1977 tanaka and ogasawara 1970 aharoni and ungarish 1976 the elovich equation has also been used to describe the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions in recent years ho and mckay 1998 in our study the elovich model is used to study the initial adsorption rate and the influencing parameters that can be related to the extent of surface coverage and activation energy needed for the chemisorption process aharoni and ungarish 1976 zhang and stanforth 2005 all the five bacterial biosorbents followed the pseudo second order kinetic model with high r2 values as shown in table 3 as per this model the lead ions are expected to form covalent bonds by sharing or exchange of electrons with the biosorbent surface and thus lead removal takes place due to chemisorption ho and mckay 1999b the intra particle diffusion kinetic model also provides good correlation of the experimental data which means intra particle diffusion influences the lead adsorption onto biosorbents the calculated parameters of the model are summarized in table 3 the elovich equation provides good agreement with experimental data for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and acinetobacter baumannii sce3 table 3 which may be due to the presence of highly heterogeneous surfaces and also it shows that surface adsorption is a dominant phenomenon taking place but in a highly heterogeneous system along with surface adsorption chemisorptions ion exchange precipitation and intra particle diffusion are occurring concurrently however the correlation coefficients of elovich equation are lower than those of the pseudo second order equation and intra particle diffusion model zhang and stanforth 2005 the initial progressive linear steps seen for bacillus toyonensis sce1 and bacillus anthracis sce2 corresponds to the fast uptake of lead ions by the bacterial biomass the points where sorption rate was faster indicated the non consecutive diffusion of sorbate molecules of lead ions into the micropores of the bacteria this was a similar observation as described by biyan et al 2009 in the later stages the diffusion rate remains constant which suggests that the pores available on the bacterial surface were exhausted the bulkiness of the substrate may also affect the rate of sorption the movement of the sorbate that are lead ions during this study may also pass on from one point to the other during the biosorption process by the feature of concentration gradient shrihari et al 2005 the control on the boundary layer is implicited to be linked to the rate controlling mechanism and involves electrostatic interactions 3 3 statistical analysis experiments based on the ccd matrix were used to determine the effect of variables lead concentration 5 15 mg l and contact time 60 180 min with a fixed adsorbent dosage 0 1 g on the response y y represents the percentage lead biosorption second order polynomial equations drew the relationship between the independent variables of concentration and time along the response the regression equation coefficients were evaluated and fitted to a second order polynomial equation for lead removal using bacterial strains the optimal lead ion uptake by various bacterial strains used for biosorption in this study is being represented in table 4 the correlations between lead accumulation efficiency y and the above parameters in coded form developed by ccd are represented in eqs 10 14 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 bacillus anthracis sce2 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 respectively the results of anova for the removal of lead ions using bacterial biomass are shown in table 5 the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 and bacillus toyonensis sce4 are in reasonable agreement and very close to 1 0 this confirms that the model fits the experimental data well whereas the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 values for bacillus anthracis sce2 and bacillus toyonensis sce5 is 0 7552 and 0 9225 respectively that also fits well to the experimental data bacillus toyonensis sce1 10 y 0 0 878 1 65 a 0 0 833 b 0 1319 ab 1 86 a 2 0

independent variables that are lead concentration and contact time on the response that is adsorption are displayed in contour plots in fig 6 a e the biosorbent dosage was a significant factor with p values greater than 0 0001 for all the bacterial species as they greatly influenced the biosorption of lead ions the biosorption of lead concentration and contact time also play a significant role in the biosorption of lead ions the greater removal of lead ions with the increase in initial lead concentration is because of an increased concentration gradient for the mass transfer of lead ions the increase in contact time helps in greater lead removal as there is more time for adsorption to take place and to attain equilibrium conditions the percent removal of leads ions increased with time and the highest percent removal were observed at 150 min after which the removal of lead ions was found to decrease which suggest that before 150 min there were free spaces on the bacterial surface for the metal ions which were occupied later as time went on and beyond that desorption might have taken place desorption based on temperature introducing slits or pores nicholson 1999 and isotherms are the ways to assess the energetic heterogeneity of biomolecules or adsorbents as these methods favor entropy qin et al 2010 the heterogeneous surfaces of a solid and the effects on it can be studied by approximate condensation method and the analysis can be done by elovich equation whereas the gaussian functions can represent moderate heterogeneous surfaces any sort of distortion on the surface can result in varied sites of adsorption displaying the surrounding barriers around these sites molecules that get adsorbed on the sites have specific adsorption energy that explains their shape and energetic heterogeneity distribution rudzinski and panczyk 2000 the solution theory based on ideal adsorption has to be disobeyed by nullifying the interactions to explain the appropriate energetically heterogeneous adsorbent murthi and snurr 2004 the total amount of ions adsorbed in the micropores and mesopores of adsorbents can be calculated by the energy distribution function that can characterize the effects of heterogeneity in liquid solid interfaces podkościelny et al 2002 adhesion forces and presence of peripheral edifices like pili can also affect the morphology of the heterogeneous surfaces dorobantu et al 2008 but it has also been found that readsorption can resemble similar effects of surface energetic heterogeneity bragg williams method can be used to study the pooled effect of these interactions and energetic heterogeneity rudzinski et al 2000 surface heterogeneity can be studied by the deviation recorded between the bet model and existent isotherm that can be viewed through the isotherm curve balard 1997 a rate limiting film or surface effect may perhaps control the sorption at short time intervals this effect may be a film diffusion controlled process saturation of the adsorbent or an initial improved surface sorption due to extreme energetic heterogeneous sites present on the bacterial surface in general the gram negative bacteria consist of a periplasm which is surrounded by an inner and outer membrane the periplasm separates the peptidoglycan which acts as a cell wall from the inner membrane and is mainly involved in the targeting of proteins ezraty et al 2017 on the other hand in gram positive bacteria contains an outer cell wall made of peptidoglycan and an inner lipid membrane the periplasm is thin around 10 nm in these cells whereas in gram positive bacteria the periplasm is thick around 20 nm as studied by erickson 2017 the sulfhydryl compounds are ligands that influence metal speciation nell and fein 2017 there are several binding sites present on the cell envelope that provide high affinity for the metal ions to get adsorbed on the bacteria some other processes that promote metal binding are redox transformations and precipitation as perceived in the studies by gadd 2004 4 conclusion the biosorption process offers an eco friendly safe and economical technology for the lead removal from water the ftir analysis proposed that the most prominent functional groups present on the biomass and are probably actively involved in lead biosorption are the hydroxyl carbonyl and amine groups when initial concentration of lead increases the correlation coefficient r2 fitting the pseudo second order model decreases from 0 991 to 0 984 for acinetobacter baumannii sce3 on the other hand the correlation coefficient of fitting to the pseudo first order model increases from 0 832 to 0 845 for bacillus toyonensis sce1 the pseudo second order kinetic model showed the best fit for all the five bacterial species for lead biosorption than the other models studies suggest that there is single layer formation of lead onto the bacterial biosorbents and that the lead ions form covalent bonds by sharing or exchange of electrons with the biosorbent surface and hence lead removal takes place the biosorption efficiency as seen in the different bacterial strains were in the order bacillus toyonensis sce1 acinetobacter baumannii sce3 bacillus toyonensis sce4 bacillus toyonensis sce5 bacillus toyonensis sce2 and the percentage of biosorption was 84 6 76 6 65 3 62 6 and 46 respectively the maximum lead uptake capacity is found to be 15 mg g for bacillus toyonensis sce1 species followed by 12 mg g for acinetobacter baumannii sce3 species for all of the systems studied chemical reaction seems significant in the rate controlling step and the pseudo second order chemical reaction kinetics provide the best correlation of the experimental data over a long period of time for all

not significantly related to the bioavailable phosphate concentration of soil and irrigated water the selenium concentration in paddy plants was significantly related to selenium present in soil p 0

been labelled as the worst mass poisoning of a population in history smith et al 2000 arsenic affected patients face major health problems like cancer melanosis hyperkeratosis restrictive lung disease peripheral vascular diseases gangrene diabetes mellitus hypertension and ischaemic heart disease guha mazumder 2000 rahman 2002 consumption of arsenic contaminated drinking water is the primary route of exposure guha mazumder et al 2013 2014 biswas et al 2013 2014a 2014b and foods provide additional exposure as agricultural products accumulate arsenic from contaminated soil and water mandal and suzuki 2002 fao 2006 mondal et al 2010 biswas and santra 2012a biswas et al 2012b biswas et al 2014c halder et al 2012 2013 the risk from consumption of arsenic through depends on the arsenic species accumulated via drinking water and diets biswas et al 2013 halder et al 2014 groundwater contamination by arsenic is zone specific and could be seen as the high risk for urban and peri urban areas than the nearer village areas situated on the same basic rock formation tirkey et al 2017 arsenic in sediments of the bengal basin originated in minerals found in the himalaya mountains and foothills where arsenic together with phosphate po4 3 appears to be primarily adsorbed on amorphous fe oxyhydroxides fao 2006 arsenic v and po4 3 are chemically similar and both form insoluble compounds with al and fe in soils and that is why al as and fe as complexes are the dominant chemical forms in soil although arsenic has less affinity for al oxides than phosphates khan et al 2014 in bengal delta region shallow groundwater is highly reduced leading to reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides and solubilization of arsenic and phosphate distribution of arsenic in sediments is spatially heterogeneous and much of the country has soil arsenic levels 5 mg kg an uncontaminated background level similar to many other countries mandal and suzuki 2002 smith et al 1998 however soil arsenic is elevated above 5 mg kg in the ganges river basin indicating that this river is a source of arsenic contamination of the current land surface singh 2006 chakraborti et al 2018 in an in situ experiment in arsenic endemic region of west bengal neidhardt et al 2014 found the positive correlation among arsenite concentration increase with dissolved fe ii attributed the fact of arsenic mobilization from fe rich minerals as iii gets adsorbed on fe iii surfaces sun and doner 1996 iron plaque forms on the root surface in aerobic rhizosphere zones and significantly impact arsenic uptake due to the oxidation of iron stimulated by oxygen liu et al 2004a 2004b hossain et al 2009 in the arsenic endemic fields of west bengal ghosh et al 2006 studied detail minerology and related phenomenon to identify the arsenic origin and concluded as presence of opaque minerals limonite and marcasite iron rich minerals as the cause behind higher concentration of arsenic in the surface horizon the source of arsenic in these soils are probably due to the presence of arsenic bearing minerals marcasite and arsenopyrite and also it may occur as adsorption on iron hydroxide coated sand grains and clay minerals ghosh et al 2006 phosphate is similar to arsenate in the chemical characteristics so competes with arsenate for adsorption sites at fe oxide surfaces qafoku et al 1999 jain and loeppert 2000 and impact arsenate solubility in the soil pore water gupta et al 2011 in one field scale experiment in estuarine landscape otte et al 1990 showed loss of phosphorus from the soil as an indicator of arsenic mobilization and the process depends on the plant species growing in the soil usage of phosphate fertilizers play a role in arsenic enrichment for crop plant phytoavailability das et al 2015 increased po4 3 application in soil may increase the arsenite uptake over arsenate meharg et al 1994 abedin et al 2002 found the phosphate as the controlling factor arsenic translocation in paddy plant parts except the rice husk therefore the impact of po43 on arsenic uptake remained unsolved arsenic has an antagonistic relationship with selenium these interacts and may result in excretion of their mutual metabolite like s glutathionyl gailer et al 2000 this confounding excretion of selenium can be a health concern as selenium an essential micronutrient supports antioxidation haemoprevention and immunocompetence and low selenium status is found with the occurrence of illnesses such as diabetes can et al 2005 cancer clark et al 1996 polio virus broome et al 2004 hiv baum et al 2000 the dietary mechanism for incorporation of selenium into the body is through ingestion of plant and animal products that are grown in soils containing selenium tapiero et al 2003 studies show that selenium supplementation can actually mitigate arsenic poisoning wang et al 2001 and itself toxic in high doses and an essential antioxidant in smaller doses schrauzer 2003 so selenium intake via dietary items is crucial for the arsenic endemic population low se can decrease as toxicity via excretion of as se compound at high concentration excessive se can enhance as toxicity by reacting with s adenosylmethionine and glutathione and modifying the structure and activity of arsenite methyltransferase sun et al 2014 there is as se interaction and or competition during paddy plant uptake when both are present in the system like the presence of se either alone or added along with as significantly reduce the as concentration and its uptake by different parts of paddy plants pandey and gupta 2015 chauhan et al 2017 and higher reduction in as concentration was observed with the addition of the highest level of applied se 0 10 mg kg kaur et al 2017 selenium antagonizes the toxic effects of arsenic on mung bean phaseolus aureus roxb plants by restricting its uptake and enhancing the antioxidative and detoxification mechanisms malik et al 2012 from the above discussion it was clear that the presence of iron bioavailable phosphate and selenium play role to make arsenic available for the crop plant uptake from soil and irrigation water the present work has been ascertained to find the co regulation of iron bioavailable phosphate and selenium in arsenic uptake from soil and water system to paddy plant parts the study also intended to look into the status of these elements and or contaminants into the rice grain if is playing role to abate the arsenic naturally the study will explore the dependence liaison of occurrence of arsenic and other elements in useful parts of paddy plants to meet aim of the study one control area was selected to understand the role of soil and irrigated ground water separately consideration of one area with no to very less arsenic input through the irrigation water was of utmost requirement 2 experimental 2 1 study area we collected samples during the winter season from the paddy fields of chakdaha and haringhata blocks of nadia district the acknowledged arsenic endemic regions in west bengal das et al 1995 roychowdhury 2002 biswas and santra 2012a biswas et al 2013 2014a 2014b groundwater is extensively used for agri irrigation purposes and arsenic concentration are frequently high in both irrigation and drinking water as depicted from the previous reports roychowdhury 2002 biswas and santra 2012a b 2013 2014a 2014b the control area fields were chosen from a village of hooghly district reportedly with no occurrence of arsenic in groundwater 10 µg l guha mazumder et al 2013 biswas et al 2014a 2014b in the present manuscript to meet aim of the study the selection of one control area was mandatory we considered the arsenic and other elements interaction during translocation from soil and water to paddy plant so to understand the role of soil and irrigated ground water separately consideration of one area with less or no arsenic input through the irrigation water was of utmost requirement moreover the study was completely field based so choosing of one control site was indispensable 2 2 sample collection irrigated water samples n 24 were collected 50 ml during the uniform rate of discharge from irrigation pumps in polyethylene containers and were acidified with nitric acid hno3 ag merck germany for preservation das et al 1995 biswas and santra 2012a 2012b field soil samples 0 15 cm depth n 20 were collected from each sampling sites composite samples of rice root n 60 straw n 60 husk n 60 rice grain n 60 were collected directly from the paddy fields collected samples were transferred and preserved in the laboratory for further analysis 2 3 sample treatment and analysis water samples were kept in 4 c till further analysis soil samples were immediately sun dried followed by oven drying at 60 c to a constant weight paddy plant parts samples except grain were washed with distilled water and dried in hot air oven at 60 c for 72 h these were ground into a fine homogenized powder for chemical analysis soil root straw husk and rice grain were acid digested using heating block rahman et al 2007 biswas et al 2014a 2017 total arsenic and total selenium was estimated using flow injection hydride generation flame atomic absorption spectrometry fi hg aas perkin elmer a analyst 200 biswas and santra 2012a 2012b biswas et al 2014a 2017 the quality control of the estimation included the analysis of standardized reference rice flour nist usa srm 1568a for plant samples san joaquin soil nist usa srm 2709a for soil samples and indian water standard crm bnd 301 from national physical laboratory new delhi following the same treatment like the samples bioavailable phosphate concentration was estimated colorimetrically by 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 5 extract of soil and plant parts olsen and sommers 1982 total iron in the water soil and plant samples was estimated after a small modification of the method of saywell and cunningham 1937 from the soil iron was extracted using 1 0 n ch3coonh4 ph 4 8 the plant part samples were acid digested and an aliquot of tri acid hno3 hclo4 h2so4 3 2 1 digest was evaporated to dryness the remaining residue was solubilized in small volumes of de ionized water and sodium acetate acetic acid buffer the red coloured complex was measured at 490 nm wavelength using spectrophotometer systronics 166 2 4 statistical methods experimental data were summarized and required statistical calculations were performed using excel minitab 14 r 3 3 as per the requirement estimation results of the elements has been presented as the mean sd we considered to compute the relationship between two sources of arsenic and other elements soil and irrigated water with different parts of a paddy plant e g root straw husk and grain using canonical correlation analysis cca the multiple regression analysis determined the dynamics and dependency of the analyzed elements from the multiple sources soil and groundwater to the paddy plant parts through the canonical correlation variables created with estimated canonical coefficients 2 4 1 translocation factor calculation the translocation factors of all the minerals and or pollutants were calculated following kar et al 2011 soil to plant root translocation was calculated using formula concentration in root concentration in soil from root to straw was calculated using formula concentration in straw concentration in root straw to husk translocation was calculated using formula concentration in husk concentration in straw straw to rice grain translocation was calculated using formula concentration in rice grain concentration in straw 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in paddy field soil physicochemical parameters of the paddy field soil of both the endemic and control area was assessed and we found no significant differences among the soil texture ph ec cec and organic carbon table 1 mean arsenic concentration of the paddy field soil was 7 06 0 81 mg kg higher p 0 00 than the control area mean 1 03 0 01 mg kg table 2 some previous studies in the same endemic areas reported soil arsenic concentration as 11 35 mg kg roychowdhury et al 2002 7 0 38 0 mg kg norra et al 2005 1 34 14 09 mg kg bhattacharya et al 2009 in seleniferous and non seleniferous areas in india the range of total selenium was 0 31 4 55 and 0 08 0 55 mg kg respectively dhillon et al 1992 mean selenium concentration in arsenic endemic areas of the present study is 0 32 0 03 mg kg the data are quite similar to a previous study of roychowdhury et al 2002 although indicated deficient levels of selenium selenium is an antagonist to arsenic wang et al 2001 sun et al 2014 since soluble soil selenium taken up by plants is also the dietary source for animal and human health knowledge of the selenium concentration in the respective soil is important as the selenium may help to counteract arsenic toxicity sun et al 2014 throughout many high rainfall regions soluble soil selenium available to plants is leached from the soils and contributes to animal and human selenium deficiency oldfield 2002 in the present study low se concentration in the paddy field soil leads to less se uptake in the paddy plant parts which in a way increase the arsenic toxicity risk from rice grain consumption the iron concentration in the paddy soil of the endemic areas was 14 99 0 97 mg kg and it was 22 03 4 52 mg kg in the control areas table 2 roychowdhury et al 2002 reported very high soil iron concentration 6740 mg kg in a study in the domkol block another most arsenic endemic region of west bengal bioavailable phosphate concentration in the paddy field soil was 6 24 0 57 mg kg and 8 62 4 57 mg kg in the endemic and control areas respectively frequent uses of the phosphate fertilizers were noted in both endemic and control areas attributing to the fact of higher phosphate availability in the field soil a higher bioavailable phosphate concentration might have role is making soil arsenic available for plant uptake as the uptake channel of available phosphate and arsenic is same in the paddy plant the interactive and competition dynamics of the arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in soil has been discussed in the following section 3 4 3 2 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in irrigation water sampling was done only for dry winter season as there is maximum groundwater use during this time arsenic concentration mean of the endemic area groundwater was 0 41 0 11 mg l significantly p 0 00 higher than the arsenic concentration of the control area and also higher than who and caussy 2005 permissible limit and indian standard of arsenic concentration in drinking water of 0 01 mg l the arsenic concentration was also higher than the maximum recommended concentration of 0 10 mg l fao ayers and westcot 1985 and is of serious concern for its food chain transformation through soil to crop to human path way irrigation water of both the endemic and control areas is iron rich mean 2 45 mg l and 0 16 mg l respectively in both the cases it was higher than normal level of iron in drinking water 0 3 mg l recommended maximum fe concentration for irrigation water is 5 mg l however it is not toxic to the plants in aerated soils but can contribute to soil acidification and loss of phosphorus and molybdenum bioavailability fao ayers and westcot 1985 for the plants chatterjee et al 2010 reported the range of iron concentration 1 2 16 0 mg l from the same study region which is in good agreement with the present study also this iron may lead to the dissolution of arsenic from arsenic bearing minerals as has been found in the field study of neidhardt et al 2014 in another study to find the role of competing ions in the mobilization of arsenic in groundwater biswas et al 2014d found the presence of ferrihydrite as the better predictor of arsenic occurrence and concluded that 100 increase or decrease of fe in the aqueous system corresponds to the 12 decrease or around 10 increase of arsenic in the system respectively from these studies it was clear that the presence of highiron in the system in the present study obviously leading to greater arsenic availability in the system the selenium concentration of the irrigated water in the endemic areas 0 25 0 04 mg l was significantly higher p 0 00 than the control area 0 02 0 02 mg l the maximum recommended se concentration for the irrigation water has been proposed by the fao as 0 02 mg l fao ayers and westcot 1985 and more than that is toxic to plants toxic at concentrations as low as 0 025 mg l and toxic to livestock if forage is grown in soils with relatively high levels of added selenium the source of the selenium in the groundwater seems to be natural whereas the phosphates may be bioavailable upon leaching from phosphate fertilizer as we noticed significantly higher p 0 00 phosphate concentration in the control area samples 2 09 0 03 mg l than the endemic area 0 92 0 05 mg l which clearly implies the fact of using the phosphate fertilizer in both endemic and control areas 3 3 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in paddy plant parts in arsenic endemic areas total arsenic concentration in the paddy plant parts followed the order as root straw husk grain table 2 we found high p 0 00 arsenic concentration mean 11 97 3 10 mg kg in rice plant roots of the endemic region compared to the control areas 2 40 0 31 mg kg it is reasonable to conclude that rice roots retain poisonous arsenic and the fact was shown in some the previous reports also roychowdhury et al 2002 norra et al 2005 bhattacharya et al 2009 plant root have also shown higher selenium concentration compared to the other part table 2 considering endemic and control sites in endemic areas rice root phosphate concentration is less than husk and iron concentration is less than straw comparing with the control sites there is no proper trend of iron and bioavailable phosphate accumulation rice husk has the retention capacity for arsenic resulting into higher arsenic concentration in the husk than the rice grain it is a case of phytoextrusion which protect rice grain from being more contaminated in laboratory experiment rice husk was shown to adsorb maximum 90 7 arsenic from water when used externally as the filtering agent asif and chen 2017 in the present study we found high arsenic concentration 0 84 0 10 mg kg in the rice husk of the endemic area samples compared to the control area however in the control area samples there was no significant difference of arsenic concentration in the husk to rice grain available phosphate concentration 5 67 0 24 mg kg was also quite higher than the control area samples in endemic and control area samples iron concentration was less in the husk compared to grain table 2 rice grain deserves particular attention as after cooking and discarding the gruel also it contains sufficient amount of arsenic could lead to arsenic related health problems for us rice grain contains more arsenic among the grains because of its anaerobic growing environment and unique physiology in flooded cultivation environment of the paddy arsenic is brought into the plant by its silicon transporters and then used in place of silicon to strengthen the plant stem and husks including the grain part meharg and zhao 2012 in the rice grain samples of the endemic area arsenic concentration 0 55 0 03 mg kg was higher p 0 00 than selenium concentration 0 34 0 02 mg kg iron 1 84 0 11 mg kg and bioavailable phosphate 1 44 0 03 mg kg concentration were higher than both arsenic and selenium in the control area rice grain contained 0 02 0 02 mg kg 0 034 0 01 mg kg 0 08 0 04 mg kg 0 89 0 91 mg kg of arsenic selenium available phosphate and iron respectively the general trend of different metal and non metal was found to be in the order of iron bioavailable phosphate arsenic selenium in rice grain considering endemic and control area some previous studies in the arsenic endemic areas of bengal delta region found the rice grain arsenic concentration as 0 24 mg kg roychowdhury et al 2002 0 30 mg kg norra et al 2005 0 16 0 58 mg kg in summer rice bhattacharya et al 2010 and 0 19 0 78 mg kg in winter rice bhattacharya et al 2010 cereal crops are more se tolerent than leguminous crops in general crops containing less than 0 1 mg kg se are considered deficient for animals and humans slekovec and goessler 2005 considering the fact control area rice grain samples seems to be se deficient compared to endemic region the interactive and competition dynamics of the arsenic selenium iron and available phosphate in soil has been discussed in the following sub section 3 4 3 4 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate competition dynamics from water and soil to paddy plant parts physicochemical parameters of the paddy field soil of both the endemic and control areas were assessed and we found no significant differences among the soil texture ph ec cec and organic carbon it was important as the small change in ph significantly effect the arsenite and arsenate mobility in the aquifers the groundwater sources biswas et al 2014d the metals and non metals we assessed in the soil irrigated water and paddy plant parts were itself competitive and interactive to be phytoavailable and subsequent translocation through paddy plant parts table 2 showed the comparison of arsenic selenium bioavailable phosphate and iron concentration in irrigated water soil and different parts of paddy plant i e root straw husk and grain collected from the endemic and the control area the arsenic concentration in irrigated water soil and all the parts of paddy plants collected from the endemic fields were significantly higher compared to the control area we found significantly higher amount of iron and arsenic in soil and paddy root respectively in the endemic area compared to the control area the fact can be attributed to the sequestration of the arsenic onto iron plaques on the root surfaces of paddy plants liu et al 2004a 2004b 2006 chen et al 2005 husk had a significant amount of phosphate and this may be the cause of less translocation of arsenic from root to straw fig 1 fig 1 shows the translocation factors of different minerals in the paddy plant parts we observed very good antagonistic relationship between arsenic and selenium in case of soil to root to straw to husk to rice grain translocation to the best of our knowledge this is the first report about interactive relationship of arsenic and selenium on uptake translocation by wetland plants studied in the field scale previously also researchers suggested that the presence of inorganic selenium decrease the arsenic translocation from root to shoot and decrease the arsenic levels in edible part grain but missed the translocation situation which leads to comparatively less human health risk from rice consumption hu et al 2014 for the other minerals no proper trends were observed canonical correlation analysis cca table 3 found the maximum possible association between two sets of variables the first one as the source irrigated water and soil and the other one is paddy plant parts root straw husk and grain by finding linear combinations of the variables the canonical correlation analysis was chosen as it can be used to identify and measure the associations among two sets of variables and it was appropriate here as the metal interaction and competition analysis was based on multiple regression and as an obvious fact there were multiple inter correlated outcome variables the canonical correlation showed table 3 a positive correlation between the sources of metals through irrigated water and soil onto the paddy plant parts in both endemic and control areas in every case of the minerals arsenic selenium available phosphate and iron we found a significant positive correlation 99 confidence level that means significant amount of the minerals have been translocated from the source to the paddy plant the fact also implied that there were not any significant factors affecting the significant translocation of the minerals from source to paddy plant further the canonical correlation weights vectors have been analyzed table 4 and we found some thing interesting in case of arsenic and selenium mainly the soil was the bulk source for paddy plant whereas for bioavailable phosphate and iron the irrigated water was the bulk source we assessed the seven times higher arsenic translocation in the plant part from soil than irrigated water around two and a half times more selenium was translocated from soil than irrigated water so only arsenic free ground water supply for the irrigation can not resist the paddy plant to gain arsenic into its parts where the soil itself having high arsenic load only the sustainable use of ground water can resist the paddy plant to uptake the phosphate and iron into its parts the canonical correlation weights vectors analysis found interesting nature of the mineral translocation through the paddy plant parts table 4 the rice husk and grain had more affinity for arsenic and selenium than the root and straw selenium is well transported through the root to straw to husk to grain compared to arsenic iron and bioavailable phosphate rice grain has more phosphate affinity compared to other examined parts of the paddy plant rice husk is more efficient iron transporter than the other plant part present manuscript was meant to analyze the changes of concentration of different element in different parts of paddy plants with the concentration changes in the main stock i e in soil and irrigated water and to assess the competition dynamics of the element during source to plant parts translocation to analyze the interrelationship of the elements during translocation we worked on the multiple dependent variables and since all the variables characteristics are part of the single study subject i e paddy plant the linear combination of root straw husk and grain of the paddy plant was created using the estimated canonical coefficients for further analysis i e anderson darling statistics ad stat table 5 here the ad stat deals with distributional adequacy of the element in different system i e source and translocation system and ended with a new and interesting finding the selenium was the most irresistive element among the considered elements considering the source and plant part translocation the new cc canonical correlation variables were then used to snap the changes of the metals concentration in paddy plants with changes of the levels of metals in soil and irrigated water using multiple regression analysis the cc variables created through the canonical correlation analysis followed normal distributions table 5 and fig 2 thus ccs were normal variate with mean xβ and variance unity where x is the vector of independent variables comprising soil and irrigated water the parameters of the model were estimated using maximum likelihood based on the likelihood function of the normal distribution the estimates were derived using a newton raphson iteration scheme multiple regression analysis results have been presented in the table 6 things to remember here that the element source i e irrigated water and soil was considered as a unit source and plant parts were considered as the unit uploading source the p values showed that arsenic concentration in a paddy plant has a significant positive relation to arsenic sources of irrigated water and soil when arsenic in the whole plant was considered results also implied that one unit increase in arsenic concentration in soil and irrigated water resulted in an average 3 660 fold and 1 345 fold increase of the arsenic concentration in paddy plants respectively selenium concentration in paddy plants was also significantly related to selenium present in soil p 0 01 and resulted average 0 678 fold increase into the paddy plant with a unit change of selenium concentration in soil the iron concentration in the paddy plant was related with iron concentration of irrigated water p 0 01 with a 0 365 fold increment however phosphate concentration in the paddy plant was not significantly related to soil and irrigated water the overall competitive dynamics of the element and paddy plant parts has been summarized in fig 3 4 conclusions soil and irrigation water arsenic level is of great public health concern as it leads to significant crop contamination and the phenomenon compounded by continuous uses of contaminated irrigation water the present study ascertained specific soil elements dynamics on to paddy plant parts in spatial scale through the food chain the elements get into plants to human food represents a lesser source of arsenic toxicity than drinking the contaminated groundwater but constant low level chronic exposure increases the occurrence of arsenicosis present paper found significant presence of arsenic bioavailable phosphate iron and selenium in paddy plant parts and studied the correlation of the presence of these elements in the plant parts elements as se fe po4 3 compete in paddy plant uptake due to hostile and synergism among those as the soils remain rich in arsenic and other toxic elements the contamination free groundwater supply alone cannot check the elements translocation through the food chain path unit as increase in soil and irrigated water result 3 660 and 1 345 fold as increase in paddy plants soil was a bulk source of as and se irrigated water was the bulk source of bioavailable po4 3 and fe for paddy plant more se is transported through root straw husk grain than as fe bioavailable po4 3 detailed study is further required to estimate the magnitude of food contamination by arsenic and other toxic elements a restriction on the withdrawal of groundwater should also be considered as these dumps the elements onto the soil acknowledgement the first author thanks to science and engineering research board department of science

increased po4 3 application in soil may increase the arsenite uptake over arsenate meharg et al 1994 abedin et al 2002 found the phosphate as the controlling factor arsenic translocation in paddy plant parts except the rice husk therefore the impact of po43 on arsenic uptake remained unsolved arsenic has an antagonistic relationship with selenium these interacts and may result in excretion of their mutual metabolite like s glutathionyl gailer et al 2000 this confounding excretion of selenium can be a health concern as selenium an essential micronutrient supports antioxidation haemoprevention and immunocompetence and low selenium status is found with the occurrence of illnesses such as diabetes can et al 2005 cancer clark et al 1996 polio virus broome et al 2004 hiv baum et al 2000 the dietary mechanism for incorporation of selenium into the body is through ingestion of plant and animal products that are grown in soils containing selenium tapiero et al 2003 studies show that selenium supplementation can actually mitigate arsenic poisoning wang et al 2001 and itself toxic in high doses and an essential antioxidant in smaller doses schrauzer 2003 so selenium intake via dietary items is crucial for the arsenic endemic population low se can decrease as toxicity via excretion of as se compound at high concentration excessive se can enhance as toxicity by reacting with s adenosylmethionine and glutathione and modifying the structure and activity of arsenite methyltransferase sun et al 2014 there is as se interaction and or competition during paddy plant uptake when both are present in the system like the presence of se either alone or added along with as significantly reduce the as concentration and its uptake by different parts of paddy plants pandey and gupta 2015 chauhan et al 2017 and higher reduction in as concentration was observed with the addition of the highest level of applied se 0 10 mg kg kaur et al 2017 selenium antagonizes the toxic effects of arsenic on mung bean phaseolus aureus roxb plants by restricting its uptake and enhancing the antioxidative and detoxification mechanisms malik et al 2012 from the above discussion it was clear that the presence of iron bioavailable phosphate and selenium play role to make arsenic available for the crop plant uptake from soil and irrigation water the present work has been ascertained to find the co regulation of iron bioavailable phosphate and selenium in arsenic uptake from soil and water system to paddy plant parts the study also intended to look into the status of these elements and or contaminants into the rice grain if is playing role to abate the arsenic naturally the study will explore the dependence liaison of occurrence of arsenic and other elements in useful parts of paddy plants to meet aim of the study one control area was selected to understand the role of soil and irrigated ground water separately consideration of one area with no to very less arsenic input through the irrigation water was of utmost requirement 2 experimental 2 1 study area we collected samples during the winter season from the paddy fields of chakdaha and haringhata blocks of nadia district the acknowledged arsenic endemic regions in west bengal das et al 1995 roychowdhury 2002 biswas and santra 2012a biswas et al 2013 2014a 2014b groundwater is extensively used for agri irrigation purposes and arsenic concentration are frequently high in both irrigation and drinking water as depicted from the previous reports roychowdhury 2002 biswas and santra 2012a b 2013 2014a 2014b the control area fields were chosen from a village of hooghly district reportedly with no occurrence of arsenic in groundwater 10 µg l guha mazumder et al 2013 biswas et al 2014a 2014b in the present manuscript to meet aim of the study the selection of one control area was mandatory we considered the arsenic and other elements interaction during translocation from soil and water to paddy plant so to understand the role of soil and irrigated ground water separately consideration of one area with less or no arsenic input through the irrigation water was of utmost requirement moreover the study was completely field based so choosing of one control site was indispensable 2 2 sample collection irrigated water samples n 24 were collected 50 ml during the uniform rate of discharge from irrigation pumps in polyethylene containers and were acidified with nitric acid hno3 ag merck germany for preservation das et al 1995 biswas and santra 2012a 2012b field soil samples 0 15 cm depth n 20 were collected from each sampling sites composite samples of rice root n 60 straw n 60 husk n 60 rice grain n 60 were collected directly from the paddy fields collected samples were transferred and preserved in the laboratory for further analysis 2 3 sample treatment and analysis water samples were kept in 4 c till further analysis soil samples were immediately sun dried followed by oven drying at 60 c to a constant weight paddy plant parts samples except grain were washed with distilled water and dried in hot air oven at 60 c for 72 h these were ground into a fine homogenized powder for chemical analysis soil root straw husk and rice grain were acid digested using heating block rahman et al 2007 biswas et al 2014a 2017 total arsenic and total selenium was estimated using flow injection hydride generation flame atomic absorption spectrometry fi hg aas perkin elmer a analyst 200 biswas and santra 2012a 2012b biswas et al 2014a 2017 the quality control of the estimation included the analysis of standardized reference rice flour nist usa srm 1568a for plant samples san joaquin soil nist usa srm 2709a for soil samples and indian water standard crm bnd 301 from national physical laboratory new delhi following the same treatment like the samples bioavailable phosphate concentration was estimated colorimetrically by 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 5 extract of soil and plant parts olsen and sommers 1982 total iron in the water soil and plant samples was estimated after a small modification of the method of saywell and cunningham 1937 from the soil iron was extracted using 1 0 n ch3coonh4 ph 4 8 the plant part samples were acid digested and an aliquot of tri acid hno3 hclo4 h2so4 3 2 1 digest was evaporated to dryness the remaining residue was solubilized in small volumes of de ionized water and sodium acetate acetic acid buffer the red coloured complex was measured at 490 nm wavelength using spectrophotometer systronics 166 2 4 statistical methods experimental data were summarized and required statistical calculations were performed using excel minitab 14 r 3 3 as per the requirement estimation results of the elements has been presented as the mean sd we considered to compute the relationship between two sources of arsenic and other elements soil and irrigated water with different parts of a paddy plant e g root straw husk and grain using canonical correlation analysis cca the multiple regression analysis determined the dynamics and dependency of the analyzed elements from the multiple sources soil and groundwater to the paddy plant parts through the canonical correlation variables created with estimated canonical coefficients 2 4 1 translocation factor calculation the translocation factors of all the minerals and or pollutants were calculated following kar et al 2011 soil to plant root translocation was calculated using formula concentration in root concentration in soil from root to straw was calculated using formula concentration in straw concentration in root straw to husk translocation was calculated using formula concentration in husk concentration in straw straw to rice grain translocation was calculated using formula concentration in rice grain concentration in straw 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in paddy field soil physicochemical parameters of the paddy field soil of both the endemic and control area was assessed and we found no significant differences among the soil texture ph ec cec and organic carbon table 1 mean arsenic concentration of the paddy field soil was 7 06 0 81 mg kg higher p 0 00 than the control area mean 1 03 0 01 mg kg table 2 some previous studies in the same endemic areas reported soil arsenic concentration as 11 35 mg kg roychowdhury et al 2002 7 0 38 0 mg kg norra et al 2005 1 34 14 09 mg kg bhattacharya et al 2009 in seleniferous and non seleniferous areas in india the range of total selenium was 0 31 4 55 and 0 08 0 55 mg kg respectively dhillon et al 1992 mean selenium concentration in arsenic endemic areas of the present study is 0 32 0 03 mg kg the data are quite similar to a previous study of roychowdhury et al 2002 although indicated deficient levels of selenium selenium is an antagonist to arsenic wang et al 2001 sun et al 2014 since soluble soil selenium taken up by plants is also the dietary source for animal and human health knowledge of the selenium concentration in the respective soil is important as the selenium may help to counteract arsenic toxicity sun et al 2014 throughout many high rainfall regions soluble soil selenium available to plants is leached from the soils and contributes to animal and human selenium deficiency oldfield 2002 in the present study low se concentration in the paddy field soil leads to less se uptake in the paddy plant parts which in a way increase the arsenic toxicity risk from rice grain consumption the iron concentration in the paddy soil of the endemic areas was 14 99 0 97 mg kg and it was 22 03 4 52 mg kg in the control areas table 2 roychowdhury et al 2002 reported very high soil iron concentration 6740 mg kg in a study in the domkol block another most arsenic endemic region of west bengal bioavailable phosphate concentration in the paddy field soil was 6 24 0 57 mg kg and 8 62 4 57 mg kg in the endemic and control areas respectively frequent uses of the phosphate fertilizers were noted in both endemic and control areas attributing to the fact of higher phosphate availability in the field soil a higher bioavailable phosphate concentration might have role is making soil arsenic available for plant uptake as the uptake channel of available phosphate and arsenic is same in the paddy plant the interactive and competition dynamics of the arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in soil has been discussed in the following section 3 4 3 2 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in irrigation water sampling was done only for dry winter season as there is maximum groundwater use during this time arsenic concentration mean of the endemic area groundwater was 0 41 0 11 mg l significantly p 0 00 higher than the arsenic concentration of the control area and also higher than who and caussy 2005 permissible limit and indian standard of arsenic concentration in drinking water of 0 01 mg l the arsenic concentration was also higher than the maximum recommended concentration of 0 10 mg l fao ayers and westcot 1985 and is of serious concern for its food chain transformation through soil to crop to human path way irrigation water of both the endemic and control areas is iron rich mean 2 45 mg l and 0 16 mg l respectively in both the cases it was higher than normal level of iron in drinking water 0 3 mg l recommended maximum fe concentration for irrigation water is 5 mg l however it is not toxic to the plants in aerated soils but can contribute to soil acidification and loss of phosphorus and molybdenum bioavailability fao ayers and westcot 1985 for the plants chatterjee et al 2010 reported the range of iron concentration 1 2 16 0 mg l from the same study region which is in good agreement with the present study also this iron may lead to the dissolution of arsenic from arsenic bearing minerals as has been found in the field study of neidhardt et al 2014 in another study to find the role of competing ions in the mobilization of arsenic in groundwater biswas et al 2014d found the presence of ferrihydrite as the better predictor of arsenic occurrence and concluded that 100 increase or decrease of fe in the aqueous system corresponds to the 12 decrease or around 10 increase of arsenic in the system respectively from these studies it was clear that the presence of highiron in the system in the present study obviously leading to greater arsenic availability in the system the selenium concentration of the irrigated water in the endemic areas 0 25 0 04 mg l was significantly higher p 0 00 than the control area 0 02 0 02 mg l the maximum recommended se concentration for the irrigation water has been proposed by the fao as 0 02 mg l fao ayers and westcot 1985 and more than that is toxic to plants toxic at concentrations as low as 0 025 mg l and toxic to livestock if forage is grown in soils with relatively high levels of added selenium the source of the selenium in the groundwater seems to be natural whereas the phosphates may be bioavailable upon leaching from phosphate fertilizer as we noticed significantly higher p 0 00 phosphate concentration in the control area samples 2 09 0 03 mg l than the endemic area 0 92 0 05 mg l which clearly implies the fact of using the phosphate fertilizer in both endemic and control areas 3 3 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate in paddy plant parts in arsenic endemic areas total arsenic concentration in the paddy plant parts followed the order as root straw husk grain table 2 we found high p 0 00 arsenic concentration mean 11 97 3 10 mg kg in rice plant roots of the endemic region compared to the control areas 2 40 0 31 mg kg it is reasonable to conclude that rice roots retain poisonous arsenic and the fact was shown in some the previous reports also roychowdhury et al 2002 norra et al 2005 bhattacharya et al 2009 plant root have also shown higher selenium concentration compared to the other part table 2 considering endemic and control sites in endemic areas rice root phosphate concentration is less than husk and iron concentration is less than straw comparing with the control sites there is no proper trend of iron and bioavailable phosphate accumulation rice husk has the retention capacity for arsenic resulting into higher arsenic concentration in the husk than the rice grain it is a case of phytoextrusion which protect rice grain from being more contaminated in laboratory experiment rice husk was shown to adsorb maximum 90 7 arsenic from water when used externally as the filtering agent asif and chen 2017 in the present study we found high arsenic concentration 0 84 0 10 mg kg in the rice husk of the endemic area samples compared to the control area however in the control area samples there was no significant difference of arsenic concentration in the husk to rice grain available phosphate concentration 5 67 0 24 mg kg was also quite higher than the control area samples in endemic and control area samples iron concentration was less in the husk compared to grain table 2 rice grain deserves particular attention as after cooking and discarding the gruel also it contains sufficient amount of arsenic could lead to arsenic related health problems for us rice grain contains more arsenic among the grains because of its anaerobic growing environment and unique physiology in flooded cultivation environment of the paddy arsenic is brought into the plant by its silicon transporters and then used in place of silicon to strengthen the plant stem and husks including the grain part meharg and zhao 2012 in the rice grain samples of the endemic area arsenic concentration 0 55 0 03 mg kg was higher p 0 00 than selenium concentration 0 34 0 02 mg kg iron 1 84 0 11 mg kg and bioavailable phosphate 1 44 0 03 mg kg concentration were higher than both arsenic and selenium in the control area rice grain contained 0 02 0 02 mg kg 0 034 0 01 mg kg 0 08 0 04 mg kg 0 89 0 91 mg kg of arsenic selenium available phosphate and iron respectively the general trend of different metal and non metal was found to be in the order of iron bioavailable phosphate arsenic selenium in rice grain considering endemic and control area some previous studies in the arsenic endemic areas of bengal delta region found the rice grain arsenic concentration as 0 24 mg kg roychowdhury et al 2002 0 30 mg kg norra et al 2005 0 16 0 58 mg kg in summer rice bhattacharya et al 2010 and 0 19 0 78 mg kg in winter rice bhattacharya et al 2010 cereal crops are more se tolerent than leguminous crops in general crops containing less than 0 1 mg kg se are considered deficient for animals and humans slekovec and goessler 2005 considering the fact control area rice grain samples seems to be se deficient compared to endemic region the interactive and competition dynamics of the arsenic selenium iron and available phosphate in soil has been discussed in the following sub section 3 4 3 4 arsenic selenium iron and bioavailable phosphate competition dynamics from water and soil to paddy plant parts physicochemical parameters of the paddy field soil of both the endemic and control areas were assessed and we found no significant differences among the soil texture ph ec cec and organic carbon it was important as the small change in ph significantly effect the arsenite and arsenate mobility in the aquifers the groundwater sources biswas et al 2014d the metals and non metals we assessed in the soil irrigated water and paddy plant parts were itself competitive and interactive to be phytoavailable and subsequent translocation through paddy plant parts table 2 showed the comparison of arsenic selenium bioavailable phosphate and iron concentration in irrigated water soil and different parts of paddy plant i e root straw husk and grain collected from the endemic and the control area the arsenic concentration in irrigated water soil and all the parts of paddy plants collected from the endemic fields were significantly higher compared to the control area we found significantly higher amount of iron and arsenic in soil and paddy root respectively in the endemic area compared to the control area the fact can be attributed to the sequestration of the arsenic onto iron plaques on the root surfaces of paddy plants liu et al 2004a 2004b 2006 chen et al 2005 husk had a significant amount of phosphate and this may be the cause of less translocation of arsenic from root to straw fig 1 fig 1 shows the translocation factors of different minerals in the paddy plant parts we observed very good antagonistic relationship between arsenic and selenium in case of soil to root to straw to husk to rice grain translocation to the best of our knowledge this is the first report about interactive relationship of arsenic and selenium on uptake translocation by wetland plants studied in the field scale previously also researchers suggested that the presence of inorganic selenium decrease the arsenic translocation from root to shoot and decrease the arsenic levels in edible part grain but missed the translocation situation which leads to comparatively less human health risk from rice consumption hu et al 2014 for the other minerals no proper trends were observed canonical correlation analysis cca table 3 found the maximum possible association between two sets of variables the first one as the source irrigated water and soil and the other one is paddy plant parts root straw husk and grain by finding linear combinations of the variables the canonical correlation analysis was chosen as it can be used to identify and measure the associations among two sets of variables and it was appropriate here as the metal interaction and competition analysis was based on multiple regression and as an obvious fact there were multiple inter correlated outcome variables the canonical correlation showed table 3 a positive correlation between the sources of metals through irrigated water and soil onto the paddy plant parts in both endemic and control areas in every case of the minerals arsenic selenium available phosphate and iron we found a significant positive correlation 99 confidence level that means significant amount of the minerals have been translocated from the source to the paddy plant the fact also implied that there were not any significant factors affecting the significant translocation of the minerals from source to paddy plant further the canonical correlation weights vectors have been analyzed table 4 and we found some thing interesting in case of arsenic and selenium mainly the soil was the bulk source for paddy plant whereas for bioavailable phosphate and iron the irrigated water was the bulk source we assessed the seven times higher arsenic translocation in the plant part from soil than irrigated water around two and a half times more selenium was translocated from soil than irrigated water so only arsenic free ground water supply for the irrigation can not resist the paddy plant to gain arsenic into its parts where the soil itself having high arsenic load only the sustainable use of ground water can resist the paddy plant to uptake the phosphate and iron into its parts the canonical correlation weights vectors analysis found interesting nature of the mineral translocation through the paddy plant parts table 4 the rice husk and grain had more affinity for arsenic and selenium than the root and straw selenium is well transported through the root to straw to husk to grain compared to arsenic iron and bioavailable phosphate rice grain has more phosphate affinity compared to other examined parts of the paddy plant rice husk is more efficient iron transporter than the other plant part present manuscript was meant to analyze the changes of concentration of different element in different parts of paddy plants with the concentration changes in the main stock i e in soil and irrigated water and to assess the competition dynamics of the element during source to plant parts translocation to analyze the interrelationship of the elements during translocation we worked on the multiple dependent variables and since all the variables characteristics are part of the single study subject i e paddy plant the linear combination of root straw husk and grain of the paddy plant was created using the estimated canonical coefficients for further analysis i e anderson darling statistics ad stat table 5 here the ad stat deals with distributional adequacy of the element in different system i e source and translocation system and ended with a new and interesting finding the selenium was the most irresistive element among the considered elements considering the source and plant part translocation the new cc canonical correlation variables were then used to snap the changes of the metals concentration in paddy plants with changes of the levels of metals in soil and irrigated water using multiple regression analysis the cc variables created through the canonical correlation analysis followed normal distributions table 5 and fig 2 thus ccs were normal variate with mean xβ and variance unity where x is the vector of independent variables comprising soil and irrigated water the parameters of the model were estimated using maximum likelihood based on the likelihood function of the normal distribution the estimates were derived using a newton raphson iteration scheme multiple regression analysis results have been presented in the table 6 things to remember here that the element source i e irrigated water and soil was considered as a unit source and plant parts were considered as the unit uploading source the p values showed that arsenic concentration in a paddy plant has a significant positive relation to arsenic sources of irrigated water and soil when arsenic in the whole plant was considered results also implied that one unit increase in arsenic concentration in soil and irrigated water resulted in an average 3 660 fold and 1 345 fold increase of the arsenic concentration in paddy plants respectively selenium concentration in paddy plants was also significantly related to selenium present in soil p 0 01 and resulted average 0 678 fold increase into the paddy plant with a unit change of selenium concentration in soil the iron concentration in the paddy plant was related with iron concentration of irrigated water p 0 01 with a 0 365 fold increment however phosphate concentration in the paddy plant was not significantly related to soil and irrigated water the overall competitive dynamics of the element and paddy plant parts has been summarized in fig 3 4 conclusions soil and irrigation water arsenic level is of great public health concern as it leads to significant crop contamination and the phenomenon compounded by continuous uses of contaminated irrigation water the present study ascertained specific soil elements dynamics on to paddy plant parts in spatial scale through the food chain the elements get into plants to human food represents a lesser source of arsenic toxicity than drinking the contaminated groundwater but constant low level chronic exposure increases the occurrence of arsenicosis present paper found significant presence of arsenic bioavailable phosphate iron and selenium in paddy plant parts and studied the correlation of the presence of these elements in the plant parts elements as se fe po4 3 compete in paddy plant uptake due to hostile and synergism among those as the soils remain rich in arsenic and other toxic elements the contamination free groundwater supply alone cannot check the elements translocation through the food chain path unit as increase in soil and irrigated water result 3 660 and 1 345 fold as increase in paddy plants soil was a bulk source of as and se irrigated water was the bulk source of bioavailable po4 3 and fe for paddy plant more se is transported through root straw husk grain than as fe bioavailable po4 3 detailed study is further required to estimate the magnitude of food contamination by arsenic and other toxic elements a restriction on the withdrawal of groundwater should also be considered as these dumps the elements onto the soil acknowledgement the first author thanks to science and engineering research board department of science

12368,due to high quality pure potable artesian groundwater is the main source of water supply for the fisheries in ararat valley armenia as a result of increased groundwater abstraction for fish farming the long term viability of groundwater aquifers as well as groundwater use by other sectors in the ararat valley is challenged in a response to observed deterioration of water availability in ararat valley starting in 2013 new policies and relatively strict regulations on water use were put in place and intensive fish production systems are being promoted the current study aims to analyse the water footprint of small and medium scale groundwater based aquaculture farms the largest and most sensitive to changes proportion of farming operations in ararat valley and to determine their role in groundwater sustainability in the region our results demonstrate that the promotion and successful implementation of more intensive low cost fish farming systems can address the gross underutilization of valuable groundwater resources and lead to a significant improvement of water resource efficiency in ararat valley fisheries an additional benefit will be a decrease in environmental degradation due to the management of nutrient rich aquaculture discharges into receiving water bodies and soil waterlogging in the area graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater

conditions of water use permits and promoting semi closed recirculating aquaculture systems rass instead of traditional flow through configurations although as a result of these measures the total groundwater use in the area decreased by 8 and 28 in fish farms compared to 2013 volumes the main environmental impacts of groundwater overexploitation are still sever total groundwater abstraction in ararat valley in 2016 still exceeded sustainability levels by 45 calculated using data from asired 2016a moreover the unsustainable use of groundwater resources lead to negative social and

to the technical complexity of these operations and large initial construction costs while these issues can be easily overcome by large aquaculture farms with high production volumes and revenues small and medium scale farms become the most sensitive operations to water shortage and economic and environmental constraints in the valley in the current study we are analysing water resource use and efficiency of small and medium scale groundwater based aquaculture farms in ararat valley and to determine the potential of implementing semi recirculation technology in groundwater sustainability in the region 2 methods 2 1 study area the ararat valley 1300km2 is one of the largest plains of armenian plateau latitude 39 49 53 58 n longitude 44 37 55 6 e it is the most densely populated area in the republic of armenia ra most of the country s agricultural and industrial production as well as approximately 50 of useable groundwater resources are concentrated in this region the study area includes 3 villages in 2 provinces ararat and armavir of the ararat valley with a high density of groundwater based fish farms 2 2 sampling scheme and data collection fish farms surveyed were sampled from a general database provided by the ministry of agriculture of ra only farms with water abstraction of less than 250l s falling into the category of small 150l s and medium 150 250l s water users were considered within this dataset 14 farms were sampled and the on farm survey based on a semi structured interview was conducted each farm was visited and a questionnaire was completed with each farm owner operator the questionnaire structure was devised to obtain information on 1 operational modes such as farm structures equipment grown fish types and production volumes 2 economic inputs and outputs 3 groundwater use efficiency including water abstraction volumes water use permits wups and water discharge options in addition with the aid of each farmer contours of the aquaculture system units for each farm were identified on a colour print of an aerial photograph and fish growth unit volumes and water flow volumes were calculated whenever possible questionnaire parameters were expressed as numeric values otherwise they were expressed as categorical variables yes no or classes of value the heterogeneity among farms was analysed by using the concept of farming style defined by van der ploeg 1994 as a way in which one has to organise and manage a farm that is generally accepted by a more or less connected group of farmers two types of fish farming styles were identified monoculture farms producing a single fish species and poly culture farm producing more than one fish species either in serial or combined manner the farms were also categorised according to water use and flow types mirzoyan et al 2010 2 3 volumetric assessment of groundwater draft and efficiency in fish production general groundwater use in ararat valley and by the aquaculture sector in detail was calculated using data provided by aspired 2016a the share of small and medium sized farms in groundwater use was calculated as a portion of total use water resource efficiency was calculated as a proportion of abstracted groundwater used to produce fish at a rate of 1t year for poly culture operations where water is sequentially re used the calculations consider equal sharing of water between production types with the factor of sharing included a factor of 2 is used for efficiency calculations in poly culture farm growing 2 species and factor of 3 for 3 fish species to assess the potential of water efficient fish farming operations in reducing groundwater abstraction data is compared to low cost semi intensive ras configurations of danish model types 1 semi ras configuration and 3 ras

total water intake ranges from 20 to 180l s with an average use of 69l s table 1 all of the farms have raceway configurations containing 5 to 21 concrete and or earthen culture ponds raceways also known as flow through systems are inland operations where water moves through the aquaculture structure in a unidirectional manner in order to maintain the required level of water quality mirzoyan et al 2010 the raceway configurations typical for ararat valley farms generally operate with high water use with very low water efficiency due to the lack of water treatment units mirzoyan et al 2010 water supply to the farms is through groundwater wells approximately 20 of farms receive their water from 2 wells 60 own a single well each table 1 decoupling between water use and supply has been observed in some farms due to cooperative behaviour in water sharing thus 2 farms 9 and 10 equally share water from a single permit and well with the total capacity of the well of 140l s one of the farms 5 is operating entirely on water discharged from a neighbouring monoculture farm 4 farm 5 grows 3 different fish species in the re used water another farm 6 with wup of 38l s has 180l s total water intake for its operation while receiving the remaining water from the discharge from a nearby farm only 40 of the farms use aerators not shown for the rest aeration is achieved by passively flowing water through stepwise configurations resulting in faster water flow with low fish density rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss is the main and most popular fish species grown in ararat valley approximately 93 of surveyed farms reported rainbow trout being the main species table 1 produced monoculture is the most common practice for rainbow trout cultures fao 2005 2012a 2005 2012b out of 14 farms investigated 11 were monoculture operations all growing rainbow trout table 1 only 3 farms 20 operate in poly culture mode sturgeon acipenser baerii and carp cyprinus carpio are the secondary fish species for one farm each and a single farm grows all 3 fish species table 1 annual maximum production is 103t year interestingly in a farm that operates in monoculture mode minimum production is 1t year again for a monoculture operation table 1 3 3 water efficiency in medium and small sized aquaculture farms water efficiency in monoculture trout farms ranged from 42 05m3 kg 3 for trout to a maximum of 1261m3 kg 2 production with an average of 186m3 kg in traditional flow through farm water consumption for rainbow trout production is about 50m3 kg fish jokumsen and svendsen 2010 suggesting a gross underutilization of water resources even for extensive farming operations in every surveyed farm other than farm 3 poly culture production in ararat valley is mainly practised to secondarily utilize water from trout production and only 3 of 14 surveyed farms grew more than one fish species these farms will be individually addressed in these operations water is sequentially re used thus calculations for poly culture farms consider equal sharing of water between production types with sharing factors being included in the calculations farm 11 uses the discharge from a rainbow trout growth pond to rear sturgeon with the average density of 8 0kg m2 this results in an increased water resource efficiency for the farm as a result of re using water and yet even with consideration of re use production rates are very low for a given volume of used groundwater 26 7m3 kg of trout production and 16 0kg m2 for sturgeon farm 1 is the only farm that produces 3 fish species suggesting a much higher water efficiency in the current case 29 6m3 kg of trout production considering factor of 3 for poly culture farms higher than the typical densities for extensive raceway configurations is accompanied by 102 0kg m2 for sturgeon rearing fitting the 50 0 80 0kg m2 production if added oxygen is provided fao 2005 2012a 2005 2012b it is noteworthy that these densities are achieved without active aeration in the farm additionally carp is grown stocking densities 60 0kg m2 in the final use of water before discharging it into the receiving canal this farm is exemplary in its high water use efficiency even without additional improvements to its fish farming systems farm 5 also operating in a poly culture mode uses the trout discharge water for carp production with very low stocking densities of 4 6kg m2 considering factor of 2 water resource efficiency for trout as a result of water re use is 78 9m3 kg considering factor of 2 interestingly this farm operates on water discharged from trout farm 4 our current data demonstrates gross underutilization of precious pure potable groundwater resources in almost all small and medium sized fish farms in ararat valley our conclusions are further supported by several additional observations thus preliminary data from water quality analysis of farm effluent for wastewater compounds demonstrates that water is being discharged from fish farms virtually clean with only negligible concentrations of nitrogen phosphorus and solid wastes study in progress data not shown low pollutant concentrations are typical for raceway configurations where effluent wastewater is relatively clean due to dilution and is generally discharged into receiving stream with little or no wastewater treatment mirzoyan et al 2010 the extremely low concentration of pollutants in aquaculture wastewater in ararat valley fish farms suggests a potential for higher stocking densities or adversely lower water abstractions for the same volume of fish produced furthermore observed trends of farms using discharged water from neighbouring operations for sometimes more intensive poly culture production suggests gross underutilization of valuable water resources and a potential for more intensive water use practices in ararat valley 3 4 potential of semi intensive farming operations to reduce groundwater abstraction although groundwater is the most desirable water source for aquaculture worldwide summerfelt 2000 in international practice the extensive farms have slowly been replaced by more intensive configurations for fish production due to sustainability issues of groundwater use e g high abstraction volumes coupled with extremely low recharge rates of 10 100 000 years for individual aquifers gleeson et al 2012 intensive fish farming configurations namely semi ras and ras configurations are generally aimed at lower water use with simultaneous high fish production rates mirzoyan et al 2010 fish farms using recirculation technology reach lower water intake per kg fish produced as well as reduced environmental impact martins et al 2010 van rijn 1996 the main drawbacks in installation of these farms are the high costs of construction and intensive management monitoring activities martins et al 2010 therefore semi ras configurations have received greater attention and are more common where financial and technical constraints exist compared to ras configurations cost efficient salmonid recirculating systems have been developed in recent years summerfelt 2006 roque d orbcastel et al 2009 danish model semi closed systems one of the least expensive production systems for trout culturing combine low costs with high recirculation rates of 70 and 95 in model 1 and model 3 farms respectively jokumsen and svendsen 2010 in addition to fish rearing tanks all danish model semi closed systems include low cost and low energy utilisation aeration units e g airlift pump systems for water circulation and gas exchange jokumsen and svendsen 2010 and a solids removal system consisting of passive con settlers and sedimentation area and a complementary solids removal system mechanical drum or belt filtration all systems also include plant lagoons for nitrogen removal the high efficiency model 3 systems are equipped with low cost biofiltration units for ammonium transformation approximately 95 of water recirculation is typical in closed ras units of different types mirzoyan et al 2010 van rijn 1996 yet in the current study danish model farms will be considered because of their low capital costs and relative simplicity of operation the studies of efficiencies of relatively low cost model 3 farms for trout growth report a use of 7 7 of groundwater volumes compared to traditional trout farming jokumsen and svendsen 2010 if this configuration is used with the same annual production volumes reported in the current study water efficiency of small and medium sized aquaculture farms in ararat valley will increase 13 times this suggests a use of 13 times less water for fish production and will result in a decrease of small and medium sized fish farm water extraction to 748 5l s instead of the current 9730 2l s therefore by only transforming small and medium sized fish farms into danish model 3 trout farms the total groundwater abstraction by small and medium sized fisheries in ararat valley will compose only 4 5 of total fisheries abstraction fig 1 in the case of the much cheaper model 1 farms with 70 recirculation this number will increase but not significantly totalling 6 0 instead of the current share of 37 the water footprint of poly culture production is smaller because of water re use for secondary and even tertiary production for example sturgeon farming also demonstrates a potential for improvement if a simple aeration unit is installed in the farm sturgeon stocking densities can increased 40 60 times fao 2005 2012a 2005 2012b however intensification of rainbow trout production the first link in the production chain and subsequent re circulation can impact the potential of the secondary culture growth and therefore clear conclusions concerning groundwater abstraction improvements are not possible when extrapolating data on the effect of implementation of intensive farming operations for only trout farms as the primary fish production type to calculate general trends of groundwater use improvements in ararat valley the picture is as follows fig 1 with transformations of only small and medium sized aquaculture farms into semi ras model 1 and ras model 3 configurations the total groundwater extraction will drop by 13 6 and 14 0 respectively groundwater extraction for aquaculture sector will drop from the current 40 1 30 7 and 30 3 for model 1 and model 3 farms respectively this will result in the reduction of current aquaculture water use to an estimated 16 940 and 16 697l s for model 1 and model 3 farms respectively hence transformation of only small and medium sized fish farms to model 1 and model 3 type trout farms will single handedly shrink the aquaculture groundwater use to 525 7 and 534 2mm3 year although fish farming will still be the second largest groundwater user in the ararat valley after irrigation water extraction rates for fish farming will become closer to the value of 400 6mm3 year recorded in 2007 aspired 2016a 3 5 effect of economic factors on low efficiency water use in ararat valley although more environmentally friendly fish production systems are promoted in armenia economic issues might become the main constraint to implementation of these systems average fish production costs in ararat valley have been estimated to be approximately 1260 amd kg 2 6 usd kg for trout and amd 1650 kg 3 4 usd kg for sturgeon feed is the largest financial input in fish farming ranging from 79 0 to 84 0 for sturgeon and trout production costs respectively aspired 2016a although some small local fish feed production exists in armenia most of fish feed is currently imported to armenia from the usa the european union and chile the water resource fee has been estimated to represent approximately 1 7 of trout production costs and 2 6 of sturgeon production costs aspired 2016a currently fisheries in the ararat valley pay 0 5 amd m3 0 001 usd m3 for ground water used fish farmers make efforts to cut fish production costs and produce higher revenues specifically in the currently unstable and small fish market conditions installation of recirculation units besides higher installation costs will potentially increase electricity and operation costs making the currently low revenues even lower and hence threatening the viability of small and medium sized fish farms the increase of groundwater resource fees for fisheries to 0 65 amd m3 0 0013 usd m3 by 2020 as a result of a new tax code adopted by armenia aspired 2016a will still leave water as one of the least expensive assets for fish production in ararat valley fish farms the relatively lower costs of groundwater for fish production combined with significantly higher feed prices is and will stay the main driving force for lower water resource efficiency practiced by fish farmers 4 conclusions the current study demonstrates underutilization of pure potable groundwater resources in ararat valley fish farms implementation of more intensive low cost ras and semi ras configurations for trout farming and or incorporation of simple aeration units in sturgeon farms have a potential to result in significant improvements of groundwater footprints and water resource efficiencies in ararat valley fisheries an additional benefit will be the decrease of environmental deterioration as a result of

12368,due to high quality pure potable artesian groundwater is the main source of water supply for the fisheries in ararat valley armenia as a result of increased groundwater abstraction for fish farming the long term viability of groundwater aquifers as well as groundwater use by other sectors in the ararat valley is challenged in a response to observed deterioration of water availability in ararat valley starting in 2013 new policies and relatively strict regulations on water use were put in place and intensive fish production systems are being promoted the current study aims to analyse the water footprint of small and medium scale groundwater based aquaculture farms the largest and most sensitive to changes proportion of farming operations in ararat valley and to determine their role in groundwater sustainability in the region our results demonstrate that the promotion and successful implementation of more intensive low cost fish farming systems can address the gross underutilization of valuable groundwater resources and lead to a significant improvement of water resource efficiency in ararat valley fisheries an additional benefit will be a decrease in

to the technical complexity of these operations and large initial construction costs while these issues can be easily overcome by large aquaculture farms with high production volumes and revenues small and medium scale farms become the most sensitive operations to water shortage and economic and environmental constraints in the valley in the current study we are analysing water resource use and efficiency of small and medium scale groundwater based aquaculture farms in ararat valley and to determine the potential of implementing semi recirculation technology in groundwater sustainability

includes 3 villages in 2 provinces ararat and armavir of the ararat valley with a high density of groundwater based fish farms 2 2 sampling scheme and data collection fish farms surveyed were sampled from a general database provided by the ministry of agriculture of ra only farms with water abstraction of less than 250l s falling into the category of small 150l s and medium 150 250l s water users were considered within this dataset 14 farms were sampled and the on farm survey based on a semi structured interview was conducted each farm was visited and a questionnaire was completed with each farm owner operator the questionnaire structure was devised to obtain information on 1 operational modes such as farm structures equipment grown fish types and production volumes 2 economic inputs and outputs 3 groundwater use efficiency including water abstraction volumes water use permits wups and water discharge options in addition with the aid of each farmer contours of the aquaculture system units for each farm were identified on a colour print of an aerial photograph and fish growth unit volumes and water flow volumes were calculated whenever possible questionnaire parameters were expressed as numeric values otherwise they were expressed as categorical variables yes no or classes of value the heterogeneity among farms was analysed by using the concept of farming style defined by van der ploeg 1994 as a way in which one has to organise and manage a farm that is generally accepted by a more or less connected group of farmers two types of fish farming styles were identified monoculture farms producing a single fish species and poly culture farm producing more than one fish species either in serial or combined manner the farms were also categorised according to water use and flow types mirzoyan et al 2010 2 3 volumetric assessment of groundwater draft and efficiency in fish production general groundwater use in ararat valley and by the aquaculture sector in detail was calculated using data provided by aspired 2016a the share of small and medium sized farms in groundwater use was calculated as a portion of total use water resource efficiency was calculated as a proportion of abstracted groundwater used to produce fish at a rate of 1t year for poly culture operations where water is sequentially re used the calculations consider equal sharing of water between production types with the factor of sharing included a factor of 2 is used for efficiency calculations in poly culture farm growing 2 species and factor of 3 for 3 fish species to assess the potential

methylene blue adsorption equilibrium isotherm 1 introduction methylene blue considered as one of the most important heterocyclic organics that used in many different fields such as drugs and dyestuff industries colored compound can exist in different kind of pharmaceutical wastes with higher doses that could be considered to be more hazardous to public health due to its mutagenic and carcinogenic properties peydayesh and rahbar kelishami 2015 kassale et al 2015 wang et al 2015 shu et al 2014 natarajan et al 2014 abbad and lounis 2014 the colored organic wastes can be found in the effluents of different industries such as textile plastic dye dyestuffs leather cosmetics pharmaceuticals food paper making containing dyes and pigments at different steps in the dyeing and finishing processes vucurovic et al 2012 the thiazine cationic dye family such as methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl are commonly used for coloring industries for paper temporary hair colorants zhao and liu 2009 zheng et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 dyeing of cotton wood and silk the hazardous effect of mb lies in the fact that it can cause some kinds of harmful effects to humans for instance heart rate increase shock vomiting jaundice cyanosis quadriplegia and tissue necrosis zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2015b zhu et al 2015 variety of removal techniques were applied for the removal of colored compound from polluted water such as adsorption peydayesh and rahbar kelishami 2015 kassale et al 2015 wang et al 2015 shu et al 2014 natarajan et al 2014 banerjee et al 2014 mahmoudi et al 2015 using membrane

have been reported to be effective for dye treatment such as activated carbon mahmoudi et al 2015 cherifi et al 2013 alothman et al 2014 reddy et al 2015 ma et al 2015 chitosan auta and hameed 2014 fly ash ma et al 2015 clays yang et al 2015a magnesium aluminate zhou et al 2015b etc recently depending on the total cost removal efficiency for large scale consumption source abundance and engineering convenience researcher attentions have been paid to low coast adsorbents including natural and synthetic ones such chen et al 2015 yang et al 2015b zhang et al 2015 the use of ion exchanger is very common for the removal of inorganic waste however the use of polymers for the removal of organic wastes is not common polymeric materials contain various functional groups which can provide active sites for dye binding furthermore the existence of styrene divinyl benzene matrix facilitate the binding of some dyes through the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with aromatic rings in most cases researchers based their works on the removal of organic compounds using advanced oxidation processes for the complete mineralization of the organic compound however recycling and ruse of organic pollutants is not common due to the processes are so complicated and needs more efforts to find the suitable adsorbent that could achieve it is mission in this study the use of sst60 strong acid cation exchanger beads as an adsorbent was tested for adsorption and preconcentration of mb from aqueous solution the effects of contact time ph initial mb concentration and temperature on the adsorption were investigated kinetics isotherm studies and thermodynamic parameters calculations related to the process were also performed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals methylene blue mb with the molecular formula c16h18n3scl and 98 purity safranin c20h19cln4 rosaniline hcl c20h19n3 methanol naoh and hydrochloric acid were purchased from merck and were used as received without further purification purolite sst60 with characteristics depicted in table 1 was purchased from the purolite company usa 2 2 adsorption experiments 1000mg l of mb stock solution was prepared by dissolving the equivalent amount of dye in di water which was then diluted to a variety of concentrations of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300mg l 2 2 1 batch adsorption experiments the investigation of mb adsorption using batch scale were carried out to understand the effect of varying the different experimental condition such as initial dye concentration contact time ph and temperature on the adsorption of mb on sst60 cation during the experiments 0 1g of sst60 was added to 200ml of mb dye solution and the ph was adjusted by using 0 1m naoh or 0 1m hcl the resulting reaction mixture was kept under constant stirring at 500rpm the dye concentration in reaction mixture was determined at characteristic wavelength of 664nm by double beam uv visible spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambda 2 then the amounts of mb adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent qe were calculated from the differences between the initial and final mb concentrations in solution by the following equation 1 q e c o c e v m where v is the volume of mb solution in l c o and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations in mg l respectively and m is the mass of adsorbent in gram 2 3 adsorption kinetics in order to determine the adsorption kinetics of mb the fit of the obtained experimental data was treated with pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models the pseudo first order rate model is defined as the following equation yang et al 2015a 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k min 1 is the lagergren rate constant of pseudo first order qt mg g and qe mg g are the amounts of mb adsorbed at time t min and at equilibrium the values of k and qe were determined from the intercept and the slope of the plot of log qe qt versus t the pseudo second order rate model is as follows yang et al 2015a 3 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo second order the plot of t qt values vs t gives straight line relation with slope equal to qe and intercept equal to 1 k2qe 2 the obtained value of k2 is used to calculate the initial adsorption rate constant h mgg 1 min 1 at t 0 as follows 14 4 h k 2 q e 2 the existing mb molecules could be moved from the bulk of solution into the outer and inner solid phase of the polymeric material through an intraparticle diffusion the possibility of intraparticle diffusion which is considered in most similar cases as the rate limiting step of adsorption processes was explored by using the intraparticle diffusion model chen et al 2015 5 q t k id t 0 5 c i from the graphical representation of the obtained results for qt vs t0 5 the values of constant c and kid mol g min0 5 can be determined from the intercept and slope respectively 2 4 adsorption isotherms the determination of different adsorption parameters was carried out by using langmuir freundlich and tempkin isotherm models some of the used isotherm are assuming the formation of monolayer of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent such as langmuir model the linear transformation of the equation can be expressed as follows alothman et al 2014 6 c e q e 1 q max k l c e q max where qe and qmax are dye equilibrium and maximum amount of mb onto the sorbent mg g respectively ce is dye concentration at equilibrium in solution mg l kl is langmuir constant l mg related to the affinity of binding sites and the free energy of sorption when ce qe is plotted vs ce a straight line relation was obtained with slope and intercept equal to 1 qmax and 1 qmax kl respectively the empirical freundlich equation for adsorption on a heterogeneous surface is commonly represented by zhu et al 2015 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf and n are the freundlich constants than can be determined from the intercept and slope of the plot of ln qe versus ln ce to evaluate the possible mutual interaction among the different species and the enthalpy of the adsorption tempkin isotherm model can be used the tempkin isotherm equation in linear form is shown as banerjee et al 2014 8 q e rt b t ln a t rt b t ln c e where r is gas universal constant 8 314jmol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature in kelvin bt jmol 1 is the tempkin constant related to enthalpy of adsorption and at lg 1 is equilibrium binding constant the tempkin constants bt and at are calculated from the slope and intercept of qe versus ln ce 2 5 adsorption thermodynamic the different thermodynamic parameters such as change in standard free energy δ g o enthalpy δ h o and entropy δ s o evaluated for mb adsorption onto sst 60 can be done using the following equations yang et al 2015b 9 k d q e c e 10 δ g o rt ln k d 11 ln k d δ s o rt δ h o rt the values of δ h o and δ s o were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln kd versus 1 t however standard gibbs free energy change of sorption δ g o was evaluated using eq 10 2 6 column run fixed bed column runs for mb removal from synthetic but representative feed solutions were carried out using 11mm diameter glass columns constant flow pumps and fraction collectors the empty bed contact time ebct and superficial liquid phase velocity slv were recorded for each experimental column run the water chemistry for all of the synthetic feed water was as follows mb 100mg l ph 8 5 other cationic dyes 100mg l the exhausted sst60 was regenerated using a mixed solution of 50 50 2m hcl and 78 ch3oh after regeneration the bed was rinsed with na2co3 to remove excess hcl and bring back the hybrid sorbent to working conditions for the next cycle of mb removal experimental setup for mb sorption was demonstrated in fig 1 column fraction collector 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial concentration and contact time on mb adsorption several parameters can affect the amount of adsorbed mb dye such as contact time the effect of the contact time on the adsorption process is shown in fig 2 the data obtained revealed that the equilibrium was attained in a time range between 30 50min depending on the concentration of mb used the data also indicate that more than 50 was adsorbed within the displayed time range furthermore the rate of adsorption process extremely fast during the initial period of adsorption due to the easier access to the vacant adsorption sites and then diminishes with time till attaining equilibrium which attributed to the consumption of adsorption sites offered by the polymeric sst60 material and the formation of monolayer on the other hand the change of mb concentration indicates that the adsorbed amount of mb at equilibrium increase with the increase of initial concentration due to the fact that as the initial concentration increase the mass transfer increases leading to higher adsorption obtained at equilibrium 3 2 effect of temperature on mb adsorption since the rate of adsorption might be depend on the speed of mb particle diffusion and however the raise of temperature causes the increase of ionic mobility for this reason the increase of temperature strongly affects the rate and amount of adsorbed species in most adsorption reactions the data obtained for the effect of temperature fig 3 on the rate and amount of adsorbed mb indicate that the elevation of adsorption temperature 288 308k markedly increase the adsorption it is clear that the adsorption capacity increase from 113 to 262mg g with the increase in temperature from 288 to 308k which might indicate the endothermic nature of the adsorption process of mb onto sst 60 3 3 effect of solution ph on mb adsorption the effect of ph on the adsorption process using ion exchangers strongly affect the whole process since ph control the surface charge of both adsorbent and adsorbate the data obtained for the effect of ph on the adsorption of mb on sst60 is shown in fig 4 as illustrated in the figure varying the ph of solution strongly affects the amount of mb adsorbed the mb uptake was found to be very low 12 24mg l at lower ph 3 5 5 5 due to the fact that in acidic medium mb molecules interact with the hydrogen ions exist in solution giving rise to the formation of positively charged mb bulk species that could not compete with the hydrogen ions which is favorably adsorbed rather than mb upon raising up the ph the amount of mb adsorbed increase gradually to reach maximum at ph range 8 9 which attributed to the fact that at this ph range 8 9 the surface of mb is uncharged and hence can easily interact with the functional groups of the polymeric materials and replace the existing positive ions h or na and the selectivity will be switched toward mb with further increase of ph to 10 the amount of mb adsorbed diminishes but still high if compared with the one in acidic medium the explanation of this point may be due to mb can adsorbed under two different forces i electrostatic interaction with functional groups of the cation exchanger depends on the ph ii hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between aromatic rings of mb and polymeric matrix independent on ph 3 4 adsorption kinetics in order to understand the adsorption kinetics it is necessary to evaluate the kinetic mechanism of the adsorption process for this reason the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to fit the experimental data with respect to the pseudo first order model as described in fig 5 in which logarithmic values of log qe qt were plotted against time the values of k1 and qe were determined from the intercept and the slope respectively and tabulated in table 2 fig 6 on the other hand the kinetic parameters k2 and qe of the pseudo second order kinetics were calculated from the intercept and the slope of the plot of t qt versus t the intraparticle model constants were determined from the intercept and the slope of the plot of qt versus t fig 7 fig 7 represents the plot of qt vs t1 2 at different initial mb concentration it is clear that the obtained relation is of multi linear behavior reflecting that the adsorption process could be controlled by more than one process based on these plots the sorption processes of mb are implicated by two different phases beholding that the rate limiting step is not governed by intraparticle diffusion however the initial period of the plot indicated an external mass transfer whereas the second linear portion is due to intraparticle or pore diffusion 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data recorded for the different doses of mb fig 8 illustrate the linearized experimental data at different temperature for mb adsorption fitted with langmuir model the data obtained indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity at 308k was found to be 262mg mb g sst60 as presented in table 1 compared to the other temperatures the calculated value of qmax is extremely high indicating the mutual affinity between mb and the used polymeric materials on the other hands the different adsorption parameters obtained at different temperature by fitting the collected data with freundlich and tempkin isotherm models were represented graphically in figs 9 and 10 and the calculated parameters were tabulated in table 3 it is clear that the highest value of r2 was obtained from langmuir isotherm equation indicating that the adsorption was favorably fitted with langmuir rather than the other isotherms furthermore the calculated rl values are all greater than zero and less than unity indicating that the adsorption of mb is favorable at this working experimental conditions 3 6 adsorption thermodynamic the investigation of adsorption thermodynamics of organic compounds gave an idea about the adsorption behavior and how to predict the mechanism as illustrated in fig 11 the values of δ h o and δ s o were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln kd versus 1 t standard gibbs free energy change of sorption δ g o was evaluated using eq 10 the calculated thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 4 as observed from table 4 the calculated values of gibbs free energy change δ g o are negative however the values of δ h o are positive indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic respectively further the positive value of entropy change δ s o reflects randomness nature of process at the solid solution interface and the affinity of sst60 for mb adsorption 3 7 fixed bed column run fixed bed column run experiments were carried out to imitative service cycle conditions and to evaluate the removal capacity of mb on sst60 fig 12 provides mb effluent histories for three separate column runs under the same experimental conditions using sst60 cation exchanger the column run results indicate that the capacity of polymeric materials lasts for more than 11 000 bed volume before the break through of mb during the column run the existing mb species replace the h attached to the functional groups of the polymeric materials till complete exhaustion furthermore after consumption of all functional groups so3 the mb will diffuse into the polymeric material and adsorbed through the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with the polymeric matrix that could give the adsorbent extra capacity to last for many bed volumes 3 7 1 effect of other cationic dyes on the adsorption of mb to investigate the selectivity of sst60 for the adsorption of mb two different cationic dyes have been added to the influent safranin and rosaniline hcl the data collected for the column run effluent histories was illustrated in fig 13 the data obtained indicate that the used cation dyes have no competing effect on the removal of mb furthermore the cationic dyes indicate earlier breakthrough as soon as the column run was started this finding might indicate the strong mutual affinity among sst60 and mb 3 8 regeneration and reuse of sst60 after fixed bed column operation and complete exhaustion of sst60 the exhausted cation several trials have been carried out to determine the suitable solution for the process of complete regeneration of mb upon using of different concentration of hcl and c2h5oh we found that the amount of regenerated mb did not exceed 30 and 70 for hcl and c2h5oh respectively of the total adsorbed amount of mb this finding might indicate that the use of hcl can only regenerate the mb adsorbed on the active sites of polymeric materials due to donnan membrane effect however the addition of ethanol facilitates the leaching of mb attached to the matrix of sst60 finally the exchanger was regenerated using a 50 2m hcl 50 methanol solution at lower ph 0 5 the regenerant effluent from two successive mb sorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 14 in less than 100bvs approximately 100 of mb was desorbed from the sst60 upon complete recovery of exhausted sst60 we can say that the polymeric material can be effectively reused for multiple cycles of sorption desorption during regeneration there was no physical or chemical degradation of the spherical sst60 beads 3 9 proposed mechanism based on the data obtained from the regeneration process it is clear that the using of hcl only for the regeneration can displace the positively charged mb attached to the polymeric material functional groups however the using of ethanol only can leach the mb particles that attached to the hydrophobic parts of the polymeric materials furthermore the regeneration with a mixture of hcl and ethanol can cause the complete regeneration of mb and recovery of the polymeric materials fig 15 is representing a simplified proposed mechanism scheme for the process of adsorption and regeneration 4 conclusion the present study shows that sst60 could be an effective adsorbent for removing mb cationic dyes from aqueous solution the data obtained indicate the dependence of the process on initial ph and temperature of polluted water the equilibrium data were fitted using the langmuir freundlich tempkin isotherms and the former model provided a better mathematical fit the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity obtained was 262mg mb g sst60 at 308k the adsorption process was feasible endothermic and spontaneous with lower negative free energy δg values the estimated enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs for the adsorption process were 25 88kjmol 1 and 90 62jmol 1 k 1 the low value of δg suggests a physical adsorption process while the positive value of δs reflects the affinity of sst60 for mb and increased randomness at the solid solution interface during adsorption the exhausted polymeric materials were efficiently regenerated using 50 50 mixture of 2m hcl 75 methanol mixture solutions

offered by the polymeric sst60 material and the formation of monolayer on the other hand the change of mb concentration indicates that the adsorbed amount of mb at equilibrium increase with the

sst60 is shown in fig 4 as illustrated in the figure varying the ph of solution strongly affects the amount of mb adsorbed the mb uptake was found to be very low 12 24mg l at lower ph 3 5 5 5 due to the fact that in acidic medium mb molecules interact with the hydrogen ions exist in solution giving rise to the formation of positively charged mb bulk species that could not compete with the hydrogen ions which is favorably adsorbed rather than mb upon raising up the ph the amount of mb adsorbed increase gradually to reach maximum at ph range 8 9 which attributed to the fact that at this ph range 8 9 the surface of mb is uncharged and hence can easily interact with the functional groups of the polymeric materials and replace the existing positive ions h or na and the selectivity will be switched toward mb with further increase of ph to 10 the amount of mb adsorbed diminishes but still high if compared with the one in acidic medium the explanation of this point may be due to mb can adsorbed under two different forces i electrostatic interaction with functional groups of the cation exchanger depends on the ph ii hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between aromatic rings of mb and polymeric matrix independent on ph 3 4 adsorption kinetics in order to understand the adsorption kinetics it is necessary to evaluate the kinetic mechanism of the adsorption process for this reason the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to fit the experimental data with respect to the pseudo first order model as described in fig 5 in which logarithmic values of log qe qt were plotted against time the values of k1 and qe were determined from the intercept and the slope respectively and tabulated in table 2 fig 6 on the other hand the kinetic parameters k2 and qe of the pseudo second order kinetics were calculated from the intercept and the slope of the plot of t qt versus t the intraparticle model constants were determined from the intercept and the slope of the plot of qt versus t fig 7 fig 7 represents the plot of qt vs t1 2 at different initial mb concentration it is clear that the obtained relation is of multi linear behavior reflecting that the adsorption process could be controlled by more than one process based on these plots the sorption processes of mb are implicated by two different phases beholding that the rate limiting step is not governed by intraparticle diffusion however the initial period of the plot indicated an external mass transfer whereas the second linear portion is due to intraparticle or pore diffusion 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data recorded for the different doses of mb fig 8 illustrate the linearized experimental data at different temperature for mb adsorption fitted with langmuir model the data obtained indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity at 308k was found to be 262mg mb g sst60 as presented in table 1 compared to the other temperatures the calculated value of qmax is extremely high indicating the mutual affinity between mb and the used polymeric materials on the other hands the different adsorption parameters obtained at different temperature by fitting the collected data with freundlich and tempkin isotherm models were represented graphically in figs 9 and 10 and the calculated parameters were tabulated in table 3 it is clear that the highest value of r2 was obtained from langmuir isotherm equation indicating that the adsorption was favorably fitted with langmuir rather than the other isotherms furthermore the calculated rl values are all greater than zero and less than unity indicating that the adsorption of mb is favorable at this working experimental conditions 3 6 adsorption thermodynamic the investigation of adsorption thermodynamics of organic compounds gave an idea about the adsorption behavior and how to predict the mechanism as illustrated in fig 11 the values of δ h o and δ s o were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln kd versus 1 t standard gibbs free energy change of sorption δ g o was evaluated using eq 10 the calculated thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 4 as observed from table 4 the calculated values of gibbs free energy change δ g o are negative however the values of δ h o are positive indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic respectively further the positive value of entropy change δ s o reflects randomness nature of process at the solid solution interface and the affinity of sst60 for mb adsorption 3 7 fixed bed column run fixed bed column run experiments were carried out to imitative service cycle conditions and to evaluate the removal capacity of mb on sst60 fig 12 provides mb effluent histories for three separate column runs under the same experimental conditions using sst60 cation exchanger the column run results indicate that the capacity of polymeric materials lasts for more than 11 000 bed volume before the break through of mb during the column run the existing mb species replace the h attached to the functional groups of the polymeric materials till complete exhaustion furthermore after consumption of all functional groups so3 the mb will diffuse into the polymeric material and adsorbed through the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with the polymeric matrix that could give the adsorbent extra capacity to last for many bed volumes 3 7 1 effect of other cationic dyes on the adsorption of mb to investigate the selectivity of sst60 for the adsorption of mb two different cationic dyes have been added to the influent safranin and rosaniline hcl the data collected for the column run effluent histories was illustrated in fig 13 the data obtained indicate that the used cation dyes have no competing effect on the removal of mb furthermore the cationic dyes indicate earlier breakthrough as soon as the column run was started this finding might indicate the strong mutual affinity among sst60 and mb 3 8 regeneration and reuse of sst60 after fixed bed column operation and complete exhaustion of sst60 the exhausted cation several trials have been carried out to determine the suitable solution for the process of complete regeneration of mb upon using of different concentration of hcl and c2h5oh we found that the amount of regenerated mb did not exceed 30 and 70 for hcl and c2h5oh respectively of the total adsorbed amount of mb this finding might indicate that the use of hcl can only regenerate the mb adsorbed on the active sites of polymeric materials due to donnan membrane effect however the addition of ethanol facilitates the leaching of mb attached to the matrix of sst60 finally the exchanger was regenerated using a 50 2m hcl 50 methanol solution at lower ph 0 5 the regenerant effluent from two successive mb sorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 14 in less than 100bvs approximately 100 of mb was desorbed from the sst60 upon complete recovery of exhausted sst60 we can say that the polymeric material can be effectively reused for multiple cycles of sorption desorption during regeneration there was no physical or chemical degradation of the spherical sst60 beads 3 9 proposed mechanism based on the data obtained from the regeneration process it is clear that the using of hcl only for the regeneration can displace the positively charged mb attached to the polymeric material functional groups however the using of ethanol only can leach the mb particles that attached to the hydrophobic parts of the polymeric materials furthermore the regeneration with a mixture of hcl and ethanol can cause the complete regeneration of mb and recovery of the polymeric materials fig 15 is representing a simplified proposed mechanism scheme for the process of adsorption and regeneration 4 conclusion the present study shows that sst60 could be an effective adsorbent for removing mb cationic dyes from aqueous solution the data obtained indicate the dependence of the process on initial ph and temperature of polluted water the equilibrium data were fitted using the langmuir freundlich tempkin isotherms and the former model provided a better mathematical fit the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity obtained was 262mg mb g sst60 at 308k the adsorption process was feasible endothermic and spontaneous with lower negative free energy δg values the estimated enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs for the adsorption process were 25 88kjmol 1 and 90 62jmol 1 k 1 the low value of δg suggests a physical adsorption process while the positive value of δs reflects the affinity of sst60 for mb and increased randomness at the solid solution interface during adsorption the exhausted polymeric materials were efficiently regenerated using 50 50 mixture of 2m hcl 75 methanol mixture solutions
