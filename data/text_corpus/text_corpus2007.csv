10035,growing water scarcity and increasing nitrogen n fertiliser prices in south africa require more prudent n fertiliser and irrigation water use approaches if the goal of sustainable agricultural intensification is to be realised it is vital to develop location specific agricultural land management strategies that promote increased crop productivity while minimising negative environmental impacts in this study a calibrated and validated environmental policy integrated climate epic model was used to simulate a range of n fertiliser and irrigation water levels on maize zea mays l yield in the eastern cape of south africa results showed that a fertiliser and irrigation water management schedule combining approximately 200 kg n ha 1 and 580 mm irrigation water per maize growing season provided the highest average maize yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 an increase of 69 above farmers current maize yield levels nitrogen fertiliser application levels greater than 160 kg n ha 1 resulted in potential n fertiliser leaching losses of more than 35 kg n ha 1 the epic model can be considered a valuable tool to aid decision makers in identifying optimal site specific irrigation water and n fertiliser application levels that contribute to increased maize crop productivity while maximising water use keywords fertiliser management crop model food security sustainable intensification 1 introduction several factors such as crop pests and diseases influence crop yields however water and nitrogen n availability continue to be two of the most critical factors influencing crop production mueller et al 2012 the influence of water and n availability on crop yields is particularly significant in the eastern cape where water is scarce and most soils lacking in adequate plant nutrients goldblatt 2011 previous research has shown that one of the major reasons for persistent low yields in south african farming systems is soil mineral nutrient depletion e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p folberth et al 2012 the continuous removal of crop residues from cultivated areas and inadequate soil nutrient replacement have led to soil nutrient reduction in many parts of south africa van der velde et al 2014a 2014b low yields are especially true for maize fields in many parts of south africa where n is the most limiting nutrient pasley et al 2019 sipaseuth et al 2007 ten berge et al 2019 similarly low water availability has also been identified as a significant yield limiting factor in most semiarid regions like south africa hammad et al 2018 yin et al 2014 given the limited availability of water in most south african farming systems the anticipated increase in crop demand due to increasing population will have to be met with less water and more efficient irrigation systems fao 2017 in addition increasing n fertiliser prices in south africa daff 2019 will require even more efficient approaches to n fertiliser management by farmers in this study efficient irrigation water and n fertiliser management means applying irrigation water and n fertiliser at the right time in the right quantities at the right placement and from the right source to maximise yields and reduce environmental impact the efficient management of irrigation water and n fertiliser at the farm scale has been shown to significantly increase crop yields while minimising environmental degradation folberth et al 2013 van der velde et al 2014a 2014b in irrigated cropping systems irrigation water application closely interacts with the efficient use of n fertiliser with the relationship being described as co limitation co limitation means that the crop s response to n fertiliser and irrigation water is greater than the crop s response to each factor in isolation sadras 2004 however many farmers in the eastern cape do not practice this efficient application of irrigation water and fertiliser due to factors such as limited financial resources and a lack of locally developed irrigation water and n fertiliser application recommendations choruma and odume 2019 to develop local n fertiliser and irrigation water management recommendations that increase crop yields while minimising environmental degradation field experiments have been used to test the effects of different irrigation water and n fertiliser management plans on crop yields and the environment field experiments have the advantage that they can be implemented on many field sites with better representations of soils which is a vital component of crop growth however field experiments are often labour intensive and costly to carry out on a regular and long term basis when compared to crop growth simulation models santhi et al 2005 zhao et al 2016 when properly calibrated and validated crop growth models offer a reliable fast and more affordable method of examining the outcomes of different n fertiliser and irrigation water scenarios on crop yields and the environment for example crop models have been used to determine irrigation requirements at the field level alexandrov and hoogenboom 1999 guerra et al 2005 and optimise the allocation of fertiliser and water among crops during the growing season bryant et al 1992 cabelguenne et al 1999 crop models can therefore be applied with reasonable accuracy to simultaneously assess the effects of irrigation water and n fertiliser combinations on crop yields in south africa most irrigation water and n fertiliser recommendations are still based on field experiments arc 2017 fao et al 2005 due to a general lack of data for model calibration while interest has grown in crop simulation modelling most modelling studies in south africa have investigated irrigation water and n fertiliser management separately for example kgonyane 2010 used the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model to simulate maize response to low inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus for dry regions fessehazion et al 2014 used the soil and water balance swb model to generate irrigation water application calendars yet irrigation and fertiliser management are closely linked there is therefore a need to develop location specific irrigation water and n fertiliser management strategies to simultaneously optimise irrigation water and n fertiliser use at the farm scale therefore the objectives of this study were to a simulate the effects of different irrigation water and n fertiliser levels on maize yield using the environmental policy integrated climate model epic and b identify optimal n fertiliser and irrigation water management strategies for increased maize yields and minimum n leaching risk the epic model was chosen because of its robust crop growth and fertiliser management modules williams et al 1984 and also because it has been calibrated for the study site in a previous study choruma et al 2019 by the authors potential n leaching risk was chosen because ground water pollution poses a significant threat to water quality in the eastern cape however ground water pollution due to agriculture has received less attention from researchers compared to surface water pollution hay et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the reader should note that the present study is a follow up study to two previous studies conducted in the study area by the authors the first study documented in choruma et al 2019 describes a calibration and validation procedure for the epic model conducted in the study area using limited data from field trials on maize the second study describes a survey of farmers agricultural land management practices including maize yields choruma and odume 2019 the results from the farmers survey concerning farmer s maize yields are used in this present study to compare farmers maize yields with epic model simulated yields therefore the present study is an application of the calibrated and validated epic model in the same study area by combining a crop model with a farmers survey the study provides novel insights into agricultural water management by integrating farmers views into the modelling process 2 2 study area the cradock research farm is in the great fish river valley catchment in the eastern cape of south africa fig 1 where extensive irrigation and commercial farming are practised the climate and soil characteristics of the cradock farm are typical of the wider great fish river valley catchment the soil is categorised as a fine loamy mollic ustifluvent soil survey staff 2014 with high amounts of sand and silt of alluvial and colluvial material developed from beaufort sediments a description of the soil characteristics is given in table 1 rainfall in the region averages 341 mm with most of the rain being experienced in february and march 2 3 epic model description the epic model version 0810 is designed to simulate field scale crop yield and can simulate over 70 crops using unique parameter values for each crop williams et al 2015 in the crop growth routine crop yield is estimated as a function of the harvest index hi and is affected by factors such as biomass to energy ratio wa planting density pd photosynthetic active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd xiong et al 2016 potential biomass is adjusted to actual biomass through daily stress caused by extreme temperature water and nutrient stress or inappropriate aeration values of site specific parameters such as potential heat units accumulated phu harvest index hi and optimum temperature ot have to be modified according to the context which the model is to be applied balkovič et al 2013 2 3 1 field experiment data for model calibration and validation were obtained from field trials on maize carried out at the cradock research farm the trials were carried out on behalf of the agricultural research council arc by the cradock research manager from 1999 to 2003 to evaluate the potential yield of different maize hybrid varieties in the eastern cape two varieties crn 3760 and phb 30h22 with complete records for grain yield and management for the period 1999 2003 were selected for the modelling study the two maize varieties chosen were grown on individual fields with similar soils at the cradock research farm but managed using the same agricultural management plan a randomised block design rbd clewer and scarisbrick 2001 with three replications was used throughout the planting rate was at 50 000 plants per hectare with a row spacing of 0 9 m agricultural management practices such as planting and harvest dates irrigation and fertiliser application dates were carried out according to a management plan developed by the arc the management plan developed by the arc was designed to reflect common agricultural practices carried out by local farmers in the cradock area table 2 flood irrigation was used with the crop getting 600 mm per growing season while nitrogen fertiliser was applied at a rate of 195 kg n ha 1 season 1 table 2 shows the representative irrigation and fertiliser amounts used during the field trials from 1999 to 2003 the same agricultural management practices were carried out around the same time each year only a few adjustments to the standard plan were made to accommodate prevailing weather conditions 2 4 model inputs weather files for the cradock farm including daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity for the years 1980 2010 were obtained from the agmerra ruane et al 2015 climate dataset at 0 5 0 5 arc degree spatial resolution values of soil parameters bulk density cation exchange capacity texture and electrical conductivity were acquired from records of soil analyses that had been previously conducted at the cradock farm values for soil albedo organic carbon concentration were missing from soil records and were taken from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 the missing soil parameters in the epic soil file were replaced with values from the hwsd based on expert opinion mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm fertiliser application irrigation amounts and planting and harvesting dates during the trial period were obtained from the cradock research farm manager s records mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm 2 5 model set up 2 5 1 modelling framework the modelling framework developed at iiasa epic iiasa balkovič et al 2013 was used to simulate the effects of various levels of n fertiliser and irrigation water on maize yield input files were converted to simulation grids at a resolution of 5 5 arc min geographic information systems gis layers on soil topography and weather were combined to set up the modelling scheme balkovič et al 2013 xiong et al 2013 the model was constructed for the entire eastern cape and assigned into homogenous response units based on physical properties given by the intersection of site properties such as elevation and soil texture next a zone raster made up of homogenous simulation units and weather grids upon which the model was run was created balkovič et al 2014 the simulation grid in which cradock research farm was located was selected for the simulations a single soil profile adjusted for soil properties found in the study area was used for all simulations see table 2 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the priestly taylor method because it gave pet values close to reported values for pet in the region compared to other methods of estimating pet schulze and maharaj 2007 weather records were available for 31 years and the model was run for 31 years from 1999 to 2003 the first 19 years of the weather record served as a warm up period for equilibrating model soil and water erosion functions irrigation and fertiliser application were done using the manual setting and scheduled according to dates used in the field trials 2 5 2 model calibration grain yield data from two separate fields on the cradock research farm were used for calibration and validation choruma et al 2019 both fields were managed using the same management plan comprehensive data for model calibration and validation such as biomass accumulation and nutrient leaching were not available as the trials were designed to evaluate cultivar stability and potential yield only grain yield and agricultural management dates were available grain yield was therefore used for model calibration and validation for calibration minor changes were made to the default parameters to adjust for site conditions and local crop varieties previous researches conducted by causarano et al 2010 folberth 2013 wang et al 2005 in semiarid areas showed that simulated crop yields were most sensitive to i potential heat units phu ii planting density pd iii the biomass to energy ratio wa defined as the potential growth per unit of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation iv harvest index hi or ratio of economic yield to above ground biomass and v microbial decay rate these parameters were subsequently chosen for calibration therefore the choice of parameters to calibrate was based on the literature following rinaldi et al 2011 the limited data available for model calibration and validation and recommendations from the epic model developers based at the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa the calibration procedure detailed in choruma et al 2019 was done according to the following steps adapted from i simulation with default parameters ii parameter adjustment microbial decay rate coefficient slow humus transformation rate tillage effect on residue decay rate exponential coefficient in potential and water use root growth distribution iii potential heat unit phu adjustment iv harvest index adjustment and v biomass to energy ratio wa adjustment model validation focused on grain yield data from the second field collected over the five year period from 1999 to 2003 2 5 3 model evaluation four indicators were calculated to evaluate model efficiency root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias as specified in choruma et al 2019 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 2 2 r 2 o i o mean s i s mean 2 o i o mean 2 s i s mean 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o mean 4 pbias i 1 n 100 o i s i i 1 n o i in the formulas n is the sample number o mean the observed mean value and s mean the simulated mean value oi and si are the observed and predicted values of the ith observation i 1 to n respectively considering the rmse values nearer to zero indicate a good fit between observed and simulated yields bao et al 2016 a value of zero for rmse indicates that the model predicts the observations with perfect accuracy the coefficient of determination r2 takes values between 0 and 1 with higher values signifying less error variance moriasi et al 2007 nse varies from negative infinity to 1 an nse value of 1 represents perfect model fit while negative nse values imply that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value moriasi et al 2007 pbias has an optimal value of 0 and measures the tendency of simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data positive values of pbias indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation gupta et al 1999 to evaluate differences between simulated and observed mean values the student s t test was used model performance was considered satisfactory if r 2 0 6 pbias 25 and nse 0 4 following wang et al 2012 2 6 model application 2 6 1 survey of farmers agricultural land management practices before the application of the epic model a survey of farmers agricultural management practices and values of ecosystem services was conducted in the study area using a questionnaire the survey study presented in choruma and odume 2019 was used to determine local farmers current agricultural land management practices irrigation fertiliser and maize yields farmers reported maize yields were then compared in this study with simulated yields obtained using combinations of irrigation water and n fertiliser levels the objective of comparing farmers yields and simulated yields was to determine whether farmers maize yields could be improved by optimising irrigation water and n fertiliser management simultaneously in this study only crop yields n fertiliser management and irrigation water management practices concerning maize production are presented a brief description of the survey study is given below overall 48 maize farmers took part in the survey of farmers agricultural management practices conducted between january and april 2019 purposive sampling was used to identify farmers in the study area who used inputs such as fertiliser and irrigation regularly an online version of the survey questionnaire was developed and the link attached to a request letter which was shared via email with the identified farmers in addition the survey was shared on the online social networking platform of the eastern cape farmers group the survey questionnaire covered the following topics 1 farmers agricultural management practices 2 the values farmers assigned to different agroecosystem services and 3 demographic information data were analysed using thematic analysis a detailed description of the survey method and framework is given in choruma and odume 2019 2 6 2 selection of nitrogen as the yield limiting factor concerning the choice of n fertiliser as the limiting nutrient to maize growth consultations held with the cradock farm manager revealed that the major factors limiting maize yields in the cradock area and surrounding commercial maize farming areas were n nutrient availability and water availability mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm an assessment of the mineralogy and soil fertility status of soils in the eastern cape by mandiringana et al 2007 found that the majority of soils from the commercial farming areas had medium to high levels of phosphorus while most of the rural areas in the eastern cape had low soil fertility naturally the commercial farming areas had higher soil fertility than soils in the rural areas mandiringana et al 2007 generally in the eastern cape nutrient supply is low in subsistence farmers crop fields due to poor soil management practices and limited fertiliser inputs levels of management and inputs are much higher in commercial farms leading to their increased productivity the present study focused on irrigation water and n nutrient availability as limiting factors to maize production in the eastern cape phosphorus deficiency was not considered in the present study because it was considered not a limiting factor 2 6 3 yield comparisons to develop optimal irrigation and n fertiliser recommendations simulated yields derived from combinations of n fertiliser and irrigation water levels were compared to yields obtained using the field trials n fertiliser and irrigation water levels simulated yields were also compared to yields reported by farmers from the survey of agricultural management practices conducted in a prior study farmers reported yields n fertiliser levels and irrigation water levels were not simulated in this study due to a lack of accurate data on farmers actual agricultural management practices dates planting harvesting and fertiliser application dates farmers reported maize yields and maize agricultural management practices were used only for comparison with simulated model outputs the agricultural management data used in the field trials were taken as the baseline scenario because they had complete information on the agricultural management practices dates e g irrigation fertiliser planting and harvesting that are required as model inputs in the baseline scenario field trials nitrogen n containing fertiliser was applied at a rate of 195 kg n ha 1 and phosphorus p containing fertiliser applied at a rate of 95 kg p ha 1 n fertiliser was applied three times during the growing season and p fertiliser applied once at planting irrigation water was applied at a depth of 75 mm per irrigation event using flood irrigation eight times during the growing season to give a total of 600 mm irrigation water per maize growing season in epic irrigation can be scheduled by the user or carried out automatically by the model with the automatic irrigation option the model decides when and how much water to apply required inputs for this option include a threshold value to trigger the irrigation applications and the maximum amount per application the three options to trigger automatic irrigation are the plant water stress intensity the soil water tension in the plough layer and the soil water deficit in the root zone for the plant water stress intensity option the automatic irrigation is triggered whenever the water stress factor reaches a predetermined value between 0 and 1 with 1 representing no stress and 0 indicating complete cessation of transpiration guerra et al 2005 in simulation scenarios where irrigation water is adequate sufficient for crop and not a limiting factor irrigation was set to automatic setting irrigation to automatic in the model applied irrigation water automatically to ease water stress if water deficit limited plant growth biomass accumulation by more than 10 on a given day liu et al 2007 to ensure sufficient irrigation water supply the maximum irrigation water supply was set to 2000 mm the minimum interval between automatic irrigation applications was set to 5 days fertiliser application in the model is similar to irrigation scheduling and can be manual or automatic in manual fertiliser application the amount and timing are fixed by the user while in the automatic fertiliser application the model automatically calculates the fertilisation scheduling according to plant nitrogen stress level or soil n concentration in the root zone similar to irrigation scheduling in scenarios where fertiliser was adequate the model was set to automatic fertiliser application and applies fertiliser automatically based on crop stress if n stress exceeded 20 in terms of limitation of biomass increase on a given day n was added up to the maximum amount of n fertiliser application set at 250 kg n ha 1 which is within ranges suggested by folberth et al 2012 for sub saharan africa since phosphorus p was not limiting the application of p was made automatically in the model simulations except in the simulations with baseline fertiliser application where phosphorus application was set at 95 kg p ha 1 according to levels and dates applied in the field trials on maize other general management operations carried out by the model in the scenarios were soil tillage using a power plough before planting common pest control management was carried out as needed in the model once calibrated and validated the epic model was used to simulate grain yield derived from different fertiliser and irrigation water combinations the simulated management scenarios used in the study are presented in table 3 scenarios were designed to cover a range of possible n fertiliser and irrigation water combinations based on scenarios developed by folberth et al 2013 for sub saharan africa farmers management practices were not simulated due to lack of exact dates that farmers carried out agricultural management practices such as planting and harvesting however farmers reported n fertiliser application levels and irrigation water amount were captured in the scenarios with manual irrigation and manual fertilisation the management practices used in the field trials e g planting dates harvest dates irrigation timing and fertiliser application timing were taken as the baseline these trials are similar to the management practices farmers use in the region mr g jordaan pers comm in the baseline irrigation and n fertiliser levels were 600 mm and 195 kg n respectively in the field trials taken as the baseline irrigation and fertiliser were applied manually on fixed dates according to the field trial management plan the epic model was run for the same hydrological years used in the calibration and validation steps a detailed description of the scenarios is given below scenario 1 considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with baseline fertiliser irrigation water supply levels were set to 0 150 300 450 600 750 900 and 1200 mm in scenario 1 the irrigation level 0 mm represented rainfed conditions where irrigation is not available and the combination irrigation 600 mm and fertiliser 195 kg n ha 1 represented the field trial conditions fertiliser application and irrigation timing dates were based on the field trial management plan see table 2 scenario 2 considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with automatic fertilisation again irrigation water supply levels were set to 0 150 300 450 600 750 900 and 1200 mm irrigation was manual and irrigation timing based on dates used in the field trials scenario 3 considered the effects on maize yield of varying fertiliser levels with baseline irrigation the n fertiliser supply levels were set at 10 30 50 70 100 130 150 170 195 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 while irrigation was fixed at 600 mm irrigation and fertiliser were applied using the manual settings and timings based on the field trials management plan scenario 4 considered the effects of varying fertiliser levels with automatic irrigation the n fertiliser supply levels were set at 10 30 50 70 100 130 150 170 195 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 fertiliser application timing was based on the dates used in the field trials finally scenario 5 considered a scenario with automatic irrigation and automatic fertilisation under these fertiliser and irrigation water settings the maize crop received sufficient n fertiliser and irrigation water and had no n nutrient stress nor water stress the following output variables were analysed for the scenarios economic yield in megagrams per hectare mg ha 1 water use efficiency calculated as yield per unit of water use yield rainfall plus irrigation in kg ha 1 mm 1 and n leaching as n lost in percolate 3 results 3 1 calibration detailed results of the calibration and validation of the epic model are given in choruma et al 2019 here only a summary of the calibration and validation results is given initially using the default parameters the model underestimated yields for all the years with pbias 17 6 r2 0 02 rmse 32 4 and nse 3 3 the range of simulated yields ranged from 7 megagrams per hectare mg ha 1 to 8 3 mg ha 1 while observed yields ranged from 9 mg ha 1 to 14 mg ha 1 adjusting the parameters parm 20 parm 47 parm 52 and wsfy improved rmse from 32 4 to 11 4 while the nse value increased from negative values to 0 47 with an mae equal to 1 16 mg ha 1 further model parameter adjustments did not increase model efficiency the initial phu value derived from the weather records resulted in an rmse error of 11 4 between the observed and simulated yields an upward adjustment of the phu value improved model performance a phu value of 2480 resulted in the smallest rmse value between observed yields and simulated yields of 10 7 additional adjustments of phu beyond 2480 did not result in any improvement in the rmse after calibration of the phu value model performance fell within the range set for satisfactory model calibration r2 0 6 and pbias 25 considering the limited data used for calibration further calibration of the crop parameters hi and wa was not performed since the model was in the range set for acceptable model calibration in the calibration simulation with phu 2480 simulated crop yields varied from 10 mg ha 1 to 12 mg ha 1 while observed yields varied from 9 mg ha 1 to 14 mg ha 1 fig 2 final phu calibration simulation results resulted in a coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed yields of 0 73 fig 3 with an nse of 0 53 which were considered satisfactory given the limited data a pbias of 1 11 and an mae of 1 09 mg ha 1 were also considered to be acceptable and the model did not need more efforts in calibrating hi and wa the value of rmse decreased from 31 3 in the default simulation to 11 7 in the simulation with the calibrated phu value table 4 shows a summary of the model performance statistics 3 2 validation for the validation simulations observed maize yields varied between 9 mg ha 1 and 14 mg ha 1 whereas simulated yields ranged from 10 mg ha 1 to 12 mg ha 1 simulated maize yields were overestimated in three out of five years in 2000 the trials recorded an unusually high yield of 14 01 mg ha 1 which the model underestimated and in 2003 the trials had a low observed yield which was slightly overestimated by the model fig 4 the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and simulated yields was 0 76 as shown in fig 5 model performance was satisfactory with nse 0 61 rmse 10 18 and pbias 0 2 table 5 shows a summary of the model statistics for the validation period a students t test comparing the observed and simulated mean grain yields showed that the observed mean yield was not significantly different from the simulated mean yield p 0 9 at the 95 significance level 3 3 farmer s survey survey results showed that farmers maize yields ranged from 2 mg ha 1 to 15 mg ha 1 giving an average maize yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 concerning irrigation methods most maize farmers used sprinkler irrigation 56 followed by flood irrigation 25 and then drip irrigation 19 the amount of irrigation water applied ranged from 400 mm to 700 mm giving an average of 500 mm per irrigation season however 44 of maize farmers did not know the total amount of irrigation water they applied each season plant appearance and farming experience were the most used methods for scheduled irrigation water and fertiliser application fertiliser type applied to maize mainly included ammonium nitrate an ammonium sulphate as urea and compound d with the most common form of fertiliser applied to maize being an the amount of an applied by maize farmers in a growing season ranged from 150 kg an ha 1 to 450 kg an ha 1 the average amount an applied was 224 kg an ha 1 3 4 scenario results 3 4 1 scenario 1 and scenario 2 concerning scenario 1 which considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with baseline fertiliser maize yield increased linearly with additional water supply until a maximum water level 750 mm further increases in water did not result in any yield increases in scenario 1 a maximum yield of 11 9 mg ha 1 was obtained at an irrigation water level of 900 mm in scenario 2 with automatic fertilisation and varying levels of irrigation water applied grain yield increased linearly with increasing levels of irrigation water up until a maximum irrigation level 900 mm further increments in irrigation water beyond 900 mm did not result in yield increases fig 6 a maximum yield of 11 9 mg ha 1 was reached at an irrigation level of 900 mm for both scenario 1 and 2 a yield of 0 8 mg ha 1 was obtained at 0 mm irrigation level corresponding to rainfed conditions 3 4 2 scenario 3 and scenario 4 scenario 3 fvirb and scenario 4 fvira considered the effects on maize yield of varying different fertiliser levels with baseline irrigation and automatic irrigation respectively in both scenarios maize yield increased linearly with additional n fertiliser supply from 0 to approximately 150 kg n ha 1 and began levelling off at around 150 kg n ha 1 as shown in fig 7 beyond 170 kg n ha 1 and 150 kg n ha 1 there were no further increases in yield for scenario 3 and scenario 4 respectively however yields were higher in scenario 4 than in scenario 3 for a given n fertiliser level the maximum yield in scenario 3 was 11 4 mg ha 1 at 170 kg n ha 1 and the maximum yield obtained in scenario 4 was 12 2 t ha 1 at 150 kg n ha 1 for both scenarios the highest incremental yield increase occurred between 30 and 130 kg n ha 1 while beyond 130 kg n ha 1 yield response to additional n fertiliser slowed down fig 7 shows the relationship between n fertiliser level and yield for scenarios 3 and 4 3 4 3 scenario 5 the average maize yield in scenario 5 fautoirauto with adequate n fertiliser and adequate irrigation water was 12 2 mg ha 1 simulation results show that the yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 was achieved with an average n fertiliser application of 200 kg n ha 1 and an average irrigation water application of 580 mm this scenario gave the highest yield for all simulations 3 4 4 n fertiliser leaching n leaching increased with increasing n fertiliser application under automatic irrigation and varying n fertiliser levels scenario fvirauto fig 8 at n fertiliser applications below 50 kg n ha 1 n leaching was less than 10 kg n ha 1 above 160 kg n ha 1 application n fertiliser leaching significantly increased with n fertiliser applications above 200 kg n ha 1 resulting in n leaching values greater than 50 kg n ha 1 fig 9 shows that as grain yield increased nitrate leaching also increased n leaching increased less than proportionally compared to grain yield after a certain point the increase in yield slowed down and levelled off while n leaching continued to increase grain yield levels off at 11 4 mg ha 1 corresponding to an n leaching rate of 29 kg n ha 1 beyond 11 4 mg ha 1 there were no further increases in grain yield while n leaching increased indicating economic losses of n fertiliser and potential environmental water pollution 3 4 5 water use efficiency in the scenario with different irrigation water levels and automatic fertiliser scenario ix fairv average water use efficiency wue increased by 85 from 10 68 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 0 mm to 19 72 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 600 mm up to a maximum wue of 19 92 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 750 mm irrigation water level fig 10 between 600 mm and 750 mm irrigation water level wue increased by only 0 9 beyond an irrigation water level of 750 mm there were no further increases in wue a graph of wue versus grain yield fig 11 showed that wue increased as grain yield increased but beyond 12 mg ha 1 there were no further increases in wue 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the epic model calibration results showed a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated yields given the limited data for model calibration and validation the simulation with default parameters resulted in an unsatisfactory agreement between observed and simulated yields pointing to the need for calibration further adjustments of model parameters mainly those related to carbon dynamics improved model simulations the improvement in model accuracy after calibration demonstrates the importance of calibrating models with site specific parameters and gives weight to niu et al 2009 and xiong et al 2013 assertions that local scale data can improve the accuracy of simulations and significantly reduce model uncertainties the improvement in model accuracy on adjusting phu is similar to studies by xiong et al 2013 and angulo et al 2013 which showed that fine tuning phus to local conditions could significantly improve the accuracy of model simulations phus are linked to the growth of biomass and its allotment to final yield hence the considerable effect of phu adjustment on crop yields experiments conducted in the usa by williams et al 1989 demonstrated that the phus necessary for the maturity of maize range between 1000 and 2900 a maize planting guide written by the agricultural research council of south africa states that maize typically requires 120 days from planting to maturity however this value of 120 is commonly for the warmer traditional maize growing areas in south africa such as kwa zulu natal du plessis 2003 the cradock area is comparatively cooler than the traditional maize growing areas in south africa which may explain the long growing season in this study the value of hi used in the calibration and validation study by choruma is the same as the hi values used by balkovič et al 2013 and kiniry et al 1997 in the epic model the default value of the hi set to 0 5 which is typical for improved high yield maize varieties s gaiser et al 2010 such as those used in the field trial the biomass to energy ratio wa is a known parameter influencing crop yields wang et al 2005 during phu calibration an rmse of 1 17 mg ha 1 and pbias 0 31 between observed and simulated yields were observed suggesting that no additional modifications of wa and hi were needed as the conditions for satisfactory model performance had been reached the default value of 40 kg ha 1 mj 1 m2 was therefore adopted as the final calibration value this value of wa is the same as the value used by balkovič et al 2013 and wang et al 2011 williams et al 2015 explain that wa increases yield through biomass changes and should be adjusted as a final resort and based on experimental data since wa can significantly change the rate of crop growth and final crop yield the hi value of 0 5 used in this studies is close to values reported in studies in nine states in the usa kiniry et al 1997 and the value reported by wang et al 2005 in the calibration and validation study by choruma et al 2019 the model was inclined to overestimate yields when observed yields were low this overestimation of yields is similar to studies conducted by martin 1993 and warner et al 1997 that found that the epic model tended to overestimate low observed yields a study by kiniry et al 1995 showed that overestimation of plant available water at field capacity could cause epic to overestimate yields in dry years to overcome this challenge kiniry et al 1995 suggested measuring the maximum depth of water extraction using local cultivars however this solution was beyond the scope of the calibration and validation study agricultural management records used during the field trials show that in 2003 the field trials were affected by heavy weed outbreaks at the time of the calibration and validation study the epic model routines did not accurately account for competition from weeds ko et al 2009 competition from weeds was not considered in the calibration simulations not accounting for the influence of weeds competing with the crop may explain why the model overestimated the low yields observed in 2003 4 2 farmers survey farmers survey results showed that most farmers applied fertiliser in the form of ammonium nitrate which contains approximately 21 nitrogen by composition in this study farmers applied an average of 224 kg an which translates to about 52 kg n ha 1 this n fertiliser application level is similar to n fertiliser application levels found in surveys conducted by fanadzo et al 2010 who found that on average farmers in the zanyokwe irrigation scheme in the eastern cape applied approximately an average of 47 6 kg n ha 1 per maize growing season the average grain yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 achieved by farmers in the survey study is less than the potential yield of 9 12 mg ha 1 possible under irrigation in south africa du plessis and bruwer 2003 the lower n fertiliser application rates by farmers may explain the lower yields obtained by farmers compared to the field experiment simulations showed that between 0 and 150 kg n ha 1 maize yield increased linearly with additional fertiliser application to achieve higher yields farmers may increase current fertiliser application levels if irrigation water is available survey results also revealed that most farmers did not practice a balanced n fertiliser and irrigation water application most farmers did not know the total amount of irrigation water they applied per season and applied water based on farming experience or plant appearance the application of water and fertiliser based on plant appearance may lead to incorrect fertiliser and water application timing and lower yields several studies in south africa have identified poor agricultural land management practices as one of the primary reasons for low yields in south african irrigated farming systems bembridge 2000 fanadzo et al 2010 if significant efforts towards sustainable intensification through increased crop production are to be made it is crucial to optimise n fertiliser and irrigation water application to match crop requirements 4 3 model application the simulation yield of 0 8 mg ha 1 obtained in the scenarios where irrigation was 0 mm corresponding to rain fed conditions mg ha 1 is comparable to studies by ndhleve et al 2017 in the eastern cape who found average farm maize yields below 1 mg ha 1 for rain fed farming systems in the absence of irrigation increasing the amount of fertiliser or even under automatic fertilisation did not increase maize yields demonstrating that water availability is a significant constraint to increasing crop yield in semiarid conditions the results of this study are similar to field trials conducted by moeletsi et al 2009 who found water deficiency as the main limiting factor for dryland maize production in south africa low yields are usually typical of subsistence small scale farmers who are unable to purchase irrigation equipment the productivity of small scale farmers can be improved by encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable intensification of crop production by using improved agricultural land management strategies this will involve the sustainable use of fertilizer and water saving technologies as well as increasing small scale farmers access to markets so they can earn money to purchase improved farming equipment comparing scenarios 3 and 4 higher yields were achieved when irrigation water was automatic rather than when fertilizer was automatic this higher yield with automatic water supply suggests that the water supply may play a more significant role in limiting crop yields compared to the n fertilizer supply in this study the results of this study further support field studies by moeletsi et al 2009 who found that in semiarid environments typical of south africa the major limiting factor in maize production was the water supply given that agriculture already accounts for 60 of water withdrawals in south africa there is a need to develop innovative technologies that save water in agriculture without reducing crop yields and food security planning for a sustainable agricultural future remains critical given that south africa is already a water scarce country a situation which may get worse in the future due to the projected negative impacts of climate change on water resources in scenario 5 when the model was set to automatic irrigation and automatic fertiliser application the maximum yield simulated was 12 2 mg ha 1 which was achieved at approximately 200 kg n ha 1 and 580 mm irrigation water this yield value is within the range of potential maize yields attainable under irrigation in south africa du plessis and bruwer 2003 this finding supports the idea that the crop s response to n fertilizer and irrigation water is greater than the crop s response to each factor in isolation the relationship between grain yield and irrigation water showed a linear relationship that levelled off at higher irrigation water level payero et al 2006 found a linear relationship between grain yield and irrigation water amount in contrast similar studies such as those by bozkurt et al 2006 kipkorir et al 2002 and farré and faci 2009 have reported non linear relationships between grain yield and irrigation water however according to tolk and howell 2003 the relationship between maize yield and irrigation water applied is influenced by several factors such as climate soil and irrigation practices this variation in the relationship between yield and irrigation highlights the importance of investigating crop responses to irrigation under local growing conditions adopting irrigation and fertilizer management practices developed somewhere else might not bring about the desired yield increases and environmental goals the optimal seasonal irrigation water requirements of approximately 580 mm found in this study are similar to djaman et al 2018 who carried out a study of irrigated maize under semiarid conditions and found an average irrigation water requirement of 730 mm per maize growing season trout et al 2017 reported that irrigation water requirements for maize varied from 616 to 774 mm in semiarid environments in the great plains of the united states similarly the optimal fertilizer application level for maximum yield of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 found in this study corresponds to a level that is currently common in industrialised regions with high yields such as the united states of america and china fao et al 2005 studies by folberth et al 2012 have found fertilizer application levels in the range 150 kg n ha 1 to 200 kg n ha 1close to adequate n fertiliser supply in most parts of sub saharan africa comparison of farmers reported n fertiliser and irrigation water amounts with scenario 5 automatic irrigation and automatic fertilisation shows that to reach the maximum yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 achieved in scenario 5 farmers must increase both irrigation water supply and n fertiliser supply to reach 12 2 mg ha 1 farmers must increase n fertilizer application from 52 kg n ha 1 to 200 kg n ha 1 and the average irrigation from 500 mm to 582 mm this increase in n fertiliser and irrigation water supply would result in a yield increase of 69 from the farmers current average yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 a simple analysis shows that at the current cost of irrigation water of 2 36 cents per cubic meter c m3 department of water and sanitation 2019 the increase in the cost of irrigation water would be minimal given a rise of 82 mm in the water supply however the farmer would require four times more of the amount of n fertiliser at an average cost of r 5 85 per kilogram of ammonium nitrate daff 2019 this represents a percentage increase of 285 in fertiliser costs although income would also increase with economic yield the farmer would need to make trade offs after considering other production costs such as labour and transport to markets from fig 8 it can be deduced that at the current farmers level of n fertilizer application of 50 kg n ha 1 n leaching is approximately 10 kg n ha 1 in comparison at the application level of 200 kg n ha 1 in scenario 5 n leaching is approximately 50 kg n ha 1 this n leaching level in scenario 5 implies that if farmers increase the amount of n fertilizer applied grain yield will increase however the potential risk of nitrate leaching to water bodies will also increase this scenario presents a trade off between maximising yields versus environmental protection applying more n fertilizer to increase crop yields will lead to an increased risk of nitrate leaching reducing environmental water quality therefore the use of crop models can provide information that can help decision makers evaluate the economic and ecological consequences of agricultural land management practices and choose optimal strategies that promote sustainable agricultural intensification the relationships between irrigation amount and crop yield with wue showed a positive correlation between grain yield and wue up to a specific irrigation amount and then levelled off this relationship implies that increasing irrigation water but only up to a maximum level will increase grain yield beyond this maximum level additional water application will not result in further yield increases this knowledge of the relationship between maximum irrigation water amount and grain yield is helpful to farm managers when making water management decisions based on irrigation water availability the values of wue found in this study are similar to values found by guo et al 2010 in semi arid northern china that ranged from 11 to 20 kg ha 1 mm 1 given the increases in water scarcity and frequency of droughts in the eastern cape there would be significant consequences for local and regional water supply and demand if current rain fed agricultural systems in the region were to convert to irrigated agriculture for example the government would have to consider the implications of such a conversion on municipal and industrial water demand and supply in the eastern cape already irrigation water supply is under pressure from other competing water uses such as municipal and industrial water use it is unlikely that agriculture which already accounts for more than 60 of water withdrawals in south africa donnenfeld et al 2018 would be allocated more water over municipal water requirements therefore to increase crop yields agricultural systems in the eastern cape and south africa in general will be required to produce more crops with limited water resources this study s results suggest that farmers can significantly increase crop yields by improving n fertilizer and irrigation application timing without significantly increasing water user the simulations at the farm scale in this study show that the epic model has the potential to be used as a decision support tool for irrigation and fertilizer management of maize in the eastern cape the capability of the epic model to simulate different irrigation and fertilizer management strategies without carrying out extended and costly field experiments makes it a valuable research and application tool in irrigation and fertilizer management of maize however the use of the epic model as a decision support tool in the study region requires further calibration and validation of the model using a more comprehensive dataset across more soils and using a wider range of agricultural management practices in the region the results of the simulations must be taken in comparative and not absolute terms as the ultimate crop yield is the result of several complex interactions in the soil plant atmosphere these complex interactions can cause real world values to vary from model simulation values for example pests and diseases can have a significant adverse effect on crop yields if not managed well 5 study limitations the study assumed no deficiencies in other macronutrients except n however in reality this may not be the case with farmers individual soils and farmers would need to have their soils assessed for any other nutrient deficiencies due to limited resources and data it was also assumed that there were no deficiencies in soil micronutrients according to voortman et al 2003 most soils in sub saharan africa contain low amounts of micronutrients due to the chemical composition of the parent material and weathering over long periods while micronutrients are seldom a limiting factor under low input conditions they can be a significant limiting factor under high input intensive agriculture gaiser et al 1999 the automatic irrigation and fertilization options used in the model may lead to an overestimation of crop yields by assuming that local farmers have complete knowledge concerning irrigation water and fertilizer management irrigation and fertilizer timing can significantly affect crop yield and crop water productivity further detailed data on farmers irrigation water and fertilizer management practices would be required to determine optimum fertilizer and irrigation water application dates based on crop growth stages also in the automatic water supply scenarios the model assumed unlimited water supply but in practice the irrigation water supply may be restricted by water authorities and water availability further research would also need to consider the potential crop yield implications due to seasonal restrictions in water abstraction for irrigation and priorities for maize against other crops such as vegetables despite these limitations this study provides a useful assessment of the potential of the epic model as a decision support tool when considering the effect of different fertilizer and irrigation management strategies on crop yield and environmental objectives 6 conclusion a calibrated and validated epic crop growth model was used to simulate the effects of different combinations of irrigation water and n fertilizer levels on maize yield simulated maize yields were compared to maize yields from a field trial and from local farmers reported maize yields it can be concluded that the optimal irrigation water and n fertilizer management practices for irrigated maize production in the cradock area are to irrigate the maize crop with approximately 580 mm water and to fertilise the soil at a rate of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 implementation of this irrigation water and n fertilizer management strategy would increase maize yields by 69 from the current farmers average maize yield of approximately 7 2 mg ha 1 to approximately 12 2 mg ha 1 at the same time farmers irrigation water use would increase by 16 from an average of 500 mm to approximately 582 mm however an amount of 35 kg n ha 1 could potentially be lost through leaching trade offs between increasing maize yields and minimising nitrate leaching would have to be reached to balance between environmental concerns and economic concerns there is room to improve farmers current maize yields by simultaneously improving n fertilizer and irrigation water management the study highlights the usefulness of crop models in combination with knowledge of farmers agricultural land management practices to develop practical irrigation and fertilizer management strategies that help achieve sustainable agricultural intensification and are likely to be adopted by local farmers funding this research was funded by the dfg the german research foundation under germany s excellence strategy funding number exc2052 1

10035,growing water scarcity and increasing nitrogen n fertiliser prices in south africa require more prudent n fertiliser and irrigation water use approaches if the goal of sustainable agricultural intensification is to be realised it is vital to develop location specific agricultural land management strategies that promote increased crop productivity while minimising negative environmental impacts in this study a calibrated and validated environmental policy integrated climate epic model was used to simulate a range of n fertiliser and irrigation water levels on maize zea mays l yield in the eastern cape of south africa results showed that a fertiliser and irrigation water management schedule combining approximately 200 kg n ha 1 and 580 mm irrigation water per maize growing season provided the highest average maize yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 an increase of 69 above farmers current maize yield levels nitrogen fertiliser application levels greater than 160 kg n ha 1 resulted in potential n fertiliser leaching losses of more than 35 kg n ha 1 the epic model can be considered a valuable tool to aid decision makers in identifying optimal site specific irrigation water and n fertiliser application levels that contribute to increased maize crop productivity while maximising water use keywords fertiliser management crop model food security sustainable intensification 1 introduction several factors such as crop pests and diseases influence crop yields however water and nitrogen n availability continue to be two of the most critical factors influencing crop production mueller et al 2012 the influence of water and n availability on crop yields is particularly significant in the eastern cape where water is scarce and most soils lacking in adequate plant nutrients goldblatt 2011 previous research has shown that one of the major reasons for persistent low yields in south african farming systems is soil mineral nutrient depletion e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p folberth et al 2012 the continuous removal of crop residues from cultivated areas and inadequate soil nutrient replacement have led to soil nutrient reduction in many parts of south africa van der velde et al 2014a 2014b low yields are especially true for maize fields in many parts of south africa where n is the most limiting nutrient pasley et al 2019 sipaseuth et al 2007 ten berge et al 2019 similarly low water availability has also been identified as a significant yield limiting factor in most semiarid regions like south africa hammad et al 2018 yin et al 2014 given the limited availability of water in most south african farming systems the anticipated increase in crop demand due to increasing population will have to be met with less water and more efficient irrigation systems fao 2017 in addition increasing n fertiliser prices in south africa daff 2019 will require even more efficient approaches to n fertiliser management by farmers in this study efficient irrigation water and n fertiliser management means applying irrigation water and n fertiliser at the right time in the right quantities at the right placement and from the right source to maximise yields and reduce environmental impact the efficient management of irrigation water and n fertiliser at the farm scale has been shown to significantly increase crop yields while minimising environmental degradation folberth et al 2013 van der velde et al 2014a 2014b in irrigated cropping systems irrigation water application closely interacts with the efficient use of n fertiliser with the relationship being described as co limitation co limitation means that the crop s response to n fertiliser and irrigation water is greater than the crop s response to each factor in isolation sadras 2004 however many farmers in the eastern cape do not practice this efficient application of irrigation water and fertiliser due to factors such as limited financial resources and a lack of locally developed irrigation water and n fertiliser application recommendations choruma and odume 2019 to develop local n fertiliser and irrigation water management recommendations that increase crop yields while minimising environmental degradation field experiments have been used to test the effects of different irrigation water and n fertiliser management plans on crop yields and the environment field experiments have the advantage that they can be implemented on many field sites with better representations of soils which is a vital component of crop growth however field experiments are often labour intensive and costly to carry out on a regular and long term basis when compared to crop growth simulation models santhi et al 2005 zhao et al 2016 when properly calibrated and validated crop growth models offer a reliable fast and more affordable method of examining the outcomes of different n fertiliser and irrigation water scenarios on crop yields and the environment for example crop models have been used to determine irrigation requirements at the field level alexandrov and hoogenboom 1999 guerra et al 2005 and optimise the allocation of fertiliser and water among crops during the growing season bryant et al 1992 cabelguenne et al 1999 crop models can therefore be applied with reasonable accuracy to simultaneously assess the effects of irrigation water and n fertiliser combinations on crop yields in south africa most irrigation water and n fertiliser recommendations are still based on field experiments arc 2017 fao et al 2005 due to a general lack of data for model calibration while interest has grown in crop simulation modelling most modelling studies in south africa have investigated irrigation water and n fertiliser management separately for example kgonyane 2010 used the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model to simulate maize response to low inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus for dry regions fessehazion et al 2014 used the soil and water balance swb model to generate irrigation water application calendars yet irrigation and fertiliser management are closely linked there is therefore a need to develop location specific irrigation water and n fertiliser management strategies to simultaneously optimise irrigation water and n fertiliser use at the farm scale therefore the objectives of this study were to a simulate the effects of different irrigation water and n fertiliser levels on maize yield using the environmental policy integrated climate model epic and b identify optimal n fertiliser and irrigation water management strategies for increased maize yields and minimum n leaching risk the epic model was chosen because of its robust crop growth and fertiliser management modules williams et al 1984 and also because it has been calibrated for the study site in a previous study choruma et al 2019 by the authors potential n leaching risk was chosen because ground water pollution poses a significant threat to water quality in the eastern cape however ground water pollution due to agriculture has received less attention from researchers compared to surface water pollution hay et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the reader should note that the present study is a follow up study to two previous studies conducted in the study area by the authors the first study documented in choruma et al 2019 describes a calibration and validation procedure for the epic model conducted in the study area using limited data from field trials on maize the second study describes a survey of farmers agricultural land management practices including maize yields choruma and odume 2019 the results from the farmers survey concerning farmer s maize yields are used in this present study to compare farmers maize yields with epic model simulated yields therefore the present study is an application of the calibrated and validated epic model in the same study area by combining a crop model with a farmers survey the study provides novel insights into agricultural water management by integrating farmers views into the modelling process 2 2 study area the cradock research farm is in the great fish river valley catchment in the eastern cape of south africa fig 1 where extensive irrigation and commercial farming are practised the climate and soil characteristics of the cradock farm are typical of the wider great fish river valley catchment the soil is categorised as a fine loamy mollic ustifluvent soil survey staff 2014 with high amounts of sand and silt of alluvial and colluvial material developed from beaufort sediments a description of the soil characteristics is given in table 1 rainfall in the region averages 341 mm with most of the rain being experienced in february and march 2 3 epic model description the epic model version 0810 is designed to simulate field scale crop yield and can simulate over 70 crops using unique parameter values for each crop williams et al 2015 in the crop growth routine crop yield is estimated as a function of the harvest index hi and is affected by factors such as biomass to energy ratio wa planting density pd photosynthetic active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd xiong et al 2016 potential biomass is adjusted to actual biomass through daily stress caused by extreme temperature water and nutrient stress or inappropriate aeration values of site specific parameters such as potential heat units accumulated phu harvest index hi and optimum temperature ot have to be modified according to the context which the model is to be applied balkovič et al 2013 2 3 1 field experiment data for model calibration and validation were obtained from field trials on maize carried out at the cradock research farm the trials were carried out on behalf of the agricultural research council arc by the cradock research manager from 1999 to 2003 to evaluate the potential yield of different maize hybrid varieties in the eastern cape two varieties crn 3760 and phb 30h22 with complete records for grain yield and management for the period 1999 2003 were selected for the modelling study the two maize varieties chosen were grown on individual fields with similar soils at the cradock research farm but managed using the same agricultural management plan a randomised block design rbd clewer and scarisbrick 2001 with three replications was used throughout the planting rate was at 50 000 plants per hectare with a row spacing of 0 9 m agricultural management practices such as planting and harvest dates irrigation and fertiliser application dates were carried out according to a management plan developed by the arc the management plan developed by the arc was designed to reflect common agricultural practices carried out by local farmers in the cradock area table 2 flood irrigation was used with the crop getting 600 mm per growing season while nitrogen fertiliser was applied at a rate of 195 kg n ha 1 season 1 table 2 shows the representative irrigation and fertiliser amounts used during the field trials from 1999 to 2003 the same agricultural management practices were carried out around the same time each year only a few adjustments to the standard plan were made to accommodate prevailing weather conditions 2 4 model inputs weather files for the cradock farm including daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity for the years 1980 2010 were obtained from the agmerra ruane et al 2015 climate dataset at 0 5 0 5 arc degree spatial resolution values of soil parameters bulk density cation exchange capacity texture and electrical conductivity were acquired from records of soil analyses that had been previously conducted at the cradock farm values for soil albedo organic carbon concentration were missing from soil records and were taken from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 the missing soil parameters in the epic soil file were replaced with values from the hwsd based on expert opinion mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm fertiliser application irrigation amounts and planting and harvesting dates during the trial period were obtained from the cradock research farm manager s records mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm 2 5 model set up 2 5 1 modelling framework the modelling framework developed at iiasa epic iiasa balkovič et al 2013 was used to simulate the effects of various levels of n fertiliser and irrigation water on maize yield input files were converted to simulation grids at a resolution of 5 5 arc min geographic information systems gis layers on soil topography and weather were combined to set up the modelling scheme balkovič et al 2013 xiong et al 2013 the model was constructed for the entire eastern cape and assigned into homogenous response units based on physical properties given by the intersection of site properties such as elevation and soil texture next a zone raster made up of homogenous simulation units and weather grids upon which the model was run was created balkovič et al 2014 the simulation grid in which cradock research farm was located was selected for the simulations a single soil profile adjusted for soil properties found in the study area was used for all simulations see table 2 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the priestly taylor method because it gave pet values close to reported values for pet in the region compared to other methods of estimating pet schulze and maharaj 2007 weather records were available for 31 years and the model was run for 31 years from 1999 to 2003 the first 19 years of the weather record served as a warm up period for equilibrating model soil and water erosion functions irrigation and fertiliser application were done using the manual setting and scheduled according to dates used in the field trials 2 5 2 model calibration grain yield data from two separate fields on the cradock research farm were used for calibration and validation choruma et al 2019 both fields were managed using the same management plan comprehensive data for model calibration and validation such as biomass accumulation and nutrient leaching were not available as the trials were designed to evaluate cultivar stability and potential yield only grain yield and agricultural management dates were available grain yield was therefore used for model calibration and validation for calibration minor changes were made to the default parameters to adjust for site conditions and local crop varieties previous researches conducted by causarano et al 2010 folberth 2013 wang et al 2005 in semiarid areas showed that simulated crop yields were most sensitive to i potential heat units phu ii planting density pd iii the biomass to energy ratio wa defined as the potential growth per unit of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation iv harvest index hi or ratio of economic yield to above ground biomass and v microbial decay rate these parameters were subsequently chosen for calibration therefore the choice of parameters to calibrate was based on the literature following rinaldi et al 2011 the limited data available for model calibration and validation and recommendations from the epic model developers based at the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa the calibration procedure detailed in choruma et al 2019 was done according to the following steps adapted from i simulation with default parameters ii parameter adjustment microbial decay rate coefficient slow humus transformation rate tillage effect on residue decay rate exponential coefficient in potential and water use root growth distribution iii potential heat unit phu adjustment iv harvest index adjustment and v biomass to energy ratio wa adjustment model validation focused on grain yield data from the second field collected over the five year period from 1999 to 2003 2 5 3

following wang et al 2012 2 6 model application 2 6 1 survey of farmers agricultural land management practices before the application of the epic model a survey of farmers agricultural management practices and values of ecosystem services was conducted in the study area using a questionnaire the survey study presented in choruma and odume 2019 was used to determine local farmers current agricultural land management practices irrigation fertiliser and maize yields farmers reported maize yields were then compared in this study with simulated yields obtained using combinations of irrigation water and n fertiliser levels the objective of comparing farmers yields and simulated yields was to determine whether farmers maize yields could be improved by optimising irrigation water and n fertiliser management simultaneously in this study only crop yields n fertiliser management and irrigation water management practices concerning maize production are presented a brief description of the survey study is given below overall 48 maize farmers took part in the survey of farmers agricultural management practices conducted between january and april 2019 purposive sampling was used to identify farmers in the study area who used inputs such as fertiliser and irrigation regularly an online version of the survey questionnaire was developed and the link attached to a request letter which was shared via email with the identified farmers in addition the survey was shared on the online social networking platform of the eastern cape farmers group the survey questionnaire covered the following topics 1 farmers agricultural management practices 2 the values farmers assigned to different agroecosystem services and 3 demographic information data were analysed using thematic analysis a detailed description of the survey method and framework is given in choruma and odume 2019 2 6 2 selection of nitrogen as the yield limiting factor concerning the choice of n fertiliser as the limiting nutrient to maize growth consultations held with the cradock farm manager revealed that the major factors limiting maize yields in the cradock area and surrounding commercial maize farming areas were n nutrient availability and water availability mr g jordaan 2017 pers comm an assessment of the mineralogy and soil fertility status of soils in the eastern cape by mandiringana et al 2007 found that the majority of soils from the commercial farming areas had medium to high levels of phosphorus while most of the rural areas in the eastern cape had low soil fertility naturally the commercial farming areas had higher soil fertility than soils in the rural areas mandiringana et al 2007 generally in the eastern cape nutrient supply is low in subsistence farmers crop fields due to poor soil management practices and limited fertiliser inputs levels of management and inputs are much higher in commercial farms leading to their increased productivity the present study focused on irrigation water and n nutrient availability as limiting factors to maize production in the eastern cape phosphorus deficiency was not considered in the present study because it was considered not a limiting factor 2 6 3 yield comparisons to develop optimal irrigation and n fertiliser recommendations simulated yields derived from combinations of n fertiliser and irrigation water levels were compared to yields obtained using the field trials n fertiliser and irrigation water levels simulated yields were also compared to yields reported by farmers from the survey of agricultural management practices conducted in a prior study farmers reported yields n fertiliser levels and irrigation water levels were not simulated in this study due to a lack of accurate data on farmers actual agricultural management practices dates planting harvesting and fertiliser application dates farmers reported maize yields and maize agricultural management practices were used only for comparison with simulated model outputs the agricultural management data used in the field trials were taken as the baseline scenario because they had complete information on the agricultural management practices dates e g irrigation fertiliser planting and harvesting that are required as model inputs in the baseline scenario field trials nitrogen n containing fertiliser was applied at a rate of 195 kg n ha 1 and phosphorus p containing fertiliser applied at a rate of 95 kg p ha 1 n fertiliser was applied three times during the growing season and p fertiliser applied once at planting irrigation water was applied at a depth of 75 mm per irrigation event using flood irrigation eight times during the growing season to give a total of 600 mm irrigation water per maize growing season in epic irrigation can be scheduled by the user or carried out automatically by the model with the automatic irrigation option the model decides when and how much water to apply required inputs for this option include a threshold value to trigger the irrigation applications and the maximum amount per application the three options to trigger automatic irrigation are the plant water stress intensity the soil water tension in the plough layer and the soil water deficit in the root zone for the plant water stress intensity option the automatic irrigation is triggered whenever the water stress factor reaches a predetermined value between 0 and 1 with 1 representing no stress and 0 indicating complete cessation of transpiration guerra et al 2005 in simulation scenarios where irrigation water is adequate sufficient for crop and not a limiting factor irrigation was set to automatic setting irrigation to automatic in the model applied irrigation water automatically to ease water stress if water deficit limited plant growth biomass accumulation by more than 10 on a given day liu et al 2007 to ensure sufficient irrigation water supply the maximum irrigation water supply was set to 2000 mm the minimum interval between automatic irrigation applications was set to 5 days fertiliser application in the model is similar to irrigation scheduling and can be manual or automatic in manual fertiliser application the amount and timing are fixed by the user while in the automatic fertiliser application the model automatically calculates the fertilisation scheduling according to plant nitrogen stress level or soil n concentration in the root zone similar to irrigation scheduling in scenarios where fertiliser was adequate the model was set to automatic fertiliser application and applies fertiliser automatically based on crop stress if n stress exceeded 20 in terms of limitation of biomass increase on a given day n was added up to the maximum amount of n fertiliser application set at 250 kg n ha 1 which is within ranges suggested by folberth et al 2012 for sub saharan africa since phosphorus p was not limiting the application of p was made automatically in the model simulations except in the simulations with baseline fertiliser application where phosphorus application was set at 95 kg p ha 1 according to levels and dates applied in the field trials on maize other general management operations carried out by the model in the scenarios were soil tillage using a power plough before planting common pest control management was carried out as needed in the model once calibrated and validated the epic model was used to simulate grain yield derived from different fertiliser and irrigation water combinations the simulated management scenarios used in the study are presented in table 3 scenarios were designed to cover a range of possible n fertiliser and irrigation water combinations based on scenarios developed by folberth et al 2013 for sub saharan africa farmers management practices were not simulated due to lack of exact dates that farmers carried out agricultural management practices such as planting and harvesting however farmers reported n fertiliser application levels and irrigation water amount were captured in the scenarios with manual irrigation and manual fertilisation the management practices used in the field trials e g planting dates harvest dates irrigation timing and fertiliser application timing were taken as the baseline these trials are similar to the management practices farmers use in the region mr g jordaan pers comm in the baseline irrigation and n fertiliser levels were 600 mm and 195 kg n respectively in the field trials taken as the baseline irrigation and fertiliser were applied manually on fixed dates according to the field trial management plan the epic model was run for the same hydrological years used in the calibration and validation steps a detailed description of the scenarios is given below scenario 1 considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with baseline fertiliser irrigation water supply levels were set to 0 150 300 450 600 750 900 and 1200 mm in scenario 1 the irrigation level 0 mm represented rainfed conditions where irrigation is not available and the combination irrigation 600 mm and fertiliser 195 kg n ha 1 represented the field trial conditions fertiliser application and irrigation timing dates were based on the field trial management plan see table 2 scenario 2 considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with automatic fertilisation again irrigation water supply levels were set to 0 150 300 450 600 750 900 and 1200 mm irrigation was manual and irrigation timing based on dates used in the field trials scenario 3 considered the effects on maize yield of varying fertiliser levels with baseline irrigation the n fertiliser supply levels were set at 10 30 50 70 100 130 150 170 195 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 while irrigation was fixed at 600 mm irrigation and fertiliser were applied using the manual settings and timings based on the field trials management plan scenario 4 considered the effects of varying fertiliser levels with automatic irrigation the n fertiliser supply levels were set at 10 30 50 70 100 130 150 170 195 200 and 250 kg n ha 1 fertiliser application timing was based on the dates used in the field trials finally scenario 5 considered a scenario with automatic irrigation and automatic fertilisation under these fertiliser and irrigation water settings the maize crop received sufficient n fertiliser and irrigation water and had no n nutrient stress nor water stress the following output variables were analysed for the scenarios economic yield in megagrams per hectare mg ha 1 water use efficiency calculated as yield per unit of water use yield rainfall plus irrigation in kg ha 1 mm 1 and n leaching as n lost in percolate 3 results 3 1 calibration detailed results of the calibration and validation of the epic model are given in choruma et al 2019 here only a summary of the calibration and validation results is given initially using the default parameters the model underestimated yields for all the years with pbias 17 6 r2 0 02 rmse 32 4 and nse 3 3 the range of simulated yields ranged from 7 megagrams per hectare mg ha 1 to 8 3 mg ha 1 while observed yields ranged from 9 mg ha 1 to 14 mg ha 1 adjusting the parameters parm 20 parm 47 parm 52 and wsfy improved rmse from 32 4 to 11 4 while the nse value increased from negative values to 0 47 with an mae equal to 1 16 mg ha 1 further model parameter adjustments did not increase model efficiency the initial phu value derived from the weather records resulted in an rmse error of 11 4 between the observed and simulated yields an upward adjustment of the phu value improved model performance a phu value of 2480 resulted in the smallest rmse value between observed yields and simulated yields of 10 7 additional adjustments of phu beyond 2480 did not result in any improvement in the rmse after calibration of the phu value model performance fell within the range set for satisfactory model calibration r2 0 6 and pbias 25 considering the limited data used for calibration further calibration of the crop parameters hi and wa was not performed since the model was in the range set for acceptable model calibration in the calibration simulation with phu 2480 simulated crop yields varied from 10 mg ha 1 to 12 mg ha 1 while observed yields varied from 9 mg ha 1 to 14 mg ha 1 fig 2 final phu calibration simulation results resulted in a coefficient of determination r2 between simulated and observed yields of 0 73 fig 3 with an nse of 0 53 which were considered satisfactory given the limited data a pbias of 1 11 and an mae of 1 09 mg ha 1 were also considered to be acceptable and the model did not need more efforts in calibrating hi and wa the value of rmse decreased from 31 3 in the default simulation to 11 7 in the simulation with the calibrated phu value table 4 shows a summary of the model performance statistics 3 2 validation for the validation simulations observed maize yields varied between 9 mg ha 1 and 14 mg ha 1 whereas simulated yields ranged from 10 mg ha 1 to 12 mg ha 1 simulated maize yields were overestimated in three out of five years in 2000 the trials recorded an unusually high yield of 14 01 mg ha 1 which the model underestimated and in 2003 the trials had a low observed yield which was slightly overestimated by the model fig 4 the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and simulated yields was 0 76 as shown in fig 5 model performance was satisfactory with nse 0 61 rmse 10 18 and pbias 0 2 table 5 shows a summary of the model statistics for the validation period a students t test comparing the observed and simulated mean grain yields showed that the observed mean yield was not significantly different from the simulated mean yield p 0 9 at the 95 significance level 3 3 farmer s survey survey results showed that farmers maize yields ranged from 2 mg ha 1 to 15 mg ha 1 giving an average maize yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 concerning irrigation methods most maize farmers used sprinkler irrigation 56 followed by flood irrigation 25 and then drip irrigation 19 the amount of irrigation water applied ranged from 400 mm to 700 mm giving an average of 500 mm per irrigation season however 44 of maize farmers did not know the total amount of irrigation water they applied each season plant appearance and farming experience were the most used methods for scheduled irrigation water and fertiliser application fertiliser type applied to maize mainly included ammonium nitrate an ammonium sulphate as urea and compound d with the most common form of fertiliser applied to maize being an the amount of an applied by maize farmers in a growing season ranged from 150 kg an ha 1 to 450 kg an ha 1 the average amount an applied was 224 kg an ha 1 3 4 scenario results 3 4 1 scenario 1 and scenario 2 concerning scenario 1 which considered the effects on maize yield of varying irrigation water levels with baseline fertiliser maize yield increased linearly with additional water supply until a maximum water level 750 mm further increases in water did not result in any yield increases in scenario 1 a maximum yield of 11 9 mg ha 1 was obtained at an irrigation water level of 900 mm in scenario 2 with automatic fertilisation and varying levels of irrigation water applied grain yield increased linearly with increasing levels of irrigation water up until a maximum irrigation level 900 mm further increments in irrigation water beyond 900 mm did not result in yield increases fig 6 a maximum yield of 11 9 mg ha 1 was reached at an irrigation level of 900 mm for both scenario 1 and 2 a yield of 0 8 mg ha 1 was obtained at 0 mm irrigation level corresponding to rainfed conditions 3 4 2 scenario 3 and scenario 4 scenario 3 fvirb and scenario 4 fvira considered the effects on maize yield of varying different fertiliser levels with baseline irrigation and automatic irrigation respectively in both scenarios maize yield increased linearly with additional n fertiliser supply from 0 to approximately 150 kg n ha 1 and began levelling off at around 150 kg n ha 1 as shown in fig 7 beyond 170 kg n ha 1 and 150 kg n ha 1 there were no further increases in yield for scenario 3 and scenario 4 respectively however yields were higher in scenario 4 than in scenario 3 for a given n fertiliser level the maximum yield in scenario 3 was 11 4 mg ha 1 at 170 kg n ha 1 and the maximum yield obtained in scenario 4 was 12 2 t ha 1 at 150 kg n ha 1 for both scenarios the highest incremental yield increase occurred between 30 and 130 kg n ha 1 while beyond 130 kg n ha 1 yield response to additional n fertiliser slowed down fig 7 shows the relationship between n fertiliser level and yield for scenarios 3 and 4 3 4 3 scenario 5 the average maize yield in scenario 5 fautoirauto with adequate n fertiliser and adequate irrigation water was 12 2 mg ha 1 simulation results show that the yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 was achieved with an average n fertiliser application of 200 kg n ha 1 and an average irrigation water application of 580 mm this scenario gave the highest yield for all simulations 3 4 4 n fertiliser leaching n leaching increased with increasing n fertiliser application under automatic irrigation and varying n fertiliser levels scenario fvirauto fig 8 at n fertiliser applications below 50 kg n ha 1 n leaching was less than 10 kg n ha 1 above 160 kg n ha 1 application n fertiliser leaching significantly increased with n fertiliser applications above 200 kg n ha 1 resulting in n leaching values greater than 50 kg n ha 1 fig 9 shows that as grain yield increased nitrate leaching also increased n leaching increased less than proportionally compared to grain yield after a certain point the increase in yield slowed down and levelled off while n leaching continued to increase grain yield levels off at 11 4 mg ha 1 corresponding to an n leaching rate of 29 kg n ha 1 beyond 11 4 mg ha 1 there were no further increases in grain yield while n leaching increased indicating economic losses of n fertiliser and potential environmental water pollution 3 4 5 water use efficiency in the scenario with different irrigation water levels and automatic fertiliser scenario ix fairv average water use efficiency wue increased by 85 from 10 68 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 0 mm to 19 72 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 600 mm up to a maximum wue of 19 92 kg ha 1 mm 1 at 750 mm irrigation water level fig 10 between 600 mm and 750 mm irrigation water level wue increased by only 0 9 beyond an irrigation water level of 750 mm there were no further increases in wue a graph of wue versus grain yield fig 11 showed that wue increased as grain yield increased but beyond 12 mg ha 1 there were no further increases in wue 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the epic model calibration results showed a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated yields given the limited data for model calibration and validation the simulation with default parameters resulted in an unsatisfactory agreement between observed and simulated yields pointing to the need for calibration further adjustments of model parameters mainly those related to carbon dynamics improved model simulations the improvement in model accuracy after calibration demonstrates the importance of calibrating models with site specific parameters and gives weight to niu et al 2009 and xiong et al 2013 assertions that local scale data can improve the accuracy of simulations and significantly reduce model uncertainties the improvement in model accuracy on adjusting phu is similar to studies by xiong et al 2013 and angulo et al 2013 which showed that fine tuning phus to local conditions could significantly improve the accuracy of model simulations phus are linked to the growth of biomass and its allotment to final yield hence the considerable effect of phu adjustment on crop yields experiments conducted in the usa by williams et al 1989 demonstrated that the phus necessary for the maturity of maize range between 1000 and 2900 a maize planting guide written by the agricultural research council of south africa states that maize typically requires 120 days from planting to maturity however this value of 120 is commonly for the warmer traditional maize growing areas in south africa such as kwa zulu natal du plessis 2003 the cradock area is comparatively cooler than the traditional maize growing areas in south africa which may explain the long growing season in this study the value of hi used in the calibration and validation study by choruma is the same as the hi values used by balkovič et al 2013 and kiniry et al 1997 in the epic model the default value of the hi set to 0 5 which is typical for improved high yield maize varieties s gaiser et al 2010 such as those used in the field trial the biomass to energy ratio wa is a known parameter influencing crop yields wang et al 2005 during phu calibration an rmse of 1 17 mg ha 1 and pbias 0 31 between observed and simulated yields were observed suggesting that no additional modifications of wa and hi were needed as the conditions for satisfactory model performance had been reached the default value of 40 kg ha 1 mj 1 m2 was therefore adopted as the final calibration value this value of wa is the same as the value used by balkovič et al 2013 and wang et al 2011 williams et al 2015 explain that wa increases yield through biomass changes and should be adjusted as a final resort and based on experimental data since wa can significantly change the rate of crop growth and final crop yield the hi value of 0 5 used in this studies is close to values reported in studies in nine states in the usa kiniry et al 1997 and the value reported by wang et al 2005 in the calibration and validation study by choruma et al 2019 the model was inclined to overestimate yields when observed yields were low this overestimation of yields is similar to studies conducted by martin 1993 and warner et al 1997 that found that the epic model tended to overestimate low observed yields a study by kiniry et al 1995 showed that overestimation of plant available water at field capacity could cause epic to overestimate yields in dry years to overcome this challenge kiniry et al 1995 suggested measuring the maximum depth of water extraction using local cultivars however this solution was beyond the scope of the calibration and validation study agricultural management records used during the field trials show that in 2003 the field trials were affected by heavy weed outbreaks at the time of the calibration and validation study the epic model routines did not accurately account for competition from weeds ko et al 2009 competition from weeds was not considered in the calibration simulations not accounting for the influence of weeds competing with the crop may explain why the model overestimated the low yields observed in 2003 4 2 farmers survey farmers survey results showed that most farmers applied fertiliser in the form of ammonium nitrate which contains approximately 21 nitrogen by composition in this study farmers applied an average of 224 kg an which translates to about 52 kg n ha 1 this n fertiliser application level is similar to n fertiliser application levels found in surveys conducted by fanadzo et al 2010 who found that on average farmers in the zanyokwe irrigation scheme in the eastern cape applied approximately an average of 47 6 kg n ha 1 per maize growing season the average grain yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 achieved by farmers in the survey study is less than the potential yield of 9 12 mg ha 1 possible under irrigation in south africa du plessis and bruwer 2003 the lower n fertiliser application rates by farmers may explain the lower yields obtained by farmers compared to the field experiment simulations showed that between 0 and 150 kg n ha 1 maize yield increased linearly with additional fertiliser application to achieve higher yields farmers may increase current fertiliser application levels if irrigation water is available survey results also revealed that most farmers did not practice a balanced n fertiliser and irrigation water application most farmers did not know the total amount of irrigation water they applied per season and applied water based on farming experience or plant appearance the application of water and fertiliser based on plant appearance may lead to incorrect fertiliser and water application timing and lower yields several studies in south africa have identified poor agricultural land management practices as one of the primary reasons for low yields in south african irrigated farming systems bembridge 2000 fanadzo et al 2010 if significant efforts towards sustainable intensification through increased crop production are to be made it is crucial to optimise n fertiliser and irrigation water application to match crop requirements 4 3 model application the simulation yield of 0 8 mg ha 1 obtained in the scenarios where irrigation was 0 mm corresponding to rain fed conditions mg ha 1 is comparable to studies by ndhleve et al 2017 in the eastern cape who found average farm maize yields below 1 mg ha 1 for rain fed farming systems in the absence of irrigation increasing the amount of fertiliser or even under automatic fertilisation did not increase maize yields demonstrating that water availability is a significant constraint to increasing crop yield in semiarid conditions the results of this study are similar to field trials conducted by moeletsi et al 2009 who found water deficiency as the main limiting factor for dryland maize production in south africa low yields are usually typical of subsistence small scale farmers who are unable to purchase irrigation equipment the productivity of small scale farmers can be improved by encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable intensification of crop production by using improved agricultural land management strategies this will involve the sustainable use of fertilizer and water saving technologies as well as increasing small scale farmers access to markets so they can earn money to purchase improved farming equipment comparing scenarios 3 and 4 higher yields were achieved when irrigation water was automatic rather than when fertilizer was automatic this higher yield with automatic water supply suggests that the water supply may play a more significant role in limiting crop yields compared to the n fertilizer supply in this study the results of this study further support field studies by moeletsi et al 2009 who found that in semiarid environments typical of south africa the major limiting factor in maize production was the water supply given that agriculture already accounts for 60 of water withdrawals in south africa there is a need to develop innovative technologies that save water in agriculture without reducing crop yields and food security planning for a sustainable agricultural future remains critical given that south africa is already a water scarce country a situation which may get worse in the future due to the projected negative impacts of climate change on water resources in scenario 5 when the model was set to automatic irrigation and automatic fertiliser application the maximum yield simulated was 12 2 mg ha 1 which was achieved at approximately 200 kg n ha 1 and 580 mm irrigation water this yield value is within the range of potential maize yields attainable under irrigation in south africa du plessis and bruwer 2003 this finding supports the idea that the crop s response to n fertilizer and irrigation water is greater than the crop s response to each factor in isolation the relationship between grain yield and irrigation water showed a linear relationship that levelled off at higher irrigation water level payero et al 2006 found a linear relationship between grain yield and irrigation water amount in contrast similar studies such as those by bozkurt et al 2006 kipkorir et al 2002 and farré and faci 2009 have reported non linear relationships between grain yield and irrigation water however according to tolk and howell 2003 the relationship between maize yield and irrigation water applied is influenced by several factors such as climate soil and irrigation practices this variation in the relationship between yield and irrigation highlights the importance of investigating crop responses to irrigation under local growing conditions adopting irrigation and fertilizer management practices developed somewhere else might not bring about the desired yield increases and environmental goals the optimal seasonal irrigation water requirements of approximately 580 mm found in this study are similar to djaman et al 2018 who carried out a study of irrigated maize under semiarid conditions and found an average irrigation water requirement of 730 mm per maize growing season trout et al 2017 reported that irrigation water requirements for maize varied from 616 to 774 mm in semiarid environments in the great plains of the united states similarly the optimal fertilizer application level for maximum yield of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 found in this study corresponds to a level that is currently common in industrialised regions with high yields such as the united states of america and china fao et al 2005 studies by folberth et al 2012 have found fertilizer application levels in the range 150 kg n ha 1 to 200 kg n ha 1close to adequate n fertiliser supply in most parts of sub saharan africa comparison of farmers reported n fertiliser and irrigation water amounts with scenario 5 automatic irrigation and automatic fertilisation shows that to reach the maximum yield of 12 2 mg ha 1 achieved in scenario 5 farmers must increase both irrigation water supply and n fertiliser supply to reach 12 2 mg ha 1 farmers must increase n fertilizer application from 52 kg n ha 1 to 200 kg n ha 1 and the average irrigation from 500 mm to 582 mm this increase in n fertiliser and irrigation water supply would result in a yield increase of 69 from the farmers current average yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 a simple analysis shows that at the current cost of irrigation water of 2 36 cents per cubic meter c m3 department of water and sanitation 2019 the increase in the cost of irrigation water would be minimal given a rise of 82 mm in the water supply however the farmer would require four times more of the amount of n fertiliser at an average cost of r 5 85 per kilogram of ammonium nitrate daff 2019 this represents a percentage increase of 285 in fertiliser costs although income would also increase with economic yield the farmer would need to make trade offs after considering other production costs such as labour and transport to markets from fig 8 it can be deduced that at the current farmers level of n fertilizer application of 50 kg n ha 1 n leaching is approximately 10 kg n ha 1 in comparison at the application level of 200 kg n ha 1 in scenario 5 n leaching is approximately 50 kg n ha 1 this n leaching level in scenario 5 implies that if farmers increase the amount of n fertilizer applied grain yield will increase however the potential risk of nitrate leaching to water bodies will also increase this scenario presents a trade off between maximising yields versus environmental protection applying more n fertilizer to increase crop yields will lead to an increased risk of nitrate leaching reducing environmental water quality therefore the use of crop models can provide information that can help decision makers evaluate the economic and ecological consequences of agricultural land management practices and choose optimal strategies that promote sustainable agricultural intensification the relationships between irrigation amount and crop yield with wue showed a positive correlation between grain yield and wue up to a specific irrigation amount and then levelled off this relationship implies that increasing irrigation water but only up to a maximum level will increase grain yield beyond this maximum level additional water application will not result in further yield increases this knowledge of the relationship between maximum irrigation water amount and grain yield is helpful to farm managers when making water management decisions based on irrigation water availability the values of wue found in this study are similar to values found by guo et al 2010 in semi arid northern china that ranged from 11 to 20 kg ha 1 mm 1 given the increases in water scarcity and frequency of droughts in the eastern cape there would be significant consequences for local and regional water supply and demand if current rain fed agricultural systems in the region were to convert to irrigated agriculture for example the government would have to consider the implications of such a conversion on municipal and industrial water demand and supply in the eastern cape already irrigation water supply is under pressure from other competing water uses such as municipal and industrial water use it is unlikely that agriculture which already accounts for more than 60 of water withdrawals in south africa donnenfeld et al 2018 would be allocated more water over municipal water requirements therefore to increase crop yields agricultural systems in the eastern cape and south africa in general will be required to produce more crops with limited water resources this study s results suggest that farmers can significantly increase crop yields by improving n fertilizer and irrigation application timing without significantly increasing water user the simulations at the farm scale in this study show that the epic model has the potential to be used as a decision support tool for irrigation and fertilizer management of maize in the eastern cape the capability of the epic model to simulate different irrigation and fertilizer management strategies without carrying out extended and costly field experiments makes it a valuable research and application tool in irrigation and fertilizer management of maize however the use of the epic model as a decision support tool in the study region requires further calibration and validation of the model using a more comprehensive dataset across more soils and using a wider range of agricultural management practices in the region the results of the simulations must be taken in comparative and not absolute terms as the ultimate crop yield is the result of several complex interactions in the soil plant atmosphere these complex interactions can cause real world values to vary from model simulation values for example pests and diseases can have a significant adverse effect on crop yields if not managed well 5 study limitations the study assumed no deficiencies in other macronutrients except n however in reality this may not be the case with farmers individual soils and farmers would need to have their soils assessed for any other nutrient deficiencies due to limited resources and data it was also assumed that there were no deficiencies in soil micronutrients according to voortman et al 2003 most soils in sub saharan africa contain low amounts of micronutrients due to the chemical composition of the parent material and weathering over long periods while micronutrients are seldom a limiting factor under low input conditions they can be a significant limiting factor under high input intensive agriculture gaiser et al 1999 the automatic irrigation and fertilization options used in the model may lead to an overestimation of crop yields by assuming that local farmers have complete knowledge concerning irrigation water and fertilizer management irrigation and fertilizer timing can significantly affect crop yield and crop water productivity further detailed data on farmers irrigation water and fertilizer management practices would be required to determine optimum fertilizer and irrigation water application dates based on crop growth stages also in the automatic water supply scenarios the model assumed unlimited water supply but in practice the irrigation water supply may be restricted by water authorities and water availability further research would also need to consider the potential crop yield implications due to seasonal restrictions in water abstraction for irrigation and priorities for maize against other crops such as vegetables despite these limitations this study provides a useful assessment of the potential of the epic model as a decision support tool when considering the effect of different fertilizer and irrigation management strategies on crop yield and environmental objectives 6 conclusion a calibrated and validated epic crop growth model was used to simulate the effects of different combinations of irrigation water and n fertilizer levels on maize yield simulated maize yields were compared to maize yields from a field trial and from local farmers reported maize yields it can be concluded that the optimal irrigation water and n fertilizer management practices for irrigated maize production in the cradock area are to irrigate the maize crop with approximately 580 mm water and to fertilise the soil at a rate of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 implementation of this irrigation water and n fertilizer management strategy would increase maize yields by 69 from the current farmers average maize yield of approximately 7 2 mg ha 1 to approximately 12 2 mg ha 1 at the same time farmers irrigation water use would increase by 16 from an average of 500 mm to approximately 582 mm however an amount of 35 kg n ha 1 could potentially be lost through leaching trade offs between increasing maize yields and minimising nitrate leaching would have to be reached to balance between environmental concerns and economic concerns there is room to improve farmers current maize yields by simultaneously improving n fertilizer and irrigation water management the study highlights the usefulness of crop models in combination with knowledge of farmers agricultural land management practices to develop practical irrigation and fertilizer management strategies that help achieve sustainable agricultural intensification and are likely to be adopted by local farmers funding this research was funded by the dfg the german research foundation under germany s excellence strategy funding number exc2052 1

results showed that the mean yield of maize in 2030 under the rcp8 5 scenario will increase by 57 water footprint wf firstly introduced by hoekstra 2003 which is one of the newest indicators in the discussion of sustainable water resources management wf analyzes the relationship between human consumption of fresh water and the use of water in the manufacture of a particular type of product hoekstra et al 2011 wf has three components the blue water footprint is water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another or returned at a different time irrigated agriculture industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint the green water footprint refers to the volume of rainwater consumed in a production process this is particularly relevant in agriculture and forestry where it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration from fields and plantations plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop or wood hoekstra et al 2009 defined the gray wf in the production of a product as the volume of fresh water required to dilute the pollutants produced in the production process of that product many researchers have studied wf for various products such as wheat hoekstra and chapagain 2007 tea jefferies et al 2012 rice chapagain

meters per ton p is the effective precipitation during the plant growth period in millimeters et is the evapotranspiration of each plant during the growth period in millimeters and y is the yield of each crop in terms of tons per hectare 2 6 statistical evaluation criterions in this study the results of the scenarios with the data of qazvin plain for maize crop by error statistical criteria including determination coefficient r2 normal root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were compared explanation the coefficient is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the relationship between two variables x and y which is displayed dimensionless this coefficient is directly related to the correlation coefficient in this way by taking the square root of the r2 the correlation coefficient between the two series can be obtained as with the correlation coefficient the closer the value of the r2 is to one the stronger the relationship between the two variables if the determination coefficient is multiplied by 100 the value obtained represents the variance of the variable x described by the variable y the pearson coefficient classification is given in the table below joinior et al 2017 excel software was used to calculate the explanation coefficient the nrmse index indicates the level of estimation the nrmse classification by jamieson et al 1991 is given in table 2 jamieson et al 1991 9 nrmse 1 o i 1 n o i p i 2 n mean absolute error is the difference of the mean absolute value of the estimated amount of the model with to real quantity the less is its amount the more is the model s accuracy 10 mae i 1 n p i o i n o i and p i are observational and predicted amount o is the mean of the observational amounts and n is the number of data or time

discussion of sustainable water resources management wf analyzes the relationship between human consumption of fresh water and the use of water in the manufacture of a particular type of product hoekstra et al 2011 wf has three components the blue water footprint is water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another or returned at a different time irrigated agriculture industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint the green water footprint refers to the volume of rainwater consumed in a production process this is particularly relevant in agriculture and forestry where it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration from fields and plantations plus the water incorporated into the harvested crop or wood hoekstra et al 2009 defined the gray wf in the production of a product as the volume of fresh water required to dilute the pollutants produced in the production process of that product many researchers have studied wf for various products such as wheat hoekstra and chapagain 2007 tea jefferies et al 2012 rice chapagain

meters per ton p is the effective precipitation during the plant growth period in millimeters et is the evapotranspiration of each plant during the growth period in millimeters and y is the yield of each crop in terms of tons per hectare 2 6 statistical evaluation criterions in this study the results of the scenarios with the data of qazvin plain for maize crop by error statistical criteria including determination coefficient r2 normal root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were compared explanation the coefficient is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the relationship between two variables x and y which is displayed dimensionless this coefficient is directly related to the correlation coefficient in this way by taking the square root of the r2 the correlation coefficient between the two series can be obtained as with the correlation coefficient the closer the value of the r2 is to one the stronger the relationship between the two variables if the determination coefficient is multiplied by 100 the value obtained represents the variance of the variable x described by the variable y the pearson coefficient classification is given in the table below joinior et al 2017 excel software was used to calculate the explanation coefficient the nrmse index indicates the level of estimation the nrmse classification by jamieson et al 1991 is given in table 2 jamieson et al 1991 9 nrmse 1 o i 1 n o i p i 2 n mean absolute error is the difference of the mean absolute value of the estimated amount of the model with to real quantity the less is its

model showed that the simulated data and the qazvin plain data have a high correlation fig 2 an explanation coefficient greater than 90 indicates that more than 90 of the variance in the tmin and tmax data of the qazvin plain is described by the lars wg model data the nrmse value is in the good category at the tmax and in the medium category at the tmin the value of the mae index was obtained for a tmin of 1 26 c and for a tmax of 1 75 c the coefficient of explanation for the precipitation p simulated with the lars wg model showed that the simulated data and the data of the qazvin plain are not highly correlated and the coefficient of explanation decreases to less than 0 5 fig 2 the nrmse value for p was in the weak category and the mae index value was 21 75 mm the results showed that the model is more accurate in simulating minimum and maximum temperatures than precipitation goudarzi et al 2015 investigated the performance of lars wg and sdsm microscopic exponential models in

the share of blue water footprint is 93 23 the high share of traces of irrigated water compared to green water indicates a low rainfall rate and indicates the stability of arid and semi arid climate in terms of agriculture aligholinia et al 2019 aligholinia et al 2016 estimated and evaluated water and green water footprints in the urmia watershed in their study the water footprint of 5 major crops including wheat sugar beet tomato alfalfa and maize were examined and the results showed that the share of green water footprint and blue water are 25 and 75 respectively and the share of water

2013 examined the effect of climate change scenarios on crop yield and wf of maize in the po valley of italy their results showed under the worst more likely future scenarios of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation crop yield decreased and water footprint especially blue increased due to increased evapotranspiration higher irrigation demand and lower final yield which is consistent with the results of the present study 4 conclusion agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in which climate change can have a major impact and affect crop yields because agricultural activities ensure food supply it is important to study the effects of climate change as it can provide the right planning and strategies for adapting to future climate change georgopoulou et al 2017 so in this study precipitation p and minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax of qazvin plain and simulated and evaluated with lars wg model in the baseline 1986 2015 the results showed that the coefficients of explanation for the tmin and tmax simulated with the lars wg model and the qazvin pain data were highly correlated the nrmse value is in the good category at the tmax and in the medium category at the tmin the results showed that the explanation coefficient for the simulated p with lars wg model and qazvin plain data are not highly correlated and the explanation coefficient decreases to less than 0 5 in general the model results in simulating tmin and tmax are more accurate than p to predict tmin tmax and p in future periods 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 2081

scenario and in 2081 2100 period in ec earth model under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the miroc5 model decreases under the rcp8 5 scenario also in this study the wf green and blue of maize under climate change in future periods was evaluated the results showed that wf will increase in future periods in general it can be said that due to climate change and increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation in future periods we will have a decrease in maize yield and increased evapotranspiration in qazvin plain the results of the present study on the effect of future climate change on y and et of maize in the qazvin plain can be a useful tool for managers experts planners and policy makers in the water sector to properly and sustainable management of water resources and agricultural

10037,livestock is an integral part of the agricultural system in sub saharan africa serving as a food source income fertilizer and power for farming and transportation however the productivity of the livestock system has been hampered due to a lack of sufficient quantity and quality feed this study evaluates the gaps and constraints of fodder and nutritional potential for livestock feed using small scale irrigation ssi the study comprised of 30 randomly selected farmers from two different ecological zones in ethiopia half of the farmers cultivated napier grass pennisetum purpureum in the robit watershed in northern ethiopia and the other half cultivated mixed vetch lathyrus cicera and oats avena sativa in lemo watershed in southern ethiopia the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex were applied in an integrated manner to assess the impacts of ssi at the watershed and field scale levels respectively the watershed scale analysis showed that there is a substantial amount of surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge that could be used for dry season fodder production using irrigation field data calibrated apex model indicated that napier yield could be maximized with 550 mm of water in robit watershed while in the lemo watershed maximum vetch and oats yield may be achieved with 250 mm of water the major constraints for napier and oats production in the study sites were soil fertility especially nitrogen and phosphorus and vetch production was limited by high temperature fodder samples were collected at the time of harvest to evaluate feed quality the nutritional analysis indicated that napier grass has a higher dry matter and ash mineral content compared to oats and vetch however vetch has higher crude protein content 18 compared to napier 10 and oats 6 overall the study indicated that cultivating vetch provided superior performance in terms of providing quality feed and environmental services

in ethiopia contributing more than a quarter of the country s gross domestic product and export earnings yami and sileshi 2001 while employing more than 80 of the workforce in ethiopia diao et al 2010 chauvin et al 2012 the agricultural practice is primarily a subsistence rain fed system however frequent rainfall variability affects crop yields and thereby puts pressure on the agriculture led economy the agricultural sector is also heavily integrated with the livestock production system which serves as a source of food fertilizer cash income and farm power for plowing and transportation the livestock systems account for about 40 of the agricultural gdp and over 67 of the agricultural labor force declaration 1996 asresie and zemedu 2015 livestock also serves as insurance in times of crop failure due to drought or dry spells thornton et al 2003 ethiopia has the largest livestock population in africa estimated at 60 million heads of cattle 61 million small ruminants 10 7 million equines 1 2 million camels 59 5 million poultry and 6 2 million beehives csa 2017 some farmers living in areas that have a high potential for livestock production started cultivating improved pasture and forage to feed their livestock through a cut and carry system and sell in the local market in the form of green fodder and or hay however the productivity of the livestock sector overall has been constrained by availability quality and seasonality of feed as well as lack of access to veterinary services ahmed et al 2016 tonamo 2016 the major sources of livestock feed in ethiopia are open grazing on pasture land crop residue left over after harvest and weeds from arable land mengistu 2006 birhan and adugna 2014 open grazing from pasture land contributes the largest share mengistu 2004 amede et al 2005 tegegne et al 2011 malede and takele 2014 the open pasture is often exhaustively grazed and therefore stored crop biomass is consumed before the rainfall season starts it is a common phenomenon for feed shortage to occur during the dry season posing a major challenge for overall feed quality and quantity yami et al 2013 dejene et al 2014 different species of forage grasses legumes and trees are used as feeds for livestock in tropical and subtropical regions in ethiopia napier grass pennisetum purpureum vetch vicia villosa oats avena sativa alfalfa medicago sativa and desho grass pennisetum glaucifolium are some of the most widely used fodder crops used for livestock feed due to their high yield and easy management orodho 2006 getu 2015 besides cattle feed these fodder crops are widely used for soil and water conservation fuelwood supply and input to biogas production orodho 2006 sawasdee and pisutpaisal 2014 asudi et al 2015 fodder crops also serve for soil and water management by covering the soil they reduce evaporation and soil erosion serving as a cover crop in steep slope areas and enhance soil fertility through their ability to fix nitrogen and contribution to organic matter assefa et al 2018 belay et al 2019 availability of quality feed determines the animal s ability to produce optimally within their genetic limits coleman and moore 2003 a assessment of the nutritional quality of available fodder can help to identify potential livestock nutritional deficits that must be addressed to provide a balanced diet that helps to maintain a healthy livestock production system fodder quality can be assessed using fodder dry matter crude proteins and minerals as indicators moreira 1989 lounglawan et al 2014 however there are limited studies in ethiopia that identify and review environmental factors that limit the ability to produce optimal feed and access the nutritional quality of different fodder crops therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the potentials and constraints of growing napier and mixed cropping of vetch and oats using small scale irrigation ssi to produce sufficiently nutritious feed to improve the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers the study used data collected from 30 randomly selected farmers in two watersheds located in different agro ecological zones in ethiopia the study watersheds robit and lemo are located in the amhara region and southern nations and nationalities people region snnpr respectively fifteen farmers in the robit watershed cultivated napier the remaining fifteen farmers in the lemo watershed cultivated mixed oats and vetch the study integrated the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex models which are part of the integrated decision support system idss clarke et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 to evaluate the gaps and constraints of fodder production in ethiopia swat is a physically based model developed to assess the impact of land and water management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields e g fertilizer and pesticides in large complex watersheds with varying soils land uses and management conditions over long periods swat arnold et al 1994 likewise apex is also a physically based model which is used to evaluate detailed crop management technologies and decisions that can affect agricultural production and environmental sustainability at the scales of individual fields whole farms or small watersheds apex williams et al 1998 the swat model was used to estimate the potential water resource at the watershed scale while the apex model was used to identify optimal irrigation management practices and environmental sustainability at the field level the feed quality of the fodder produced was evaluated using established quality matrices williams 1984 aoac 1990 2 methodology 2 1 study watersheds robit watershed is located in the amhara region between 11 37 00 n 37

meat milk and manure some of the livestock provide labor for plowing and transportation 2 2 experiment design the field data were collected from 30 randomly selected experimental sites the experimental sites were selected randomly and on average they are 2 km and 3 km apart in robit and lemo watersheds respectively the data collected included planting dates irrigation and fertilizer application dates and amounts soil moisture content crop height and yields soil samples were collected for two layers of the top 60 cm which were analyzed to determine soil physical and chemical properties such as texture field capacity available organic matter ph total nitrogen available phosphorus and electric conductivity napier biomass was harvested two times throughout the growing period the first harvest was 110 days from the planting and the second harvest was after 30 days from the first harvest followed by a permanent killing to prepare the land for rainfed maize production the fodder height was measured throughout the growing period such as at the initial crop development and maturity growth stages 2 2 1 robit napier sites napier grass is a tall perennial grass that grows at an altitude ranging from 1500 to 2500 m ecocrop 2000 well managed napier grass produces a substantial amount of good quality feed and feedstock for biogas production sawasdee and pisutpaisal 2014 although napier grass thrives in high rainfall areas it is also considered a drought tolerant crop orodho 2006 mwendia et al 2017 the optimal temperature for napier grass growth ranges between 21 and 40 c ecocrop 2000 the field data were collected from 15 farmsteads cultivating napier grass using irrigation during the dry season march to july the source of water for irrigation was shallow groundwater from wells having depths between 6 5 and 17 2 m the farming plots size ranges from 50 to 140 m2 of the 15 sites only data from six sites were used for this study the data quality from nine sites were found poor to use for the analysis since the grass in the plots was lost after planting due to lack of proper management and or grazing by animals table 1 shows a summary of the management practices in the six selected napier sites 2 2 2 lemo vetch and oats sites commonly oats and vetch are cultivated together to increase feed value and enhance soil fertility assefa and ledin 2001

to june the area receives rainfall for more than ten days and from july to september the rainy days exceed 15 days the total rainfall amount during the vetch and oats growing period was 320 mm with a standard deviation of 90 mm although the rainfall amount in both sites had a significant contribution to the total fodder crop water requirement in the dry season it was not sufficient to meet the total crop water requirement for optimal fodder production which indicated a need for supplemental irrigation 2 4 modeling approaches the study used the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex models to assess the gaps and constraints of fodder production the swat model is a basin scale distributed hydrological model in swat a watershed is divided into multiple sub watersheds which may have multiple hydrologic response units hrus hrus are unique combinations of land use soil and slope most of the biophysical processes such as soil water content surface runoff sediment yield and crop growth are simulated at the hru level and then aggregated to each subbasin the apex model is a field or small watershed scale model in which a sub watershed is assumed to have a single hru called subarea the model can simulate detailed field conditions including crop management and growth nutrient and pesticide fate hydrology soil temperature erosion sedimentation and costs and returns of the various management practices saleh and gallego 2007 wang et al 2011 although swat and apex models operate at a different spatial scale and apply for different applications they share several attributes for example they both require similar input data and most of their biophysical equations are similar arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 1998 williams et al 1998 spatial data used by both models include dem soil and land use the dem was used to characterize the watershed physical characteristics such as slope subbasin subarea areas longest flow path length etc for the swat model land use and soil data were collected from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy emwie the soil data contains the physical and chemical properties of the soils in the watersheds since the apex model was set up at the field level soil and land use information were collected at the field sites 2 4 1 model calibrations and evaluations streamflow calibration parameters for both swat and apex were identified from the literature bitew and gebremichael 2010 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 worqlul et al 2019 table 2 presents the list of parameters selected and their respective parameter space the swat model parameters were calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in the swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup tool abbaspour et al 2007 the model calibration period was from1995 to 2010 for gumara and 2000 to 2010 for bidru awana watersheds and the model was validated for the period 2011 2016 and 2010 2015 respectively the calibration of the apex model was conducted using apex cute auto calibration and uncertainty estimator wang et al 2014 the fodder yield calibration was based on one year multiple site field observations observed napier yield was available for 2015 and vetch and oats yield were available for 2016 because of observed streamflow data limitation the swat model in both watersheds was calibrated and validated using data from nearby watersheds robit watershed had daily streamflow observation since june 22 2015 while there was no streamflow observation for the lemo watershed the selected nearby gauged watersheds have similar watershed characteristics as the study watersheds which enabled reasonable model parameter transfers kokkonen et al 2003 booij et al 2007 wale et al 2009 the watersheds selected to represent the robit and lemo watersheds were the gumera and bidru awana watersheds respectively the transferred parameters for the robit watershed were further fine tuned using the available observed streamflow data at its outlet the swat model thereafter was used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of available surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge across the watersheds the apex model was set up for the field plots where there were land management and fodder yield data for model setup and calibration the apex model crop parameters were calibrated to capture the observed fodder height and yield after calibrating the model for observed crop yield and height the model was used to understand the constraints and gaps of fodder production in the watersheds the calibrated model was also used to estimate the water and fertilizer production of the study fodder crops fodder yield samples were collected from the fields for fodder nutritional quality analysis a total of 70 samples of napier and 22 samples for oat and vetch were collected for nutritional quality analysis the nutrient indicators analyzed included percent of dry matter ash organic matter nitrogen crude protein natural detergent fiber acid detergent fiber acid detergent lignin percent on dry matter and metabolizable energy the performance of the daily simulated streamflow soil loss crop height and yield were evaluated using multiple statistics such as coefficient of determination r squared root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and nash sutcliff efficiency nse generally r squared values can range between zero and one where zero indicates no correlation and one represents perfect association between simulated and observed variables rmse refers to the standard deviation of the prediction error pbias calculates the relative volume difference between simulated and observed volume a negative value indicates over prediction and a positive value indicates under prediction of simulation nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed variable variance nse values can range between negative infinite and one an nse value of one indicates a perfect fit between the simulated and observed variable and negative nse values mean that use of an average of observed variable is better than the simulated variable according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is assumed very good if r square is 0 5 nse is 0 75 and pbias is 10 2 4 2 water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops the calibrated apex model was used to study the water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops in both sites water use efficiency was determined by simulating the model multiple times by varying irrigation amounts at two day irrigation intervals paired with sufficient nutrients this approach helps to disentangle the impacts of different irrigation amount levels on crop yield while avoiding other limiting conditions like nutrient stress the nutrient limitation was avoided by automatically applying dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer for vetch and oats and a combination of urea and dap fertilizers for napier urea fertilizer consists mainly of nitrogen with n p k nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio of 46 0 0 while the dap fertilizer is a source of p and n with n p k ratio of 18 46 0 the scenarios of water productivity analysis were achieved by applying water between 100 and 850 mm over the growing period the amount of water per irrigation event was calculated based on the number of growing days from planting to harvest and irrigation intervals for example napier grass was set at a two day irrigation interval with a per event irrigation amount of 4 1 mm for a total of 250 mm irrigation for a growing period of 122 days 2 4 3 fodder nutritional quality analysis the nutritional quality of collected fodder samples was analyzed at the animal nutrition laboratory of the international livestock research institute ilri in addis ababa ethiopia the samples were dried at 65 c for 48 h in a forced draft oven and then ground to pass through 1 mm mesh sieve near infrared reflectance spectroscopy nirs prediction was employed for the analysis using equations calibrated and validated for each fodder type with data obtained from standard wet chemistry analysis williams 1984 aoac 1990 the nirs instrument used was a foss forage analyzer 5000 with software package winisi ii analyzed quality variables were dry matter ash crude protein cp neutral detergent fiber ndf acid detergent fiber adf acid detergent lignin adl and in vitro organic matter digestibility ivomd and metabolizable energy me 3 results and discussion 3 1 water resources potential of robit and lemo watersheds the performance of the swat models for the gumara and bidru awana watersheds were acceptable with nse of 0 83 and 0 60 and pbias of 5 4 and 8 5 during the calibration period respectively the models performance was also validated with an independent period of data and provided nse of 0 84 and 0 55 and pbias of 15 3 and 10 6 for gumara and awana watersheds the swat calibrated parameters with gumera and bidru awana watersheds were used to estimate the surface and groundwater recharge at robit and lemo watersheds respectively which is presented in fig 3 the average annual surface runoff of robit watershed was between 440 and 535 mm and the average annual groundwater ranges between 250 and 320 mm fig 3a and b while in the lemo watershed the average annual surface runoff ranged between 115 and 370 mm fig 3c and the average annual groundwater recharge varied between 80 and 400 mm fig 3d the analysis showed that when the available water resources are used for ssi in combination with the rainfall in the dry season both watersheds can produce sufficient amount of fodder 3 2 apex fodder yield simulation and yield limiting factors 3 2 1 napier yield simulation and yield limiting factors the field data indicated a strong linear relationship between napier yield and the amount of water applied the water applied captured 77 of the yield variability r square 0 77 while the fertilizer applied urea captured 66 of the yield variability the apex model was set up and calibrated at six napier sites using the observed fodder yield data the model simulated well the observed fodder yield with 0 86 coeffficient of determination and 0 6 t ha root mean square error fig 4 the performance of the apex model simulated crop height was also validated using the observed fodder height fig 5 the simulated fodder height captured the observed average fodder height reasonably well with r square of 0 95 fig 5 showed that the observed fodder height in dots and the daily simulated daily napier height line graphs showing the model performed well in capturing the observed fodder height the calibrated apex model was further used to understand the major yield limiting factors fig 6 presents the major yield limiting factors in the six simulated sites the simulation results indicated that nitrogen and phosphorus were the major yield limiting factors followed by water and temperature stress due to its fast growth and higher yield napier requires a regular application of nutrients n and p recommend annual nitrogen and phosphorous application rates vary from 200 to 460 kg ha and 50 to 100 kg ha respectively it varies based on soil type and fertility orodho 2006 pontes et al 2016 yang et al 2016 in the robit site napier was cultivated with nitrogen fertilizer application rates of between 92 and 184 kg ha and without phosphorus based on local recommendations this caused napier yield limitation due to nitrogen and phosphorous absence by an average of 23 and 15 stress days respectively fig 5 actual daily growth of plant in the apex model is constrained by nutrient water and temperature stresses the number of stress days were estimated counting the number fraction of days in which the available soil nutrients water and or temperature was outside the demand for optimal crop growth for example the number of nitrogen stress days is counted as 0 1 days if the available root zone soil nitrogen meets 90 of the crop nitrogen requirement for optimal growth 3 2 2 oats and vetch simulation and yield limiting factors the amount of water applied throughout the growing season of oats and vetch as a mixed crop varies between 100 and 140 mm the calibrated apex model based on the six selected sites captured the observed yield very well with an average difference of 13 for oats and 6 for vetch fig 7 the model performance was also validated using the observed fodder height the result indicated an acceptable performance with an r square of 0 89 fig 8 presented the number of stress days that the yield of both oats and vetch was limited by water nitrogen phosphorus and temperature the result showed that oats yield was limited by nitrogen and water while vetch yield was limited by water and temperature simulations showed that oats and vetch yield can be optimized by adding more nitrogen fertilizer and water as well as by increasing the vetch proportion in the planting mix increasing the vetch proportion contributed to soil fertility since it has the ability to fix nitrogen this assertion was in fact validated using the calibrated apex model the model was applied to simulate oat yield as a single crop to understand the effect of vetch on the cropping mix the singly cultivated oat was simulated with a similar amount of fertilizer and irrigation amounts as the mixed cropped oats and vetch simulation the result showed a significant oat yield reduction when planted as a single crop compared to the mixed cultivation the reduction in yield ranged from 17 to 43 depending on the site the reduction in yield was mainly related to nitrogen stress the vetch increased the soil nitrogen by symbiotically fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nitrogen fixing bacteria the simulation indicated that vetch can contribute soil nitrogen up to 30 kg ha some studies reported that vetch can contribute more than 100 kg of nitrogen per hectare in a single growing period ku et al 2018 3 3 water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops the calibrated apex model was further used to estimate the water use efficiency of napier and oats and vetch mix since the study focused on assessing the optimal water use efficiency level the model was supplied unlimited urea and dap fertilizer rates to meet crop nitrogen and phosphorus requirement 3 3 1 water and fertilizer use efficiency of napier the simulated napier yield and average number of water stress days over 21 years are shown in fig 9 the result showed that when 100 mm of water was applied the fertilizer uptake of napier grass was very low and yield was limited by water stress for 100 mm of water application the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous uptake was 81 kg ha and 21 kg ha respectively as the amount of water applied increases the water stress level reduced and the fertilizer requirement increased due to an increase in plant nutrient uptake and nutrient losses through surface runoff and deep percolation maximum napier yield was obtained when 550 mm of water and 145 kg ha of nitrogen and 25 kg ha phosphorus were applied after that any increase in the amount of irrigation and fertilizer did not improve the yield the nitrogen components i e plant nitrogen uptake kg ha soluble nitrogen lost in surface runoff kg ha leached nitrogen and nitrogen loss in the form of volatilization and denitrification kg ha for the different amount of irrigation application were estimated and presented in fig 10 the nitrogen uptake of napier grass increased until 550 mm of irrigation and thereafter it did not change significantly however as the amount of water applied increases the nitrogen loss through percolation increased significantly while a minor increase was observed in volatilization and denitrification fig 9 the simulation indicated very little phosphorous loss in the soil since phosphorous is less soluble compared to nitrogen however over application of phosphorous could lead to a build up of phosphorus in the soil 3 3 2 water and fertilizer use efficiency of vetch and oats similar to the simulations for napier in the robit watershed simulations for the vetch and oats showed that nutrient uptake increased with increased irrigation up to a limited extent the result indicated that when 100 mm of water is applied the fertilizer requirement of vetch and oats was very low and the yield was limited by water for 100 mm of irrigation the phosphorous uptake was 52 kg ha as the amount of irrigation applied increases to 250 mm and above the water stress reduced significantly and the fertilizer requirement did not change much maximum simulated vetch and oats yield was obtained at 250 mm of irrigation and phosphorus uptake was 52 kg ha fig 11 irrigation beyond 250 mm did not significantly increase the phosphorus uptake as well as the yield fig 10 presents the simulated vetch and oats yield and the number of water stress days for six scenarios of irrigation over a simulation period of 21 years 1995 2015 3 4 nutritional value of napier vetch and oats the feed nutrition analysis indicated that dm fraction of dry and fresh weight content of napier was slightly higher than vetch and oats fig 12 napier dm is approximately 2 higher than oats and vetch however there was no significant difference in dm between vetch and oats dm of the feed contains energy protein fiber vitamins and minerals the analysis also indicated a higher proportion of ash mineral in napier 13 followed by vetch and oats 11 and 5 respectively these results were similar to those previously reported by galyean 1989 vetch has the highest crude protein content 18 compared to napier 10 and oats 6 cp is considered as a good determinant of feed quality the detergent fiber component ndf adf and adl estimated for the fodder crops is shown in fig 12 ndf is a good measure of feed quality and plant maturity higher ndf in the feed decreases intake and increases chewing activity the ndf content was higher in oats and napier compared to vetch fig 13 which is consistent with the findings of fulkerson et al 2007 and ergon et al 2016 the average adf lignin and cellulose component was lower in vetch at 39 compared to napier 46 and oats 47 adf is a subset of the ndf which contains the poorly digestible insoluble in a weak acid cell wall components lignin and cellulose van saun 2006 the adl component between the three fodders was similar at 5 fig 13 vetch contained 11 mj kg dm metabolizable energy a higher energy content than oats and napier which is at 7 and 8 mj kg respectively overall the feed quality analysis indicated a superior performance of vetch in terms of digestibility and feed quality 4 conclusion integrating field data with two biophysical models apex and swat this study explored the opportunities gaps and constraints of fodder production in two different agro ecological zones in ethiopia the study also examined the nutrition components of the cultivated fodder to identify fodder types that provides balanced diet to livestock the findings showed that there is a substantial amount of water resources in both watersheds to produce fodder production using small scale irrigation the modeling results showed that the average optimal amount of water required to cultivate napier and a mix of oats and vetches is 550 and 250 mm respectively the application of irrigation beyond the optimal amount for the respective fodder crops increased surface runoff and percolation that cause nutrient losses moreover the study indicated that poor soil fertility limited optimal fodder production in both watersheds for example phosphorous was one of the major yield limiting factors for vetch production although nitrogen was not a limiting factor as vetch is a legume crop the fodder nutrition assessment indicated that napier has a higher dry matter content compared to oats and vetch napier also has a higher mineral content while vetch contains the most crude protein and energy content overall vetch provides a superior nutrition performance as a livestock feed besides providing high biomass dry matter content crude protein and energy for livestock fodder crops such as vetch provided other environmental services for example vetch crop can symbiotically fix atmospheric n through nitrogen fixing bacteria and thereby improve soil fertility this study concludes that fodder production using small scale irrigation can help to produce high quality fodder like vetch that could improve ethiopia s livestock sector and its contribution to the country s economy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10037,livestock is an integral part of the agricultural system in sub saharan africa serving as a food source income fertilizer and power for farming and transportation however the productivity of the livestock system has been hampered due to a lack of sufficient quantity and quality feed this study evaluates the gaps and constraints of fodder and nutritional potential for livestock feed using small scale irrigation ssi the study comprised of 30 randomly selected farmers from two different ecological zones in ethiopia half of the farmers cultivated napier grass pennisetum purpureum in the robit watershed in northern ethiopia and the other half cultivated mixed vetch lathyrus cicera and oats avena sativa in lemo watershed in southern ethiopia the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex were applied in an integrated manner to assess the impacts of ssi at the watershed and field scale levels respectively the watershed scale analysis showed that there is a substantial amount of surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge that could be used for dry season fodder production using irrigation field data calibrated apex model indicated that napier yield could be maximized with 550 mm of water in robit watershed while in the lemo watershed maximum vetch and oats yield may be achieved with 250 mm of water the major constraints for napier and oats production in the study sites were soil fertility especially nitrogen and phosphorus and vetch production was limited by high temperature fodder samples were collected at the time of harvest to evaluate feed quality the nutritional analysis indicated that napier grass has a higher dry matter and ash mineral content compared to oats and vetch however vetch has higher crude protein content 18 compared to napier 10 and oats 6 overall the study indicated that cultivating vetch provided superior performance in terms of providing quality feed and environmental services

in ethiopia contributing more than a quarter of the country s gross domestic product and export earnings yami and sileshi 2001 while employing more than 80 of the workforce in ethiopia diao et al 2010 chauvin et al 2012 the agricultural practice is primarily a subsistence rain fed system however frequent rainfall variability affects crop yields and thereby puts pressure on the agriculture led economy the agricultural sector is also heavily integrated with the livestock production system which serves as a source of food fertilizer cash income and farm power for plowing and transportation the livestock systems account for about 40 of the agricultural gdp and over 67 of the agricultural labor force declaration 1996 asresie and zemedu 2015 livestock also serves as insurance in times of crop failure due to drought or dry spells thornton et al 2003 ethiopia has the largest livestock population in africa estimated at 60 million heads of cattle 61 million small ruminants 10 7 million equines 1 2 million camels 59 5 million poultry and 6 2 million beehives csa 2017 some farmers living in areas that have a high potential for livestock production started cultivating improved pasture and forage to feed their livestock through a cut and carry system and sell in the local market in the form of green fodder and or hay however the productivity of the livestock sector overall has been constrained by availability quality and seasonality of feed as well as lack of access to veterinary services ahmed et al 2016 tonamo 2016 the major sources of livestock feed in ethiopia are open grazing on pasture land crop residue left over after harvest and weeds from arable land mengistu 2006 birhan and adugna 2014 open grazing from pasture land contributes the largest share mengistu 2004 amede et al 2005 tegegne et al 2011 malede and takele 2014 the open pasture is often exhaustively grazed and therefore stored crop biomass is consumed before the rainfall season starts it is a common phenomenon for feed shortage to occur during the dry season posing a major challenge for overall feed quality and quantity yami et al 2013 dejene et al 2014 different species of forage grasses legumes and trees are used as feeds for livestock in tropical and subtropical regions in ethiopia napier grass pennisetum purpureum vetch vicia villosa oats avena sativa alfalfa medicago sativa and desho grass pennisetum glaucifolium are some of the most widely used fodder crops used for livestock feed due to their high yield and easy management orodho 2006 getu 2015 besides cattle feed these fodder crops are widely used for soil and water conservation fuelwood supply and input to biogas production orodho 2006 sawasdee and pisutpaisal 2014 asudi et al 2015 fodder crops also serve for soil and water management by covering the soil they reduce evaporation and soil erosion serving as a cover crop in steep slope areas and enhance soil fertility through their ability to fix nitrogen and contribution to organic matter assefa et al 2018 belay et al 2019 availability of quality feed determines the animal s ability to produce optimally within their genetic limits coleman and moore 2003 a assessment of the nutritional quality of available fodder can help to identify potential livestock nutritional deficits that must be addressed to provide a balanced diet that helps to maintain a healthy livestock production system fodder quality can be assessed using fodder dry matter crude proteins and minerals as indicators moreira 1989 lounglawan et al 2014 however there are limited studies in ethiopia that identify and review environmental factors that limit the ability to produce optimal feed and access the nutritional quality of different fodder crops therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the potentials and constraints of growing napier and mixed cropping of vetch and oats using small scale irrigation ssi to produce sufficiently nutritious feed to improve the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers the study used data collected from 30 randomly selected farmers in two watersheds located in different agro ecological zones in ethiopia the study watersheds robit and lemo are located in the amhara region and southern nations and nationalities people region snnpr respectively fifteen farmers in the robit watershed cultivated napier the remaining fifteen farmers in the lemo watershed cultivated mixed oats and vetch the study integrated the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex models which are part of the integrated decision support system idss clarke et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 to evaluate the gaps and constraints of fodder production in ethiopia swat is a physically based model developed to assess the impact of land and water management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields e g fertilizer and pesticides in large complex watersheds with varying soils land uses and management conditions over long periods swat arnold et al 1994 likewise apex is also a physically based model which is used to evaluate detailed crop management technologies and decisions that can affect agricultural production and environmental sustainability at the scales of individual fields whole farms or small watersheds apex williams et al 1998 the swat model was used to estimate the potential water resource at the watershed scale while the apex model was used to identify optimal irrigation management practices and environmental sustainability at the field level the feed quality of the fodder produced was evaluated using established quality matrices williams 1984 aoac 1990 2 methodology 2 1 study watersheds robit watershed is located in the amhara region between 11 37 00 n 37 26 00 e and 11 42 00 n 37 31 00 e lemo watershed is located in the southern nations nationalities and people s region snnpr between 7 20 56 40 n 37 37 44 39 e and 7 46 33 59 n 37 53 45 60 e fig 1 the catchment area for the robit and lemo watersheds are approximately 15 km2 and 482 km2 respectively the elevation at robit watershed varies between 1795 m and 2045 m while the elevation of lemo watershed ranges between 1821 m and 2815 m the major types of livestock raised in these watersheds and the surrounding area are cattle goats sheep donkeys and mules the main livestock outputs include meat milk and manure some of the livestock provide labor for plowing and transportation 2 2 experiment design the field data were collected from 30 randomly selected experimental sites the experimental sites were selected randomly and on average they are 2 km and 3 km apart in robit and lemo watersheds respectively the data collected included planting dates irrigation and fertilizer application dates and amounts soil moisture content crop height and yields soil samples were collected for two layers of the top 60 cm which were analyzed to determine soil physical and chemical properties such as texture field capacity available organic matter ph total nitrogen available phosphorus and electric conductivity napier biomass was harvested two times throughout the growing period the first harvest was 110 days from the planting and the second harvest was after 30 days from the first harvest followed by a permanent killing to prepare the land for rainfed maize production the fodder height was measured throughout the growing period such as at the initial crop development and maturity growth stages 2 2 1 robit napier sites napier grass is a tall perennial grass that grows at an altitude ranging from 1500 to 2500 m ecocrop 2000 well managed napier grass produces a substantial amount of good quality feed and feedstock for biogas production sawasdee and pisutpaisal 2014 although napier grass thrives in high rainfall areas it is also considered a drought tolerant crop orodho 2006 mwendia et al 2017 the optimal temperature for napier grass growth ranges between 21 and 40 c ecocrop 2000 the field data were collected from 15 farmsteads cultivating napier grass using irrigation during the dry season march to july the source of water for irrigation was shallow groundwater from wells having depths between 6 5 and 17 2 m the farming plots size ranges from 50 to 140 m2 of the 15 sites only data from six sites were used for this study the data quality from nine sites were found poor to use for the analysis since the grass in the plots was lost after planting due to lack of proper management and or grazing by animals table 1 shows a summary of the management practices in the six selected napier sites 2 2 2 lemo vetch and oats sites commonly oats and vetch are cultivated together to increase feed value and enhance soil fertility assefa and ledin 2001 lithourgidis et al 2006 oat is a cereal crop that can be cultivated for grain and forage stevens et al 2004 the optimal temperature for oat ranges from 16 to 20 c ecocrop 2000 vetch is an annual legume cover crop used for haymaking the optimal growing temperature ranges from 11 to 23 c ecocrop 2000 it grows taller when planted mixed with crops that offer structural support vetch has a taproot that can reach depths up to 1 5 m sattell et al 1998 field data were collected from 15 sites in the lemo watershed each site has an area of 50 m2 growing mix of vetch and oats at a planting ratio of 3 vetches to 1 oat farmers used irrigation water from groundwater wells which have depths between 5 5 and 12 m a summary of the land management practices for vetch and oats cultivation in the lemo watershed is presented in table 1 the biomass was harvested once at the end of the growing season 2 3 rainfall distribution in the fodder cultivation sites daily rainfall data from weather stations close to the watersheds were used to identify rainfall contribution to fodder crop water requirment during the cultivation season the rainfall analysis was done based on the available data for the period 1994 2015 the long term average monthly rainfall the number of raining days and the fodder growing period march to mid july in robit and lemo watersheds which were used to inform irrigation are presented in fig 2a and b for the studied period the annual rainfall for robit watershed varies between 1100 and 1900 mm the total daily rainfall in the robit site during the napier cultivation period was 400 mm with a standard deviation of 75 mm the majority of the rainfall occurred at the end of the cultivation period in lemo watershed the annual rainfall varies between 900 and 1500 mm from march to june the area receives rainfall for more than ten days and from july to september the rainy days exceed 15 days the total rainfall amount during the vetch and oats growing period was 320 mm with a standard deviation of 90 mm although the rainfall amount in both sites had a significant contribution to the total fodder crop water requirement in the dry season it was not sufficient to meet the total crop water requirement for optimal fodder production which indicated a need for supplemental irrigation 2 4 modeling approaches the study used the soil and water assessment tool swat and agricultural policy environmental extender apex models to assess the gaps and constraints of fodder production the swat model is a basin scale distributed hydrological model in swat a watershed is divided into multiple sub watersheds which may have multiple hydrologic response units hrus hrus are unique combinations of land use soil and slope most of the biophysical processes such as soil water content surface runoff sediment yield and crop growth are simulated at the hru level and then aggregated to each subbasin the apex model is a field or small watershed scale model in which a sub watershed is assumed to have a single hru called subarea the model can simulate detailed field conditions including crop management and growth nutrient and pesticide fate hydrology soil temperature erosion sedimentation and costs and returns of the various management practices saleh and gallego 2007 wang et al 2011 although swat and apex models operate at a different spatial scale and apply for different applications they share several attributes for example they both require similar input data and most of their biophysical equations are similar arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 1998 williams et al 1998 spatial data used by both models include dem soil and land use the dem was used to characterize the watershed physical characteristics such as slope subbasin subarea areas longest flow path length etc for the swat model land use and soil data were collected from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy emwie the soil data contains the physical and chemical properties of the soils in the watersheds since the apex model was set up at the field level soil and land use information were collected at the field sites 2 4 1 model calibrations and evaluations streamflow calibration parameters for both swat and apex were identified from the literature bitew and gebremichael 2010 mengistu and sorteberg 2012 worqlul et al 2019 table 2 presents the list of parameters selected and their respective parameter space the swat model parameters were calibrated using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm in the swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup tool abbaspour et al 2007 the model calibration period was from1995 to 2010 for gumara and 2000 to 2010 for bidru awana watersheds and the model was validated for the period 2011 2016 and 2010 2015 respectively the calibration of the apex model was conducted using apex cute auto calibration and uncertainty estimator wang et al 2014 the fodder yield calibration was based on one year multiple site field observations observed napier yield was available for 2015 and vetch and oats yield were available for 2016 because of observed streamflow data limitation the swat model in both watersheds was calibrated and validated using data from nearby watersheds robit watershed had daily streamflow observation since june 22 2015 while there was no streamflow observation for the lemo watershed the selected nearby gauged watersheds have similar watershed characteristics as the study watersheds which enabled reasonable model parameter transfers kokkonen et al 2003 booij et al 2007 wale et al 2009 the watersheds selected to represent the robit and lemo watersheds were the gumera and bidru awana watersheds respectively the transferred parameters for the robit watershed were further fine tuned using the available observed streamflow data at its outlet the swat model thereafter was used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of available surface runoff and shallow groundwater recharge across the watersheds the apex model was set up for the field plots where there were land management and fodder yield data for model setup and calibration the apex model crop parameters were calibrated to capture the observed fodder height and yield after calibrating the model for observed crop yield and height the model was used to understand the constraints and gaps of fodder production in the watersheds the calibrated model was also used to estimate the water and fertilizer production of the study fodder crops fodder yield samples were collected from the fields for fodder nutritional quality analysis a total of 70 samples of napier and 22 samples for oat and vetch were collected for nutritional quality analysis the nutrient indicators analyzed included percent of dry matter ash organic matter nitrogen crude protein natural detergent fiber acid detergent fiber acid detergent lignin percent on dry matter and metabolizable energy the performance of the daily simulated streamflow soil loss crop height and yield were evaluated using multiple statistics such as coefficient of determination r squared root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and nash sutcliff efficiency nse generally r squared values can range between zero and one where zero indicates no correlation and one represents perfect association between simulated and observed variables rmse refers to the standard deviation of the prediction error pbias calculates the relative volume difference between simulated and observed volume a negative value indicates over prediction and a positive value indicates under prediction of simulation nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed variable variance nse values can range between negative infinite and one an nse value of one indicates a perfect fit between the simulated and observed variable and negative nse values mean that use of an average of observed variable is better than the simulated variable according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is assumed very good if r square is 0 5 nse is 0 75 and pbias is 10 2 4 2 water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops the calibrated apex model was used to study the water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops in both sites water use efficiency was determined by simulating the model multiple times by varying irrigation amounts at two day irrigation intervals paired with sufficient nutrients this approach helps to disentangle the impacts of different irrigation amount levels on crop yield while avoiding other limiting conditions like nutrient stress the nutrient limitation was avoided by automatically applying dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer for vetch and oats and a combination of urea and dap fertilizers for napier urea fertilizer consists mainly of nitrogen with n p k nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio of 46 0 0 while the dap fertilizer is a source of p and n with n p k ratio of 18 46 0 the scenarios of water productivity analysis were achieved by applying water between 100 and 850 mm over the growing period the amount of water per irrigation event was calculated based on the number of growing days from planting to harvest and irrigation intervals for example napier grass was set at a two day irrigation interval with a per event irrigation amount of 4 1 mm for a total of 250 mm irrigation for a growing period of 122 days 2 4 3 fodder nutritional quality analysis the nutritional quality of collected fodder samples was analyzed at the animal nutrition laboratory of the international livestock research institute ilri in addis ababa ethiopia the samples were dried at 65 c for 48 h in a forced draft oven and then ground to pass through 1 mm mesh sieve near infrared reflectance spectroscopy nirs prediction was employed for the analysis using equations calibrated and validated for each fodder type with data obtained from standard wet chemistry analysis williams 1984 aoac 1990 the nirs instrument used was a foss forage analyzer 5000 with software package winisi ii analyzed quality variables were dry matter ash crude protein cp neutral detergent fiber ndf acid detergent fiber adf acid detergent lignin adl and in vitro organic matter digestibility ivomd and metabolizable energy me 3 results and discussion 3 1 water resources potential of robit and lemo watersheds the performance of the swat models for the gumara and bidru awana watersheds were acceptable with nse of 0 83 and 0 60 and pbias of 5 4 and 8 5 during the calibration period respectively the models performance was also validated with an independent period of data and provided nse of 0 84 and 0 55 and pbias of 15 3 and 10 6 for gumara and awana watersheds the swat calibrated parameters with gumera and bidru awana watersheds were used to estimate the surface and groundwater recharge at robit and lemo watersheds respectively which is presented in fig 3 the average annual surface runoff of robit watershed was between 440 and 535 mm and the average annual groundwater ranges between 250 and 320 mm fig 3a and b while in the lemo watershed the average annual surface runoff ranged between 115 and 370 mm fig 3c and the average annual groundwater recharge varied between 80 and 400 mm fig 3d the analysis showed that when the available water resources are used for ssi in combination with the rainfall in the dry season both watersheds can produce sufficient amount of fodder 3 2 apex fodder yield simulation and yield limiting factors 3 2 1 napier yield simulation and yield limiting factors the field data indicated a strong linear relationship between napier yield and the amount of water applied the water applied captured 77 of the yield variability r square 0 77 while the fertilizer applied urea captured 66 of the yield variability the apex model was set up and calibrated at six napier sites using the observed fodder yield data the model simulated well the observed fodder yield with 0 86 coeffficient of determination and 0 6 t ha root mean square error fig 4 the performance of the apex model simulated crop height was also validated using the observed fodder height fig 5 the simulated fodder height captured the observed average fodder height reasonably well with r square of 0 95 fig 5 showed that the observed fodder height in dots and the daily simulated daily napier height line graphs showing the model performed well in capturing the observed fodder height the calibrated apex model was further used to understand the major yield limiting factors fig 6 presents the major yield limiting factors in the six simulated sites the simulation results indicated that nitrogen and phosphorus were the major yield limiting factors followed by water and temperature stress due to its fast growth and higher yield napier requires a regular application of nutrients n and p recommend annual nitrogen and phosphorous application rates vary from 200 to 460 kg ha and 50 to 100 kg ha respectively it varies based on soil type and fertility orodho 2006 pontes et al 2016 yang et al 2016 in the robit site napier was cultivated with nitrogen fertilizer application rates of between 92 and 184 kg ha and without phosphorus based on local recommendations this caused napier yield limitation due to nitrogen and phosphorous absence by an average of 23 and 15 stress days respectively fig 5 actual daily growth of plant in the apex model is constrained by nutrient water and temperature stresses the number of stress days were estimated counting the number fraction of days in which the available soil nutrients water and or temperature was outside the demand for optimal crop growth for example the number of nitrogen stress days is counted as 0 1 days if the available root zone soil nitrogen meets 90 of the crop nitrogen requirement for optimal growth 3 2 2 oats and vetch simulation and yield limiting factors the amount of water applied throughout the growing season of oats and vetch as a mixed crop varies between 100 and 140 mm the calibrated apex model based on the six selected sites captured the observed yield very well with an average difference of 13 for oats and 6 for vetch fig 7 the model performance was also validated using the observed fodder height the result indicated an acceptable performance with an r square of 0 89 fig 8 presented the number of stress days that the yield of both oats and vetch was limited by water nitrogen phosphorus and temperature the result showed that oats yield was limited by nitrogen and water while vetch yield was limited by water and temperature simulations showed that oats and vetch yield can be optimized by adding more nitrogen fertilizer and water as well as by increasing the vetch proportion in the planting mix increasing the vetch proportion contributed to soil fertility since it has the ability to fix nitrogen this assertion was in fact validated using the calibrated apex model the model was applied to simulate oat yield as a single crop to understand the effect of vetch on the cropping mix the singly cultivated oat was simulated with a similar amount of fertilizer and irrigation amounts as the mixed cropped oats and vetch simulation the result showed a significant oat yield reduction when planted as a single crop compared to the mixed cultivation the reduction in yield ranged from 17 to 43 depending on the site the reduction in yield was mainly related to nitrogen stress the vetch increased the soil nitrogen by symbiotically fixing atmospheric nitrogen through nitrogen fixing bacteria the simulation indicated that vetch can contribute soil nitrogen up to 30 kg ha some studies reported that vetch can contribute more than 100 kg of nitrogen per hectare in a single growing period ku et al 2018 3 3 water and fertilizer use efficiency of fodder crops the calibrated apex model was further used to estimate the water use efficiency of napier and oats and vetch mix since the study focused on assessing the optimal water use efficiency level the model was supplied unlimited urea and dap fertilizer rates to meet crop nitrogen and phosphorus requirement 3 3 1 water and fertilizer use efficiency of napier the simulated napier yield and average number of water stress days over 21 years are shown in fig 9 the result showed that when 100 mm of water was applied the fertilizer uptake of napier grass was very low and yield was limited by water stress for 100 mm of water application the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous uptake was 81 kg ha and 21 kg ha respectively as the amount of water applied increases the water stress level reduced and the fertilizer requirement increased due to an increase in plant nutrient uptake and nutrient losses through surface runoff and deep percolation maximum napier yield was obtained when 550 mm of water and 145 kg ha of nitrogen and 25 kg ha phosphorus were applied after that any increase in the amount of irrigation and fertilizer did not improve the yield the nitrogen components i e plant nitrogen uptake kg ha soluble nitrogen lost in surface runoff kg ha leached nitrogen and nitrogen loss in the form of volatilization and denitrification kg ha for the different amount of irrigation application were estimated and presented in fig 10 the nitrogen uptake of napier grass increased until 550 mm of irrigation and thereafter it did not change significantly however as the amount of water applied increases the nitrogen loss through percolation increased significantly while a minor increase was observed in volatilization and denitrification fig 9 the simulation indicated very little phosphorous loss in the soil since phosphorous is less soluble compared to nitrogen however over application of phosphorous could lead to a build up of phosphorus in the soil 3 3 2 water and fertilizer use efficiency of vetch and oats similar to the simulations for napier in the robit watershed simulations for the vetch and oats showed that nutrient uptake increased with increased irrigation up to a limited extent the result indicated that when 100 mm of water is applied the fertilizer requirement of vetch and oats was very low and the yield was limited by water for 100 mm of irrigation the phosphorous uptake was 52 kg ha as the amount of irrigation applied increases to 250 mm and above the water stress reduced significantly and the fertilizer requirement did not change much maximum simulated vetch and oats yield was obtained at 250 mm of irrigation and phosphorus uptake was 52 kg ha fig 11 irrigation beyond 250 mm did not significantly increase the phosphorus uptake as well as the yield fig 10 presents the simulated vetch and oats yield and the number of water stress days for six scenarios of irrigation over a simulation period of 21 years 1995 2015 3 4 nutritional value of napier vetch and oats the feed nutrition analysis indicated that dm fraction of dry and fresh weight content of napier was slightly higher than vetch and oats fig 12 napier dm is approximately 2 higher than oats and vetch however there was no significant difference in dm between vetch and oats dm of the feed contains energy protein fiber vitamins and minerals the analysis also indicated a higher proportion of ash mineral in napier 13 followed by vetch and oats 11 and 5 respectively these results were similar to those previously reported by galyean 1989 vetch has the highest crude protein content 18 compared to napier 10 and oats 6 cp is considered as a good determinant of feed quality the detergent fiber component ndf adf and adl estimated for the fodder crops is shown in fig 12 ndf is a good measure of feed quality and plant maturity higher ndf in the feed decreases intake and increases chewing activity the ndf content was higher in oats and napier compared to vetch fig 13 which is consistent with the findings of fulkerson et al 2007 and ergon et al 2016 the average adf lignin and cellulose component was lower in vetch at 39 compared to napier 46 and oats 47 adf is a subset of the ndf which contains the poorly digestible insoluble in a weak acid cell wall components lignin and cellulose van saun 2006 the adl component between the three fodders was similar at 5 fig 13 vetch contained 11 mj kg dm metabolizable energy a higher energy content than oats and napier which is at 7 and 8 mj kg respectively overall the feed quality analysis indicated a superior performance of vetch in terms of digestibility and feed quality 4 conclusion integrating field data with two biophysical models apex and swat this study explored the opportunities gaps and constraints of fodder production in two different agro ecological zones in ethiopia the study also examined the nutrition components of the cultivated fodder to identify fodder types that provides balanced diet to livestock the findings showed that there is a substantial amount of water resources in both watersheds to produce fodder production using small scale irrigation the modeling results showed that the average optimal amount of water required to cultivate napier and a mix of oats and vetches is 550 and 250 mm respectively the application of irrigation beyond the optimal amount for the respective fodder crops increased surface runoff and percolation that cause nutrient losses moreover the study indicated that poor soil fertility limited optimal fodder production in both watersheds for example phosphorous was one of the major yield limiting factors for vetch production although nitrogen was not a limiting factor as vetch is a legume crop the fodder nutrition assessment indicated that napier has a higher dry matter content compared to oats and vetch napier also has a higher mineral content while vetch contains the most crude protein and energy content overall vetch provides a superior nutrition performance as a livestock feed besides providing high biomass dry matter content crude protein and energy for livestock fodder crops such as vetch provided other environmental services for example vetch crop can symbiotically fix atmospheric n through nitrogen fixing bacteria and thereby improve soil fertility this study concludes that fodder production using small scale irrigation can help to produce high quality fodder like vetch that could improve ethiopia s livestock sector and its contribution to the country s economy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10038,nitrogen n loss from paddy fields is a major cause of water eutrophication alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation is a promising measure for controlling nutrient loss nevertheless quantifying n loss from paddy fields under awd to water bodies is difficult because of 1 the sharp fluctuations in soil moisture and 2 the variation in runoff n concentrations caused by the probable first flush effect consequently studies on n loss are usually confined to plot experiments from june to november 2020 a 2 5 ha field scale experiment was conducted in shanghai during the rice growth stage the proposed methodology included recording the water levels in a paddy field quantification of runoff and implementation of automatic sampling procedures the electrical conductivity ec of runoff was applied to study the loss characteristics of nutrients the antecedent field water level afwl in paddies was used to evaluate the effect of soil moisture on the field water capacity which was indicated by the runoff curve number cn it was found that awd significantly altered the cn when the afwl dropped to 100 mm beneath the soil surface the cn dropped to 40 the ec was closely related to the n concentration adjusted r2 0 76 n 176 when water samples with n concentrations ranging from 0 28 to 109 32 mg l were analyzed a hydrograph of ec versus runoff velocity during rainfall events indicated the significant effects of dilution caused by rainfall therefore the estimate of n loss should be based on high frequency sampling there was a more significant first flush effect on n loss during rainfall events than with artificial drainage however due to the high frequency of artificial drainage n loss through artificial drainage should also be fully taken into account in conclusion the quantity and quality of n loss were significantly affected by wide fluctuations in soil moisture under awd and the first flush effect of rainfall keywords nonpoint pollution irrigation conditions nitrogen loss water quality first flush effect 1 introduction china which is in possession of 20 of the global rice paddy area has been stably producing approximately 30 of the total global rice fao 2018 this high rice yield is partly ascribed to the massive input of chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen n fertilizers zhang et al 2018 suggested that in china n application rates in 45 of paddy fields exceeded the environmentally optimal application n rate 169 199 kg n ha 1 and thus need to be reduced to mitigate water pollution following the rapid degradation cycle 1 10 days of n fertilizer urea et al the n concentrations in water in paddy fields have been reported to exponentially decline hua et al 2019 liu et al 2020 according to a meta analysis runoff depth and n fertilization rate were the primary factors controlling n runoff loss rates from paddy fields zhang et al 2021 the loss of n load from paddy fields depends on the timing i e time to recent n fertilization and the runoff quantity including rainfall runoff and artificial drainage in addition the n concentration in runoff generated by heavy rainfall 50 mm in 24 h may significantly fluctuate due to the first flush effect characterized by high pollution loads at the initial stage of a rainfall event followed by decreasing pollution loads later in the runoff period mamoon et al 2019 to precisely quantify the n loss load a full scale and extensive collection of water samples at the field scale is indispensable due to the remarkable variations in the n concentrations of intra and inter runoff events according to conventional farming practices for rice cultivation alternate flooding and draining has multiple purposes including to satisfy physiological water requirements address inefficient tiller control increase soil aeration for root respiration and facilitate rice harvesting in recent decades the alternate wetting and drying awd of paddies in which fields are drained and reflooded one or more times during the growing season has been promoted as an eco friendly strategy to both decrease irrigation water use and reduce the environmental impact of rice cultivation while maintaining or even improving yields lahue et al 2016 according to field surveys from shanghai china the water management employed by local farmers somewhat resembles awd 1 shallow flooding during the first 2 weeks after transplant to revive seedlings from transplant shock and to suppress weed emergence 2 applying a thin layer 20 50 mm of water from panicle initiation to the end of flowering as this period is very sensitive to water deficit and 3 implementing alternate wetting and dry cycles during all other growth periods in addition to precipitation artificial drainage is frequently carried out which also causes loss from paddy fields in northeast china where the average annual precipitation is approximately 530 mm artificial drainage and n fertilizer amounts more significantly affect local paddy n loss than does precipitation nan et al 2021 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china with an average precipitation of approximately 1200 mm rice cultivation requires an average of 1300 mm of water during the 3 6 months growth stages requiring 300 350 mm to be irrigated into paddies li et al 2011 nevertheless despite the high artificial drainage frequency the characteristics of nutrient loss under drainage are less concerning in subtropical regions more importantly n loss variations are highly correlated with both precipitation and the antecedent moisture content amc under awd the soil in paddy fields goes through extreme fluctuations in water moisture which significantly influences runoff export ouyang et al 2015 2017 usually antecedent rainfall is used to evaluate the amc scs 1972 nevertheless unlike in uplands where rainfall is the major cause of variations in the amc using antecedent rainfall might be unreliable in paddy fields due to the high frequency of irrigation and accompanying sharp fluctuations in the amc therefore the effects of the amc on runoff volume require a quantitative investigation in paddy fields in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and other subtropical regions of china where rainfall exceeds 1000 mm nutrient loss from paddy fields is mostly due to high rainfall and frequency drainage moreover the loss process is affected by the considerable variation in the amc when under awd all of these findings highlight the need for a methodology that could estimate nutrient loss at the field scale the current study aimed to 1 formulate methods to study the n loss characteristics of runoff generated by rainfall events or artificial drainage at the field scale and 2 estimate the effect of the amc on rainfall runoff and the first flush effect of runoff during rainfall events under awd 2 materials and methods 2 1 layout of the paddy field and field management over the past decades the areas of single paddy fields in shanghai have gradually increased for mechanized tillage convenience an average scale paddy field with an area of 2 5 ha was chosen in fengxian district shanghai china 121 37 e 30 97 n the site has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 c and an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm the soil texture is sandy clay with bulk density 1 40 g cm 3 on site observations were conducted from june to november 2020 to rapidly drain the ponding water many drainage outlets were dug out in the levees by local farmers hence the discharge path of nutrients into the river was as follows first all water exported from the paddy field aggregated in the annular drainage ditch channel and then inflowed into the river through a sole drainage outlet in the ditch where water samples were collected with the aid of an automatic sampler fig 1 the levees were built 5 years ago and their thickness exceeded 0 6 m which could effectively prevent lateral seepage from the paddy field to comprehensively study the loss of nutrients in the region all water and fertilization management strictly conformed to the local farming practices rice seedlings were transplanted on june 15 2020 the fertilizers were applied according to local farmer s practices before transplantation compound fertilizer 49 21 and 40 kg ha of pure n p and k and urea 69 kg ha pure n were applied as basal fertilizer on july 29 and august 9 of 2020 urea 138 kg ha pure n and compound fertilizer 34 15 and 28 kg ha of pure n p and k was applied as topdressing fertilizer respectively 2 2 device installation and sampling setting 2 2 1 water depth recording in the field a field water tube developed by the international rice research institute irri can monitor the water level beneath the soil surface under awd and reflect soil water conditions ishfaq et al 2020 in the current experiment a pvc tube with apertures was embedded into the paddy field at 350 mm depth fig 1 the pipe diameter was 30 cm and an ultrasonic water gauge was fixed on the top of the pipe to measure the water depth soil matric potential was measured with a granular matrix sensor model watermark 200ss irrometer riverside ca usa the granular matrix sensor was installed close to the tube at a depth of 150 mm fig 1 the soil water potential sensor is a resistive device that responds to changes in soil moisture nolz et al 2013 2 2 2 runoff quantification and automatic sampling method a triangular thin walled weir was used to quantify the runoff at the drainage outlet of the ditch fig 2 to avoid pooling water in the ditch the weir crest was kept at the same level as the bottom of the drainage ditch the commonly used ultrasonic gauge with an accuracy of one centimeter may not meet the high accuracy requirement for measuring the water level of small scale catchments liao et al 2019 including the present 2 5 ha catchment especially when measuring the drainage volume characteristic of low runoff depth therefore a float type water level gauge model 6541 precision water level instrument unidata o connor wa australia was used to measure the water level in the flume fig 2 the gauge was installed within a pvc pipe connected to the flume using a counterweight clump weight the gauge s floater was able to fluctuate with the water in the flume synchronously consequently the water level in the flume could be determined for comparison an ultrasonic gauge was also installed above the flume an automatic sampler was installed close to the flume with water samples collected at the flume fig 1 when the water level in the flume exceeded the weir crest height ch value indicated in fig 2 the sampling procedure was triggered concerning the first flush effect the sampling intervals were 20 min in the initial period and 60 240 min in later periods during the rainy season the rainfall events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are intermittent at the hourly scale and have long duration continuity at the day scale which may present certain challenges in the setting of the sampling interval to in depth study the first flush effect the sampling procedure was set to restart when the no runoff time exceeded 24 h 2 2 3 electrical conductivity sensor and other auxiliary devices an electrical conductivity ec sensor model c4e four electrode sensor aqualabo val de marne île de france france with built in temperature compensation was vertically installed in the flume when the water level in the flume exceeded the ch value the sensor was completely submerged and the ec was recorded a hyetometrograph model 6465m davis hayward ca usa was installed near the flume all data were collected and transmitted to a cloud database with the aid of a datalogger model cr 300 campbell scientific logan ut usa 2 3 scs method to describe the relationship between soil water status and runoff the soil conservation service curve number scn cn is the most widely adopted method in hydrology used to quantitatively compute the direct surface runoff from a rainfall event scs 1972 the scs curve number method describes the relationship between precipitation and runoff quantity as 1 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q is the runoff depth mm p is the rainfall depth mm and s is the maximum retention storage mm after runoff generation the method assumes an initial abstraction of 0 2 s the maximum retention storage s is calculated from the following formula based on in situ field observations 2 s 5 p 2 q 4 q 2 5 pq the maximum retention storage is related to the cn value by the following 3 cn 25400 254 s the cn value is a dimensionless index ranging from 0 no runoff to 100 all rainfall becomes runoff cn 100 represents a theoretical lower bound of the potential retention storage and cn 0 indicates the theoretical upper bound of the potential retention storage in the present study the cn values were used to evaluate the effects of amc on the field capacity under awd 2 4 description of the first flush the concentration of n in surface runoff was described based on the event mean concentrations emcs due to the large fluctuation during rainfall events sansalone and buchberger 1997 the emc can be defined as the total pollutant load divided by the total runoff volume 4 emc m v 0 t c t q t dt 0 t q t dt c t q t t c t t where m is the total pollutant load of outflow runoff v is the total runoff volume t is the time c t is the concentration of pollutants at time t q t is the runoff flow rate at time t and δt is the sampling interval cumulative load curves clcs were used to monitor the first flush effect increased nutrient loads above those from runoff during rainfall events kato et al 2009 this method plots the cumulative runoff ratio on the horizontal axis and the cumulative load ratio on the vertical axis 5 cumulative runoff ratio v t v 6 cumulative load ratio m t m where v t and m t are the cumulative runoff and n loss at time t respectively the strength of the first flush was calculated using the pollutogram approach developed by kato et al 2009 7 f x x β where f x is the fraction of the total nutrient load during a rainfall event x is the fraction of total runoff during the event and β is the coefficient a first flush occurs with values of β 1 where β 1 means that nutrient loads and runoff are proportional during the event and β 1 indicates that the nutrient loads arrive predominantly towards the end of the event 2 5 chemical analysis all water samples were taken to the laboratory within 24 h and analyzed within 48 h total n tn ammonium n nh4 n and nitrate n no3 n in the water samples were determined by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method nessler s reagent colorimetric method and a spectrophotometric method with phenol disulfonic acid respectively seba state environmental protection administration of china 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of ultrasonic and float type gauge readings after october 27 2020 the flume was almost dried up and the readings acquired by the ultrasonic us and float type ft gauges were used to evaluate the reliability of the two gauges fig 3 theoretically the readings recorded by the two gauges should be stable nevertheless although the us readings were calculated using a temperature compensation algorithm the diurnal variation remained noteworthy the diurnal variation range of us gauge readings exceeded 220 mm on the other hand the ft gauge readings showed no diurnal fluctuations and the readings gradually and steadily decreased primarily due to the evaporation of water in the pvc tube fig 2 the variation in us gauge data might lead to unexpected measurement deviation especially for small catchment flow liao et al 2019 3 2 dynamics of the water level during rice growth stages a comparison of the field water level fwl and soil water matric potential is shown in fig 4 the fwl was an ideal indicator that reflects both the water depth ponded in a paddy field and the soil water matric potential at a depth of 150 mm when the water depth was 0 mm it was quite obvious that the soil was saturated and the readings of the soil water potential sensor were almost stable when the water level dropped down to approximately 100 mm below the soil surface the water matric potential began to gradually descend after irrigation the soil water matric potential quickly returned to a stable value when the soil was saturated fig 4 under awd flooding of the paddies depends on whether the fwl drops to a threshold value the critical fwl for safe awd means increasing or maintaining the yield with water savings as at this threshold level roots of plants are still able to acquire sufficient water from saturated soil ishfaq et al 2020 determining the critical fwl for safe awd is a complicated task due to the effects of soil texture weather conditions etc according to local farmers who have years of experience the present water regime did not cause a loss of yield and the safe fwl at which water matric potential also did not drop might be 100 mm fig 4 fig 5 demonstrates the dynamics of the water level and precipitation during the plant growth stage the water regime adopted by the local farmers approached the awd irrigation was frequently conducted except during the soil drying stage from july 15 to july 29 2020 to control inefficient tillers and the late grain filling stage after september 15 2020 during the other stages the soil was subjected to alternate wetting and drying therefore the soil water content fluctuated extremely thus significantly affecting runoff export during heavy events additionally artificial drainages were implemented a couple of times according to the local farmers water regime irrigation and immediate artificial drainage could maintain aerobic soil conditions which promoted root growth on the other hand with the aim of exposing weeds or drowning pests irrigation and artificial drainage were also conducted before or after applying herbicide or pesticide 3 3 runoff export from paddies and the effect of the amc on runoff quantity under rainfall fig 6 shows the runoff export from the paddy catchment before july 10 2020 there was no artificial drainage due to almost uninterrupted rain during this growth stage the rice seedlings were not submergence tolerant because of their small biomass as a result the outlets of the paddies were not blocked at times after july 10 2020 the time intervals of precipitation were much longer and the outlets were often blocked by compact soil dams used to pool water in the field the average fwls 1 h before the onset of rainfall were defined as antecedent fwls afwls afwls were used to quantify the variation in runoff export caused by the soil water content when the afwl 0 the cn value linearly decreased with the afwl when afwl 0 the cn value ranging from 93 5 to 97 4 was not statistically correlated with the afwl fig 7 the paddy field s present cn values were close to 98 similar to the cn values of an experiment that was previously conducted in a paddy field near the present site he et al 2003 usually the scs cn method estimates rainfall runoff using a cn value obtained from catchment characteristics and antecedent rainfall 5 days before rainfall cn values could be calculated by a cn rainfall function andrzej et al 2020 nevertheless water management in paddies should be especially considered because of the differences in irrigation frequencies the antecedent 5 day rainfall was used to evaluate whether the amc is unreliable in a paddy field since the cn values considerably changed during the rice growth stages fig 7 the cn value dropped to 37 2 when the afwl 116 8 mm in the present study indicating high field water capacity and high nutrient retention potential in addition to the afwl the heights of soil dams hd at paddy outlets should be a principal factor affecting the q p relationship in eq 1 fu et al 2021 found that increasing weir outlet height hd in this study and shallow wet irrigation could significantly decrease the loss of nutrients from paddy fields 3 4 electrical conductivity of surface runoff as an easily accessible index for water quality monitoring ec is usually used for evaluating the total dissolved solids or ion concentrations in water cañedo argüelles et al 2013 various forms exist to express the total ec as the sum of the ec values for individual ion species in water benettin and breukelen 2017 the tn concentrations exported from the paddy field ranged from 0 28 to 109 32 mg l when tn 4 mg l the adjusted r 2 r 2 adjusted of the regression line for the tn concentration vs the ec value was 0 29 n 115 p 0 01 while if all data were included the r 2 adjusted was 0 76 n 174 p 0 01 fig 8 according to the higher r 2 adjusted it could be concluded that high concentrations 4 mg l of n as no3 and nh4 in runoff account for the increase in ec the ec was negatively related to the runoff velocity figs 9 and 10 like the study conducted in an alpine catchment cano paoli et al 2019 the ec and water discharge had an inverse relationship as the new water from rainfall which has low ec contributing to runoff has a shorter dwell time than old water and hence lower ion concentrations the ec is high under baseflow also known as drought flow or fair weather runoff after which it gradually decreases starting from the onset of an event to reach a minimum in the first part of the recession limb subsequently the ec rises again reaching values similar to the pre event value when water from rainfall no longer contributes to runoff the ec of rainfall ranged from 20 to 50 μs cm in the present study therefore the total ion concentration decreased due to the dilution of rainfall as demonstrated in fig 10 otherwise the irrigation water ec ranged from 437 to 466 μs cm and the ec of artificial drainage steadily approached the ec of irrigation water when drainage runoff was under recession the mixing of irrigation water with high ec resulted in different hydrographs of runoff velocity vs ec for the event runoff and artificial

10038,nitrogen n loss from paddy fields is a major cause of water eutrophication alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation is a promising measure for controlling nutrient loss nevertheless quantifying n loss from paddy fields under awd to water bodies is difficult because of 1 the sharp fluctuations in soil moisture and 2 the variation in runoff n concentrations caused by the probable first flush effect consequently studies on n loss are usually confined to plot experiments from june to november 2020 a 2 5 ha field scale experiment was conducted in shanghai during the rice growth stage the proposed methodology included recording the water levels in a paddy field quantification of runoff and implementation of automatic sampling procedures the electrical conductivity ec of runoff was applied to study the loss characteristics of nutrients the antecedent field water level afwl in paddies was used to evaluate the effect of soil moisture on the field water capacity which was indicated by the runoff curve number cn it was found that awd significantly altered the cn when the afwl dropped to 100 mm beneath the soil surface the cn dropped to 40 the ec was closely related to the n concentration adjusted r2 0 76 n 176 when water samples with n concentrations ranging from 0 28 to 109 32 mg l were analyzed a hydrograph of ec versus runoff velocity during rainfall events indicated the significant effects of dilution caused by rainfall therefore the estimate of n loss should be based on high frequency sampling there was a more significant first flush effect on n loss during rainfall events than with artificial drainage however due to the high frequency of artificial drainage n loss through artificial drainage should also be fully taken into account in conclusion the quantity and quality of n loss were significantly affected by wide fluctuations in soil moisture under awd and the first flush effect of rainfall keywords nonpoint pollution irrigation conditions nitrogen loss water quality first flush effect 1 introduction china which is in possession of 20 of the global rice paddy area has been stably producing approximately 30 of the total global rice fao 2018 this high rice yield is partly ascribed to the massive input of chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen n fertilizers zhang et al 2018 suggested that in china n application rates in 45 of paddy fields exceeded the environmentally optimal application n rate 169 199 kg n ha 1 and thus need to be reduced to mitigate water pollution following the rapid degradation cycle 1 10 days of n fertilizer urea et al the n concentrations in water in paddy fields have been reported to exponentially decline hua et al 2019 liu et al 2020 according to a meta analysis runoff depth and n fertilization rate were the primary factors controlling n runoff loss rates from paddy fields zhang et al 2021 the loss of n load from paddy fields depends on the timing i e time to recent n fertilization and the runoff quantity including rainfall runoff and artificial drainage in addition the n concentration in runoff generated by heavy rainfall 50 mm in 24 h may significantly fluctuate due to the first flush effect characterized by high pollution loads at the initial stage of a rainfall event followed by decreasing pollution loads later in the runoff period mamoon et al 2019 to precisely quantify the n loss load a full scale and extensive collection of water samples at the field scale is indispensable due to the remarkable variations in the n concentrations of intra and inter runoff events according to conventional farming practices for rice cultivation alternate flooding and draining has multiple purposes including to satisfy physiological water requirements address inefficient tiller control increase soil aeration for root respiration and facilitate rice harvesting in recent decades the alternate wetting and drying awd of paddies in which fields are drained and reflooded one or more times during the growing season has been promoted as an eco friendly strategy to both decrease irrigation water use and reduce the environmental impact of rice cultivation while maintaining or even improving yields lahue et al 2016 according to field surveys from shanghai china the water management employed by local farmers somewhat resembles awd 1 shallow flooding during the first 2 weeks after transplant to revive seedlings from transplant shock and to suppress weed emergence 2 applying a thin layer 20 50 mm of water from panicle initiation to the end of flowering as this period is very sensitive to water deficit and 3 implementing alternate wetting and dry cycles during all other growth periods in addition to precipitation artificial drainage is frequently carried out which also causes loss from paddy fields in northeast china where the average annual precipitation is approximately 530 mm artificial drainage and n fertilizer amounts more significantly affect local paddy n loss than does precipitation nan et al 2021 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china with an average precipitation of approximately 1200 mm rice cultivation requires an average of 1300 mm of water during the 3 6 months growth stages requiring 300 350 mm to be irrigated into paddies li et al 2011 nevertheless despite the high artificial drainage frequency the characteristics of nutrient loss under drainage are less concerning in subtropical regions more importantly n loss variations are highly correlated with both precipitation and the antecedent moisture content amc under awd the soil in paddy fields goes through extreme fluctuations in water moisture which significantly influences runoff export ouyang et al 2015 2017 usually antecedent rainfall is used to evaluate the amc scs 1972 nevertheless unlike in uplands where rainfall is the major cause of variations in the amc using antecedent rainfall might be unreliable in paddy fields due to the high frequency of irrigation and accompanying sharp fluctuations in the amc therefore the effects of the amc on runoff volume require a quantitative investigation in paddy fields in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and other subtropical regions of china where rainfall exceeds 1000 mm nutrient loss from paddy fields is mostly due to high rainfall and frequency drainage moreover the loss process is affected by the considerable variation in the amc when under awd all of these findings highlight the need for a methodology that could estimate nutrient loss at the field scale the current study aimed to 1 formulate methods to study the n loss characteristics of runoff generated by rainfall events or artificial drainage at the field scale and 2 estimate the effect of the amc on rainfall runoff and the first flush effect of runoff during rainfall events under awd 2 materials and methods 2 1 layout of the paddy field and field management over the past decades the areas of single paddy fields in shanghai have gradually increased for mechanized tillage convenience an average scale paddy field with an area of 2 5 ha was chosen in fengxian district shanghai china 121 37 e 30 97 n the site has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 c and an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm the soil texture is sandy clay with bulk density 1 40 g cm 3 on site observations were conducted from june to november 2020 to rapidly drain the ponding water many drainage outlets were dug out in the levees by local farmers hence the discharge path of nutrients into the river was as follows first all water exported from the paddy field aggregated in the annular drainage ditch channel and then inflowed into the river through a sole drainage outlet in the ditch where water samples were collected with the aid of an automatic sampler fig 1 the levees were built 5 years ago and their thickness exceeded 0 6 m which could effectively prevent lateral seepage from the paddy field to comprehensively study the loss of nutrients in the region all water and fertilization management strictly conformed to the local farming practices rice seedlings were transplanted on june 15 2020 the fertilizers were applied according to local farmer s practices before transplantation compound fertilizer 49 21 and 40 kg ha of pure n p and k and urea 69 kg ha pure n were applied as basal fertilizer on july 29 and august 9 of 2020 urea 138 kg ha pure n and compound fertilizer 34 15 and 28 kg ha of pure n p and k was applied as topdressing fertilizer respectively 2 2 device installation and sampling setting 2 2 1 water depth recording in the field a field water tube developed by the international rice research institute irri can monitor the water level beneath the soil surface under awd and reflect soil water conditions ishfaq et al 2020 in the current experiment a pvc tube with apertures was embedded into the paddy field at 350 mm depth fig 1 the pipe diameter was 30 cm and an ultrasonic water gauge was fixed on the top of the pipe to measure the water depth soil matric potential was measured with a granular matrix sensor model watermark 200ss irrometer riverside ca usa the granular matrix sensor was installed close to the tube at a depth of 150 mm fig 1 the soil water potential sensor is a resistive device that responds to changes in soil moisture nolz et al 2013 2 2 2 runoff quantification and automatic sampling method a triangular thin walled weir was used to quantify the runoff at the drainage outlet of the ditch fig 2 to avoid pooling water in the ditch the weir crest was kept at the same level as the bottom of the drainage ditch the commonly used ultrasonic gauge with an accuracy of one centimeter may not meet the high accuracy requirement for measuring the water level of small scale catchments liao et al 2019 including the present 2 5 ha catchment especially when measuring the drainage volume characteristic of low runoff depth therefore a float type water level gauge model 6541 precision water level instrument unidata o connor wa australia was used to measure the water level in the flume fig 2 the gauge was installed within a pvc pipe connected to the flume using a counterweight clump weight the gauge s floater was able to fluctuate with the water in the flume synchronously consequently the water level in the flume could be determined for comparison an ultrasonic gauge was also installed above the flume an automatic sampler was installed close to the flume with water samples collected at the flume fig 1 when the water level in the flume exceeded the weir crest height ch value indicated in fig 2 the sampling procedure was triggered concerning the first flush effect the sampling intervals were 20 min in the initial period and 60 240 min in later periods during the rainy season the rainfall events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are intermittent at the hourly scale and have long duration continuity at the day scale which may present certain challenges in the setting of the sampling interval to in depth study the first flush effect the sampling procedure was set to restart when the no runoff time exceeded 24 h 2 2 3 electrical conductivity sensor and other auxiliary devices an electrical conductivity ec sensor model c4e four electrode sensor aqualabo val de marne île de france france with built in temperature compensation was vertically installed in the flume when the water level in the flume exceeded the ch value the sensor was completely submerged and the ec was recorded a hyetometrograph model 6465m davis hayward ca usa was installed near the flume all data were collected and transmitted to a cloud database with the aid of a datalogger model cr 300 campbell scientific logan ut usa 2 3 scs method to describe the relationship between soil water status and runoff the soil conservation service curve number scn cn is the most widely adopted method in hydrology used to quantitatively compute the direct surface runoff from a rainfall event scs 1972 the scs curve number method describes the relationship between precipitation and runoff quantity as 1 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q is the runoff depth mm p is the rainfall depth mm and s is the maximum retention storage mm after runoff generation the method assumes an initial abstraction of 0 2 s the maximum retention storage s is calculated from the following formula based on in situ field observations 2 s 5 p 2 q 4 q 2 5 pq the maximum retention storage is related to the cn value by the following 3 cn 25400 254 s the cn value is a dimensionless index ranging from 0 no runoff to 100 all rainfall becomes runoff cn 100 represents a theoretical lower bound of the potential retention storage and cn 0 indicates the theoretical upper bound of the potential retention storage in the present study the cn values were used to evaluate the effects of amc on the field capacity under awd 2 4 description of the first flush the concentration of n in surface runoff was described based on the event mean concentrations emcs due to the large fluctuation during rainfall events sansalone and buchberger 1997 the emc can be defined as the total pollutant load divided by the total runoff volume 4 emc m v 0 t c t q t dt 0 t q t dt c t q t t c t t where m is the total pollutant load of outflow runoff v is the total runoff volume t is the time c t is the concentration of pollutants at time t q t is the runoff flow rate at time t and δt is the sampling interval cumulative load curves clcs were used to monitor the first flush effect increased nutrient loads above those from runoff during rainfall events kato et al 2009 this method plots the cumulative runoff ratio on the horizontal axis and the cumulative load ratio on the vertical axis 5 cumulative runoff ratio v t v 6 cumulative load ratio m t m where v t and m t are the cumulative runoff and n loss at time t respectively the strength of the first flush was calculated using the pollutogram approach developed by kato et al 2009 7 f x x β where f x is the fraction of the total nutrient load during a rainfall event x is the fraction of total runoff during the event and β is the coefficient a first flush occurs with values of β 1 where β 1 means that nutrient loads and runoff are proportional during the event and β 1 indicates that the nutrient loads arrive predominantly towards the end of the event 2 5 chemical analysis all water samples were taken to the laboratory within 24 h and analyzed within 48 h total n tn ammonium n nh4 n and nitrate n no3 n in the water samples were determined by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method nessler s reagent colorimetric method and a spectrophotometric method with phenol disulfonic acid respectively seba state environmental protection administration of china 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of ultrasonic and float type gauge readings after october 27 2020 the flume was almost dried up and the readings acquired by the ultrasonic us and float type ft gauges were used to evaluate the reliability of the two gauges fig 3 theoretically the readings recorded by the two gauges should be stable nevertheless although the us readings were calculated using a temperature compensation algorithm the diurnal variation remained noteworthy the diurnal variation range of us gauge readings exceeded 220 mm on the other hand the ft gauge readings showed no diurnal fluctuations and the readings gradually and steadily decreased primarily due to the evaporation of water in the pvc tube fig 2 the variation in us gauge data might lead to unexpected measurement deviation especially for small catchment flow liao et al 2019 3 2 dynamics of the water level during rice growth stages a comparison of the field water level fwl and soil water matric potential is shown in fig 4 the fwl was an ideal indicator that reflects both the water depth ponded in a paddy field and the soil water matric potential at a depth of 150 mm when the water depth was 0 mm it was quite obvious that the soil was saturated and the readings of the soil water potential sensor were almost stable when the water level dropped down to approximately 100 mm below the soil surface the water matric potential began to gradually descend after irrigation the soil water matric potential quickly returned to a stable value when the soil was saturated fig 4 under awd flooding of the paddies depends on whether the fwl drops to a threshold value the critical fwl for safe awd means increasing or maintaining the yield with water savings as at this threshold level roots of plants are still able to acquire sufficient water from saturated soil ishfaq et al 2020 determining the critical fwl for safe awd is a complicated task due to the effects of soil texture weather conditions etc according to local farmers who have years of experience the present water regime did not cause a loss of yield and the safe fwl at which water matric potential also did not drop might be 100 mm fig 4 fig 5 demonstrates the dynamics of the water level and precipitation during the plant growth stage the water regime adopted by the local farmers approached the awd irrigation was frequently conducted except during the soil drying stage from july 15 to july 29 2020 to control inefficient tillers and the late grain filling stage after september 15 2020 during the other stages the soil was subjected to alternate wetting and drying therefore the soil water content fluctuated extremely thus significantly affecting runoff export during heavy events additionally artificial drainages were implemented a couple of times according to the local farmers water regime irrigation and immediate artificial drainage could maintain aerobic soil conditions which promoted root growth on the other hand with the aim of exposing weeds or drowning pests irrigation and artificial drainage were also conducted before or after applying herbicide or pesticide 3 3 runoff export from paddies and the effect of the amc on runoff quantity under rainfall fig 6 shows the runoff export from the paddy catchment before july 10 2020 there was no artificial drainage due to almost uninterrupted rain during this growth stage the rice seedlings were not submergence tolerant because of their small biomass as a result the outlets of the paddies were not blocked at times after july 10 2020 the time intervals of precipitation were much longer and the outlets were often blocked by compact soil dams used to pool water in the field the average fwls 1 h before the onset of rainfall were defined as antecedent fwls afwls afwls were used to quantify the variation in runoff export caused by the soil water content when the afwl 0 the cn value linearly decreased with the afwl when afwl 0 the cn value ranging from 93 5 to 97 4 was not statistically correlated with the afwl fig 7 the paddy field s present cn values were close to 98 similar to the cn values of an experiment that was previously conducted in a paddy field near the present site he et al 2003 usually the scs cn method estimates rainfall runoff using a cn value obtained from catchment characteristics and antecedent rainfall 5 days before rainfall cn values could be calculated by a cn rainfall function andrzej et al 2020 nevertheless water management in paddies should be especially considered because of the differences in irrigation frequencies the antecedent 5 day rainfall was used to evaluate whether the amc is unreliable in a paddy field since the cn values considerably changed during the rice growth stages fig 7 the cn value dropped to 37 2 when the afwl 116 8 mm in the present study indicating high field water capacity and high nutrient retention potential in addition to the afwl the heights of soil dams hd at paddy outlets should be a principal factor affecting the q p relationship in eq 1 fu et al 2021 found that increasing weir outlet height hd in this study and shallow wet irrigation could significantly decrease the loss of nutrients from paddy fields 3 4 electrical conductivity of surface runoff as an easily accessible index for water quality monitoring ec is usually used for evaluating the total dissolved solids or ion concentrations in water cañedo argüelles et al 2013 various forms exist to express the total ec as the sum of the ec values for individual ion species in water benettin and breukelen 2017 the tn concentrations exported from the paddy field ranged from 0 28 to 109 32 mg l when tn 4 mg l the adjusted r 2 r 2 adjusted of the regression line for the tn concentration vs the ec value was 0 29 n 115 p 0 01 while if all data were included the r 2 adjusted was 0 76 n 174 p 0 01 fig 8 according to the higher r 2 adjusted it could be concluded that high concentrations 4 mg l of n as no3 and nh4 in runoff account for the increase in ec the ec was negatively related to the runoff velocity figs 9 and 10 like the study conducted in an alpine catchment cano paoli et al 2019 the ec and water discharge had an inverse relationship as the new water from rainfall which has low ec contributing to runoff has a shorter dwell time than old water and hence lower ion concentrations the ec is high under baseflow also known as drought flow or fair weather runoff after which it gradually decreases starting from the onset of an event to reach a minimum in the first part of the recession limb subsequently the ec rises again reaching values similar to the pre event value when water from rainfall no longer contributes to runoff the ec of rainfall ranged from 20 to 50 μs cm in the present study therefore the total ion concentration decreased due to the dilution of rainfall as demonstrated in fig 10 otherwise the irrigation water ec ranged from 437 to 466 μs cm and the ec of artificial drainage steadily approached the ec of irrigation water when drainage runoff was under recession the mixing of irrigation water with high ec resulted in different hydrographs of runoff velocity vs ec for the event runoff and artificial drainage figs 9 and 10 regarding the agricultural catchment characteristics at high fertilization frequency previous studies have suggested that ec could be used as a promising indicator reflecting the remarkable increase in n when n fertilization is applied as long as the dilution by rainfall ion composition at a specific site and other factors are fully considered ec will be an inexpensive tool for n loss risk warning and it will help the farmers to make drainage decisions when the ec probe placed in paddy fields or at the drainage outlets ec was successfully used to predict nutrient concentrations exported from silages at different sites holly et al 2018 unlike silage runoff generated by rainfall the ec of runoff from paddy fields was strongly affected by irrigation water the ec of irrigation water needs to be considered when ec is used for the prediction of nutrient concentrations in different drainage events nevertheless high resolution data derived from ec values are very beneficial for revealing the relationship between nutrient loss from the field and water quality variation in water bodies considering that costs and sample management can still be obstacles to high resolution water quality monitoring of chemical indices benettin and breukelen 2017 3 5 event mean concentrations emcs of n loss and first flush effects of rainfall runoff and artificial drainage it has been widely confirmed that after n application the n concentrations in pooled water in paddy fields exponentially decrease and the high risk periods for n loss include the first 5 days after fertilizer application liu et al 2020 the dynamics of emcs are shown in fig 11a on the 6th day after the last urea fertilization the emc of n reached 52 mg l after which it exponentially decreased on july 15 2020 the emc under rainfall was lower than the subsequent value under artificial drainage which was attributed to the addition of rainfall with a lower n concentration 0 34 mg l than that in

10039,forest planting is a common practice in semi arid sandy land restoration but problems may appear associated with forest age like higher soil water consumption that threatens restoration program

soil profile in the mu us sandy lands north china results indicated that the 20 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the 0 200 cm depth soil profile the 30 yr and 40 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the depth of 0 400 cm whereas the oldest 50 60 yr pines mainly consumed the soil water located at the deepest soil profile 500 700 cm variation of soil water storage sws was decreased with stand ages reaching the minimum value in the 30 40 yr stands and then gradually increased in the 50 60 yr stands the sws was relatively uniform on the 50 yr and 60 yr stands this pattern was associated with soil desiccation and soil water depletion the lower sws indicated lower soil water storage which was associated with soil desiccation and soil water depletion these findings proved that planted forest gradually aggravated soil water consumption along the increasing forest age caused a serious soil water deficit in the 200 700 cm depth soil layer which may be exceeding the water environmental carrying capacity therefore we suggest that forest should be thinned on the periods with the highest sws which would maintain long term forest sustainability by

dependent on deep soil water than younger forests drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 while young forests were more susceptible to drought than older forests giordano et al 2011 song et al 2016b studied the water use patterns of planted forest under different ages in a semi arid sandy land of northeast china and reported that the 10 and 22 year old forests used water from the 20 100 cm soil layers but the 32 and 42 year old forests could absorb water from groundwater and the contribution of groundwater to forest transpiration increased with the decrease of soil water thus the planting of deep rooted forests in sandy land led to an increase of soil water evaporation and groundwater consumption that aggravated soil water scarcity li et al 2016 smits et al 2012 moreover the management practice showed significant effects on the water consumption intensity of plants and played an essential role in maintaining the survival rates and the continuous growth of planted forests zucca et al 2011 several decades ago due to ignoring the effects of planting patterns together with the influence of climate change to future vegetation survival the issues gradually emerged such as vegetation degradation soil water deficit and groundwater recession which was the legacy problem of vegetation restoration nowadays the best way to solve or remit the excessive consumption of soil water and maintain the vegetation sustainability may be thinning forests during the suitable growth period therefore it is necessary to understand the soil water changes for developing practical measures which could help protect and restore degraded sandy ecosystems in arid and semi arid land environments matzner et al 2003 however the spatio temporal relationships between soil water and the stand ages remain poorly understood in some ecosystems in this study soil water variation of p sylvestris forest at different stand ages along 0 1000 cm soil layer were analyzed the aims of this study were 1 to quantify the variation of sandy soil water storage in the soil depth of 0 1000 cm along the stand ages and 2 to determine the mainly soil water consumption layers of planted p sylvestris forest with different stand ages in sandy land these results will be contributed to better understand the existing relationships between the soil water content and the stand ages of forest plantations in semi arid sandy land and provide basis for the proper management of artificial forest in semi arid sandy land areas for landowners and policy makers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in the hongshixia forest park 38 19 n 109 42 e located 5 kilometers north of yulin city in shaanxi province northwest china the study region is the junction of shaanxi shanxi and inner mongolia which is also located at the southern rim of the mu us desert the study area is a wind sand grass shoal located at an elevation of ca 1100 m a s l the climate is monsoon influenced semi arid continental with a warm temperate zone this part of inland china has obvious continental climate and the underlying surface contributes to the sandy climate characteristics this region is characterized by a dry spring with sufficient sunshine a hot summer with concentrated precipitation a rainy autumn with marked temperature differences and a cold winter with windy sand storms the mean annual temperature is 7 9 with minimum and maximum air temperatures of 32 7 and 37 2 respectively the average temperature is ca 10 and 24 in the coldest january and hottest july months respectively the annual frost free period lasts 130 150 d and the mean annual sunshine duration is 2900 h the mean annual precipitation is 415 mm and most rainfall occurs as rainstorms primarily occurs from july to september accounting for 60 70 of the total annual rainfall annual evaporation is 4 10 times of annual precipitation the soil in the study area is the common aeolian sandy soil of the semi arid areas of northwest china which is characterized by loose structure and poor quality the mean sediment concentration is 92 6 and ph is between 8 01 and 8 71 the dominant natural vegetation species include artemisia ordosica and salix psammophila nowadays the pinus sylvestris p sylvestris forests are distributed in the greater xing an mountains of china this species of pine is so adaptable that it can grow in eolian sand slope sand windward slope sand and loess stone field the p sylvestris has become the main introduced species in the semi arid deserted areas of china at present wang et al 2015 song et al 2018 near the study area the p sylvestris was introduced from the forestry bureau of honghua erji 119 43 119 51 e 48 06 48 07 n in hulun buir inner mongolia and planted in 1964 then it began to be planted in large areas after the 1980 s interspersed with shrubs such as amorpha fruticosa and hippophae rhamnoides 2 2 experimental design soil sampling and soil water storage estimate this experiment used the method of spatial sequence instead of temporal sequence to study the effects of stand ages of forestland to soil water conditions five different ages 20 30 40 50 and 60 year old p sylvestris were selected a bare control land was also chosen at the hongshixia forest park p sylvestris with different forest ages has a certain distance approximately 100 m and the sampling points were selected in the inner of each plot to avoid the edge effects the slope of the study area is approximately 2 3o at an altitude of about 1100 m in the five artificial forests almost an equal number of seedlings of p sylvestris were planted plant death occurred because of the survival rate and natural selection and after they died the trees were not left in the artificial forest in each of the five age groups five plots 50 20 m were established and three quadrats 10 10 m were chosen in each plot the density trees per hectare and diameter at breast height dhb cm were measured in all quadrats fig 1 dhb were measured at a height of 1 3 m of trees in the experimental design nine sampling points were established in the bare land and in each forest of the five age groups the measurement of soil water content along 0 1000 cm soil profile was finished within two weeks in july 2018 five days before and during measurement there was no effective precipitation 5 mm the variation of soil water content between forest and bare land generally represents the water consumption of forest at different stages due to some constraints associated with the natural environment of the study area and human and material resources it was difficult to collect soil samples of the 0 1000 cm depth layer in some extent during the sampling process in total three complete sampling points were chosen in each treatment and the bare land respectively in each plot the distance from tress to sampling point was the same to avoid the spatial heterogeneity caused by root distribution soil samples to a depth of 1000 cm were obtained by a soil auger 40 mm of diameter at 10 cm intervals for one point the soil samples were weighed in aluminum boxes and then oven dried to constant weight in a given context 105 24 h the soil bulk density b g cm 3 was measured at 10 cm intervals by using a cutting ring with 100 cm3 cubage at each age group there were three replicate samples to estimate the average values for each soil layer the soil water storage sws mm and the variation of sws s mm were calculated by the following formula 1 sws i d i b swc 10 1 2 s sis sib where the subscript i is the 0 i cm soil profile d i cm is soil depth of i swc weight is the mass soil water content s is mm is the sws of i cm under the different stand ages and s ib is the sws of i cm in the bare control land 2 3 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss 22 0 software ibm montauk new york usa one way anova analysis of variance followed by the tukey s hsd test was used to analyze the differences of sws and soil water relative deficiency among the different stand ages significant differences were evaluated at the 0 05 probability level all data are presented as means standard errors of the means all figures were created by using the program origin 9 0 origin lab northampton massachusetts usa fig 3 was the contour map of soil water content in 0 1000 cm soil depth along different stand ages of p sylvestris 3 results 3 1 changes in the planted forest density the forest density of afforestation increased firstly and then decreased with increasing stand ages fig 2 and it maintained a similar average rate ca 1400 trees per hectare in the 20 yr 30 yr and 50 yr stand ages the density was highest in the 40 yr stand with 1883 trees per hectare and the lowest density was observed in the 60 yr stand 683 trees per hectare 3 2 soil water storage changes in the different planted forest stand ages regarding the soil layers the sws firstly decreased and then increased with increasing soil depths fig 3 the lowest sws in the 40 yr stand age ca 42 66 mm was found in the 0 200 cm soil profiles the sws in the 200 400 cm soil profiles of 30 yr stand age was 36 33 mm the lowest values of sws of the 50 yr stand age appeared in the soil layers of 400 600 cm 37 78 mm and 600 800 cm 142 89 mm in the 800 1000 cm soil profiles the sws of the bare land 568 96 mm and of the 20 yr 550 38 mm and 30 yr 663 94 mm stand ages were higher than the sws observed in the other stand ages and soil depths 517 98 290 45 and 220 04 mm in the 40 yr 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages respectively then the sws rapidly decreased after 30 years of forest plantation fig 4 with respect to the plantation age the sws firstly decreased and then increased with the increasing stand ages meanwhile the sws in the deeper layers 400 1000 cm was significantly higher than that in the shallow soil layers 0 400 cm fig 3 the sws suddenly increased in the 800 1000 cm soil layer of the bare land plots from 166 07 to 568 96 mm and in a similar way in the 20 yr stand age from 267 72 to 550 38 mm in the 400 600 cm soil layer the sws increased in the 30 yr from 149 63 to 663 94 mm 40 yr from 101 59 to 517 98 mm and 50 yr stand ages from 37 78 to 290 45 mm fig 4 however none obvious turning point was observed in the sws in the 60 yr stand age the observed sws at the 200 400 cm depth was similar to the sws at the 400 600 cm 171 10 mm 600 800 cm 185 42 mm and 800 1000 cm 220 04 mm depths fig 5f 3 3 variations of soil water storage in the soil profile under different planted forest stand ages across each soil layer the sws was more variable in the bare land fig 6 compared to bare land sws in each soil layer and different stand ages were decreased as well as the variations of sws were lower than zero in the 20 yr stand age the variation was 26 05 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layers the variations were also negative in the 0 200 and 200 400 cm soil layers in the 30 yr 97 79 and 153 30 mm respectively and 40 yr 70 86 and 13 59 mm respectively stand ages during the whole period of 50 years all the variations were negative from the 0 1000 cm soil layers after 60 years of forest plantation there was a special point and the variations were negative in the 0 200 cm 108 82 mm 600 800 cm 64 87 mm and 800 1000 cm 467 07 mm soil layers taking into account the whole 0 200 cm soil profile sws was the highest in the 40 yr stand age 153 30 mm it was significantly higher than that of 20 yr 26 05 mm 30 yr 98 79 mm 50 yr 128 07 mm and 60 yr 108 82 mm stand ages fig 6 4 discussion it is essential to maintain a sustainable soil water for vegetation especially in arid regions where water scarcity is the greatest restrictive factor for vegetation growth and sustainable development matzner et al 2003 song et al 2016a wei et al 2019 previous reports showed that p sylvestris was adapted to the environment of the semi arid sandy land areas and this species was suitable for establishment to reduce wind speed and thus to solidify sand song et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 however the improper varieties of artificial forest the high plantation density or water shortage all lead to more serious desertification again kerhoulas et al 2013 cao 2008 this study highlights the existence of a soil water bottleneck during the process of forest growth with the forest s stand ages 4 1 soil water variation with the increasing stand ages soil moisture plays a very important role in the driving growth patterns in semi arid environments wang et al 2017 specifically the emphasis of the data analysis in this study focused on the relationships between the stand ages and the soil water use of the planted forest in a semi arid sandy land in this study the main period of soil water decreasing was in 30 40 years after that soil water storage gradually increasing fig 3 the above phenomenon was attributed to plantation dieback which often occurred approximately 30 35 years after planting song et al 2016b song et al 2018 suggested that the most important reason for forest degradation and dieback was an unbalanced pattern of water due to the lack of direct use of precipitation liu et al 2017 also emphasized that the demand for water and other resources in forest is higher after approximately 30 40 years of plantation due to the individual gradually growth accompanied by an increased photosynthetic rate of the young pines in the study area an important reason of part of forest dying maybe due to water scarcity after 40 years resulted in a lower forest density fig 2 studies have indicated that p sylvestris entered the mature period when the stand ages were over 35 years song et al 2016b hence after 40 years not only the forest density were diminished but the growth rate also decreased and then the sws continued to be slowly consumed over time in the 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages moreover vertessy et al 2001 advanced that the leaf area index decreased with the increasing stand ages that reduced transpiration and canopy interception as the forest ages these effects increased rainfall infiltration and decreased the consumption of soil water 4 2 soil water distribution and consumption characteristics in the soil profile along stand ages soil water utilization depth of forest was increased with the increasing stand ages specifically the forest in 20 yr stand age obtained soil water mainly from shallow soil layer 0 200 cm and it was deeper in the 30 yr and the 40 yr forests which reached 400 cm soil layer with the increasing stand ages the utilize depth of soil water up to 1000 cm soil layer in 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages on the one hand the soil water utilization depth was highly correlated with the root distribution song et al 2016b previous study has reported that the roots of the p sylvestris were primarily distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layers the taproots were located between 0 and 400 cm and the lateral roots covered 200 300 cm of radius from the trunk and had a mass of root hairs zheng et al 2012 the range of root distribution were gradually broader with the increasing stand ages and aggravated deep soil water consumption drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 song et al 2016a have reported that the planted forests with different stand ages use various water sources due to the differences in their vertical root distribution which lead to the difference of soil water distribution on the other hand evapotranspiration was different during different growing periods that influenced the soil water consumption intensity of forests water suction by roots was the important way to provide water for the growth and transpiration of plants verma et al 2014 in the dry lands evapotranspiration was generally several times higher than that of rainfall soil water consumption of vegetation transpiration induced the increasing degree and depth of soil water deficit once the soil water supply in the shallow layers 0 200 cm was insufficient planted pines needed more water to maintain a rapid growth rate after maturity the young forests consumed predominantly shallow soil water at the start of their growth while mature forests used both the shallow and deep soil water because of their deeper taproots kerhoulas et al 2013 liu et al 2015a 2015b deeper water sources play an important role in the response to droughts anderegg et al 2013 barbeta et al 2014 and it is effectively supplemented by groundwater musa et al 2019 the sws of the deep soil layer 800 1000 cm was higher compared to 0 800 cm soil layer and gradually decreased with the increasing stand ages this result demonstrated that the soil water consumption intensity and depth were increased with increasing stand ages this may be due to the prolonged root system aggravated deeper soil water usage causing the reduction of deep soil water liu et al 2018 observed that the finer roots of p sylvestris sought for deep layer water in order to deal with drought stress on the other hand although the groundwater can provide replenishment of soil water the deep soil water still declined with the stand age this may lead to the decline of groundwater level zheng et al 2012 this was explained by the planting of vegetation decreased the replenish of rainfall to soil water and increased the utilization of soil water that reduced the recharge to groundwater another aspect to consider was the instability of the groundwater recharge process that could also cause the deep soil water changes therefore we assumed that the soil water content in the deeper layers in this study was affected by both the forest ages and fluctuations of groundwater table over time moreover the stand ages of 20 30 yr showed the higher sws compared to bare land below the 200 cm soil depth in the bare sandy land the main soil water consumption was evaporation except for evaporation there is transpiration in the forests generally the water consumption intensity of evaporation is higher than that of transpiration liu et al 2015a 2015b the existence of plants restricted evaporation especially after rainfall while the sandy soil with higher infiltration rate and lower water holding capacity which resulted in the higher soil water content of forest in deeper soil layer than that of the bare land furthermore the planted forests gradually utilized the water resources of the deep soil layers by extending the root system but it also favored a release of the absorbed water into the shallow soil dawson 1996 meanwhile the distribution of soil water showed uneven discontinuous and irregular during the 60 year period our results proved that soil water was insufficient to replace serious soil water loss through the long term transpiration of plants and thus the utilization of soil water under the artificial forest was unbalanced forese thinning was proposed as a management tool to reduce net stand water use and improve water availability for remaining forests and reduced their dependence on deeper water which may decrease their subsequent drought vulnerability mcdowell and allen 2015 giuggiola et al 2013 zausen et al 2005 based on our findings and the available literatures we proposed that the artificial forest should be gradually thinned over the period of 30 40 years old when presented the highest degree of soil water storage decreasing to maintain the normal survival and sustainable development of forest vegetation 5 conclusions the benefits of the planted forest practices to control land degradation and wind erosion in semi arid sandy areas are in danger due to soil desiccation and dieback of artificial forests the important death rate of forest in the forest plantation was explained by the insufficient water supply with increasing the stand age our research showed that there were significant differences in the soil water storage of the planted forest with different stand ages the 20 yr forests mainly consumed shallow soil water 0 200 cm of soil depth the 30 yr and 40 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water stored at 0 400 cm depths and the 50 60 yr forest consumed the soil water of the 0 1000 cm soil layer importantly our findings showed that the main period of soil water storage decreasing was in 30 40 years after which the variation of soil water storage was gradually decreased in the studied semi arid sandy land the worst of the soil water decreasing for p sylvestris forests occurred during 30 40 years and later the soil water storage gradually increased due to and the decreasing forest density consequently therefore this study suggests that the intermediate felling may be considered for reducing soil water consumption for artificial forests to maintain the

10039,forest planting is a common practice in semi arid sandy land restoration but problems may appear associated with forest age like higher soil water consumption that threatens restoration program s success this study quantified the distribution and variation of soil water storage in a pinus sylvestris p sylvestris plantation under various stand ages 20 30 40 50 and 60 years along 0 1000 cm soil profile in the mu us sandy lands north china results indicated that the 20 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the 0 200 cm depth soil profile the 30 yr and 40 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the depth of 0 400 cm whereas the oldest 50 60 yr pines mainly consumed the soil water located at the deepest soil profile 500 700 cm variation of soil water storage sws was decreased with stand ages reaching the minimum value in the 30 40 yr stands and then gradually increased in the 50 60 yr stands the sws was relatively uniform on the 50 yr and 60 yr stands this pattern was associated with soil desiccation and soil water depletion the lower sws indicated lower soil water storage which was associated with soil desiccation and soil water depletion these findings proved that planted forest gradually aggravated soil water consumption along the increasing forest age caused a serious soil water deficit in the 200 700 cm depth soil layer which may be exceeding the water environmental carrying capacity therefore we suggest that forest should be thinned on the periods with the highest sws which would maintain long term forest sustainability by

2018 wang et al 2015 however the planted forest has brought a series of negative effects with the increase in planting years after several decades of planting some studies have found that some of the p sylvestris forests began to die and the groundwater level dropped in particular after 30 35 years of plantation song et al 2016b zheng et al 2012 the decline of swc was the most important reason to

cope with water scarcity for instance many plant species presented different root systems that allow them to switch between shallow and deep water for normal growth in arid and semi arid regions nie et al 2012 prieto et al 2012 in addition deep water reserves are essential for vegetation to withstand dry periods in water limited drylands barbeta et al 2014 generally older forests are more dependent on deep soil water than younger forests drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 while young forests were more susceptible to drought than older forests giordano et al 2011 song et al 2016b studied the water use patterns of planted forest under different ages in a semi arid sandy land of northeast china and reported that the 10 and 22 year old forests used water from the 20 100 cm soil layers but the 32 and 42 year old forests could absorb water from groundwater and the contribution of groundwater to forest transpiration increased with the decrease of soil water thus the planting of deep rooted forests in sandy land led to an increase of soil water evaporation and groundwater consumption that aggravated soil water scarcity li et al 2016 smits et al 2012 moreover the management practice showed significant effects on the water consumption intensity of plants and played an essential role in maintaining the survival rates and the continuous growth of planted forests zucca et al 2011 several decades ago due to ignoring the effects of planting patterns together with the influence of climate change to future vegetation survival the issues gradually emerged such as vegetation degradation soil water deficit and groundwater recession which was the legacy problem of vegetation restoration nowadays the best way to solve or remit the excessive consumption of soil water and

remain poorly understood in some ecosystems in this study soil water variation of p sylvestris forest at different stand ages along 0 1000 cm soil layer were analyzed the aims of this study were 1 to quantify the variation of sandy soil water storage in the soil depth of 0 1000 cm along the stand ages and 2 to determine the mainly soil water consumption layers of planted p sylvestris forest with

the annual frost free period lasts 130 150 d and the mean annual sunshine duration is 2900 h the mean annual precipitation is 415 mm and most rainfall occurs as rainstorms primarily occurs from july to september accounting for 60 70 of the total annual rainfall annual evaporation is 4 10 times of annual precipitation the soil in the study area is the common aeolian sandy soil of the semi arid areas of northwest china which is characterized by loose structure and poor quality the mean sediment concentration is 92 6 and ph is between 8 01 and 8 71 the dominant natural vegetation species include artemisia ordosica and salix psammophila nowadays the pinus sylvestris p sylvestris forests are distributed in the greater xing an mountains of china this species of pine is so adaptable that it can grow in eolian sand slope sand windward slope sand and loess stone field the p sylvestris has become the main introduced species in the semi arid deserted areas of china at present wang et al 2015 song et al 2018 near the study area the p sylvestris was introduced from the forestry bureau of honghua erji 119 43 119 51 e 48 06 48 07 n in hulun buir inner mongolia and planted in 1964 then it began to be planted in large areas after the 1980 s interspersed with shrubs such as amorpha fruticosa and hippophae rhamnoides 2 2 experimental design soil sampling and soil water storage estimate this experiment used the method of spatial sequence instead of temporal sequence to study the effects of stand ages of forestland to soil water conditions five different ages 20 30 40 50 and 60 year old p sylvestris were selected a bare control land was also chosen at the hongshixia forest park p sylvestris with different forest ages has a certain distance approximately 100 m and the sampling points were selected in the inner of each plot to avoid the edge effects the slope of the study area is approximately 2 3o at an altitude of about 1100 m in the five artificial forests almost an equal number of seedlings of p sylvestris were planted plant death occurred because of the survival rate and natural selection and after they died the trees were not left in the artificial forest in each of the five age groups five plots 50 20 m were established and three quadrats 10 10 m were chosen in each plot the density trees per hectare and diameter at breast height dhb cm were measured in all quadrats fig 1 dhb were measured at a height of 1 3 m of trees in the experimental design nine sampling points were established in the bare land and in each forest of the five age groups the measurement of soil water content along 0 1000 cm soil profile was finished within two weeks in july 2018 five days before and during measurement there was no effective precipitation 5 mm the variation of soil water content between forest and bare land generally represents the water consumption of forest at different stages due to some constraints associated with the natural environment of the study area and human and material resources it was difficult to collect soil samples of the 0 1000 cm depth layer in some extent during the sampling process in total three complete sampling points were chosen in each treatment and the bare land respectively in each plot the distance from tress to sampling point was the same to avoid the spatial heterogeneity caused by root distribution soil samples to a depth of 1000 cm were obtained by a soil auger 40 mm of diameter at 10 cm intervals for one point the soil samples were weighed in aluminum boxes and then oven dried to constant weight in a given context 105 24 h the soil bulk density b g cm 3 was measured at 10 cm intervals by using a cutting ring with 100 cm3 cubage at each age group there were three replicate samples to estimate the average values for each soil layer the soil water storage sws mm and the variation of sws s mm were calculated by the following formula 1 sws i d i b swc 10 1 2 s sis sib where the subscript i is the 0 i cm soil profile d i cm is soil depth of i swc weight is the mass soil water content s is mm is the sws of i cm under the different stand ages and s ib is the sws of i cm in the bare control land 2 3 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss 22 0 software ibm montauk new york usa one way anova analysis of variance followed by the tukey s hsd test was used to analyze the differences of sws and soil water relative deficiency among the different stand ages significant differences were evaluated at the 0 05 probability level all data are presented as means standard errors of the means all figures were created by using the program origin 9 0 origin lab northampton massachusetts usa fig 3 was the contour map of soil water content in 0 1000 cm soil depth along different stand ages of p sylvestris 3 results 3 1 changes in the planted forest density the forest density of afforestation increased firstly and then decreased with increasing stand ages fig 2 and it maintained a similar average rate ca 1400 trees per hectare in the 20 yr 30 yr and 50 yr stand ages the density was highest in the 40 yr stand with 1883 trees per hectare and the lowest density was observed in the 60 yr stand 683 trees per hectare 3 2 soil water storage changes in the different planted forest stand ages regarding the soil layers the sws firstly decreased and then increased with increasing soil depths fig 3 the lowest sws in the 40 yr stand age ca 42 66 mm was found in the 0 200 cm soil profiles the sws in the 200 400 cm soil profiles of 30 yr stand age was 36 33 mm the lowest values of sws of the 50 yr stand age appeared in the soil layers of 400 600 cm 37 78 mm and 600 800 cm 142 89 mm in the 800 1000 cm soil profiles the sws of the bare land 568 96 mm and of the 20 yr 550 38 mm and 30 yr 663 94 mm stand ages were higher than the sws observed in the other stand ages and soil depths 517 98 290 45 and 220 04 mm in the 40 yr 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages respectively then the sws rapidly decreased after 30 years of forest plantation fig 4 with respect to the plantation age the sws firstly decreased and then increased with the increasing stand ages meanwhile the sws in the deeper layers 400 1000 cm was significantly higher than that in the shallow soil layers 0 400 cm fig 3 the sws suddenly increased in the 800 1000 cm soil layer of the bare land plots from 166 07 to 568 96 mm and in a similar way in the 20 yr stand age from 267 72 to 550 38 mm in the 400 600 cm soil layer the sws increased in the 30 yr from 149 63 to 663 94 mm 40 yr from 101 59 to 517 98 mm and 50 yr stand ages from 37 78 to 290 45 mm fig 4 however none obvious turning point was observed in the sws in the 60 yr stand age the observed sws at the 200 400 cm depth was similar to the sws at the 400 600 cm 171 10 mm 600 800 cm 185 42 mm and 800 1000 cm 220 04 mm depths fig 5f 3 3 variations of soil water storage in the soil profile under different planted forest stand ages across each soil layer the sws was more variable in the bare land fig 6 compared to bare land sws in each soil layer and different stand ages were decreased as well as the variations of sws were lower than zero in the 20 yr stand age the variation was 26 05 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layers the variations were also negative in the 0 200 and 200 400 cm soil layers in the 30 yr 97 79 and 153 30 mm respectively and 40 yr 70 86 and 13 59 mm respectively stand ages during the whole period of 50 years all the variations were negative from the 0 1000 cm soil layers after 60 years of forest plantation there was a special point and the variations were negative in the 0 200 cm 108 82 mm 600 800 cm 64 87 mm and 800 1000 cm 467 07 mm soil layers taking into account the whole 0 200 cm soil profile sws was the highest in the 40 yr stand age 153 30 mm it was significantly higher than that of 20 yr 26 05 mm 30 yr 98 79 mm 50 yr 128 07 mm and 60 yr 108 82 mm stand ages fig 6 4 discussion it is essential to maintain a sustainable soil water for vegetation especially in arid regions where water scarcity is the greatest restrictive factor for vegetation growth and sustainable development matzner et al 2003 song et al 2016a wei et al 2019 previous reports showed that p sylvestris was adapted to the environment of the semi arid sandy land areas and this species was suitable for establishment to reduce wind speed and thus to solidify sand song et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 however the improper varieties of artificial forest the high plantation density or water shortage all lead to more serious desertification again kerhoulas et al 2013 cao 2008 this study highlights the existence of a soil water bottleneck during the process of forest growth with the forest s stand ages 4 1 soil water variation with the increasing stand ages soil moisture plays a very important role in the driving growth patterns in semi arid environments wang et al 2017 specifically the emphasis of the data analysis in this study focused on the relationships between the stand ages and the soil water use of the planted forest in a semi arid sandy land in this study the main period of soil water decreasing was in 30 40 years after that soil water storage gradually increasing fig 3 the above phenomenon was attributed to plantation dieback which often occurred approximately 30 35 years after planting song et al 2016b song et al 2018 suggested that the most important reason for forest degradation and dieback was an unbalanced pattern of water due to the lack of direct use of precipitation liu et al 2017 also emphasized that the demand for water and other resources in forest is higher after approximately 30 40 years of plantation due to the individual gradually growth accompanied by an increased photosynthetic rate of the young pines in the study area an important reason of part of forest dying maybe due to water scarcity after 40 years resulted in a lower forest density fig 2 studies have indicated that p sylvestris entered the mature period when the stand ages were over 35 years song et al 2016b hence after 40 years not only the forest density were diminished but the growth rate also decreased and then the sws continued to be slowly consumed over time in the 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages moreover vertessy et al 2001 advanced that the leaf area index decreased with the increasing stand ages that reduced transpiration and canopy interception as the forest ages these effects increased rainfall infiltration and decreased the consumption of soil water 4 2 soil water distribution and consumption characteristics in the soil profile along stand ages soil water utilization depth of forest was increased with the increasing stand ages specifically the forest in 20 yr stand age obtained soil water mainly from shallow soil layer 0 200 cm and it was deeper in the 30 yr and the 40 yr forests which reached 400 cm soil layer with the increasing stand ages the utilize depth of soil water up to 1000 cm soil layer in 50 yr and 60 yr stand ages on the one hand the soil water utilization depth was highly correlated with the root distribution song et al 2016b previous study has reported that the roots of the p sylvestris were primarily distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layers the taproots were located between 0 and 400 cm and the lateral roots covered 200 300 cm of radius from the trunk and had a mass of root hairs zheng et al 2012 the range of root distribution were gradually broader with the increasing stand ages and aggravated deep soil water consumption drake et al 2011 kerhoulas et al 2013 song et al 2016a have reported that the planted forests with different stand ages use various water sources due to the differences in their vertical root distribution which lead to the difference of soil water distribution on the other hand evapotranspiration was different during different growing periods that influenced the soil water consumption intensity of forests water suction by roots was the important way to provide water for the growth and transpiration of plants verma et al 2014 in the dry lands evapotranspiration was generally several times higher than that of rainfall soil water consumption of vegetation transpiration induced the increasing degree and depth of soil water deficit once the soil water supply in the shallow layers 0 200 cm was insufficient planted pines needed more water to maintain a rapid growth rate after maturity the young forests consumed predominantly shallow soil water at the start of their growth while mature forests used both the shallow and deep soil water because of their deeper taproots kerhoulas et al 2013 liu et al 2015a 2015b deeper water sources play an important role in the response to droughts anderegg et al 2013 barbeta et al 2014 and it is effectively supplemented by groundwater musa et al 2019 the sws of the deep soil layer 800 1000 cm was higher compared to 0 800 cm soil layer and gradually decreased with the increasing stand ages this result demonstrated that the soil water consumption intensity and depth were increased with increasing stand ages this may be due to the prolonged root system aggravated deeper soil water usage causing the reduction of deep soil water liu et al 2018 observed that the finer roots of p sylvestris sought for deep layer water in order to deal with drought stress on the other hand although the groundwater can provide replenishment of soil water the deep soil water still declined with the stand age this may lead to the decline of groundwater level zheng et al 2012 this was explained by the planting of vegetation decreased the replenish of rainfall to soil water and increased the utilization of soil water that reduced the recharge to groundwater another aspect to consider was the instability of the groundwater recharge process that could also cause the deep soil water changes therefore we assumed that the soil water content in the deeper layers in this study was affected by both the forest ages and fluctuations of groundwater table over time moreover the stand ages of 20 30 yr showed the higher sws compared to bare land below the 200 cm soil depth in the bare sandy land the main soil water consumption was evaporation except for evaporation there is transpiration in the forests generally the water consumption intensity of evaporation is higher than that of transpiration liu et al 2015a 2015b the existence of plants restricted evaporation especially after rainfall while the sandy soil with higher infiltration rate and lower water holding capacity which resulted in the higher soil water content of forest in deeper soil layer than that of the bare land furthermore the planted forests gradually utilized the water resources of the deep soil layers by extending the root system but it also favored a release of the absorbed water into the shallow soil dawson 1996 meanwhile the distribution of soil water showed uneven discontinuous and irregular during the 60 year period our results proved that soil water was insufficient to replace serious soil water loss through the long term transpiration of plants and thus the utilization of soil water under the artificial forest was unbalanced forese thinning was proposed as a management tool to reduce net stand water use and improve water availability for remaining forests and reduced their dependence on deeper water which may decrease their subsequent drought vulnerability mcdowell and allen 2015 giuggiola et al 2013 zausen et al 2005 based on our findings and the available literatures we proposed that the artificial forest should be gradually thinned over the period of 30 40 years old when presented the highest degree of soil water storage decreasing to maintain the normal survival and sustainable development of forest vegetation 5 conclusions the benefits of the planted forest practices to control land degradation and wind erosion in semi arid sandy areas are in danger due to soil desiccation and dieback of artificial forests the important death rate of forest in the forest plantation was explained by the insufficient water supply with increasing the stand age our research showed that there were significant differences in the soil water storage of the planted forest with different stand ages the 20 yr forests mainly consumed shallow soil water 0 200 cm of soil depth the 30 yr and 40 yr forests mainly consumed the soil water stored at 0 400 cm depths and the 50 60 yr forest consumed the soil water of the 0 1000 cm soil layer importantly our findings showed that the main period of soil water storage decreasing was in 30 40 years after which the variation of soil water storage was gradually decreased in the studied semi arid sandy land the worst of the soil water decreasing for p sylvestris forests occurred during 30 40 years and later the soil water storage gradually increased due to and the decreasing forest density consequently therefore this study suggests that the intermediate felling may be considered for reducing soil water consumption for artificial forests to maintain the
