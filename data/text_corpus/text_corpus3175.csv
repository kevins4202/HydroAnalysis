15875,twelve sampling sites from two basins of lake chaohu were studied seasonally from june 2020 to april 2021 in hefei city china to better understand the effect of organic carbon c quantity and composition on nitrate no3 n reduction pathways serious algal bloom in the west basin of lake chaohu wlc resulted in higher organic c accumulation and no3 n deficiency in interstitial water compared to the east basin of lake chaohu elc jointly leading to a high c no3 n ratio this triggered dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra over denitrification in terms of higher dnra rate nitrogen retaining index nri and nrfa gene abundance mediating dnra furthermore high oxygen alkyl c and abundance of functional genes mediating labile organic c decomposition and dnra suggested that the alkyl carbon oxygen bond was responsible for dnra induction different bacterial community composition and diversity involved in c and nitrogen n metabolism in two basins indicated that bacteria in sediments of wlc were more active in no3 n reduction spearman correlation analysis showed that the less represented genera such as thiobacillus and clostridium were positively correlated with both organic c and no3 n reduction rates respectively hence organic c composition could affect no3 n reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words dnra denitrification organic carbon sediment 1 introduction recently eutrophication has become increasingly serious in many lakes the primary cause is the excessive input of nutrient elements such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p leading to the algal bloom zhang et al 2019a the input of n and p can be distinguished into exogenous input and endogenous input the response of algae and plankton to exogenous nutrients in eutrophic lakes is significantly slow or even non responsive moreover the endogenous input can still have an important impact on eutrophication and algal bloom even if the exogenous input of n and p is controlled the release of n and p from sediments has a great impact on eutrophication because of the high exchange surface between sediments and water and the most severe disturbance lang et al 2018 therefore the transformation pathways of n and p in sediments become particularly important no3 n reduction process includes denitrification and dnra denitrification can reduce no3 n to n2 and anammox can oxidize ammonium nh4 n to n2 using nitrite no2 n as the electron acceptor both of those are important n removal processes pauer and auer 2000 zhu et al 2010 they can effectively alleviate the environmental problems caused by excessive active n hou et al 2013 some studies have shown that denitrification contributes to n removal significantly compared to anammox in shallow lakes roland et al 2018 in lake taihu denitrification contributes more than 80 to nitrogen removal while anammox only accounts for approximately 10 zhao et al 2021 dnra process reduces no3 n to nh4 n which is an important n retention process in lakes gardner et al 2006 dnra is an internal circulation process of n which aggravates pollution when it is high denitrification is a process of removing lake nitrogen reflecting the self purification capacity of the ecosystem the relative contribution of dnra and denitrification to no3 n reduction is different the proportion of dnra to no3 n reduction varies from 2 nizzoli et al 2010 to 98 hietanen and kuparinen 2008 no3 n reduction processes denitrification and dnra are interrelated they have great ecological significance for balancing the n cycle in the lake no3 n reduction process is usually regulated by several factors such as temperature salinity no3 n organic c electron donors metal oxides and sulfides burgin and hamilton 2007 sher et al 2008 lu et al 2013 yin et al 2015 organic c has been considered the most important influencing factor as an electron donor for denitrification and the dnra process both the concentration and the quality of organic c affect the denitrification and dnra process organic c is positively correlated with the dnra rate at a certain concentration sun et al 2021 a high concentration of organic c promotes no3 n reduction by the dnra process limiting the denitrification process song et al 2013 hence organic c quantity regulated the partitioning of denitrification and dnra however the effect of organic carbon composition on the no3 n reduction process has not received enough attention we performed field investigations in lake chaohu with different eutrophic degrees and algal bloom scales to understand in detail the effect and mechanism of organic c quantity and composition on the no3 n reduction process the different n p and c compounds organic c fractionation and composition rate and functional genes involved in nitrate reduction and the microbial community composition in surface sediments and interstitial waters were analyzed monthly in wlc and elc of lake chaohu the following are the objectives of this study 1 to compare the rate of denitrification anammox and dnra and their contribution to n retention or loss 2 to characterize the functional genes and microbial community of no3 n reduction via metagenomic analysis 3 to clarify the roles of organic c quantity and composition on the relative balance between denitrification and dnra and 4 to speculate on the relationship between organic c no3 n reduction rate and microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection lake chaohu 31 25 31 43 n 117 16 117 51 e the fifth largest freshwater lake

and discussion 3 1 effect of c n on no3 n reduction pathway the tn tp dop no2 n and srp in surface water showed the highest concentration from june to october in more eutrophic wlc than elc after that followed similar trends between the two zones from december to april a significantly higher nh4 n concentration was recorded in surface water in june and december in more eutrophic wlc no3 n in surface water of elc exceeded that of wlc in july and august and it was still higher in wlc in other months serious algal bloom broke out in july and october in wlc increasing chl a concentration the doc accumulated in surface water was not significantly different between the two zones in all months fig 2 don srp no3 n dop and no2 n showed similar concentrations and trends in the interstitial water between the two zones however the doc and nh4 n in interstitial water of wlc were significantly higher than that of elc in approximately all months fig 3 in sediments content in wlc showed a higher concentration compared to elc prt and lip however tom and cho were at similar concentrations between the two zones fig 4 dnra dominated in the process of no3 n reduction in sediments in most of the months in the two zones in sediments of wlc the dnra rate was higher than that of elc from june to august and then it decreased the denitrification rate was similar in the two zones except in august where it was higher in the sediment of wlc the anammox rate was significantly low and negligible the nri index showed the highest values in wlc from june to october and in elc from december to april fig 5 overall high organic c in terms of prt in sediments of wlc induced high nh4 n concentrations during the algal bloom in the interstitial water coupled with anoxia in the water column in terms of do and orp table s1 due to algal bloom and microbial decomposition jointly contributing to nh4 n accumulation and no3 n deficiency in interstitial water of wlc figs 2 4 however high organic c in sediment and interstitial water of wlc especially during an algal bloom resulted in the high c no3 n fuelling the dnra process figs 3 5 this conclusion was further proved by the variation in dnra rate and c no3 n in terms of high cho doc in interstitial water dnra rate nri index and low no3 n in interstitial water figs 3 5 in sediments of elc during winter sediment c n has been proved to be the key abiotic factor accounting for the distinct dnra potential rates pang and ji 2019 dnra may occur under higher c n ratios and nitrate retention capacity was positively correlated with c n and c no3 n ratios zhang et al 2019b this study did not find a positive relationship between dnra and c no3 n in the sediment of wlc in winter spring and elc in summer autumn resulting in an ambiguous relationship based on all data analyses table 1 hence it was hypothesized that the relationship between dnra and c no3 n depended on specific environmental events and held a unique ecological significance for example high doc was excreted during algal bloom microcystis by algae and no3 n deficiency due to algal luxury assimilation for growing demand created high c no3 n ratios environmental condition which favored the growth of dnra positive bacteria dnra function was further fueled combined with the anoxia status additionally low n conditions led the ecosystem to retain n as much as possible by means of dnra over denitrification the observed mechanism should be considered as a pattern of algae bacterial mutuality microcystis and dnra positive bacteria a previously unidentified association between vibrio spp mediated dnra and prorocentrum dominated algal bloom was observed in the east china sea kim et al 2021 furthermore bacteria attached to microcystis cells in lake chaohu performed important functions in ammonia production through dnra yang et al 2021 indicating that dnra is also an important microbial process washbourne et al 2011 3 2 effect of organic c property on no3 n reduction pathway the main qualitative composition of organic c quality was aromatic and oxygen alkyl c in sediments of the two zones with wlc showing significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon than elc during an algal bloom the seasonal variation and difference between the two zones of alkyl and carboxyl c were inconspicuous fig 6 the abundance of functional genes mediating organic c decomposition especially glucosidase xylanase and endoglucanase with the nrfa gene mediating dnra showed higher values in the sediments of wlc during algal bloom compared to elc fig 7 all these results were found to be consistent with the high dnra rate in the sediments of wlc in summer fig 5 suggesting that the alkyl carbon oxygen bond is responsible for the induction of labile organic c decomposition and dnra process high oxygen alkyl c concentrations suggested phytoplankton communities as dominant sources maie et al 2005 furthermore oxygen alkyl c was proven to be more labile than the other c ono et al 2015 the significantly higher dnra rate found in the wlc sediments was consistent with the highest numbers of dnra positive microorganisms and fraction of labile c indicating that indigenous labile c was the key factor influencing the partitioning of nitrate reduction between denitrification and dnra yin et al 2002 hence oxygen alkyl c derived from algae fueled the dnra process during an algal bloom however denitrification and dnra usually co occurred in degrading aromatic c ribeiro et al 2018 this indicates that the degradation product of aromatic c facilitates the coexistence of denitrification and dnra positive bacteria 3 3 regulation of microorganisms on no3 n reduction pathway the dominant bacterial species were different in the sediment of the two zones in sediment of wlc the dominant species were mostly involved in c and n metabolism such as dnra positive bacteria geobacter and anaeromyxobacter denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas cupriavidus caldilinea lautropia and desulfuromonas nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas n fixing bacteria burkholderia and azoarcus methanogenic bacteria methanoregula methane oxidizing bacteria methylobacter aromatic compounds degradation bacteria syntrophus and anammox bacteria however the dominant species consisted of iron oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus nitrifying bacteria nitrosospira photosynthetic bacteria rubrivivax n fixing bacteria variovorax and c degradation bacteria gemmatimonas in the sediment of elc fig 8 hence it was apparent that bacteria in the sediment of wlc were more active in c and n metabolism especially dnra and denitrification process which is attributed to high c content species composition and anoxia status spearman correlation analysis showed that oxygen alkyl alkyl and aromatic c were positively correlated with bacteria that functioned no3 n reduction such as denitrifying bacteria thiobacillus anammox bacteria candidatus sulfopaludibacter dnra bacteria anaeromyxobacter and clostridium furthermore denitrification and dnra rate were positively correlated with thiobacillus staphylococcus and clostridium respectively more denitrification and dnra bacteria such as sreroidobacter rubrivivax pseudomonas and geobacter were not associated with both organic c and rate fig 9 these outcomes demonstrate that organic c composition can determine no3 n reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community organic c composition can be as important as c concentration in determining the no3 n reduction pathway carlson et al 2020 additionally positive relation existed among oxygen alkyl c paraburkholderia and massilia functioning labile organic c degradation fig 9 indicating that different c fractions induced the production of specific decomposing bacteria a microbial community with no3 n reduction function was adapted to process typically encountered organic matter salk et al 2017 hence the complexity of organic c composition led to the diversity of microbial community structures with no3 n reduction function most of which were performed by less representative bacterial species 4 conclusions higher organic c accumulation derived from algal excretion and no3 n deficiency due to biological assimilation and blocked nitrification resulted from anoxia in sediment during an algal bloom jointly leading to high c no3 n fuelling the dnra over denitrification furthermore low n conditions drove the ecosystem to retain n as much as possible via the dnra pathway which should be considered a pattern of algae bacterial mutualism high oxygen alkyl c the main organic c composition and abundance of functional genes mediating organic c decomposition and dnra coupled with high dnra rate in sediment during an algal bloom suggested that oxygen alkyl c was responsible for the induction of organic c decomposition and dnra process it can be deduced that oxygen alkyl c derived from algae is more labile facilitating dnra positive bacterial growth obviously different bacterial community compositions and diversity involved in c and n metabolism in sediments with algal bloom and non algal bloom indicate that bacteria in sediment with algal bloom are more active in no3 n reduction the complexity of organic c composition led to the diversity of microbial community structure with no3 n reduction function however spearman correlation analysis showed that less represented bacterial species such as thiobacillus and clostridium was positively correlated with both organic c and relative rate respectively hence organic c composition can determine no3 n reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

the changes in related parameters in the water and sediments furthermore delta 5 3 1 was used to integrate the nmr images to obtain the proportional relationship between each component spss 20 software was used to calculate the pearson s correlation coefficients among the data moreover the r software was used to prepare heatmaps based on the abundance of relative functional genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n on no3 n reduction pathway the tn tp dop no2 n and srp in surface water showed the highest concentration from june to october in more eutrophic wlc than elc after that followed similar trends between the two zones from december to april a significantly higher nh4 n concentration was recorded in surface water in june and december in more eutrophic wlc no3 n in surface water of elc exceeded that of wlc in july and august and it was still higher in wlc in other months serious algal bloom broke out in july and october in wlc increasing chl a concentration the doc accumulated in surface water was not significantly different between the two zones in all months fig 2 don srp no3 n dop and no2 n showed similar concentrations and trends in the interstitial water between the two zones however the doc and nh4 n in interstitial water of wlc were significantly higher than that of elc in approximately all months fig 3 in sediments content in wlc showed a higher concentration compared to elc prt and lip however tom and cho were at similar concentrations between the two zones fig 4 dnra dominated in the process of no3 n reduction in sediments in most of the months in the two zones in sediments of wlc the dnra rate was higher than that of elc from june to august and then it decreased the denitrification rate was similar in the two zones except in august where it was higher in the sediment of wlc the anammox rate was significantly low and negligible the nri index showed the highest values in wlc from june to october and in elc from december to april fig 5 overall high organic c in terms of prt in sediments of wlc induced high nh4 n concentrations during the algal bloom in the interstitial water coupled with anoxia in the water column in terms of do and orp table s1 due to algal bloom and microbial decomposition jointly contributing to nh4 n accumulation and no3 n deficiency in interstitial water of wlc figs 2 4 however high organic c in sediment and interstitial water of wlc especially during an algal bloom resulted in the high c no3 n fuelling the dnra process figs 3 5 this conclusion was further proved by the variation in dnra rate and c no3 n in terms of high cho doc in interstitial water dnra rate nri index and low no3 n in interstitial water figs 3 5 in sediments of elc during winter sediment c n has been proved to be the key abiotic factor accounting for the distinct dnra potential rates pang and ji 2019 dnra may occur under higher c n ratios and nitrate retention capacity was positively correlated with c n and c no3 n ratios zhang et al 2019b this study did not find a positive relationship between dnra and c no3 n in the sediment of wlc in winter spring and elc in summer autumn resulting in an ambiguous relationship based on all data analyses table 1 hence it was hypothesized that the relationship between dnra and c no3 n depended on specific environmental events and held a unique ecological significance for example high doc was excreted during algal bloom microcystis by algae and no3 n deficiency due to algal luxury assimilation for growing demand created high c no3 n ratios environmental condition which favored the growth of dnra positive bacteria dnra function was further fueled combined with the anoxia status additionally low n conditions led the ecosystem to retain n as much as possible by means of dnra over denitrification the observed mechanism should be considered as a pattern of algae bacterial mutuality microcystis and dnra positive bacteria a previously unidentified association between vibrio spp mediated dnra and prorocentrum dominated algal bloom was observed in the east china sea kim et al 2021 furthermore bacteria attached to microcystis cells in lake chaohu performed important functions in ammonia production through dnra yang et al 2021 indicating that dnra is also an important microbial process washbourne et al 2011 3 2 effect of organic c property on no3 n reduction pathway the main qualitative composition of organic c quality was aromatic and oxygen alkyl c in sediments of the two zones with wlc showing significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon than elc during an algal bloom the seasonal variation and difference between the two zones of alkyl and carboxyl c were inconspicuous fig 6 the abundance of functional genes mediating organic c decomposition especially glucosidase xylanase and endoglucanase with the nrfa gene mediating dnra showed higher values in the sediments of wlc during algal bloom compared to elc fig 7 all these results were found to be consistent with the high dnra rate in the sediments of wlc in summer fig 5 suggesting that the alkyl carbon oxygen bond is responsible for the induction of labile organic c decomposition and dnra process high oxygen alkyl c concentrations suggested phytoplankton communities as dominant sources maie et al 2005 furthermore oxygen alkyl c was proven to be more labile than the other c ono et al 2015 the significantly higher dnra rate found in the wlc sediments was consistent with the highest numbers of dnra positive microorganisms and fraction of labile c indicating that indigenous labile c was the key factor influencing the partitioning of nitrate reduction between denitrification and dnra yin et al 2002 hence oxygen alkyl c derived from algae fueled the dnra process during an algal bloom however denitrification and dnra usually co occurred in degrading aromatic c ribeiro et al 2018 this indicates that the degradation product of aromatic c facilitates the coexistence of denitrification and dnra positive bacteria 3 3 regulation of microorganisms on no3 n reduction pathway the dominant bacterial species were different in the sediment of the two zones in sediment of wlc the dominant species were mostly involved in c and n metabolism such as dnra positive bacteria geobacter and anaeromyxobacter denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas cupriavidus caldilinea lautropia and desulfuromonas nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas n fixing bacteria burkholderia and azoarcus methanogenic bacteria methanoregula methane oxidizing bacteria methylobacter aromatic compounds degradation bacteria syntrophus and anammox bacteria however the dominant species consisted of iron oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus nitrifying bacteria nitrosospira photosynthetic bacteria rubrivivax n fixing bacteria variovorax and c degradation bacteria gemmatimonas in the sediment of elc fig 8 hence it was apparent that bacteria in the sediment of wlc were more active in c and n metabolism especially dnra and denitrification process which is attributed to high c content species composition and anoxia status spearman correlation analysis showed that oxygen alkyl alkyl and aromatic c were positively correlated with bacteria that functioned no3 n reduction such as denitrifying bacteria thiobacillus anammox bacteria candidatus sulfopaludibacter dnra bacteria anaeromyxobacter and clostridium furthermore denitrification and dnra rate were positively correlated with thiobacillus staphylococcus and clostridium respectively more denitrification and dnra bacteria such as sreroidobacter rubrivivax pseudomonas and geobacter were not associated with both organic c and rate fig 9 these outcomes demonstrate that organic c composition can determine no3 n reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community organic c composition can be as important as c concentration in determining the no3 n reduction pathway carlson et al 2020 additionally positive relation existed among oxygen alkyl c paraburkholderia and massilia functioning labile organic c degradation fig 9 indicating that different c fractions induced the production of specific decomposing bacteria a microbial community with no3 n reduction function was adapted to process typically encountered organic matter salk et al 2017 hence the complexity of organic c composition led to the diversity of microbial community structures with no3 n reduction function most of which were performed by less representative bacterial species 4 conclusions higher organic c accumulation derived from algal excretion and no3 n deficiency due to biological assimilation and blocked nitrification resulted from anoxia in sediment during an algal bloom jointly leading to high c no3 n fuelling the dnra over denitrification furthermore low n conditions drove the ecosystem to retain n as much as possible via the dnra pathway which should be considered a pattern of algae bacterial mutualism high oxygen alkyl c the main organic c composition and abundance of functional genes mediating organic c decomposition and dnra coupled with high dnra rate in sediment during an algal bloom suggested that oxygen alkyl c was responsible for the induction of organic c decomposition and dnra process it can be deduced that oxygen alkyl c derived from algae is more labile facilitating dnra positive bacterial growth obviously different bacterial community compositions and diversity involved in c and n metabolism in sediments with algal bloom and non algal bloom indicate that bacteria in sediment with algal bloom are more active in no3 n reduction the complexity of organic c composition led to the diversity of microbial community structure with no3 n reduction function however spearman correlation analysis showed that less represented bacterial species such as thiobacillus and clostridium was positively correlated with both organic c and relative rate respectively hence organic c composition can determine no3 n reduction function by shaping the specific bacterial community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15876,biological carbon pump bcp in karst areas has received intensive attention for years due to their significant contribution to the global missing carbon sink the stability of autochthonous dissolved organic matter auto dom produced by bcp in karst aquatic ecosystems may play a critical role in the missing carbon sink however the source of dissolved organic matter dom in inland waters and its consumption by planktonic bacteria have not been thoroughly examined recalcitrant dissolved organic matter rdom may exist in karst aquatic ecosystem as in the ocean through the study of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and the interaction between cdom and the planktonic bacterial community under different land uses at the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site sw china we found that c2 as the fluorescence component of auto dom mineralised by planktonic bacteria may have some of the characteristics of rdom and is an important dom source in karst aquatic ecosystems the stability ratio fmax c2 c1 c2 of auto dom reached 89 6 6 71 in winter and 64 1 7 19 in spring moreover correlation based network analysis determined that the planktonic bacterial communities were controlled by different fluorescence types of cdom of which c1 fresh auto dom c3 conventional allochthonous dom allo dom and c4 the allo dom mineralised by bacteria were clustered in one module together with prevalent organic degrading planktonic bacteria c2 was clustered in another tightly combined module suggesting specific microbial utilization strategies for the c2 component in addition some important planktonic bacterium and functional genes including chemotrophic heterotrophs and photosynthetic bacteria were found to be affected by high ca2 and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations in karst aquatic ecosystems our research showed that auto dom may be as an important carbon sink as the allo dom in karst ecosystems the former generally being neglected based on a posit that it is easily and first mineralized by planktonic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bcp autochthonous dissolved organic matter stability planktonic bacteria karst aquatic ecosystem eem parafrac 1 introduction in recent years much research has focused on the location of missing carbon sinks schindler 1999 ciais et al 2013 kirschbaum et al 2019 liu et al 2021 an increasing number of studies have suggested that inland water play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and deserves further study cole et al 2007 liu et al 2018 2021 recently researchers have reported that in karst areas aquatic photosynthetic organisms can take up dissolved inorganic carbon dic converting it into organic carbon and fixing it when they die biological remains are buried in reservoirs and lakes creating a stable carbon sink in inland waters liu et al 2010 2011 2018 2021 the missing carbon sink associated with the strengthening of autochthonous production ap in inland ecosystems has been estimated to range from 0 38 to 1 8 gt c yr 1 with large uncertainties liu et al 2021 ap is an important carbon sink and dissolved organic carbon doc accounts for more than 80 of the total organic carbon toc especially in karst lake water columns doc is the dominant indicator of autochthonous productivity in karstic aquatic ecosystems noges et al 2016 he et al 2022 which is generally neglected in the calculation of the carbon budget based on the assumption that doc is readily mineralised by planktonic bacteria sawakuchi et al 2017 drake et al 2018 ran et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to study the stability of doc in inland waters to assess missing global carbon sinks around the world based on the carbon isotope values the high dic concentrations promotes both phytoplankton and aquatic plant photosynthetic production photosynthetic autochthonous organic carbon contributes 60 80 of the total sediment and particulate organic carbon poc in karst aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2016 he et al 2020 huang et al 2020 he et al 2021 applied the excitation emission matrix eem spectrum method and found that the dic fertilization effect directly promoted autochthonous doc auto doc formation and indirectly promoted microbial sourced doc in the lijiang river these results confirmed the existence of a biological carbon pump bcp in karst areas however the stability of auto doc in the water has not been explored and it remains unclear what is the strategy of planktonic bacteria in the water column to consume auto doc in aquatic ecosystems dom has been classified based on its origin autochthonous or allochthonous and bioavailability labile or recalcitrant muscarella et al 2019 much research has been conducted on allochthonous organic matter and the parts that flow into lakes are regarded as difficult to degrade recent reports have challenged this scenario by showing fast planktonic bacterial utilization of a highly labile pool of low molecular weight compounds of allochthonous origin in boreal streams ågren et al 2008 berggren et al 2010 leading to the possibility that allochthonous doc allo doc could fuel carbon degradation by planktonic bacteria at different time scales holmes et al 2008 ward et al 2013 the concentration of auto doc in freshwater lakes depends mainly on aquatic primary productivity and the degradation of planktonic bacteria interactions between doc and planktonic bacteria are central to biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems heterogeneous microorganisms in water bodies employ doc as the main carbon source while previous studies suggest that many primary production forms are preferentially degraded and eventually consumed by approximately 80 westrich and berner 1984 cole et al 1988 guillemette et al 2013 2017 previous studies have suggested that molecular weight chemical composition and elemental metrology are the basis for microbial consumption of organic carbon chrost et al 1983 amon and benner 1996 the organic carbon in algae is regarded as simple labile composed of small molecules and easily consumed by planktonic bacteria chrost and faust 1983 amon and benner 1996 berggren et al 2010 berggren and del giorgio 2015 which may explain why the budget of auto doc has been neglected in previous studies however studies have shown that the preferential breakdown and metabolites of auto doc are resistant to microbial remineralization ogawa et al 2001 hach et al 2020 defrancesco et al 2021 the influence of auto doc on planktonic bacterial communities has been demonstrated by incubating planktonic bacteria with different sources of doc in laboratory studies perez and sommaruga 2006 guillemette et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 2021a the difficulty in distinguishing auto dom and allo dom in the complex field environment and the limitations of laboratory tests are challenges in the study of the utilization of doc by planktonic bacteria in the field environments moreover the disturbance of the phytoplankton community structure caused by various complex environmental factors in natural lakes may distort the degradation dynamics between auto dom and planktonic bacteria therefore we required an ecosystem with clear sources of organic matter and relatively independent influencing factors which would allow for an understanding of the degradation dynamics of autochthonous and allochthonous dom by planktonic bacteria the key to solving the above problems is to distinguish the sources of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and construct a relationship between planktonic bacteria and each component many scholars have made great efforts to study the distinction between autochthonous and allochthonous sources of cdom but there are still many disputes recently the combination of the eem and fluorescence regional integration has been used to quantify the abundance and dynamics of dom components in inland water yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 moreover the rapid development of metagenomic technology has provided deep insight into the dynamics of planktonic bacterial communities in the field legendre and gallagher 2001 in particular the emergence of network analysis methods has played a key role in explaining changes in lake microbial communities and environmental interactions eiler et al 2012 barberan et al 2012 kara et al 2013 to date researchers have focused on the interspecific interactions of lake communities but ignored the relationship between dom and planktonic bacterial community metabolic activities as the carbon source and main nutrient understanding the relationship between dom and planktonic bacterial community metabolic activities is crucial for understanding the consumption strategies of planktonic bacteria zhang et al 2020 here we present the results of planktonic bacterial changes and cdom in four seasons under five different land uses at the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site sw china the variation in the intensity of the cdom fluorescence peak fmax indicates the variation in the concentrations of the different components murphy et al 2013 high throughput sequencing of 16 s and parallel factor modeling parafac of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to answer the following three questions 1 how do seasonal changes affect the composition of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of cdom in karst aquatic ecosystems under different land uses 2 what are the effects of organic matter input from different proportions of autochthonous and allochthonous sources on the planktonic bacterial community structure 3 how do dic concentrations influence planktonic bacteria in relation to the carbon cycle under different land uses we hypothesised that auto dom formed through the microbial carbon pump mcp in karst aquatic ecosystems may be stabilised in certain environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the test site the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site 26 14 26 15

s3 grassland s4 and shrubland s5 each ecosystem was composed of a concrete tank that was 20 m long 5 m wide and 3 m deep and coated with epoxy resin to avoid the influence of concrete erosion on the tank hydrochemistry zeng et al 2017 the bare rock tank was filled with dolomitic limestone gravel without soil the bare soil tank was filled with soil and dolomitic limestone gravel but was not planted with any vegetation the cultivated land tank was planted with corn from april to october and a moderate amount of compound fertiliser was applied at the same time as the seed in april when corn died it was buried in situ in 2014 alfalfa and roxburgh rose were planted in grassland and shrubland tanks respectively and were never harvested bao et al 2021 fig s1 there were side drainage holes in each tank feeding artificial ponds p1 p5 which simulated natural karst springs s1 s5 fig 1c each pond and its associated spring system simulated a precisely known single land use catchment of the same size zeng et al 2017 in june 2019 chara spp the dominant submerged plants in karst aquatic ecosystems were transplanted into the ponds from a nearby river basin bao et al 2020 more details on the tanks and ponds are provided in the supporting information 2 2 sample collection and monitoring of environmental parameters samples were collected in july and october 2020 and january and april

half analysis and random initialization were used to validate the identified components the maximum fluorescence intensity of each parafac component fmax and the percentage of each parafac component in the water samples were calculated stedmon and markager 2005 the position of the parafac component was determined using the fmax value of the component and its ex and em wavelengths 2 4 dna

2010 otu taxonomic data were obtained using uclust v1 2 22 to compare the representative sequences of otus with the silva version 132 16s rrna databases functional gene annotation was performed using functional annotation of the prokaryotic taxa faprotax louca et al 2017 the 16s rrna gene sequences were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the number prjna810372 2 5 statistical analysis the otus were combined with four cdom and three hydrochemical parameter components to construct a network the psych pair r package was used to calculate the spearman correlation coefficient p between otus with a total of more than 96 and the fmax of cdom components in the sample and hydrochemical parameters to reduce the complexity of the dataset the relative abundance of otus 0 01 with significant correlations p 0 05 and robust correlations r 0 6 were chosen zhou et al 2021b random networks with equal numbers of nodes and edges to real networks were generated based on erdös rényi random networks erdös and rényi 2011 gephi v9 2 was used for attribute calculation of the network module detection and visualization we determined the connectivity of each node based on

community log n 1 we converted the environmental variables by log10 x 1 except for ph and conducted a collinearity analysis on the environmental factors to remove the high variance inflation factor vif 20 peng et al 2021 the redundancy analysis rda function was performed using canoco5 software to explain the relationship between the composition of the microbial community and environmental factors oksanen et al 2018 spearman correlation coefficients between the four cdom components and the relative abundance of the planktonic bacterial community were calculated using the spss software mantel tests were performed to compare environmental factors abundant genera and keystone taxa 3 results 3 1 physiochemical properties of the five different ponds the physiochemical parameters of the water in the five ponds p1 p5 showed obvious seasonal variations fig s2 water ph ranged from 8 09 to 9 29 the hco3 concentrations ranged from 1 2 mmol l to 3 9 mmol l high concentrations of hco3 occurred in p4 and p5 in contrast low hco3 concentrations were observed in p1 and p2 the ponds were characterised by high saturated concentrations of do in spring summer and autumn 130 235 but low values in winter chl a generally showed temporal and spatial dynamics similar to do with the maximum in p4 and p5 4 94 μg l and 3 07 μg l in summer and 2 04 μg l and 1 63 μg l in spring respectively unlike chl a and do there were steady variations in toc over the first three seasons and increases in spring 3 2 changes in cdom compositions in different pond waters four distinct components were identified fig s3 with ex em wavelengths of 230 280 326 nm 255 381 444 nm 275 340 466 nm and 310 412 nm component c1 represents tyrosine like peak b fluorophores zhou et al 2019 c2 c3 and c4 showed analogous positioning to different humus like fluorophores c2 was categorised as low molecular humus like peak m fluorophores associated with autochthonous production coble 1996 fellman et al 2010 mudarra et al 2011 mcintyre and gueguen 2013 c3 represented allochthonous humus like peak c fluorophores with a high molecular weight and aromatic organic compounds amaral et al 2021 and c4 was categorised as microbial humus like fluorophores peak m wang et al 2012 hambly et al 2015 amaral et al 2020 fig 2 the tyrosine like component c1 represented amino acids derived from plankton the fmax of c1 was low in winter 0 018 0 0198 r u but high in spring 0 152 0 0365 r u fig 3 a the low molecular component c2 which was humus like changed greatly from summer and autumn 0 014 0 0064 r u to winter and spring 0 202 0 0466 r u and was the dominated fluorescence component in winter and spring fig 3a the fmax values of components c1 and c2 showed a trend similar to that of the toc c3 which represented allochthonous humus like features showed a slight change over the four seasons microbial humus like c4 was the dominated fluorescence component in summer and autumn accounted for 39 16 5 99 of all components in the five ponds and halved in winter and spring to 22 50 3 61 stability refers to the resistance to degradation of microorganisms biosynthetic compounds not modified by secondary abiotic reactions are presumably to be resistant to degradation on the long term benner et al 1992 dittmar 2015 the cellular and degradation products of microbes can be selectively preserved due to their chemical structure and adsorption to mineral surfaces sollins et al 1996 von lützow et al 2006 liang et al 2017 we defined the stability ratio as the proportion of mineralised organic matter in the total organic matter fmax of each source autochthonous or allochthonous c2 and c4 represent the components of organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous sources respectively after mineralization by microorganisms we can summarise these as the stable components of the two sources for example the stability ratio of auto dom was fmax c2 c1 c2 and that of allo dom was fmax c4 c3 c4 fig 3b shows that the stability ratio of auto dom was low in summer 16 8 7 00 and autumn 20 6 3 84 and high in winter 89 6 6 71 and spring 64 1 7 19 the stability of the two components from the same source is different the sources of the two auto dom are mixed the fresh auto dom such as tryptophan is easily degraded which makes auto dom seeming to be labile the stability ratio therefore should be used to quantify the stability of different sources to obtain a clearer understanding of the importance of auto dom in carbon sinks auto dom had two different phases throughout the year summer to autumn and winter to spring however the stability ratio of the allo dom was the same throughout the year 3 3 composition of planktonic bacterial communities in total 47 991 clean 16s rrna gene sequences and 5154 otus were obtained during macroalgal degradation the coverage of each sample was greater than 0 97 these otus at a 3 dissimilarity threshold were classified into 43 phyla 113 classes 326 orders 619 families and 1074 genera owing to the high proportion of proteobacteria at the phylum level fig s4a to facilitate our in depth analysis we divided it into three subgroups alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria at the phylum level a total of 25 major phyla 0 01 were detected in the samples from different ponds during the four seasons fig s4a proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla while actinobacteria disappeared in winter in summer alphaproteobacteria were rare in p4 and p5 whereas bacteroidetes were abundant in p3 and p4 the community structure of the five ponds in winter was similar to that in summer however the dominance of bacteroides in p3 and p4 decreased significantly whereas actinobacteria abundance increased gammaproteobacteria dominated the five ponds during the winter in spring the changes among the five ponds were different from those in other seasons especially in p4 and p5 limnohabitans microbacteriaceae f polynucleobacter hgcl clade and sediminibacterium were enriched in the ponds 67 3 fig s4b except in spring polynucleobacter were generally prevalent in p5 36 4 in summer 29 5 in autumn and 45 2 in winter and a higher abundance appeared only in p4 in spring sphingopyxis decreased in p4 and p5 except in spring whereas it increased in p4 in spring the abundance of the hgcl clade increased extremely in spring 4 discussion 4 1 effects of dic fertilization on spatiotemporal changes in fluorescence components the hco3 concentrations showed large spatiotemporal variations in the five ponds due to different seasons and land uses in our experiment the major factor affecting hco3 concentrations was the influence of spring water input caused by changes in soil respiration under different vegetation coverage conditions zeng et al 2019 p4 reflected the influence of grassland with more litter more developed roots more soil microbes and the largest soil respiration in the alfalfa planting period resulting in the highest hco3 concentrations of s4 in spring water p3 and p5 had less development of plants than p4 thus their hco3 concentrations were lower the higher do concentrations in p4 and p5 during the growing season combined with the higher hco3 concentrations indicated a more intense bcp in the two ponds bao et al 2020 this was in agreement with previous research showing that hydrochemistry under different land uses may influence the primary productivity in the corresponding surface waters hayes et al 2015 bao et al 2020 organic matter produced by primary production could be accompanied by photodegradation and biodegradation and its composition could change we found that the fmax of c1 and c2 which represented autochthonous organic matter were higher in p4 and p5 fig s5 previous studies have shown that dic fertilization affects aquatic photosynthesis in pond ecosystems zeng et al 2019 therefore the higher fmax of c1 in p4 which represents fresh auto dom may have been due to dic fertilization simultaneously c2 had the highest fmax in water he et al 2021 found that c2 is positively correlated with dic in the lijiang river we speculated that in addition to dic fertilisation the stability of dom at high dic levels may be another cause a previous study at the site bao et al 2020 showed that diatoms were the dominant algae in p4 and were more conducive to preservation as they had more stable components than other algae landa et al 2014 to explore the characteristics of organic matter from different sources we analysed the contribution rate and stability ratio of auto dom and found that from the perspective of the contribution rate the total fmax values of the four components were almost the same in summer autumn and winter but increased significantly in spring which was consistent with the change in toc this was mainly due to the increase in autochthonous components during winter and spring fig 3a the proportion of the c2 component in winter and spring was approximately 47 1 9 60 a significant proportion of inland water previous studies have shown that the dom decomposition rate in theory could be a function of its concentration dittmar et al 2015 and the high fmax of c2 in these two seasons not only indicates a high concentration but also explains the resistance of c2 to microbial degradation the release of autochthonous components from planktonic and submerged ecosystems began in november and auto dom especially c2 was not the highest in summer with the increase in rainfall in summer the c2 components released by the decay of algae in the previous year were removed by water flow whereas the newly formed planktonic and submerged components were still in the growing season only a small portion of the c2 components was released and the high deposition flux in summer also resulted in more fixed organic matter settling into the sediment in the form of poc these results coincide with the fact that planktonic bacteria may produce humus like substances in lakes after modifying protein like substances thereby increasing the proportion of humus like substances and decreasing the proportion of protein like substances hanamachi et al 2008 this has been proven in incubation experiments with samples from the tibetan plateau and the antarctic region zhou et al 2019 the stability ratio indicated that auto dom was preserved in the form of c2 the stability of allo dom c4 has been proven in previous studies guillemette et al 2013 2017 zhou et al 2021a which suggests that the stability ratio defined is meaningful from another perspective allo dom is the result of multiple mineralizations by microorganisms in soil and spring water and it is more stable than fresh organic matter formed in lakes stability ratio in our research is therefore a relative concept since the dilution limits and recalcitrant mechanism are still an important debate question to research in the ocean jiao et al 2010 arrieta et al 2015 the organic matter produced by aquatic plants may be used by planktonic bacteria similar to terrestrial plants and the recalcitrant humus is eventually buried and preserved thus this part of organic matter should not be ignored when discussing the contribution of inland lakes to global carbon sinks the importance of autochthonous production in inland lake carbon sinks could be neglected if one compares mineralised allo dom with fresh auto dom rather than compare the stability of the metabolic products of both there have been many experiments on bacterial degradation of phytoplankton both in ocean and inland waters hanamachi et al 2008 found that although the phytoplankton produced organic matter is readily used by planktonic bacteria quickly molecular rearrangement by planktonic bacteria is an important factor in auto dom burial in addition the algal organic groups were divided into neutral aldoses amino acids fatty acids the organic composition of the labile fraction of phytoplanktonic organic matter was found to vary depending on the phytoplankton groups diatoms have a more recalcitrant organic component glycine hecky et al 1973 diatoms are a class of phytoplankton sensitive to carbon high dic and ca2 levels are important characteristics of karst aquatic ecosystems higher co2 concentrations lead diatoms to increase in abundance tortell et al 2002 low décarie 2015 allowing diatoms to dominate phytoplankton communities in this aquatic ecosystem 4 2 effects of cdom components and hydrochemical properties on the composition of planktonic bacteria we demonstrated that different cdom components and physicochemical properties were crucial drivers of planktonic bacterial composition in the five ponds the relationship between planktonic bacteria and environmental factors was determined by rda at different classification levels at the phylum level fig 4 a t ph and c1 p 0 05 played a vital role in structuring the abundant bacterial compositions and t was the dominant environmental factor affecting the planktonic bacterial community which was mainly reflected in the seasons hco3 and humus like c3 also played a role in some planktonic bacterial communities at the genus level fig 4b t chl a c1 and c4 were the main factors affecting the planktonic bacterial compositions p 0 05 this relationship suggests that humus like components may also influenced planktonic bacterial communities which differs from the results of previous studies on the qingliu river zhang et al 2020 this was because our research area showed little anthropogenic pollution while previous research focused mainly on rivers flowing through the cities and industrial zones exogenous pollutants would greatly cover the influence of auto dom and allo dom on the microbial community which would impede the exploration of the influence of dom on planktonic bacteria the clear boundaries of our study area make it clear that the planktonic bacterial community was affected by the karst environment and allowed us to determine the organic matter utilization strategy of planktonic bacteria in addition we found that c1 had a significant effect on the community structure but c2 did not show this effect these results suggest that in addition to t and ph both auto dom and allo dom can affect planktonic bacterial communities in natural karst aquatic ecosystems however the dom components after mineralization may have no significant effect on planktonic bacteria due to their recalcitrant nature through the above analysis we constructed spearman correlations between the percentages of the four cdom components and the concentrations of hco3 co2 aq and ca2 and the relative abundance of planktonic bacteria in the five ponds these results suggest that tryptophan like c1 and humus like c3 and c4 have synergistic effects on most planktonic bacteria at the phylum level most planktonic bacteria were simultaneously negatively correlated with the four components fig 5 a p 0 05 the phylum actinobacteria was significantly positively correlated with c1 p 0 01 whereas gammaproteobacteria was negatively correlated with c1 p 0 05 the former is considered competitive under resource poor and aromatic rich conditions li et al 2020 and the latter responds to the enrichment of diatom derived dom landa et al 2014 and utilises proteins amino acids and extracellular polysaccharides blanchet et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the relationship between the two phyla and c1 illustrates the competitive relationship between them which is consistent with the results obtained in previous laboratory degradation experiments zhou et al 2021a in addition the significant negative relationship between co2 aq and actinobacteria indicated that the competitive advantage of this phylum would gradually decreased in water with higher co2 aq bacteroidetes are capable of decomposing carbohydrates starch polysaccharides and hydrolytic cellulose bauer et al 2006 although no significant correlation was found between bacteroidetes and the related components in our study the extremely significant positive correlation between bacteroidetes and ca2 indicates that chemotrophic heterotrophic planktonic bacteria occupy a dominant position in a high ca2 environment alphaproteobacteria the dominant planktonic bacteria in the community fig s4a was negatively related to humus like c3 c4 and hco3 p 0 05 and was competitive under resource poor and aromatic rich conditions low toc concentrations characterise all ponds with the mean value of 1 35 mg l and the maximum of 7 79 mg l occurring in spring in such a low resource environment although alphaproteobacteria can become the most abundant planktonic bacteria there is still a negative correlation between alphaproteobacteria and the two allochthonous components this was contrary to the results of the research on the response of planktonic bacteria in composition and function to the various dom in the qinhuai river zhang et al 2020 as the newly imported unstable dom would be consumed quickly notably the relationship between the c2 and planktonic bacteria was significantly different from that of the other components in particular no correlation was observed between the c2 and several key chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria at the genus level our research showed that there was no preference between humus like and tryptophan like component consumption in the genus polynucleobacter fig 5b this is inconsistent with the previous studies showing that polynucleobacter prefers allochthonous humus in aquatic ecosystems steinberg 2014 adesanoye 2015 zhang et al 2020 there was a strong relationship between the hgcl clade and c1 which mainly degrades cyanobacteria the hgcl clade was negatively correlated with co2 aq indicating that there were fewer cyanobacteria in the high co2 aq environment which is consistent with the conclusion found at the same research site that diatoms and chlorophyta were more suitable for growth than cyanobacteria under a high dic environment and appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus conditions bao et al 2021 the abundant genera limnohabitans and sphingomonas were significantly related to c1 c3 and c4 because limnohabitans can utilise substrates produced by different algae steinberg 2014 adesanoye 2015 karel et al 2020 sphingomonas is capable of energy metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation metabolism li et al 2020 the relationship between the cdom components and these planktonic bacteria was negative because the poor resource environment as mentioned above led to insufficient organic matter at the same time in addition to polynucleobacter we found that the above abundant genera associated with organic matter degradation had no relationship with c2 this further confirmed the specific planktonic bacterial utilization characteristics of this component 4 3 carbon dominates the co occurrence network of planktonic bacteria in the five ponds to examine the interrelationship between selected otus with cdom components and three hydrochemical indices a co occurrence network of five ponds in four seasons was constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus with the four cdom components and three hydrochemical indices thus we elucidated the interactions among key planktonic bacterial communities from a new perspective fig 6 according to our results 1252 edges were captured among 169 nodes indicating a significant interrelation between the abundant species the network diameter average path length average clustering coefficient and modularity of the real network were higher than those in the erdös rényi random network table s1 the nodes were divided into 17 planktonic phyla proteobacteria including gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and patescilbacteria accounted for 72 18 the abundant genera hgcl clade polynucleobacter flavobacterium sphingomonas and janthinobacterium exhibited strong connections the nodes were divided into 13 modules among which six modules had a strong correlation tyrosine like c1 and the humus like c3 and c4 were found in modules ii and c2 was in module i hydrochemical indices such as ca2 hco3 and co2 aq were aggregated in module iii the species in module i primarily belonged to gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria the nodes in module ii showed the highest average degree and closeness centralities fig s6 indicating a stronger community relationship and mainly included gammaproteobacteria bacteroidetes deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria generally the degradation of organic matter and the adaptation of planktonic bacteria to the environment is a community behavior berry and widder 2014 therefore using the co occurrence diagram we can more clearly explain the characteristics of the consumption of organic matter by planktonic bacteria and the influence of environmental changes seventeen genera including hgci clade flavobacterium polynucleobacter burkholderiaceae hydrogenophag chloroplast and legionella module hubs and connectors were the keystone taxa in our network fig s7a no network hubs pi 0 62 and zi 2 5 were detected in the network most keystone taxa were rare planktonic bacteria which was in agreement with previous studies shi et al 2016 the disappearance of keystone taxa in certain environments causes the disassembly of modules and networks but the importance of keystone taxa play depends on the environmental changes lupatini et al 2014 to further clarify the influence of environmental factors on the microbial communities and keystone taxa we conducted a mantel test fig s7b the abundance of the genera was significantly correlated with t c1 c3 and c4 p 0 01 and the relationship with c2 was weaker p 0 05 only t c1 and c3 had a significant relationship with keystone taxa p 0 05 overall this is consistent with previous analyses showing that organic matter and t dominate planktonic bacterial community changes our research shows that in such a karst aquatic ecosystem without the interference of anthropogenic factors differences in the cdom components play a significant role in the construction of the planktonic bacterial community the figure indicates that planktonic bacteria seem to have had a similar relationship with autochthonous and allochthonous dom two terrestrial components c3 and c4 and an autochthonous component c1 are clustered in module i and some planktonic bacteria were associated with carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for instance the hgcl clade which is dominant in this module plays a crucial role in cyanobacteria degradation and limnohabitans play a prominent role in the metabolism of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems kasalicky et al 2013 from the results of the correlation analysis we suggest that the autochthonous fresh component and two allochthonous components were the main carbon sources for heterotrophic planktonic bacteria whereas the traditional view is that allochthonous components in aquatic ecosystems are relatively stable guillemette et al 2013 many recent studies show that although old carbon in soil is considered stable it becomes more biolabile once it enters the aquatic ecosystem known as priming marın spiotta et al 2014 due to the soil s physical structure mineral adsorption and bioenergy constraints on soil bacterial communities may more critical in stabilising and storing organic matter than previously thought kemmitt et al 2008 schmidt et al 2011 therefore when allo dom leaves the soil environment and there are no original partial refuges to keep it temporarily stable the priming effect from fresh organic matter entering the water body increase degradation notably humus like c2 was clustered in module ii the closer relationship may be due to the recalcitrance of auto dom after microbial mineralization which requires the cooperation of planktonic bacterial communities planktonic bacteria may alter the molecular structure of dom during degradation making dom resistant to further mineralization thereby preserving carbon ogawa et al 2001 smith et al 2017 c2 is the transformation of labile c into stabilised forms by planktonic bacteria on this basis we speculate that c2 may be a component of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter rdom in inland water similar to that generated by the mcp mechanism proposed in the ocean and soil jiao et al 2010 liang et al 2017 although the reasons behind the long term stability of dom remain unknown three important hypothesises have been shown environment hypothesis intrinsic stability hypothesis and molecular diversity hypothesis dittmar 2015 the nutritional state of the environment in our study was suitable for the survival of planktonic bacteria therefore the weak correlation between some key chemotrophic heterotrophs and c2 indicates that c2 may not be utilised by them c2 was a recalcitrant humus component all characteristics are consistent with the first two hypotheses and indicated that c2 may be a type of rdom in inland waters 4 4 prediction of bacterial function genes and their relationship with ca2 and dic the functional genes for aerobic chemoheterotrophy phototrophy photoheterotrophy nitrate reduction methylotrophy and methanol oxidation were the core genes for the c cycle in the five ponds table s2 to explore the specificity of these genes in karst areas we constructed relationships between the functional genes and hydrochemical indices fig 7 functional genes for aerobic chemoheterotrophy showed a significant negative correlation with hco3 hco3 was positively correlated with chitinolysis ca2 hco3 and co2 aq were positively correlated with the functional genes involved in aromatic compound degradation in addition the functional genes for phototrophy photoheterotrophy and nitrification had a positive relationship with co2 aq previous studies have found that elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations may affect planktonic bacterial communities with regard to c assimilation and decomposition he et al 2010 man et al 2020 karst aquatic ecosystems are characterised by high ca2 and dic concentrations and elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations also lead to an increase in dic in water an environment with high dic concentrations can promote more intense photosynthetic production chemoheterotrophy based on the dominant functional gene predicted by faprotax was significantly reduced in the high dic environment suggesting that compared with non karst areas there were fewer chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria this may promote the preservation of autochthonous organic carbon in karst areas moreover the positive correlation between chitinolysis and aromatic compound degradation genes and the three hydrochemical indices suggests a higher abundance of planktonic bacteria related to the degradation of aromatic and chitin compounds in a high dic environment in conclusion the high ca2 and dic environments in karst areas have a significant impact on the planktonic bacterial communities and the associated carbon sequestration and organic matter degradation this kind of environment favors a strong bcp effect generating more auto dom which initiates the priming effect and leads to the degradation of allochthonous organic matter 5 conclusion we investigated the variation in the cdom components of five simulated aquatic ecosystems under different land uses with relatively independent influencing factors during four seasons our results showed that auto dom had significant seasonal variation characterised by two main stages the summer autumn stage and the winter spring stage the auto dom c1 c2 accounted for 33 0 6 33 in the first stage and 61 6 6 99 in the latter stage this indicated that seasonal factors must be considered when determining the contribution of auto dom in karst aquatic ecosystems c2 which is mineralised by bacteria maintained a high level of contribution in the winter spring stage suggesting the high stability of it and leads to high stability ratio of auto dom based on the investigation of planktonic bacterial community and the relationships between cdom and planktonic bacteria in combination with the analysis of microbial functional genes we found that after planktonic bacterial mineralization c2 may become more recalcitrant than c1 originating from phytoplankton the stability of c2 was confirmed from a microbial perspective moreover the correlation analysis of hydrochemical indices ca2 hco3 and co2 aq with planktonic bacterial communities and functional genes showed that the karst aquatic ecosystem had a significant impact on some important bacteria related to photosynthesis and chemoautotrophy which may explain the relative stability of auto dom in karst aquatic ecosystems based on these characteristics we suggest that c2 may be an important rdom in karst aquatic ecosystems fig 8 we need to further test this conclusion through laboratory culture studies in the future more importantly this study provides new insights into the important contribution of inland lakes to the global carbon sink in addition we should strengthen

15876,biological carbon pump bcp in karst areas has received intensive attention for years due to their significant contribution to the global missing carbon sink the stability of autochthonous dissolved organic matter auto dom produced by bcp in karst aquatic ecosystems may play a critical role in the missing carbon sink however the source of dissolved organic matter dom in inland waters and its consumption by planktonic bacteria have not been thoroughly examined recalcitrant dissolved organic matter rdom may exist in karst aquatic ecosystem as in the ocean through the study of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and the interaction between cdom and the planktonic bacterial community under different land uses at the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site sw china we found that c2 as the fluorescence component of auto dom mineralised by planktonic bacteria may have some of the characteristics of rdom and is an important dom source in karst aquatic ecosystems the stability ratio fmax c2 c1 c2 of auto dom reached 89 6 6 71 in winter and 64 1 7 19 in spring moreover correlation based network analysis determined that the planktonic bacterial communities were controlled by different fluorescence types of cdom of which c1 fresh auto dom c3 conventional allochthonous dom allo dom and c4 the allo dom mineralised by bacteria were clustered in one module together with prevalent organic degrading planktonic bacteria c2 was clustered in another tightly combined module suggesting specific microbial utilization strategies for the c2 component in addition some important planktonic bacterium and functional genes including chemotrophic heterotrophs and photosynthetic bacteria were found to be affected by high ca2 and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations in karst aquatic ecosystems our research showed that auto dom may be as an important carbon sink as the allo dom in karst ecosystems the former generally being neglected based on a posit that it is easily and first mineralized by planktonic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bcp autochthonous dissolved organic matter stability planktonic bacteria karst aquatic ecosystem eem parafrac 1 introduction in recent years much research has focused on the location of missing carbon sinks schindler 1999 ciais et al 2013 kirschbaum et al 2019 liu et al 2021 an increasing number of studies have suggested that inland water play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and deserves further study cole et al 2007 liu et al 2018 2021 recently researchers have reported that in karst areas aquatic photosynthetic organisms can take up dissolved inorganic carbon dic converting it into organic carbon and fixing it when they die biological remains are buried in reservoirs and lakes creating a stable carbon sink in inland waters liu et al 2010 2011 2018 2021 the missing carbon sink associated with the strengthening of autochthonous production ap in inland ecosystems has been estimated to range from 0 38 to 1 8 gt c yr 1 with large uncertainties liu et al 2021 ap is an important carbon sink and dissolved organic carbon doc accounts for more than 80 of the total organic carbon toc especially in karst lake water columns doc is the dominant indicator of autochthonous productivity in karstic aquatic ecosystems noges et al 2016 he et al 2022 which is generally neglected in the calculation of the carbon budget based on the assumption that doc is readily mineralised by planktonic bacteria sawakuchi et al 2017 drake et al 2018 ran et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to study the stability of doc in inland waters to assess missing global carbon sinks around the world based on the carbon isotope values the high dic concentrations promotes both phytoplankton and aquatic plant photosynthetic production photosynthetic autochthonous organic carbon contributes 60 80 of the total sediment and particulate organic carbon poc in karst aquatic ecosystems yang et al 2016 he et al 2020 huang et al 2020 he et al 2021 applied the excitation emission matrix eem spectrum method and found that the dic fertilization effect directly promoted autochthonous doc auto doc formation and indirectly promoted microbial sourced doc in the lijiang river these results confirmed the existence of a biological carbon pump bcp in karst areas however the stability of auto doc in the water has not been explored and it remains unclear what is the strategy of planktonic bacteria in the water column to consume auto doc in aquatic ecosystems dom has been classified based on its origin autochthonous or allochthonous and bioavailability labile or recalcitrant muscarella et al 2019 much research has been conducted on allochthonous organic matter and the parts that flow into lakes are regarded as difficult to degrade recent reports have challenged this scenario by showing fast planktonic bacterial utilization of a highly labile pool of low molecular weight compounds of allochthonous origin in boreal streams ågren et al 2008 berggren et al 2010 leading to the possibility that allochthonous doc allo doc could fuel carbon degradation by planktonic bacteria at different time scales holmes et al 2008 ward et al 2013 the concentration of auto doc in freshwater lakes depends mainly on aquatic primary productivity and the degradation of planktonic bacteria interactions between doc and planktonic bacteria are central to biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems heterogeneous microorganisms in water bodies employ doc as the main carbon source while previous studies suggest that many primary production forms are preferentially degraded and eventually consumed by approximately 80 westrich and berner 1984 cole et al 1988 guillemette et al 2013 2017 previous studies have suggested that molecular weight chemical composition and elemental metrology are the basis for microbial consumption of organic carbon chrost et al 1983 amon and benner 1996 the organic carbon in algae is regarded as simple labile composed of small molecules and easily consumed by planktonic bacteria chrost and faust 1983 amon and benner 1996 berggren et al 2010 berggren and del giorgio 2015 which may explain why the budget of auto doc has been neglected in previous studies however studies have shown that the preferential breakdown and metabolites of auto doc are resistant to microbial remineralization ogawa et al 2001 hach et al 2020 defrancesco et al 2021 the influence of auto doc on planktonic bacterial communities has been demonstrated by incubating planktonic bacteria with different sources of doc in laboratory studies perez and sommaruga 2006 guillemette et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 2021a the difficulty in distinguishing auto dom and allo dom in the complex field environment and the limitations of laboratory tests are challenges in the study of the utilization of doc by planktonic bacteria in the field environments moreover the disturbance of the phytoplankton community structure caused by various complex environmental factors in natural lakes may distort the degradation dynamics between auto dom and planktonic bacteria therefore we required an ecosystem with clear sources of organic matter and relatively independent influencing factors which would allow for an understanding of the degradation dynamics of autochthonous and allochthonous dom by planktonic bacteria the key to solving the above problems is to distinguish the sources of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and construct a relationship between planktonic bacteria and each component many scholars have made great efforts to study the distinction between autochthonous and allochthonous sources of cdom but there are still many disputes recently the combination of the eem and fluorescence regional integration has been used to quantify the abundance and dynamics of dom components in inland water yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 moreover the rapid development of metagenomic technology has provided deep insight into the dynamics of planktonic bacterial communities in the field legendre and gallagher 2001 in particular the emergence of network analysis methods has played a key role in explaining changes in lake microbial communities and environmental interactions eiler et al 2012 barberan et al 2012 kara et al 2013 to date researchers have focused on the interspecific interactions of lake communities but ignored the relationship between dom and planktonic bacterial community metabolic activities as the carbon source and main nutrient understanding the relationship between dom and planktonic bacterial community metabolic activities is crucial for understanding the consumption strategies of planktonic bacteria zhang et al 2020 here we present the results of planktonic bacterial changes and cdom in four seasons under five different land uses at the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site sw china the variation in the intensity of the cdom fluorescence peak fmax indicates the variation in the concentrations of the different components murphy et al 2013 high throughput sequencing of 16 s and parallel factor modeling parafac of excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy were used to answer the following three questions 1 how do seasonal changes affect the composition of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of cdom in karst aquatic ecosystems under different land uses 2 what are the effects of organic matter input from different proportions of autochthonous and allochthonous sources on the planktonic bacterial community structure 3 how do dic concentrations influence planktonic bacteria in relation to the carbon cycle under different land uses we hypothesised that auto dom formed through the microbial carbon pump mcp in karst aquatic ecosystems may be stabilised in certain environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the test site the shawan karst water carbon cycle test site 26 14 26 15

statistical analysis the otus were combined with four cdom and three hydrochemical parameter components to construct a network the psych pair r package was used to calculate the spearman correlation

water in the five ponds p1 p5 showed obvious seasonal variations fig s2 water ph ranged from 8 09 to 9 29 the hco3 concentrations ranged from 1 2 mmol l to 3 9 mmol l high concentrations of hco3 occurred in p4 and p5 in contrast low hco3 concentrations were observed in p1 and p2 the ponds were characterised by high saturated concentrations of do in spring summer and autumn 130 235 but low values in winter chl a generally showed temporal and spatial dynamics similar to do with the maximum in p4 and p5 4 94 μg l and 3 07 μg l in summer and 2 04 μg l and 1 63 μg l in spring respectively unlike chl a and do there were steady variations in toc over the first three seasons and increases in spring 3 2 changes in cdom compositions in different pond waters four distinct components were identified fig s3 with ex em wavelengths of 230 280 326 nm 255 381 444 nm 275 340 466 nm and 310 412 nm component c1 represents tyrosine like peak b fluorophores zhou et al 2019 c2 c3 and c4 showed analogous positioning to different humus like fluorophores c2 was categorised as low molecular humus like peak m fluorophores associated with autochthonous production coble 1996 fellman et al 2010 mudarra et al 2011 mcintyre and gueguen 2013 c3 represented allochthonous humus like peak c fluorophores with a high molecular weight and aromatic organic compounds amaral et al 2021 and c4 was categorised as microbial humus like fluorophores peak m wang et al 2012 hambly et al 2015 amaral et al 2020 fig 2 the tyrosine like component c1 represented amino acids derived from plankton the fmax of c1 was low in winter 0 018 0 0198 r u but high in spring 0 152 0 0365 r u fig 3 a the low molecular component c2 which was humus like changed greatly from summer and autumn 0 014 0 0064 r u to winter and spring 0 202 0 0466 r u and was the dominated fluorescence component in winter and spring fig 3a the fmax values of components c1 and c2 showed a trend similar to that of the toc c3 which represented allochthonous humus like features showed a slight change over the four seasons microbial humus like c4 was the dominated fluorescence component in summer and autumn accounted for 39 16 5 99 of all components in the five ponds and halved in winter and spring to 22 50 3 61 stability refers to the resistance to degradation of microorganisms biosynthetic compounds not modified by secondary abiotic reactions are presumably to be resistant to degradation on the long term benner et al 1992 dittmar 2015 the cellular and degradation products of microbes can be selectively preserved due to their chemical structure and adsorption to mineral surfaces sollins et al 1996 von lützow et al 2006 liang et al 2017 we defined the stability ratio as the proportion of mineralised organic matter in the total organic matter fmax of each source autochthonous or allochthonous c2 and c4 represent the components of organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous sources respectively after mineralization by microorganisms we can summarise these as the stable components of the two sources for example the stability ratio of auto dom was fmax c2 c1 c2 and that of allo dom was fmax c4 c3 c4 fig 3b shows that the stability ratio of auto dom was low in summer 16 8 7 00 and autumn 20 6 3 84 and high in winter 89 6 6 71 and spring 64 1 7 19 the stability of the two components from the same source is different the sources of the two auto dom are mixed the fresh auto dom such as tryptophan is easily degraded which makes auto dom seeming to be labile the stability ratio therefore should be used to quantify the stability of different sources to obtain a clearer understanding of the importance of auto dom in carbon sinks auto dom had two different phases throughout the year summer to autumn and winter to spring however the stability ratio of the allo dom was the same throughout the year 3 3 composition of planktonic bacterial communities in total 47 991 clean 16s rrna gene sequences and 5154 otus were obtained during macroalgal degradation the coverage of each sample was greater than 0 97 these otus at a 3 dissimilarity threshold were classified into 43 phyla 113 classes 326 orders 619 families and 1074 genera owing to the high proportion of proteobacteria at the phylum level fig s4a to facilitate our in depth analysis we divided it into three subgroups alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria at the phylum level a total of 25 major phyla 0 01 were detected in the samples from different ponds during the four seasons fig s4a proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla while actinobacteria disappeared in winter in summer alphaproteobacteria were rare in p4 and p5 whereas bacteroidetes were abundant in p3 and p4 the community structure of the five ponds in winter was similar to that in summer however the dominance of bacteroides in p3 and p4 decreased significantly whereas actinobacteria abundance increased gammaproteobacteria dominated the five ponds during the winter in spring the changes among the five ponds were different from those in other seasons especially in p4 and p5 limnohabitans microbacteriaceae f polynucleobacter hgcl clade and sediminibacterium were enriched in the ponds 67 3 fig s4b except in spring polynucleobacter were generally prevalent in p5 36 4 in summer 29 5 in autumn and 45 2 in winter and a higher abundance appeared only in p4 in spring sphingopyxis decreased in p4 and p5 except in spring whereas it increased in p4 in spring the abundance of the hgcl clade increased extremely in spring 4 discussion 4 1 effects of dic fertilization on spatiotemporal changes in fluorescence components the hco3 concentrations showed large spatiotemporal variations in the five ponds due to different seasons and land uses in our experiment the major factor affecting hco3 concentrations was the influence of spring water input caused by changes in soil respiration under different vegetation coverage conditions zeng et al 2019 p4 reflected the influence of grassland with more litter more developed roots more soil microbes and the largest soil respiration in the alfalfa planting period resulting in the highest hco3 concentrations of s4 in spring water p3 and p5 had less development of plants than p4 thus their hco3 concentrations were lower the higher do concentrations in p4 and p5 during the growing season combined with the higher hco3 concentrations indicated a more intense bcp in the two ponds bao et al 2020 this was in agreement with previous research showing that hydrochemistry under different land uses may influence the primary productivity in the corresponding surface waters hayes et al 2015 bao et al 2020 organic matter produced by primary production could be accompanied by photodegradation and biodegradation and its composition could change we found that the fmax of c1 and c2 which represented autochthonous organic matter were higher in p4 and p5 fig s5 previous studies have shown that dic fertilization affects aquatic photosynthesis in pond ecosystems zeng et al 2019 therefore the higher fmax of c1 in p4 which represents fresh auto dom may have been due to dic fertilization simultaneously c2 had the highest fmax in water he et al 2021 found that c2 is positively correlated with dic in the lijiang river we speculated that in addition to dic fertilisation the stability of dom at high dic levels may be another cause a previous study at the site bao et al 2020 showed that diatoms were the dominant algae in p4 and were more conducive to preservation as they had more stable components than other algae landa et al 2014 to explore the characteristics of organic matter from different sources we analysed the contribution rate and stability ratio of auto dom and found that from the perspective of the contribution rate the total fmax values of the four components were almost the same in summer autumn and winter but increased significantly in spring which was consistent with the change in toc this was mainly due to the increase in autochthonous components during winter and spring fig 3a the proportion of the c2 component in winter and spring was approximately 47 1 9 60 a significant proportion of inland water previous studies have shown that the dom decomposition rate in theory could be a function of its concentration dittmar et al 2015 and the high fmax of c2 in these two seasons not only indicates a high concentration but also explains the resistance of c2 to microbial degradation the release of autochthonous components from planktonic and submerged ecosystems began in november and auto dom especially c2 was not the highest in summer with the increase in rainfall in summer the c2 components released by the decay of algae in the previous year were removed by water flow whereas the newly formed planktonic and submerged components were still in the growing season only a small portion of the c2 components was released and the high deposition flux in summer also resulted in more fixed organic matter settling into the sediment in the form of poc these results coincide with the fact that planktonic bacteria may produce humus like substances in lakes after modifying protein like substances thereby increasing the proportion of humus like substances and decreasing the proportion of protein like substances hanamachi et al 2008 this has been proven in incubation experiments with samples from the tibetan plateau and the antarctic region zhou et al 2019 the stability ratio indicated that auto dom was preserved in the form of c2 the stability of allo dom c4 has been proven in previous studies guillemette et al 2013 2017 zhou et al 2021a which suggests that the stability ratio defined is meaningful from another perspective allo dom is the result of multiple mineralizations by microorganisms in soil and spring water and it is more stable than fresh organic matter formed in lakes stability ratio in our research is therefore a relative concept since the dilution limits and recalcitrant mechanism are still an important debate question to research in the ocean jiao et al 2010 arrieta et al 2015 the organic matter produced by aquatic plants may be used by planktonic bacteria similar to terrestrial plants and the recalcitrant humus is eventually buried and preserved thus this part of organic matter should not be ignored when discussing the contribution of inland lakes to global carbon sinks the importance of autochthonous production in inland lake carbon sinks could be neglected if one compares mineralised allo dom with fresh auto dom rather than compare the stability of the metabolic products of both there have been many experiments on bacterial degradation of phytoplankton both in ocean and inland waters hanamachi et al 2008 found that although the phytoplankton produced organic matter is readily used by planktonic bacteria quickly molecular rearrangement by planktonic bacteria is an important factor in auto dom burial in addition the algal organic groups were divided into neutral aldoses amino acids fatty acids the organic composition of the labile fraction of phytoplanktonic organic matter was found to vary depending on the phytoplankton groups diatoms have a more recalcitrant organic component glycine hecky et al 1973 diatoms are a class of phytoplankton sensitive to carbon high dic and ca2 levels are important characteristics of karst aquatic ecosystems higher co2 concentrations lead diatoms to increase in abundance tortell et al 2002 low décarie 2015 allowing diatoms to dominate phytoplankton communities in this aquatic ecosystem 4 2 effects of cdom components and hydrochemical properties on the composition of planktonic bacteria we demonstrated that different cdom components and physicochemical properties were crucial drivers of planktonic bacterial composition in the five ponds the relationship between planktonic bacteria and environmental factors was determined by rda at different classification levels at the phylum level fig 4 a t ph and c1 p 0 05 played a vital role in structuring the abundant bacterial compositions and t was the dominant environmental factor affecting the planktonic bacterial community which was mainly reflected in the seasons hco3 and humus like c3 also played a role in some planktonic bacterial communities at the genus level fig 4b t chl a c1 and c4 were the main factors affecting the planktonic bacterial compositions p 0 05 this relationship suggests that humus like components may also influenced planktonic bacterial communities which differs from the results of previous studies on the qingliu river zhang et al 2020 this was because our research area showed little anthropogenic pollution while previous research focused mainly on rivers flowing through the cities and industrial zones exogenous pollutants would greatly cover the influence of auto dom and allo dom on the microbial community which would impede the exploration of the influence of dom on planktonic bacteria the clear boundaries of our study area make it clear that the planktonic bacterial community was affected by the karst environment and allowed us to determine the organic matter utilization strategy of planktonic bacteria in addition we found that c1 had a significant effect on the community structure but c2 did not show this effect these results suggest that in addition to t and ph both auto dom and allo dom can affect planktonic bacterial communities in natural karst aquatic ecosystems however the dom components after mineralization may have no significant effect on planktonic bacteria due to their recalcitrant nature through the above analysis we constructed spearman correlations between the percentages of the four cdom components and the concentrations of hco3 co2 aq and ca2 and the relative abundance of planktonic bacteria in the five ponds these results suggest that tryptophan like c1 and humus like c3 and c4 have synergistic effects on most planktonic bacteria at the phylum level most planktonic bacteria were simultaneously negatively correlated with the four components fig 5 a p 0 05 the phylum actinobacteria was significantly positively correlated with c1 p 0 01 whereas gammaproteobacteria was negatively correlated with c1 p 0 05 the former is considered competitive under resource poor and aromatic rich conditions li et al 2020 and the latter responds to the enrichment of diatom derived dom landa et al 2014 and utilises proteins amino acids and extracellular polysaccharides blanchet et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the relationship between the two phyla and c1 illustrates the competitive relationship between them which is consistent with the results obtained in previous laboratory degradation experiments zhou et al 2021a in addition the significant negative relationship between co2 aq and actinobacteria indicated that the competitive advantage of this phylum would gradually decreased in water with higher co2 aq bacteroidetes are capable of decomposing carbohydrates starch polysaccharides and hydrolytic cellulose bauer et al 2006 although no significant correlation was found between bacteroidetes and the related components in our study the extremely significant positive correlation between bacteroidetes and ca2 indicates that chemotrophic heterotrophic planktonic bacteria occupy a dominant position in a high ca2 environment alphaproteobacteria the dominant planktonic bacteria in the community fig s4a was negatively related to humus like c3 c4 and hco3 p 0 05 and was competitive under resource poor and aromatic rich conditions low toc concentrations characterise all ponds with the mean value of 1 35 mg l and the maximum of 7 79 mg l occurring in spring in such a low resource environment although alphaproteobacteria can become the most abundant planktonic bacteria there is still a negative correlation between alphaproteobacteria and the two allochthonous components this was contrary to the results of the research on the response of planktonic bacteria in composition and function to the various dom in the qinhuai river zhang et al 2020 as the newly imported unstable dom would be consumed quickly notably the relationship between the c2 and planktonic bacteria was significantly different from that of the other components in particular no correlation was observed between the c2 and several key chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria at the genus level our research showed that there was no preference between humus like and tryptophan like component consumption in the genus polynucleobacter fig 5b this is inconsistent with the previous studies showing that polynucleobacter prefers allochthonous humus in aquatic ecosystems steinberg 2014 adesanoye 2015 zhang et al 2020 there was a strong relationship between the hgcl clade and c1 which mainly degrades cyanobacteria the hgcl clade was negatively correlated with co2 aq indicating that there were fewer cyanobacteria in the high co2 aq environment which is consistent with the conclusion found at the same research site that diatoms and chlorophyta were more suitable for growth than cyanobacteria under a high dic environment and appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus conditions bao et al 2021 the abundant genera limnohabitans and sphingomonas were significantly related to c1 c3 and c4 because limnohabitans can utilise substrates produced by different algae steinberg 2014 adesanoye 2015 karel et al 2020 sphingomonas is capable of energy metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation metabolism li et al 2020 the relationship between the cdom components and these planktonic bacteria was negative because the poor resource environment as mentioned above led to insufficient organic matter at the same time in addition to polynucleobacter we found that the above abundant genera associated with organic matter degradation had no relationship with c2 this further confirmed the specific planktonic bacterial utilization characteristics of this component 4 3 carbon dominates the co occurrence network of planktonic bacteria in the five ponds to examine the interrelationship between selected otus with cdom components and three hydrochemical indices a co occurrence network of five ponds in four seasons was constructed based on spearman s correlations between otus with the four cdom components and three hydrochemical indices thus we elucidated the interactions among key planktonic bacterial communities from a new perspective fig 6 according to our results 1252 edges were captured among 169 nodes indicating a significant interrelation between the abundant species the network diameter average path length average clustering coefficient and modularity of the real network were higher than those in the erdös rényi random network table s1 the nodes were divided into 17 planktonic phyla proteobacteria including gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and patescilbacteria accounted for 72 18 the abundant genera hgcl clade polynucleobacter flavobacterium sphingomonas and janthinobacterium exhibited strong connections the nodes were divided into 13 modules among which six modules had a strong correlation tyrosine like c1 and the humus like c3 and c4 were found in modules ii and c2 was in module i hydrochemical indices such as ca2 hco3 and co2 aq were aggregated in module iii the species in module i primarily belonged to gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria the nodes in module ii showed the highest average degree and closeness centralities fig s6 indicating a stronger community relationship and mainly included gammaproteobacteria bacteroidetes deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria generally the degradation of organic matter and the adaptation of planktonic bacteria to the environment is a community behavior berry and widder 2014 therefore using the co occurrence diagram we can more clearly explain the characteristics of the consumption of organic matter by planktonic bacteria and the influence of environmental changes seventeen genera including hgci clade flavobacterium polynucleobacter burkholderiaceae hydrogenophag chloroplast and legionella module hubs and connectors were the keystone taxa in our network fig s7a no network hubs pi 0 62 and zi 2 5 were detected in the network most keystone taxa were rare planktonic bacteria which was in agreement with previous studies shi et al 2016 the disappearance of keystone taxa in certain environments causes the disassembly of modules and networks but the importance of keystone taxa play depends on the environmental changes lupatini et al 2014 to further clarify the influence of environmental factors on the microbial communities and keystone taxa we conducted a mantel test fig s7b the abundance of the genera was significantly correlated with t c1 c3 and c4 p 0 01 and the relationship with c2 was weaker p 0 05 only t c1 and c3 had a significant relationship with keystone taxa p 0 05 overall this is consistent with previous analyses showing that organic matter and t dominate planktonic bacterial community changes our research shows that in such a karst aquatic ecosystem without the interference of anthropogenic factors differences in the cdom components play a significant role in the construction of the planktonic bacterial community the figure indicates that planktonic bacteria seem to have had a similar relationship with autochthonous and allochthonous dom two terrestrial components c3 and c4 and an autochthonous component c1 are clustered in module i and some planktonic bacteria were associated with carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for instance the hgcl clade which is dominant in this module plays a crucial role in cyanobacteria degradation and limnohabitans play a prominent role in the metabolism of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems kasalicky et al 2013 from the results of the correlation analysis we suggest that the autochthonous fresh component and two allochthonous components were the main carbon sources for heterotrophic planktonic bacteria whereas the traditional view is that allochthonous components in aquatic ecosystems are relatively stable guillemette et al 2013 many recent studies show that although old carbon in soil is considered stable it becomes more biolabile once it enters the aquatic ecosystem known as priming marın spiotta et al 2014 due to the soil s physical structure mineral adsorption and bioenergy constraints on soil bacterial communities may more critical in stabilising and storing organic matter than previously thought kemmitt et al 2008 schmidt et al 2011 therefore when allo dom leaves the soil environment and there are no original partial refuges to keep it temporarily stable the priming effect from fresh organic matter entering the water body increase degradation notably humus like c2 was clustered in module ii the closer relationship may be due to the recalcitrance of auto dom after microbial mineralization which requires the cooperation of planktonic bacterial communities planktonic bacteria may alter the molecular structure of dom during degradation making dom resistant to further mineralization thereby preserving carbon ogawa et al 2001 smith et al 2017 c2 is the transformation of labile c into stabilised forms by planktonic bacteria on this basis we speculate that c2 may be a component of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter rdom in inland water similar to that generated by the mcp mechanism proposed in the ocean and soil jiao et al 2010 liang et al 2017 although the reasons behind the long term stability of dom remain unknown three important hypothesises have been shown environment hypothesis intrinsic stability hypothesis and molecular diversity hypothesis dittmar 2015 the nutritional state of the environment in our study was suitable for the survival of planktonic bacteria therefore the weak correlation between some key chemotrophic heterotrophs and c2 indicates that c2 may not be utilised by them c2 was a recalcitrant humus component all characteristics are consistent with the first two hypotheses and indicated that c2 may be a type of rdom in inland waters 4 4 prediction of bacterial function genes and their relationship with ca2 and dic the functional genes for aerobic chemoheterotrophy phototrophy photoheterotrophy nitrate reduction methylotrophy and methanol oxidation were the core genes for the c cycle in the five ponds table s2 to explore the specificity of these genes in karst areas we constructed relationships between the functional genes and hydrochemical indices fig 7 functional genes for aerobic chemoheterotrophy showed a significant negative correlation with hco3 hco3 was positively correlated with chitinolysis ca2 hco3 and co2 aq were positively correlated with the functional genes involved in aromatic compound degradation in addition the functional genes for phototrophy photoheterotrophy and nitrification had a positive relationship with co2 aq previous studies have found that elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations may affect planktonic bacterial communities with regard to c assimilation and decomposition he et al 2010 man et al 2020 karst aquatic ecosystems are characterised by high ca2 and dic concentrations and elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations also lead to an increase in dic in water an environment with high dic concentrations can promote more intense photosynthetic production chemoheterotrophy based on the dominant functional gene predicted by faprotax was significantly reduced in the high dic environment suggesting that compared with non karst areas there were fewer chemoheterotrophic planktonic bacteria this may promote the preservation of autochthonous organic carbon in karst areas moreover the positive correlation between chitinolysis and aromatic compound degradation genes and the three hydrochemical indices suggests a higher abundance of planktonic bacteria related to the degradation of aromatic and chitin compounds in a high dic environment in conclusion the high ca2 and dic environments in karst areas have a significant impact on the planktonic bacterial communities and the associated carbon sequestration and organic matter degradation this kind of environment favors a strong bcp effect generating more auto dom which initiates the priming effect and leads to the degradation of allochthonous organic matter 5 conclusion we investigated the variation in the cdom components of five simulated aquatic ecosystems under different land uses with relatively independent influencing factors during four seasons our results showed that auto dom had significant seasonal variation characterised by two main stages the summer autumn stage and the winter spring stage the auto dom c1 c2 accounted for 33 0 6 33 in the first stage and 61 6 6 99 in the latter stage this indicated that seasonal factors must be considered when determining the contribution of auto dom in karst aquatic ecosystems c2 which is mineralised by bacteria maintained a high level of contribution in the winter spring stage suggesting the high stability of it and leads to high stability ratio of auto dom based on the investigation of planktonic bacterial community and the relationships between cdom and planktonic bacteria in combination with the analysis of microbial functional genes we found that after planktonic bacterial mineralization c2 may become more recalcitrant than c1 originating from phytoplankton the stability of c2 was confirmed from a microbial perspective moreover the correlation analysis of hydrochemical indices ca2 hco3 and co2 aq with planktonic bacterial communities and functional genes showed that the karst aquatic ecosystem had a significant impact on some important bacteria related to photosynthesis and chemoautotrophy which may explain the relative stability of auto dom in karst aquatic ecosystems based on these characteristics we suggest that c2 may be an important rdom in karst aquatic ecosystems fig 8 we need to further test this conclusion through laboratory culture studies in the future more importantly this study provides new insights into the important contribution of inland lakes to the global carbon sink in addition we should strengthen

active in the in vitro rdase assays but non active in the in vivo experiments further in vitro assays of hydrogenase activity suggested that significant inhibition of bdcm on the hydrogenase activity could block electron derivation from h2 for consequent reduction of organohalides in the in vivo experiments therefore our results provided unprecedented insight into metabolic co metabolic and rdase

2004 moreover both 1 3 mm acetylene and 5 mm sulfide could down regulate transcription of atpase and hase encoding genes in d mccartyi 195 mao et al 2017a 2017b the inhibition of organohalides on the hase and atpase might be correlated with the metabolic co metabolic and rdase active only dehalogenation nonetheless the detailed correlation awaited exploration pertaining to microbial reductive dechlorination of hcbd the first report indicated that hcbd was dechlorinated to tetra cbd in a column packed with rhine river sediment bosma et al 1994 nonetheless the reductive dechlorination of hcbd to lowly chlorinated congeners was only observed in limited microcosm studies including a methanogenic consortium dechlorinating a mixture of hcbd pce ct and hexachloroethane boucquey et al 1995 and a microcosm enriched from hcbd contaminated sediment booker and pavlostathis 2000 thus far no information is available on the taxonomy of the hcbd dechlorinating microorganisms and on the dechlorination pathways mainly because of the difficulty in enrichment of hcbd dechlorinators and the unavailability of polychloro 1 3 butadiene standards in contrast to the microbial dechlorination of hcbd reduced cobalamins were identified to mediate the conversion of hcbd in abiotic experiments for instance hcbd was converted into penta cbd and other products in a reaction mixture containing ti ⅲ citrate and hydroxocobalamin bosma et al 1994 similar abiotic dechlorination of hcbd was observed in reaction mixtures containing cyanocobalamin james et al 2008 therefore no activity in microbial dechlorination of hcbd may not be due to the no low activity of cobalamin containing rdases but the inefficiency of other enzymatic processes e g hase and atpase mediated electron derivation and atp generation respectively which warrant experimental studies in this study hcbd dechlorination activity was first screened in pure and mixed cultures originated from different geographic sites then the hcbd dechlorination pathways were proposed based on both experimental evidence and quantum chemical calculations the ohrb were identified by combining bacterial cultivation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr analyses finally mechanisms underlying the no dehalogenation co metabolic dehalogenation or metabolic dehalogenation of hcbd and other organohalides e g bdcm and pcbs were tested this study provided mechanistic insight into ohrb mediated metabolic and co metabolic dehalogenation of organohalides enabling the development of new strategies for efficient bioremediation of organohalide contaminated sites and novel methods for high throughput screening of dehalogenation activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation and medium preparation four pure cultures i e d mccartyi cg1 cg4 cg5 and geobacter lovleyi lyy and three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 were obtained and established in our previous studies and their cultivation medium was prepared as described liang et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 briefly autoclaved bicarbonate buffered mineral salt medium was amended with 10 mm lactate for the three microcosms as the carbon source and electron donor in pure cultures acetate 10 mm and hydrogen gas 5 104 pa were supplemented as carbon source and electron donor respectively l cysteine 24 ppm and na2s 9h2o 48 ppm were added as reductants to control redox potential and resazurin 5 ppm was added as a redox indicator in the dechlorinating cultures 0 2 mm pce was amended as an electron acceptor to pre cultivate ohrb pce pregrown microcosms different organohalides i e 0 2 mm hcbd 0 2 mm bdcm or 0 5 ppm pcb180 were amended ⅰ as sole electron acceptor ⅱ after pce was completely consumed ⅲ together with pce in addition enrichment of pce dechlorinating dehalococcoides was achieved by sequential transfers liang et al 2021 to test the hase activity and atpase activity as described briefly the microcosms xm3 and hz2 were first transferred in the medium amended with lactate and pce after six successive transfers the carbon source and electron donor were changed to acetate and h2 respectively after another six successive transfers ampicillin 50 ppm was amended in the medium to inhibit cell growth of non dechlorinating microorganisms desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough dvh was cultivated anaerobically in the defined ls4d medium as described mukhopadhyay et al 2006 biotic controls were prepared similarly but without amendment with the organohalides abiotic controls were prepared similarly without inoculum all cultures were incubated in the dark at 30 c without shaking 2 2 dehalogenation activity test via in vitro assays dehalogenation cells were prepared and harvested as described qiu et al 2020 briefly cells were concentrated by centrifugation 15 min 10 000 g 4 c the in vitro dehalogenation activity tests were carried out with concentrated whole cells under anaerobic conditions in 4 ml bottles which contained 2 ml of assay solution yu et al 2018 the solution buffered with 100 mm tris hcl was reduced with 15 mm of ti ⅲ citrate and methyl viologen and contained organohalides i e 0 2 mm hcbd 0 2 mm bdcm or 0 5 ppm pcb180 as an electron acceptor all in vitro assay bottles in triplicate were incubated at 30 1 c in an anaerobic chamber 2 3 hydrogenase activity test hydrogenase activity was measured with anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid disodium salt aqds as an electron acceptor as described jayachandran et al 2004 briefly cultures were harvested by centrifugation 15 min 10 000 g 4 c in an anaerobic chamber the reaction mixture contained 5 mm aqds ε 1 8 mm 1 cm 1 at 450 nm in anoxic 100 mm tris hcl at ph 7 5 organohalide i e 0 2 mm pce or 0 2 mm bdcm was added separately to test their impact on hase activity a volume of 10 ml of assay solution was filled in a 20 ml serum bottle containing 5 h2 the reaction was started by the injection of 200 μl cell suspension and the increase in a450 was monitored with a spectrophotometer after 72 h the cell concentrations of xm3 hz2 and cg1 were 5 77 108 9 14 108 and 4 64 108 cell per ml respectively and the od600 of concentrated dvh in the suspension was 3 60 biotic control was prepared as described without organohalide addition or without h2 abiotic control was prepared similarly with defined medium instead of cell suspension all bottles in triplicate were incubated at 30 1 c 2 4 atpase activity test atpase activity was measured according to the manufacture s protocol described in genmed h atpase kit genmed scientifics u s a in the in vivo assays 0 2 mm hcbd was first amended in pce pregrown microcosms after 24 hours incubation cells were harvested via centrifugation to test the atpase activity by following the manufacturer s instruction in the in vitro assays similarly the pce pregrown microcosms were harvested by centrifugation then 0 2 mm hcbd was amended in the reaction mixture and subjected to the atpase activity test in biotic control atpase activity was tested using pce pregrown microcosms without amendment of hcbd for detection of the atpase activity the decrease in a340 was monitored in succession for 30 min and atpase activity was calculated by following the manufacturer s instruction 2 5 analytical techniques chloroethenes and pcbs were analyzed as described previously qiu et al

the equilibrium geometries of all chloro 1 3 butadienes were obtained at functional beck 3 lee yang parr b3lyp with a def2 svp basis set and confirmed by vibrational analyses with the same method the latter showed no imaginary frequency the gas phase hishfeld schemed population analyses hirshfeld 1977 of all chloro 1 3 butadienes were calculated at b3lyp def2 svp considering the highly correlation of hirshfeld atomic charges under distinct environments the hirshfeld population analyses under aquatic and protein environments were not considered zhang et al 2021a for a specific substrate its chlorine substituent with the least negative hirshfeld charge can be preferably abstracted in dehalococcoides mediated dehalogenation zhang et al 2017 the significant difference of hirshfeld charges associated with unequal chlorine substituents are larger than 0 003 zhang et al 2017 2 7 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing qpcr and microbial community analyses microbial cells for dna

usa the 16s rrna gene based pcr amplification was conducted under the condition as described wang et al 2019 the primer set i e u515f u909r was used to amplify v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene narihiro et al 2015 wang et al 2020 to identify amplicon sequence variants asvs 16s rrna gene amplicon reads were analyzed through the dada2 pipeline von schwartzenberg et al 2021 taxonomy was assigned using the dada2 implementation of the rdp classifier using the dada2 formated training sets for silva132 kumar et al 2019 von schwartzenberg et al 2021 the qpcr enumeration of dehalococcoides cells were performed with quantitect sybr green pcr kit as described previously liang et al 2021 wang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 microbial reductive dechlorination of hcbd hcbd dechlorination activity was screened in four pure cultures i e d mccartyi cg1 cg4 cg5 and g lovleyi lyy and three pcb pce dechlorinating microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 using in vitro assays in contrast to no dechlorination activity in the four pure cultures or abiotic controls hcbd was dechlorinated to penta and tetra cbds in in vitro tests with the three microcosms fig s1 these results suggested that rdase s expressed in pce pregrown microcosms catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd possibly via mediation by pce hcbd bifunctional rdase s to further confirm that ohrb in the three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 were capable of dechlorinating hcbd three sets of in vivo experiments were established fig 1 1 hcbd hcbd was amended as a sole electron acceptor in the three microcosms 2 pce hcbd hcbd was amended in the three pce pregrown microcosms 3 pce hcbd pce and hcbd were simultaneously amended in the three microcosms surprisingly no hcbd dechlorination activity was observed in the hcbd or pce hcbd experimental sets fig 1 fig s2 in addition co existence of pce and hcbd significantly inhibited pce dechlorination in the three microcosms in contrast similar to observations in the in vitro tests hcbd was dechlorinated to penta and tetra cbds in all of the pce hcbd experimental sets fig 1 fig s2 these results indicated that hcbd might be dechlorinated by ohrb in the three microcosms in a non metabolic way moreover the pce induced rdase s in these microcosms catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd 3 2 quantum chemically calculated hcbd dechlorination pathways since mono to penta cbds were not commercially available as analytical standards hirshfeld charges q cl of all chloro 1 3 butadienes cbds were calculated with gaussian 09 rev e 01 to explore their potential dechlorination pathways fig 2 fig s3 interestingly results showed that the overall reductive dechlorination of cbds largely depended on the substituted chlorine numbers i e the less chlorine numbers the lower dechlorination reactivity potential for example dechlorination of hcbd to e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd and z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd followed a high to low reactivity order corresponding to their highest q cl values of 0 002757 0 003336 and 0 016715 respectively fig 2 therefore further dechlorination of tetra cbds to tri di and mono cbds became even less favorable fig s3 explaining the observation of penta and tetra cbds as major hcbd dechlorination products in experimental studies moreover the dechlorination pathway of a specific cbd could be predicted by the q cl values for instance hcbd with three different chlorine substitutions had varied q cl values of 0 002757 0 002993 and 0 024163 and the chlorine with the highest q cl value of 0 002757 was most likely dechlorinated consequently the chlorine removal from hcbd could generate e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd as a dechlorination product intermediate similarly z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd could be a dechlorination product of the e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd by removing the chlorine with the highest q cl value of 0 003336 further dechlorination of the z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd to tri cbds became unfavorable due to the extremely low q cl value i e q cl 0 016715 fig 2 fig s3 3 3 hcbd dechlorination as a co metabolic process to identify hcbd dechlorinating bacteria in the three microcosms 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis was employed to gain insight into their microbial community compositions results showed the high relative abundance of dehalococcoides as the only obligate ohrb in the three microcosms i e 19 49 15 58 and 7 84 in xm3 ts1 and hz2 respectively fig s4 compared to biotic controls the significantly higher relative abundance of dehalococcoides in pce dechlorinating xm3 suggested dehalococcoides as a major dechlorinating population growing on pce fig 3 a fig s4 notably pce amendment also stimulated growth of acetogenic populations e g veillonella and megasphaera fig 3a which could be due to the consumption of acetate by dehalococcoides and consequent improvement of thermodynamic conditions of the acetogens as described liang et al 2021 to further confirm whether the pce enriched dehalococcoides was a hcbd dechlorinating population dehalococcoides in microcosm xm3 was further enriched and subjected to in vitro tests of hcbd dechlorination activities results showed the positive and linear correlation between hcbd dechlorination activity and the relative abundance of dehalococcoides fig 3b fig s5a i e 90 92 hcbd dechlorination in the highly enriched culture 82 72 dehalococcoides vs 43 59 hcbd dechlorination in the less enriched culture 19 49 dehalococcoides these results together with no other known ohrb presented in the cultures suggested dehalococcoides to be a hcbd dechlorinating population in contrast to the high hcbd dechlorination activity in pce pregrown microcosms no dechlorination activity was observed in cultures fed with sole hcbd indicating hcbd dechlorination possibly via a co metabolic process to confirm it qpcr was utilized to quantify cell growth of dehalococcoides upon pce and sequential hcbd dechlorination in pce hcbd microcosm of xm3 dehalococcoides cells increased from 4 28 106 to 1 87 108 cells ml 1 upon pce dechlorination but did not grow further upon sequential hcbd amendment fig 3c fig s5b in contrast no significant cell growth of dehalococcoides was observed in xm3 controls solely amended with hcbd fig 3c fig s5b these results together with hcbd dechlorination kinetics suggested that hcbd dechlorination was a co metabolic process in this co metabolic process dehalococcoides could derive electrons from h2 for sequential reductive dechlorination but was not able to obtain energy for cell growth based on the structure of organohalide respiring electron transport chains in ohrb the co metabolism of hcbd could be due to the inhibition on atpase of the second respiration part to test it experiments were performed with dehalococcoides enriched xm3 i e dehalococcoides accounted for 82 72 of total community which confirmed the inhibitive effect of hcbd on atpase i e 87 33 and 78 89 decrease of the atpase activity upon hcbd addition in the in vivo and in vitro experiments respectively fig 3d 3 4 different impact of bdcm on the organohalide respiring electron transport chains to test whether the three pce pregrown microcosms dehalogenated other organohalides in a similar way with the co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd in vitro dehalogenation experiments were performed with pcb180 and three halomethanes i e carbon tetrachloride chloroform and bromodichloromethane bdcm different from active pcb180 dechlorination in hz2 xm3 and ts1 dehalogenation activity of bdcm was only observed in pce pregrown microcosm hz2 debromination to dichloromethane suggesting that the ohrb in hz2 employed pce expressed rdase s to catalyze bromine removal from the bdcm to further confirm the debromination activity three sets of in vivo experiments were set up with the hz2 1 bdcm bdcm was amended as a sole electron acceptor 2 pce bdcm bdcm was added to the pce pregrown culture 3 pce bdcm pce and bdcm were simultaneously amended in the culture at the same time three sets of similar in vivo experiments were set up with the hz2 and xm3 1 pcb180 pcb180 was amended as a sole electron acceptor 2 pce pcb180 pcb180 was added to the pce pregrown culture 3 pce pcb180 pce and pcb180 were simultaneously amended in the culture surprisingly in contrast to metabolic dechlorination of pce pcbs fig s6 and co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd fig 1 in the microcosms no bdcm debromination activity was observed in all in vivo experiments fig s7 or abiotic controls this phenomenon might result from the inhibitive impact of bdcm on the electron transport chain for example the inhibition of hase in dehalococcoides would block electron transfer from h2 to the downstream bdcm debrominating rdases to test this speculation in vitro experiments with h2 and aqds as an electron donor and acceptor respectively were set up with the highly dehalococcoides enriched microcosm hz2 as well as other pure and enrichment cultures fig 4 in contrast to no inhibition of pce bdcm was shown to significantly inhibit the hase activity in the dehalococcoides enriched hz2 fig 4a similar bdcm inhibition on the hase was also observed in the dehalococcoides enriched microcosm xm3 fig 4b and pure culture cg1 fig 4c in contrast bdcm had no obvious inhibition on the hase of d vulgaris hildenborough dvh as a non dechlorinating pure culture fig 4d implying the taxonomy specific inhibition of bdcm on hase no aqds reduction was detected in abiotic controls and biotic controls without amendment of h2 4 discussion in this study to investigate the mechanism underlying observations of metabolic co metabolic and rdase active only dehalogenation four organohalides i e pce pcbs hcbd and bdcm were used as electron acceptors in dehalococcoides cultures the pce pcbs hcbd and bdcm were shown to have distinctively different impacts on the organohalide respiring electron transport chains of ohrb ⅰ metabolic dechlorination of pce and pcbs without inhibition in which electron transport from hydrogen to organohalides was coupled with atp synthesis ⅱ co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd in which hcbd had inhibitive impact on atp generation part e g atpase and the electron transport from hydrogen to organohalides was not effectively coupled with atp synthesis ⅲ in vitro active but in vivo inactive debromination of bdcm in which bdcm had inhibitive effect on parts of the electron transport chains e g hase therefore for the first time these results unraveled three representative models of impact of organohalides on the electron transport chain and energy conservation of ohrb and their underlying mechanisms fig 5 particularly for the ubiquitous impact ⅱ co metabolism and impact ⅲ hydrogenase inhibition similar observations had been reported in previous studies on microbial attenuation of both halogenated and non halogenated organic pollutants of which the underlying mechanism remained elusive bashir et al 2018 choi et al 2021 gafni et al 2020 im et al 2019 kassenga et al 2004 maymó gatell et al 1999 for example d mccartyi 195 dechlorinated vc and hch isomers in a co metabolic process maymó gatell et al 1999 bashir et al 2018 similar co metabolism had been reported for the reductive dehalogenation of 3 chlorobenzene and pcp in pure culture desulfomonile tiedjei dcb 1 mohn and kennedy 1992 of pce in pure culture d mccartyi 11 g zhao and he 2019 and of 1 2 dichloroethane and chlorofluorocarbons in dehalococcoides containing microcosms and field samples im et al 2019 kassenga et al 2004 identification of these co metabolic dechlorination processes were based on the cell growth of ohrb in this study our experimental evidence provided mechanistic insight into co metabolic dehalogenation i e inhibition of organohalides on the atpase resulted in extremely low efficiency of atp generation and the dehalogenation process barely supported cell growth of ohrb and the inhibition of atpase would lead to delayed dehalogenation of other substrates e g pce nonetheless the mechanisms of atpase inhibition could be complicated and varied for different inhibitors for example inhibition of the h atpase by venturicidin and oligomycin was correlated with inhibition of f0 mediated proton transport perlin et al 1985 while phytopolyphenols inhibited atpase by affecting f1 sector and increasing the duration of the catalytic dwell sekiya et al 2012 2014 in addition rdases might have a broader range of substrates relative to their hosting microorganisms the comparatively narrower substrate range of living cells could be due to the other metabolic parts e g hase examples included the bdcm dehalogenation in this study and pcp dechlorination in crude cell extract of desulfitobacterium chlororespirans co23 inactive in in vivo assay löffler et al 1996 previous studies identified different inhibitive effects on the hase nitric oxide interacted directly with the nife active site of hydrogenase and induced irreversible damage of the iron sulfur centers in electron transfer chains ceccaldi et al 2016 formaldehyde donated ch2 and covalently linked fe and the amine cofactor to block the active site of hase zhang et al 2021b in contrast specific inhibitive effects of organohalides on atpase and hase warranted further studies our results provided unprecedented insight into the impact of organohalides on the organohalide respiring electron transport chain which could be further employed to develop new strategies for screening ohrb in contrast to hcbd bdcm dehalogenation pce dechlorination was observed in all of the four pure cultures i e d mccartyi strains cg1 cg4 cg5 and g lovleyi lyy and three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 previous studies identified pce dechlorination activity in most organohalide respiring lineages including dehalococcoides dehalogenimonas and dehalobium of chloroflexi desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter of firmicutes and sulfurospirillum of proteobacteria kruse et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 these organohalide respiring populations could remove halogens from a wide range of organohalides e g pcbs chlorophenols and chlorobenzenes and at the same time dechlorinate pce qiu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore pce could be a promising substrate to screen ohrb for reductive dehalogenation of varied organohalides in in vitro tests bypassing the extremely time consuming cultivation and enrichment of ohrb based on the representative impact of organohalides on the ohrb s respiratory electron transport chains as well as the above mentioned activity screening strategy a four step process could be proposed to screen ohrb for reductive dehalogenation of a specific organohalide 1 step ⅰ establishment of pce enriched cultures 2 step ⅱ in vitro assay on rdase activity of target organohalides with the pce enriched cultures 3 step ⅲ in vitro assay on hase activity with the pce enriched cultures 4 step ⅳ in vitro assay on atpase activity with the pce enriched cultures the four step screening process could quickly cluster the enrichment cultures into four groups 1 rdase inactive namely no dehalogenation activity in step ⅱ 2 rdase active only active dehalogenation in step ⅱ but inhibition on hase in step ⅲ 3 co metabolic dehalogenation active dehalogenation in step ⅱ but inhibition on atpase in step ⅳ 4 metabolic dehalogenation active dehalogenation in step ⅱ and no inhibition presented in step ⅲ and step ⅳ notably though pce could be dechlorinated by most and phylogenetically diverse ohrb e g dehalococcoides geobacter desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter pre cultivation with pce might result in phase out of some non pce dechlorinating bacteria qiu et al 2020 since inhibitive impact of organohalides on the atpase hase was taxonomy specific the genes encoding organohalide tolerant atpases hydrogenases could be employed to engineer microorganisms being able to perform metabolic dehalogenation based on principles of synthetic microbiology dragomirova et al 2018 for example in contrast to no inhibition on hase of dvh bdcm inhibited the enzymatic activity of hases of dehalococcoides consequently the hase encoding genes of dvh might be incorporated and heterogeneously expressed in dehalococcoides to allow its metabolic debromination of bdcm which could provide a new avenue to devise strategies for future efficient bioremediation applications this study identified dehalococcoides as a hcbd dechlorinating lineage in which pce expressed rdase s catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd to our knowledge this is the first report on the identification of ohrb for reductive dechlorination of the persistent hcbd as well as the dechlorination pathways though previous studies have reported dechlorination of hcbd in both microcosms and reactors booker and pavlostathis 2000 bosma et al 1994 boucquey et al 1995 their functional ohrb remained unknown which might be due to the co metabolic hcbd dechlorination of most ohrb and consequent inability in their enrichment in addition in contrast to the scarce information on microbial reductive dechlorination process for hcbd conversion current studies largely focused on the processes of aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and physicochemical degradation kong et al 2020a lee et al 2017 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 for example an aerobic bacterium serratia marcescens hl1 was isolated for biodegradation of hcbd li et al 2008 nonetheless it was still a challenge to apply these aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and physicochemical degradation processes to remediate anoxic hcbd contaminated matrices e g soil and groundwater kong et al 2020a tang et al 2014 2016 in contrast the ohrb mediated reductive dechlorination could be a promising strategy to remediate hcbd contaminated sites and the identification of the key functional microorganisms was of great significance for understanding and optimization of the ohrb mediated remediation being proceeded with the reductive dechlorination of hcbd the lowly chlorinated congeners as dechlorination products or intermediates were comparatively more reduced and nucleophilic and became recalcitrant to subsequent chlorine removal which could be a common problem in multi step dehalogenation of highly halogenated organohalides chen and he 2018 dam et al 2019 laroe et al 2014 wang et al 2014 to achieve extensive dehalogenation a variety of strategies to integrate microbial reductive dehalogenation with other processes had been proposed recently dong et al 2019 lefèvre et al 2018 including bio nzvi rd combining microbial reductive dehalogenation and nano scale zero valent iron wang et al 2016 and bio rd pao integrating microbial reductive dehalogenation with persulfate activation and oxidation wu and wang 2022 therefore to extensively remediate hcbd contaminated sites following research gaps warranted future studies 1 to screen and enrich ohrb for extensive and metabolic dechlorination of hcbd 2 to develop new processes synergistically combining hcbd dechlorinating ohrb and subsequent oxidative process for extensive attenuation or even complete mineralization of hcbd 5 conclusions dehalococcoieds dechlorinate hcbd to e 1 2 3 tri cbd via e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd and z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd in a co metabolic way inhibition of hcbd on atpase may be the reason that dehalococcoieds is not able to couple cell growth with hcbd dechlorination inhibition of bdcm on hydrogenase a key component in upstream electron transport chains may be the reason underlying the observation of active bdcm debromination in in vitro assays but no activity in in vivo experiments this study

dehalogenation represents a promising strategy to remediate hcbd contaminated sites nonetheless information on the hcbd dechlorinating ohrb and their dechlorination pathways remain unknown in this study both in vivo and in vitro experiments as well as quantum chemical calculation were employed to successfully identify and characterize the reductive dechlorination of hcbd by dehalococcoides

amplicon sequencing analyses suggested that the hcbd dechlorinating dehalococcoides coupled their cell growth with dechlorination of perchloroethene pce rather than hcbd the in vivo and in vitro atpase assays indicated 78 89 decrease in atpase activity upon hcbd addition which suggested hcbd inhibition on atpase mediated energy harvest and provided rationality on the dehalococcoides mediated co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd interestingly dehalogenation screening of organohalides with the hcbd dechlorinating enrichment cultures showed that debromination of bromodichloromethane bdcm was active in the in vitro rdase assays but non active in the in vivo experiments further in vitro assays of hydrogenase activity suggested that significant inhibition of bdcm on the hydrogenase activity could block electron derivation from h2 for consequent reduction of organohalides in the in vivo experiments therefore our results provided unprecedented insight into metabolic co metabolic and rdase

unintentional formation and emission control in 2017 by stockholm convention stockholm convention 2019 the persistent organohalides with inherent stability are recalcitrant to environmental attenuation of which conversion is generally limited to reductive processes e g reductive dehalogenation due to the highly oxidized states lu et al 2017 2019 of the reductive processes microbial reductive dehalogenation mediated by organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb e g dehalococcoides dehalobacter and dehalogenimonas represents a promising strategy to remediate organohalide contaminated sites with advantages in low cost and environmental friendliness löffler and edwards 2006 in the organohalide respiration electrons derived from h2 or organic matter electron donors are transported to organohalides electron acceptors via membrane associated electron transport chains which is further coupled with atpase mediated atp generation to support cell growth of ohrb löffler and edwards 2006 mohn and tiedje 1992 wang et al 2018 take the obligate ohrb dehalococcoides as an example the complete organohalide respiring electron transport chain mainly includes two parts kublik et al 2016 wang et al 2018 1 in part i electrons are first derived from hydrogen under the catalysis of hydrogenase and then transferred via a compact protein complex to organohalides under mediation of the reductive dehalogenase kublik et al 2016 2 in part ⅱ energy can be generated through atpase based proton gradient driven atp synthesis of the two major organohalide respiration parts hydrogenase hase reductive dehalogenase rdase and atpase play key roles in the electron transport and energy harvest based on the complete organohalide respiring electron transport chain and the function of their key components i e hase rdase and atpase organohalides could be clustered into four groups 1 group i organohalides no dehalogenation activity is present when the rdase cannot catalyze halogen removal from the group i organohalides 2 group ⅱ rdase active only organohalides dehalogenation activity can be observed only in the in vitro test when the rdase can catalyze halogen removal from the group ⅱ organohalides jayachandran et al 2004 but inhibition on electron transport from the electron donor to electron acceptor results in no dehalogenation activity in the living culture in vivo test for example dechlorination of 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tecb by dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 was observed in in vitro but not in in vivo tests jayachandran et al 2003 jayachandran et al 2004 3 group ⅲ organohalides co metabolic dehalogenation activity can be observed only in the living culture in the presence of other organohalides bashir et al 2018 maymó gatell et al 1999 the co metabolic substrates cannot be energy sources to support cell growth nzila 2013 for microbial reductive dehalogenation energy harvest via the atpase based atp synthesis could be de coupled with reductive dehalogenation resulting in the co metabolic dehalogenation mohn and tiedje 1991 for instance transformation of δ hch was co metabolic in dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 in the presence of pce as a primary substrate bashir et al 2018 4 group ⅳ organohalides metabolic dehalogenation activity can be observed in the living culture with cell growth of ohrb when electron transport is coupled with atp generation mohn and tiedje 1991 e g metabolic dechlorination of pce by dehalococcoides geobacter desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter wang et al 2018 for a specific dehalogenating culture compositions of the four groups of organohalides may be different depending on the ohrb expressed rdase hase and atpase in previous studies accumulating experimental evidence has shown metabolic and co metabolic dechlorination as well as rdase active only in vitro dechlorination of organohalides for example co metabolic dechlorination of vinyl chloride vc and hexachlorocyclohexane hch was observed in dehalococcoides containing cultures bashir et al 2018 maymó gatell et al 1999 moreover dechlorination of 1 2 3 4 tetrachlorobenzene 1 2 3 4 tecb and pentachlorophenol pcp was observed in the in vitro assays but not in the living cultures in which dehalococcoides and desulfitobacterium were identified as major ohrb respectively jayachandran et al 2003 löffler et al 1996 sanford et al 1996 in addition organohalides may inhibit enzymatic activities of the hase and atpase for example 50 μm 1 2 3 4 tecb was verified to inhibit hase of dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 by 25 jayachandran et al 2004 moreover both 1 3 mm acetylene and 5 mm sulfide could down regulate transcription of atpase and hase encoding genes in d mccartyi 195 mao et al 2017a 2017b the inhibition of organohalides on the hase and atpase might be correlated with the metabolic co metabolic and rdase active only dehalogenation nonetheless the detailed correlation awaited exploration pertaining to microbial reductive dechlorination of hcbd the first report indicated that hcbd was dechlorinated to tetra cbd in a column packed with rhine river sediment bosma et al 1994 nonetheless the reductive dechlorination of hcbd to lowly chlorinated congeners was only observed in limited microcosm studies including a methanogenic consortium dechlorinating a mixture of hcbd pce ct and hexachloroethane boucquey et al 1995 and a microcosm enriched from hcbd contaminated sediment booker and pavlostathis 2000 thus far no information is available on the taxonomy of the hcbd dechlorinating microorganisms and on the dechlorination pathways mainly because of the difficulty in enrichment of hcbd dechlorinators and the unavailability of polychloro 1 3 butadiene standards in contrast to the microbial dechlorination of hcbd reduced cobalamins were identified to mediate the conversion of hcbd in abiotic experiments for instance hcbd was converted into penta cbd and other products in a reaction mixture containing ti ⅲ citrate and hydroxocobalamin bosma et al 1994 similar abiotic dechlorination of hcbd was observed in reaction mixtures containing cyanocobalamin james et al 2008 therefore no activity in microbial dechlorination of hcbd may not be due to the no low activity of cobalamin containing rdases but the inefficiency of other enzymatic processes e g hase and atpase mediated electron derivation and atp generation respectively which warrant experimental studies in this study hcbd dechlorination activity was first screened in pure and mixed cultures originated from different geographic sites then the hcbd dechlorination pathways were proposed based on both experimental evidence and quantum chemical calculations the ohrb were identified by combining bacterial cultivation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and qpcr analyses finally mechanisms underlying the no dehalogenation co metabolic dehalogenation or metabolic dehalogenation of hcbd and other organohalides e g bdcm and pcbs were tested this study provided mechanistic insight into ohrb mediated metabolic and co metabolic dehalogenation of organohalides enabling the development of new strategies for efficient bioremediation of organohalide contaminated sites and novel methods for high throughput screening of dehalogenation activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation and medium preparation four pure cultures i e d mccartyi cg1 cg4 cg5 and geobacter lovleyi lyy and three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 were obtained and established in our previous studies and their cultivation medium was prepared as described liang et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 wang et al 2014 briefly autoclaved bicarbonate buffered mineral salt medium was amended with 10 mm lactate for the three microcosms as the carbon source and electron donor in pure cultures acetate 10 mm and hydrogen gas 5 104 pa were supplemented as carbon source and electron donor respectively l cysteine 24 ppm and na2s 9h2o 48 ppm were added as reductants to control redox potential and resazurin 5 ppm was added as a redox indicator in the dechlorinating cultures 0 2 mm pce was amended as an electron acceptor to pre cultivate ohrb pce pregrown microcosms different organohalides i e 0 2 mm hcbd 0 2 mm bdcm or 0 5 ppm pcb180 were amended ⅰ as sole electron acceptor ⅱ after pce was completely consumed ⅲ together with pce in addition enrichment of pce dechlorinating dehalococcoides was achieved by sequential transfers liang et al 2021 to test the hase activity and atpase activity as described briefly the microcosms xm3 and hz2 were first transferred in the medium amended with lactate and pce after six successive transfers the carbon source and electron donor were changed to acetate and h2 respectively after another six successive transfers ampicillin 50 ppm was amended in the medium to inhibit cell growth of non dechlorinating microorganisms desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough dvh was cultivated anaerobically in the defined ls4d medium as described mukhopadhyay et al 2006 biotic controls were prepared similarly but without amendment with the organohalides abiotic controls were prepared similarly without inoculum all cultures were incubated in the dark at 30 c without shaking 2 2 dehalogenation activity test via in vitro assays dehalogenation cells were prepared and harvested as described qiu et al 2020 briefly cells were concentrated by centrifugation 15 min 10 000 g 4 c the in vitro dehalogenation activity tests were carried out with concentrated whole cells under anaerobic conditions in 4 ml bottles which contained 2 ml of assay solution yu et al 2018 the solution buffered with 100 mm tris hcl was reduced with 15 mm of ti ⅲ citrate and methyl viologen and contained organohalides i e 0 2 mm hcbd 0 2 mm bdcm or 0 5 ppm pcb180 as an electron acceptor all in vitro assay bottles in triplicate were incubated at 30 1 c in an anaerobic chamber 2 3 hydrogenase activity test hydrogenase activity was measured with anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid disodium salt aqds as an electron acceptor as described jayachandran et al 2004 briefly cultures were harvested by centrifugation 15 min 10 000 g 4 c in an anaerobic chamber the reaction mixture contained 5 mm aqds ε 1 8 mm 1 cm 1 at 450 nm in anoxic 100 mm tris hcl at ph 7 5 organohalide i e 0 2 mm pce or 0 2 mm bdcm was added separately to test their impact on hase activity a volume of 10 ml of assay solution was filled in a 20 ml serum bottle containing 5 h2 the reaction was started by the injection of 200 μl cell suspension and the increase in a450 was monitored with a spectrophotometer after 72 h the cell concentrations of xm3 hz2 and cg1 were 5 77 108 9 14 108 and 4 64 108 cell per ml respectively and the od600 of concentrated dvh in the suspension was 3 60 biotic control was prepared as described without organohalide addition or without h2 abiotic control was prepared similarly with defined medium instead of cell suspension all bottles in triplicate were incubated at 30 1 c 2 4 atpase activity test atpase activity was measured according to the manufacture s protocol described in genmed h atpase kit genmed scientifics u s a in the in vivo assays 0 2 mm hcbd was first amended in pce pregrown microcosms after 24 hours incubation cells were harvested via centrifugation to test the atpase activity by following the manufacturer s instruction in the in vitro assays similarly the pce pregrown microcosms were harvested by centrifugation then 0 2 mm hcbd was amended in the reaction mixture and subjected to the atpase activity test in biotic control atpase activity was tested using pce pregrown microcosms without amendment of hcbd for detection of the atpase activity the decrease in a340 was monitored in succession for 30 min and atpase activity was calculated by following the manufacturer s instruction 2 5 analytical techniques chloroethenes and pcbs were analyzed as described previously qiu et al

the equilibrium geometries of all chloro 1 3 butadienes were obtained at functional beck 3 lee yang parr b3lyp with a def2 svp basis set and confirmed by vibrational analyses with the same method the latter showed no imaginary frequency the gas phase hishfeld schemed population analyses hirshfeld 1977 of all chloro 1 3 butadienes were calculated at b3lyp def2 svp considering the highly correlation of hirshfeld atomic charges under distinct environments the hirshfeld population analyses under aquatic and protein environments were not considered zhang et al 2021a for a specific substrate its chlorine substituent with the least negative hirshfeld charge can be preferably abstracted in dehalococcoides mediated dehalogenation zhang et al 2017 the significant difference of hirshfeld charges associated with unequal chlorine substituents are larger than 0 003 zhang et al 2017 2 7 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing qpcr and microbial community analyses microbial cells for dna extraction were harvested by centrifugation from 1 ml cultures 15 min 10 000 g 4 c total community genomic dna extraction was performed using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals carlsbad ca usa the 16s rrna gene based pcr amplification was conducted under the condition as described wang et al 2019 the primer set i e u515f u909r was used to amplify v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene narihiro et al 2015 wang et al 2020 to identify amplicon sequence variants asvs 16s rrna gene amplicon reads were analyzed through the dada2 pipeline von schwartzenberg et al 2021 taxonomy was assigned using the dada2 implementation of the rdp classifier using the dada2 formated training sets for silva132 kumar et al 2019 von schwartzenberg et al 2021 the qpcr enumeration of dehalococcoides cells were performed with quantitect sybr green pcr kit as described previously liang et al 2021 wang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 microbial reductive dechlorination of hcbd hcbd dechlorination activity was screened in four pure cultures i e d mccartyi cg1 cg4 cg5 and g lovleyi lyy and three pcb pce dechlorinating microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 using in vitro assays in contrast to no dechlorination activity in the four pure cultures or abiotic controls hcbd was dechlorinated to penta and tetra cbds in in vitro tests with the three microcosms fig s1 these results suggested that rdase s expressed in pce pregrown microcosms catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd possibly via mediation by pce hcbd bifunctional rdase s to further confirm that ohrb in the three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 were capable of dechlorinating hcbd three sets of in vivo experiments were established fig 1 1 hcbd hcbd was amended as a sole electron acceptor in the three microcosms 2 pce hcbd hcbd was amended in the three pce pregrown microcosms 3 pce hcbd pce and hcbd were simultaneously amended in the three microcosms surprisingly no hcbd dechlorination activity was observed in the hcbd or pce hcbd experimental sets fig 1 fig s2 in addition co existence of pce and hcbd significantly inhibited pce dechlorination in the three microcosms in contrast similar to observations in the in vitro tests hcbd was dechlorinated to penta and tetra cbds in all of the pce hcbd experimental sets fig 1 fig s2 these results indicated that hcbd might be dechlorinated by ohrb in the three microcosms in a non metabolic way moreover the pce induced rdase s in these microcosms catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd 3 2 quantum chemically calculated hcbd dechlorination pathways since mono to penta cbds were not commercially available as analytical standards hirshfeld charges q cl of all chloro 1 3 butadienes cbds were calculated with gaussian 09 rev e 01 to explore their potential dechlorination pathways fig 2 fig s3 interestingly results showed that the overall reductive dechlorination of cbds largely depended on the substituted chlorine numbers i e the less chlorine numbers the lower dechlorination reactivity potential for example dechlorination of hcbd to e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd and z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd followed a high to low reactivity order corresponding to their highest q cl values of 0 002757 0 003336 and 0 016715 respectively fig 2 therefore further dechlorination of tetra cbds to tri di and mono cbds became even less favorable fig s3 explaining the observation of penta and tetra cbds as major hcbd dechlorination products in experimental studies moreover the dechlorination pathway of a specific cbd could be predicted by the q cl values for instance hcbd with three different chlorine substitutions had varied q cl values of 0 002757 0 002993 and 0 024163 and the chlorine with the highest q cl value of 0 002757 was most likely dechlorinated consequently the chlorine removal from hcbd could generate e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd as a dechlorination product intermediate similarly z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd could be a dechlorination product of the e 1 1 2 3 4 penta cbd by removing the chlorine with the highest q cl value of 0 003336 further dechlorination of the z e 1 2 3 4 tetra cbd to tri cbds became unfavorable due to the extremely low q cl value i e q cl 0 016715 fig 2 fig s3 3 3 hcbd dechlorination as a co metabolic process to identify hcbd dechlorinating bacteria in the three microcosms 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis was employed to gain insight into their microbial community compositions results showed the high relative abundance of dehalococcoides as the only obligate ohrb in the three microcosms i e 19 49 15 58 and 7 84 in xm3 ts1 and hz2 respectively fig s4 compared to biotic controls the significantly higher relative abundance of dehalococcoides in pce dechlorinating xm3 suggested dehalococcoides as a major dechlorinating population growing on pce fig 3 a fig s4 notably pce amendment also stimulated growth of acetogenic populations e g veillonella and megasphaera fig 3a which could be due to the consumption of acetate by dehalococcoides and consequent improvement of thermodynamic conditions of the acetogens as described liang et al 2021 to further confirm whether the pce enriched dehalococcoides was a hcbd dechlorinating population dehalococcoides in microcosm xm3 was further enriched and subjected to in vitro tests of hcbd dechlorination activities results showed the positive and linear correlation between hcbd dechlorination activity and the relative abundance of dehalococcoides fig 3b fig s5a i e 90 92 hcbd dechlorination in the highly enriched culture 82 72 dehalococcoides vs 43 59 hcbd dechlorination in the less enriched culture 19 49 dehalococcoides these results together with no other known ohrb presented in the cultures suggested dehalococcoides to be a hcbd dechlorinating population in contrast to the high hcbd dechlorination activity in pce pregrown microcosms no dechlorination activity was observed in cultures fed with sole hcbd indicating hcbd dechlorination possibly via a co metabolic process to confirm it qpcr was utilized to quantify cell growth of dehalococcoides upon pce and sequential hcbd dechlorination in pce hcbd microcosm of xm3 dehalococcoides cells increased from 4 28 106 to 1 87 108 cells ml 1 upon pce dechlorination but did not grow further upon sequential hcbd amendment fig 3c fig s5b in contrast no significant cell growth of dehalococcoides was observed in xm3 controls solely amended with hcbd fig 3c fig s5b these results together with hcbd dechlorination kinetics suggested that hcbd dechlorination was a co metabolic process in this co metabolic process dehalococcoides could derive electrons from h2 for sequential reductive dechlorination but was not able to obtain energy for cell growth based on the structure of organohalide respiring electron transport chains in ohrb the co metabolism of hcbd could be due to the inhibition on atpase of the second respiration part to test it experiments were performed with dehalococcoides enriched xm3 i e dehalococcoides accounted for 82 72 of total community which confirmed the inhibitive effect of hcbd on atpase i e 87 33 and 78 89 decrease of the atpase activity upon hcbd addition in the in vivo and in vitro experiments respectively fig 3d 3 4 different impact of bdcm on the organohalide respiring electron transport chains to test whether the three pce pregrown microcosms dehalogenated other organohalides in a similar way with the co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd in vitro dehalogenation experiments were performed with pcb180 and three halomethanes i e carbon tetrachloride chloroform and bromodichloromethane bdcm different from active pcb180 dechlorination in hz2 xm3 and ts1 dehalogenation activity of bdcm was only observed in pce pregrown microcosm hz2 debromination to dichloromethane suggesting that the ohrb in hz2 employed pce expressed rdase s to catalyze bromine removal from the bdcm to further confirm the debromination activity three sets of in vivo experiments were set up with the hz2 1 bdcm bdcm was amended as a sole electron acceptor 2 pce bdcm bdcm was added to the pce pregrown culture 3 pce bdcm pce and bdcm were simultaneously amended in the culture at the same time three sets of similar in vivo experiments were set up with the hz2 and xm3 1 pcb180 pcb180 was amended as a sole electron acceptor 2 pce pcb180 pcb180 was added to the pce pregrown culture 3 pce pcb180 pce and pcb180 were simultaneously amended in the culture surprisingly in contrast to metabolic dechlorination of pce pcbs fig s6 and co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd fig 1 in the microcosms no bdcm debromination activity was observed in all in vivo experiments fig s7 or abiotic controls this phenomenon might result from the inhibitive impact of bdcm on the electron transport chain for example the inhibition of hase in dehalococcoides would block electron transfer from h2 to the downstream bdcm debrominating rdases to test this speculation in vitro experiments with h2 and aqds as an electron donor and acceptor respectively were set up with the highly dehalococcoides enriched microcosm hz2 as well as other pure and enrichment cultures fig 4 in contrast to no inhibition of pce bdcm was shown to significantly inhibit the hase activity in the dehalococcoides enriched hz2 fig 4a similar bdcm inhibition on the hase was also observed in the dehalococcoides enriched microcosm xm3 fig 4b and pure culture cg1 fig 4c in contrast bdcm had no obvious inhibition on the hase of d vulgaris hildenborough dvh as a non dechlorinating pure culture fig 4d implying the taxonomy specific inhibition of bdcm on hase no aqds reduction was detected in abiotic controls and biotic controls without amendment of h2 4 discussion in this study to investigate the mechanism underlying observations of metabolic co metabolic and rdase active only dehalogenation four organohalides i e pce pcbs hcbd and bdcm were used as electron acceptors in dehalococcoides cultures the pce pcbs hcbd and bdcm were shown to have distinctively different impacts on the organohalide respiring electron transport chains of ohrb ⅰ metabolic dechlorination of pce and pcbs without inhibition in which electron transport from hydrogen to organohalides was coupled with atp synthesis ⅱ co metabolic dechlorination of hcbd in which hcbd had inhibitive impact on atp generation part e g atpase and the electron transport from hydrogen to organohalides was not effectively coupled with atp synthesis ⅲ in vitro active but in vivo inactive debromination of bdcm in which bdcm had inhibitive effect on parts of the electron transport chains e g hase therefore for the first time these results unraveled three representative models of impact of organohalides on the electron transport chain and energy conservation of ohrb and their underlying mechanisms fig 5 particularly for the ubiquitous impact ⅱ co metabolism and impact ⅲ hydrogenase inhibition similar observations had been reported in previous studies on microbial attenuation of both halogenated and non halogenated organic pollutants of which the underlying mechanism remained elusive bashir et al 2018 choi et al 2021 gafni et al 2020 im et al 2019 kassenga et al 2004 maymó gatell et al 1999 for example d mccartyi 195 dechlorinated vc and hch isomers in a co metabolic process maymó gatell et al 1999 bashir et al 2018 similar co metabolism had been reported for the reductive dehalogenation of 3 chlorobenzene and pcp in pure culture desulfomonile tiedjei dcb 1 mohn and kennedy 1992 of pce in pure culture d mccartyi 11 g zhao and he 2019 and of 1 2 dichloroethane and chlorofluorocarbons in dehalococcoides containing microcosms and field samples im et al 2019 kassenga et al 2004 identification of these co metabolic dechlorination processes were based on the cell growth of ohrb in this study our experimental evidence provided mechanistic insight into co metabolic dehalogenation i e inhibition of organohalides on the atpase resulted in extremely low efficiency of atp generation and the dehalogenation process barely supported cell growth of ohrb and the inhibition of atpase would lead to delayed dehalogenation of other substrates e g pce nonetheless the mechanisms of atpase inhibition could be complicated and varied for different inhibitors for example inhibition of the h atpase by venturicidin and oligomycin was correlated with inhibition of f0 mediated proton transport perlin et al 1985 while phytopolyphenols inhibited atpase by affecting f1 sector and increasing the duration of the catalytic dwell sekiya et al 2012 2014 in addition rdases might have a broader range of substrates relative to their hosting microorganisms the comparatively narrower substrate range of living cells could be due to the other metabolic parts e g hase examples included the bdcm dehalogenation in this study and pcp dechlorination in crude cell extract of desulfitobacterium chlororespirans co23 inactive in in vivo assay löffler et al 1996 previous studies identified different inhibitive effects on the hase nitric oxide interacted directly with the nife active site of hydrogenase and induced irreversible damage of the iron sulfur centers in electron transfer chains ceccaldi et al 2016 formaldehyde donated ch2 and covalently linked fe and the amine cofactor to block the active site of hase zhang et al 2021b in contrast specific inhibitive effects of organohalides on atpase and hase warranted further studies our results provided unprecedented insight into the impact of organohalides on the organohalide respiring electron transport chain which could be further employed to develop new strategies for screening ohrb in contrast to hcbd bdcm dehalogenation pce dechlorination was observed in all of the four pure cultures i e d mccartyi strains cg1 cg4 cg5 and g lovleyi lyy and three microcosms i e xm3 ts1 and hz2 previous studies identified pce dechlorination activity in most organohalide respiring lineages including dehalococcoides dehalogenimonas and dehalobium of chloroflexi desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter of firmicutes and sulfurospirillum of proteobacteria kruse et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2014 these organohalide respiring populations could remove halogens from a wide range of organohalides e g pcbs chlorophenols and chlorobenzenes and at the same time dechlorinate pce qiu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 therefore pce could be a promising substrate to screen ohrb for reductive dehalogenation of varied organohalides in in vitro tests bypassing the extremely time consuming cultivation and enrichment of ohrb based on the representative impact of organohalides on the ohrb s respiratory electron transport chains as well as the above mentioned activity screening strategy a four step process could be proposed to screen ohrb for reductive dehalogenation of a specific organohalide 1 step ⅰ establishment of pce enriched cultures 2 step ⅱ in vitro assay on rdase activity of target organohalides with the pce enriched cultures 3 step ⅲ in vitro assay on hase activity with the pce enriched cultures 4 step ⅳ in vitro assay on atpase activity with the pce enriched cultures the four step screening process could quickly cluster the enrichment cultures into four groups 1 rdase inactive namely no dehalogenation activity in step ⅱ 2 rdase active only active dehalogenation in step ⅱ but inhibition on hase in step ⅲ 3 co metabolic dehalogenation active dehalogenation in step ⅱ but inhibition on atpase in step ⅳ 4 metabolic dehalogenation active dehalogenation in step ⅱ and no inhibition presented in step ⅲ and step ⅳ notably though pce could be dechlorinated by most and phylogenetically diverse ohrb e g dehalococcoides geobacter desulfitobacterium and dehalobacter pre cultivation with pce might result in phase out of some non pce dechlorinating bacteria qiu et al 2020 since inhibitive impact of organohalides on the atpase hase was taxonomy specific the genes encoding organohalide tolerant atpases hydrogenases could be employed to engineer microorganisms being able to perform metabolic dehalogenation based on principles of synthetic microbiology dragomirova et al 2018 for example in contrast to no inhibition on hase of dvh bdcm inhibited the enzymatic activity of hases of dehalococcoides consequently the hase encoding genes of dvh might be incorporated and heterogeneously expressed in dehalococcoides to allow its metabolic debromination of bdcm which could provide a new avenue to devise strategies for future efficient bioremediation applications this study identified dehalococcoides as a hcbd dechlorinating lineage in which pce expressed rdase s catalyzed the chlorine removal from hcbd to our knowledge this is the first report on the identification of ohrb for reductive dechlorination of the persistent hcbd as well as the dechlorination pathways though previous studies have reported dechlorination of hcbd in both microcosms and reactors booker and pavlostathis 2000 bosma et al 1994 boucquey et al 1995 their functional ohrb remained unknown which might be due to the co metabolic hcbd dechlorination of most ohrb and consequent inability in their enrichment in addition in contrast to the scarce information on microbial reductive dechlorination process for hcbd conversion current studies largely focused on the processes of aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and physicochemical degradation kong et al 2020a lee et al 2017 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 for example an aerobic bacterium serratia marcescens hl1 was isolated for biodegradation of hcbd li et al 2008 nonetheless it was still a challenge to apply these aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and physicochemical degradation processes to remediate anoxic hcbd contaminated matrices e g soil and groundwater kong et al 2020a tang et al 2014 2016 in contrast the ohrb mediated reductive dechlorination could be a promising strategy to remediate hcbd contaminated sites and the identification of the key functional microorganisms was of great significance for understanding and optimization of the ohrb mediated remediation being proceeded with the reductive dechlorination of hcbd the lowly chlorinated congeners as dechlorination products or intermediates were comparatively more reduced and nucleophilic and became recalcitrant to subsequent chlorine removal which could be a common problem in multi step dehalogenation of highly

15878,monitoring of water distribution network wdn requires placement of sensors at strategic locations to detect maximum contamination events at the earliest the multi objective optimization moo of sensor placement is a complicated problem owing to its combinatorial nature interconnected and large wdn sizes and temporal flows producing complex outcomes for a given set of contamination events in this study a new method is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by condensing the nodal search space this method first segregates the nodes based on intrusion events detected using k means clustering followed by selecting nodes from each group based on the improvement observed in the objectives namely contamination event detection expected detection time and affected population the selected nodes formed the decision variable space for the moo study the developed strategy was tested on two benchmark networks bwsn network1 and c town network and its performance is compared with the traditional method in terms of hypervolume contribution rate cr indicator and the number of pareto points the optimal subset of nodes generated twice the number of pareto points than the complete set of nodes set for placing 20 sensors and had 10 more than cr indicator than the traditional method for the placement of 5 sensors the proposed solutions were better at the higher detection likelihood values which is required to achieve maximum detection the proposed sensor placement algorithm can be easily scaled to large wdns it is expected to provide a better optimal sensor placement solution irrespective of network size as compared to the traditional approach graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sensor placement water distribution network multiobjective optimization optimal sensor placement bwsn c town 1 introduction the advancements in sensors for water quality measurements have enabled water supply assurance and steadily shifted the focus towards monitoring and maintaining the quality of supplied water in water distribution networks wdn storey et al 2010 monitoring of wdns has been widely researched with the application of sensors in the network concentrating on collecting crucial supply data to facilitate swift mitigation procedures creaco et al 2019 nurani et al 2018 the placement of the sensors at niche locations is essential due to budgetary constraints thus allowing only a limited number of sensors to be placed in a vast network zeng et al 2018 this led to research in various sensor placement strategies aimed at monitoring of wdns with a limited number of sensors the main issue for placing sensors in a wdn arises in selecting the best solution from a vast number of feasible solutions available to utility managers the efficiency of the best solution has to be assessed and compared with other available solutions and this efficiency can be estimated based on the required goals or objectives for placing the sensors though the sensor placement problem spp can be constructed as an optimization problem finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive when deterministic methods are employed while stochastic approaches result in sub optimal solutions hu et al 2020 xu et al 2013 the intricacies of optimizing the sensor placement in a wdn are further explained in the following paragraphs the main components of the sensor placement problem that have been extensively researched are objectives optimization algorithm and decision variables with the network flow configuration and nodal demands of a wdn two crucial information can be estimated flow and contaminant concentration at any node and the time taken for the contaminant to travel in the network based on this data the battle of water sensor networks bwsn hart et al 2007 design challenge was conducted to compare various approaches to solving spp for wdns the problem was formulated with four objectives minimization of expected detection time minimization of the expected population affected minimization of expected amount of contaminated consumed and maximization of detection likelihood the study revealed that the first three objectives affected population contaminated water consumed and detection time conflicted with detection likelihood since then many researchers have discussed the multi objective optimization of spp mospp for wdn focusing on detecting events and either of the other three objectives hu et al 2018 the effect of contamination in wdn can be captured in pollution matrices and it can be developed by simulating a series of contamination scenarios in epanet 2 0 https www epa gov water research epanet rossman 2000 and recording the response from the network compactly in a matrix the pollution matrices have number of rows equal to the number of nodes in the network and columns equal to the number of contamination events that are simulated each value represents the information like contamination detection time taken for detection if contamination detected etc by the corresponding node row for the corresponding event column so each row provides values for the estimation of objective function if a sensor is placed at the corresponding node thus by adopting similar procedure for all the nodes rows the values required for estimation of the objective function for each node or set of nodes can be stored and estimated efficiently this step will reduce computation cost as during optimization pollution matrix is utilized to estimate the objective function rather than simulating all the contamination events for estimating the objective function for each sensor solution the information recorded in the pollution matrices depicted contamination presence time of detection water consumed before detection or the number of persons affected before detection etc chastain 2006 hart et al 2007 various optimization algorithms have been implemented to solve the spp and mospp such as genetic algorithm ga and its variants eliades and polycarpou 2006 hu et al 2020 preis and ostfeld 2007 greedy randomized adaptive search procedures grasp techniques berry et al 2006 krause et al 2008 heuristics aral et al 2010 guan et al 2006 particle swarm optimization pso hu et al 2015 marlim and kang 2021 and constrained mixed integer programming mip formulations berry et al 2008 also the teva spot software tool was developed by the u s epa to evaluate the contamination risks and design sensor monitoring stations for wdn teva spot allows the users to choose an objective among the following a number of failed detections b time of detection c estimated population exposed d estimation population contaminated e extent of contamination f mass of contaminated water consumed g length of pipe contaminated and h volume of water contaminated the objectives c d f and h are correlated with the time of detection while objectives e and g are correlated with objective a it can be seen that minimization of objective a is complementary to the maximization of objective number percentage of successful detections which is analogous to the detection likelihood objective considered in this study however teva spot carries out single objective optimization of the above mentioned objectives and the conflicting objectives have to be provided as a constraint us environmental protection agency 2012 stochastic techniques generate near optimal solutions with low memory requirements and cpu time for both spp and mospp while the mip formulations consume huge memory to provide optimal solutions for spp and constrained mospp nevertheless irrespective of the methods applied for optimizing sensor locations the complexity of wdn due to vastness complex interflows and temporal demands have kept the search for optimal sensor locations still a significant challenge adedoja et al 2019 hu et al 2018 the third component represents the decision variables given by the set of nodes in the network the problem size depends on the number of nodes considered for placing sensors as large number of nodes translate into large number of node sensor pairs this makes the problem computationally and memory wise expensive the problem can be interpreted as a combinatorial problem of choosing a solution from nck combinations where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of sensors blockeel et al 2013 however if a few nodes are deemed non potential and only m such nodes are considered for sensor placement the number of combinations reduces to mck which is lesser than nck for instance if a network has 100 nodes but only 90 nodes are chosen for the placement of 5 sensors then the total number of combinations reduces by more than 41 this led to the following studies that focused on improving the nodal search space by contracting the wdn using graph trimming methods and topography based clustering designing contamination events based on heuristics and decreasing decision variable nodes search space considered for optimization klise et al klise et al 2013 pruned large wdn using graph trimming techniques followed by a two tiered optimization procedure the first step involved grouping similar nodes based on topography and flow pattern into super nodes and finding the optimal super nodes for placing sensors and then fine tuning the sensor locations using the original nodes grouped in the optimal super nodes xu et al clustered the wdn into k regions for placing k sensors and from each cluster one node was selected based on maximum connectivity with other nodes in the cluster xu et al 2008 this selection of single node from k clusters was improvised by greedily selecting k nodes with better overall connectivity within the wdn leading to better observability of the whole network di nardo et al 2018 the above methods oversimplified the spp by overseeing the effects of temporal demands reverse flows and contaminant transport velocity as their applicability was tested only on a small number of contamination events diao et al implemented controllability analysis on bwsn network1 to condense the decision variable search space by diao and rauch 2013 choosing nodes that facilitated maximum network observability in a given time frame but this prioritized the observability at the expense of swiftness in detections when a set of nodes are considered together for sensor placement in contrast khorshid el al khorshidi et al 2018 developed a node selection strategy based on value of information voi and transinformation entropy te techniques the nodes were compared pair wise in terms detection time and grouped according to the swiftness in detecting the given set of contamination events the results of the voi te method were compared with the results from teva spot tool which uses grasp heuristics but the comparison with the traditional multi objective optimization is required to assess the efficiency of the voi te method mandel et al defined quality zones within the wdn by clustering the nodes based on time varying concentration data mandel et al 2015 but the study has not been extended to sensor placement problem the quality zones were developed by tracing the water from the source nodes using epanet2 0 but in a wdn the contaminant intrusion can occur at any node moreover the simulations were carried out at steady state conditions which are generally not observed in real wdns thus there is a need for a pre selection procedure to reduce the nodal search space that encompasses the dynamic water quality simulations with a focus on the sensor placement objectives the observations or pollution matrices acquired from the contamination transport simulations provide the required data on the objectives detection of contaminant time of arrival of contaminated water and population affected at the nodes based on this data the nodes from the wdn can be clustered in terms of similarity in detecting events followed by selecting nodes from these clusters with better objective function values in this study a novel strategy is developed based on k means clustering and cluster wise greedy selection to reduce the nodal search space for multi objective sensor placement study this strategy is based on the transport of contaminant both nodal observation and transportation time in the wdn rather than just the connectivity the resulting subset of nodes will be used for multi objective optimization to generate multiple sensor design solutions with trade offs between objectives the multi objective optimization is carried out for two sets of conflicting objectives 1 maximizing detection likelihood vs minimizing detection time and 2 maximizing detection likelihood vs minimizing the affected population the pattern search algorithm custódio et al 2011 which is based on direct search methods for optimization is implemented for finding the pareto points the node selection strategy is tested on two benchmark networks bwsn network1 and c town network finally the pareto front generated using the optimal subset of nodes are compared with the traditional method of performing mospp 2 methodology the work carried out in this study consists of three sections as described in fig 1 firstly the effect of contamination in the wdn is analysed by simulating various contamination events the conditions of each event time node etc is provided by matlab to epanet2 0 where extended hydraulic and water quality simulation of each event is carried out the parameters of the network nodal concentration time of contamination observance are then fed back to matlab for developing the pollution matrices the second step is identifying a crucial set of nodes that provide higher detection likelihood and lower detection time the nodes are first clustered in the node clustering module followed by cluster wise selection of nodes for the objectives considered in the node selection module both the modules are developed in matlab the selected nodes are then used for multi objective optimization study of sensor placement in the third step the dotted lines represent the paths that will provide the decision search space for the multi objective optimization generally only the first and third steps are carried out to find the optimal pareto which suggests that all the nodes of wdn are potential locations for placing sensors in order to compare with the proposed strategy the traditional method of estimating the pareto is also carried out 2 1 contaminant transport simulation and pollution matrix the two benchmark networks considered as test cases for the developed node selection strategy bwsn network1 and c town network are shown in fig 2 the contamination scenario for bwsn network 1 was a subset of bwsn challenge case a hart et al 2007 with an intrusion at every half an hour interval at each node for two hours the contamination event is defined by the parameters injection flow rate 125 l h contaminant concentration 230 000 mg l and injection duration 2 h this translates to intrusion of 479167 mg min of contamination for two hours it is assumed that the ingested contaminant remains inert throughout the network and it is consumed only at the demand nodes while in c town a 15 min interval for each contamination event was set to capture the intricacies of contaminant flow within the network the number of sensors to be placed was fixed to 5 and 20 translating to 3 8 and 15 of nodes in bwsn network1 respectively and 1 2 and 5 of the c town network it is assumed that sensors have a sensitivity limit of 0 01 mg l and there is no lag between detecting a contaminant by the sensor transmitting of information to the utility manager table 1 describes the contamination events design for both the wdns the contamination event simulations were carried out in epanet2 0 integrated with matlab 2020b the results of the contamination events were recorded in three pollution matrices depicting the detection of the event time to detection and population affected the events detections matrix edm is binary in nature where 1 represented if the contamination was observed and 0 otherwise the time to detection pollution matrix tdm stored the time delay in contaminant observation since the onset of contamination for each node for all the intrusion events similarly the population affected matrix pam provides the details about the number of people affected until the contamination is observed 2 2 generation of optimal subset of nodes this section discusses the objectives for the sensor placement study and the objective function based node selection strategy 2 2 1 definition of objective functions the objectives evaluated for the mospp study are a detection likelihood b expected time of detection and c expected population affected prior to detection a the detection likelihood z1 is defined as the percentage of contamination events detected for a given design of sensors 1 z 1 100 n i 1 n d i i 1 2 3 n where i 1 2 3 n refers to the n contamination events simulated for the network and di 1 if the contamination event i was detected otherwise 0 b the time of detection for a particular contamination event i td is the minimum time to detect among all sensors j present in the design 2 t d i m i n t i j and the expected time of detection z2 is the expected value of td over n contaminations given by 3 z 2 e t d i c similarly the expected population affected prior to detection is the expected value of population affected pa computed over the assumed probability distribution of i contamination events 4 z 3 e p a i the estimation of pa i is explained in section a 1 the objectives are taken as is from bwsn challenge hart et al 2007 in the following paragraphs the expected time of detection will be referred to as detection time and expected population affected prior to detection as affected population for ease of discussion 2 2 2 generating optimal subset of nodes the ideal case for complete observation of the wdn is to place sensors at all the nodes in the network but it is not possible due to various constraints the following best case scenario is to design the sensor placement such that all the contamination events can be detected but a guarantee of 100 detection is inefficient if the time to detect is large or large population gets affected before detection it is necessary to assess the nodes based on swift detection of the contamination events the objectives for improving the detections and detection time or affected population are competing in nature that is placing sensors for better detections will deteriorate the detection time or affected population consider the simple example network with six nodes in a straight line as shown in fig 3 a the example is explained for the moo study of detection likelihood vs detection time but can also be easily extended to detection likelihood vs affected population for placing only one sensor in the network it can be observed that placing a sensor at node 5 can detect all the events but the expected detection time will be maximum for this sensor placement design on the other hand if the sensor is placed at the tank node the expected detection time will be minimum as the detection time is estimated based only on the detected events and only those events will be detected that occur at the tank due to the conflicting nature each objective requires different nodes for optimal value but at the cost of the other objective however if two sensors are to be placed in this simple network then the first sensor can be dedicated to maximizing the detection likelihood node 5 and the second sensor that results in minimum detection time in combination with node 5 can be selected note that the number of combinations for placing two sensors in nodes 6c2 15 is reduced to just 5 pairs comprised of node 5 and other nodes this methodology can be extended to real wdns by selecting all the nodes that improve the detections predominantly dead end nodes followed by selecting nodes that improve the detection time of previously selected nodes the selection procedure is two phased as nodes will be first selected based on event detections followed by detection time or affected population but real wdns are much more complex in design than the above network in fig 3 and this will lead to loss of important information when these nodes are considered for mospp in real wdns multiple sources in the form of reservoirs and overhead tanks are installed for reliable water supply the nodes that are connected to two sources might receive water from either of the sources or in the cases where the nodes are present in between reservoir and overhead tanks a change in water flow direction is observed whenever the source of water supply changes so it must be noted that these nodes and the nodes in the downstream will only be contaminated by the current source of water supply these issues of changing water flow direction can be overcome by segregating the network into different groups or clusters based on the similarity in events detected and selecting the nodes from the group in the following paragraphs the clustering and greedy selection procedure are further explained 2 2 2 1 k means clustering and node selection the nodes of the wdn were segregated into clusters using k means clustering based on the dissimilarity of events detected by the nodes rather than the time variant contamination concentration in k means clustering the data is clustered into k groups based on the distance metric between the k centroids and the observation data points lloyd 1982 the difference in the detection ability of the nodes is translated into the distance metric using the event detection matrix edm the edm is built of 0 s and 1 s and the hamming distance metric was used to estimate the distance between two nodal observations the hamming distance is calculated based on the xor operation and it estimates the number of bits that are different in each of the strings for example the distance between 101011 and 110011 is given by 101011 110011 011000 h a m m i n g d i s t a n c e 2 when this metric is applied to the detection matrix nodes with similar number of detections at the same bit locations events will be grouped into one in other words this calculates the dissimilarity between the nodes in detecting a given set of contamination events also if neither the nodes detect the contamination it does not affect the distance metric this clustering methodology prioritizes the transportation of contaminant to nodes during contamination events over connectivity or closeness of nodes which is norm considered in previous literature the number of clusters is estimated by performing clustering with a multiple number of clusters and then fixing it based on statistical measures mandel et al 2015 or they can be fixed based on the number of sensors to be placed xu et al 2008 the former procedure requires multiple k means clustering runs while in the latter only one node is chosen per cluster for sensor placement these procedures result in larger computation time and neglect of many potential locations respectively in this study a heuristics based approach is developed by assuming that all the nodes in the wdn are selected by choosing k nodes from k clusters for each objective considered for moo study for two objectives in mospp this results in the equation 5 2 k 2 n u m b e r o f n o d e s upon rearranging the above the number of clusters can be calculated as 6 k r o u n d n u m b e r o f n o d e s 2 the number of clusters was fixed by eq 6 and from each cluster the nodes were selected as discussed below 2 2 2 2 selection of nodes the node selection procedure is two phased and in each phase the nodes are selected for each of the objectives in mospp in the order of importance first the nodes are chosen for event detection followed by the second competing objective detection time z2 or affected population z3 the selection procedure relies on the pollution matrices for assessing the importance of the nodes in the first phase nodes are selected from each cluster in the clustering module focusing on z1 the nodes belonging to each cluster are stored in sets gi where i 1 2 k represents cluster i from each gi set nodes are selected in the order of maximum number of events detected z1 using the event detection matrix and stored in set ng i the node selection for a cluster is terminated when no further improvements in z1 is observed in the example network fig 3 node 2 from cluster 1 will have the maximum z1 value and no other nodes in the cluster can improve z1 value similarly only node 5 from cluster 2 will be selected thus for a given wdn ng i i 1 2 k are generated that comprise the nodes selected from sets gi i 1 2 k respectively the nodes with higher sensitivity to detection likelihood z1 is given by the union of the sets ng i denoted as p dl i 1 k n g i in the second phase the nodes are selected based on the improvement observed in detection time the nodes are selected from each set gi and their union will be defined as nodes with higher sensitivity to detection time firstly sets tg i are defined for each set gi and the nodes in pdl are added to each of the tg i sets inclusion of set pdl in the set tg i before selecting nodes ensures that all the contamination events are detected and the selected node will improve the overall detection time the detection times corresponding to the nodes were estimated using the time to detect matrix tdm then from each set gi nodes are appended one by one to set tg i that results in the lowest value z2 the nodes are appended till no further decrease in the detection time is observed or a maximum of k nodes are selected the nodes in a wdn will provide the lowest detection time when they are the source of contamination and a sensor is placed at them however the trade off in improving z2 for each new node selected is very low when the number of nodes in set tg i is large thus to control the number of selected nodes the second terminating criteria mandates choosing of a maximum of only k nodes from each group the set of nodes selected based on detection time is given by the union of set tg i as p dt i 1 k t g i this is the optimal subset of nodes considered for moo of z1 vs z2 note that the nodes for improving detection likelihood have already been added to sets tg i and thus do not require to be added separately during the implementation of the above selection procedure the nodes that were already part of ng i pdl and tg i were removed from sets gi to avoid repeated computations of already selected nodes the cluster wise greedy selection of nodes results in choosing nodes with lower detection time which are generally located in the upstream of the cluster as well as nodes with maximum observability which are generally located in the downstream of the cluster thus the combination of k means clustering and greedy selection results in set of selected nodes that are targeted towards both objectives in contrast the previous studies only focused on the network connectivity closeness to other nodes for trimming the network or just maximum observability at the expense of detection time the flowchart for node selection procedure is shown in fig 4 an example of network clustering and node selection procedure is illustrated in appendix a 2 2 3 multi objective optimization moo and contribution rate indicator the pattern search algorithm from matlab2020b was implemented to find the pareto front this algorithm uses a derivative free methodology by extending direct search methods to multi objective problems custódio et al 2011 in the node selection procedure the objective functions would be evaluated for selecting nodes therefore to provide a fair comparison the number of objective function calls made during the selection procedure is reduced from the maximum number of function counts for the proposed method pareto fronts of the traditional and proposed methods were compared in terms of contribution rate cr indicator based on hypervolume developed by cao et al 2015 the pareto fronts pfi to be compared are first compiled to generate a surrogate true pareto front pfs then the contribution from each of the pfi s in pfs is estimated using hypervolume hypervolume measures the size of the space enclosed by all points on the pareto front and a user defined reference point and it is indicated as ih pf r for a given pareto front pf and a reference point r after the evaluation of the reference point estimated based on cao et al 2015 cr indicator of pareto fronts from each method was calculated the contribution rate cr associated with each of the pareto front are estimated as 7 c r i i h p f i r i h p f s r where pfi is the set of non dominating points of pareto front i present in the surrogate true pareto pfs r refers to the reference point and ih refers to hypervolume the procedure for estimation is explained in appendix a 3 the value of cri close to 1 means that pfi is closest to replicating the surrogate true pareto front compared to other pfs a higher cr indicator translates into higher hypervolume dominance 3 results and discussion 3 1 bwsn network1 the contamination event simulations for bwsn network1 yielded three pollution matrices of dimensions 129 6192 as 48 events per node were simulated for each of the 129 nodes it was observed that 622 events remained undetected due to zero flow conditions at the nodes during contaminant intrusion the nodes of bwsn network1 were clustered into 8 groups based on eq 6 and 21 nodes were selected based on edm 51 based on tdm and 48 based on the pam most of the dead ends have been selected except junction 13 and junction 36 due to zero flow ensuring that all the observable events will be detected the 8 clusters with the average number of detections are depicted in fig 5 a the average number of detections for clusters ranged from 203 4 3 6 of observable events at the network entrance nodes and low flow nodes to 2893 0 51 94 of observable events at the downstream nodes the 72 nodes selected for detection likelihood vs detection time and 69 nodes selected for detection likelihood vs affected population are shown in fig 5b and c respectively the first cluster had the lowest mean detections and consisted of junctions 1 7 38 109 124 128 and reservoir node 129 junction 1 7 38 and 124 were selected during first phase of selection leaving junctions 109 128 and 129 as no improvement in detections were observed on appending these nodes in the second phase of selection all three nodes improved detection time and were thus added to the optimal subset of nodes whereas only junction 109 was selected for the affected population it must be noted that all three nodes have zero base demand but as the algorithm chooses at least one node from each group the node at downstream was selected out of 48 nodes selected for the affected population 13 had zero base demands these nodes were selected either due to their position between two nodes with non zero base demands like junction 91 or due to condition that makes the algorithm select at least one node from each cluster as observed for junction 109 it can be observed that five nodes in cluster 2 are disjointed from cluster 2 and are separated by cluster 6 this is because though the disjointed nodes are located closer to and at the downstream of cluster 6 the events detected by these nodes are more similar to the events detected by nodes of cluster 6 this is verified by the average number of events detected by the disjointed nodes 1181 8 which is closer to average number of events detected of cluster 2 1081 02 than cluster 6 1796 28 the matching rate is defined as the percentage of nodes from bwsn results appearing in the pre selected nodes and it is provided in table 2 the sensor locations nodes in bwsn challenge were given by 14 different research groups using different methods to optimize these locations the efficiency of the proposed method is tested by comparing the optimal subset of nodes with the possible sensor nodes provided in bwsn the matching rate of the bwsn 5 spp solution nodes with the optimal subset of nodes set osn was 78 8 and 75 6 for z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study respectively while only 26 9 matching rate was observed in the controllability analysis method set cas described in diao and rauch 2013 for bwsn 20 spp 64 71 and 67 06 of the bwsn solution nodes matched with set osn compared to 57 4 for set cas the lower matching rate of set cas might be due to excluding the cumulative effect of selected nodes in improvising the detection time meanwhile the proposed methodology weighs the nodes in terms of their individual significance in detecting events and reducing detection time or exposed population the nodes of set osn and bwsn results are enumerated in appendix a 4 the percentage of events detected with respect to mean detection time for set osn and set cas diao and rauch 2013 are shown in fig 6 about 66 16 of events were detected by osn while cas detected only 41 36 within 5 min of contamination also the set cas observed a maximum of 94 5 of events while osn observed 100 of the events this shows that the selected nodes have quicker reaction time to the contamination events than dn nodes for comparison purposes the sensor solutions from bwsn 5 sensor set b5 and bwsn 20 sensor set b20 were also plotted fig 6 the order of improvement of event detection percentage with respect to detection time was b5 cas osn and finally b20 sets the set osn was swift in detecting events than the set b5 and set cas but lagged behind set b20 it must be noted that only the combination of nodes from set osn is required for placing the sensor and thus multi objective optimization was carried out to verify the efficiency of selected nodes the parameters for multi objective optimization study were number of runs 30 maximum function count 50000 bounds 1 number of nodes tolerance 1 10 6 final pareto front compiled non dominating set of all 30 runs the paretosearch tool of matlab2020b that incorporates pattern search technique was used for generating pareto fronts the legend traditional refers to the generic method where all the nodes in wdn are deemed as plausible sensor locations while the legend proposed refers to the method developed in this study where only the optimal subset of nodes osn are considered for placing sensors fig 7 represents the process to estimate the surrogate true pareto front for placing 20 sensors for objectives z1 and z2 fig 7a depicts the complete set of pareto points obtained from 30 runs of the optimization a clear separation of the pareto points between traditional and proposed procedures was observed with the latter dominating the former in the range 50 to 90 detection likelihood this effect is reiterated when compiled pareto points from 30 runs are compared in fig 7b based on these pareto fronts the surrogate true pareto front and reference point were obtained and depicted in fig 7 c the surrogate true pareto fronts with the reference points for 5 and 20 sensors placement for objectives z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study are shown in fig 8 an overview of pareto points for z1 vs z2 study revealed that the osn performs better than the complete set whereas in z1 vs z3 study for placing 5 sensors the optimal subset generated fewer pareto points than traditional method and most of these pareto points had higher detection likelihood values this could be due to the exclusion of nodes with very low base demand that were not selected and when these combined with zero demand nodes with higher detection ability it resulted in a low number of people affected at higher z1 value this trend was again pronounced in 20 sensor results shown in fig 8 d where all the pareto points at z1 65 were obtained from the traditional method and at z1 75 were from the proposed method the comparisons of both methods in terms of cr indicator is shown in table 3 the cr indicator of both methods for 5spp was same in z1 vs z2 study indicating that both procedures dominate a significant portion of hypervolume at the same level whereas in z1 vs z3 study the traditional method was higher by 4 16 the cr indicator for 20 spp was 190 and 22 7 more than the traditional method in z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study respectively this indicated that the optimal subset provided better pareto points in terms of hypervolume dominance since the solutions with lower detection likelihood cannot be considered for placing sensors a cut off criterion was maintained to assess the number of pareto points contributed by both methods only those solutions whose z1 value was more than 50 of maximum observed events 50 of max z1 were considered as potential solutions the number of these pareto points observed for 5 sensors were higher for the traditional method while for 20 sensors proposed method provided a higher number of solutions the time taken for estimating the final pareto front using the proposed method for 5spp was 25 by average less than the traditional method while it was less by only 0 7 by average for 20spp both traditional and proposed methods generated better pareto points in comparison to bwsn results only 4 pareto points from bwsn were coinciding with pareto fronts obtained in this study illustrated in appendix a 5 3 2 c town network the pollution matrices for the c town network had 38016 contamination events for 396 nodes yielding a pollution matrix of dimension 396 38016 three nodes in the network did not detect any event and their respective contamination events were undetected due to zero flow the c town network was segregated into 14 groups and 263 nodes were selected for z1 vs z2 study and 261 nodes were selected for z1 vs z3 study illustrated in a4 7 the surrogate true pareto front and reference point for cr indicator estimation for c town network is displayed in fig 9 for 5spp comparable pareto points are generated by both the methods for both the mospp studies in the case of z1 vs z3 the proposed methodology generated better pareto points for higher detection likelihood similar to the results observed for bwsn network1 but for 20spp most of the pareto points in pfs were generated from the proposed method these observations have been reflected in the cr value of the corresponding problem provided in table 4 the set osn yielded 96 6 and 74 6 of pareto points in pfs for z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 respectively for 20spp the time taken for estimating the final pareto front using the proposed method for z1 vs z2 study was 3 85 by average less than the traditional method whereas it was less by 9 75 by average for z1 vs z2 study from the results of both the methods it was observed that the pre selection procedure performs well when the number of combinations is huge as in 20spp 129c5 129c20 and 396c5 396c20 but the deterioration in performance was only observed for the lower detection likelihood solutions which are generally omitted 3 3 comparison of sensor placement solutions based on detection likelihood cut off the expected time for detection for various percentages of detections is described in table 5 for bwsn 5spp detection the maximum z1 value from traditional method was 84 01 and 84 78 for traditional method and proposed method respectively and for 20 sensors it was 89 21 and 89 95 on the other hand the detection time at the maximum z1 values were lower in proposed method but in order to provide a viable comparison z2 and z3 are compared at values at four fixed values of z1 starting at a minimum level of detecting 50 of the events and then increasing in the order of 10 it was observed that there is no significant difference in the traditional and proposed method for 5 spp while for 20 spp the expected time of detection reduces by 2 8 6 94 and 1 8 for 60 70 and 80 detections respectively the affected population metric was higher in the proposed method for 5 sensor design while it was lower for 20 sensor design at 60 70 and 80 detection likelihood the lowest z1 value pareto point for 20spp was 58 in proposed method and thus at cut off of 50 the corresponding affected population was 18 higher as shown in fig 10 the sensor locations for 70 detection for z1 vs z3 study for 5spp have 3 locations in common and one node in each solution had zero base demand while 12 sensor locations were similar for 20 spp with 5 and 7 zero demand nodes for traditional and proposed solutions respectively the sensor locations of 5 spp are not repeated in 20 spp which indicates that solutions of a smaller number of sensors cannot be replicated for a larger number of sensors and for each sensor design optimization is required to estimate the best location similarly z2 and z3 are compared at z1 values of 40 50 60 and 65 this range of z1 was fixed owing to the maximum z1 value of 53 and 71 observed for placing 5 and 20 sensors the expected time for detection for both 5 spp and 20 spp from the proposed method is comparable to values observed in the traditional method table 6 all the objective values obtained from the proposed method for objectives z2 and z3 except at z3 at 50 detection likelihood where it is almost equal are lower than the traditional method the sensor nodes at 50 detections is displayed in fig 11 where 3 out 5 sensor locations are at the same nodes for 5 sensors fig 11a and in the case of 20 sensors only 6 nodes are common in solutions provided by both methods fig 11b the sensor nodes from the proposed method are evenly distributed in the wdn such that the nodes are placed at the farthest ends to obtain maximum detections the set of nodes obtained from the proposed fig 11 are also present in the decision space of the traditional method but due to the combinatorial nature of the problem that particular solution was not obtained in the traditional method during the optimization process the focused optimal sub space developed in this study made it easy for the optimizer to determine a better combination of significant nodes as observed in the results of proposed method the repeatability of the pre selection strategy was tested out by running the selection module 100 times and estimating the percentage of the nodes from the final non dominating pareto fronts selected in all the 100 runs on average 80 of the nodes from pareto fronts were selected in all the runs while 90 5 of nodes were selected in at least 85 of runs appendix a 7 the average time for finding the optimal subset for bwsn was 3 01 secs and for c town network 156 57 secs 4 conclusion this study developed a strategy for the pre selection of nodes to reduce the decision variable space for optimal sensor placement in a wdn the network was split into clusters based on a novel heuristics based approach that incorporates the nodal disparity in detecting a set of contamination events the selection procedure was two phased first a set of nodes are selected based on their ability to detect events followed by selecting another set of nodes that improvised the detection time or affected population in combination with the previously selected nodes the proposed algorithm was tested on bwsn network1 and c town network and compared based on the quality of pareto front produced after moo to optimize detection likelihood and expected time of detection or expected affected population the search space was successfully reduced by 45 and 34 for the bwsn and c town network respectively and the pareto front obtained from the optimal subset of nodes was better in terms of cr indicator than the complete set of nodes the time taken for generating the final pareto front was better than the traditional method in 6 of 8 moo studies carried out in the study these cases are bwsn network 5spp and 20 spp for both z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study and c town network 5spp and 20 spp for z1 vs z3 study the proposed method is robust and can be applied to any network irrespective of its complexity different design of contamination events and different objectives with appropriate modifications the only prerequisites required are the pollution matrices corresponding to the objectives considered for placing sensors further the selection strategy also guarantees that a major set of significant nodes i e 70 are always selected thus it can be integrated with the decision support system to monitor and maintain larger wdn in future studies the effect of modification and or improvisation in optimization algorithm specifically to mospp by methods like the inclusion of initial guesses tweaking of optimization parameters etc will be analysed to enhance the quality of pareto fronts funding this work is funded by dst and eu through the lotus project no dst imrcd india eu lotus 208 g and eu grant

15878,monitoring of water distribution network wdn requires placement of sensors at strategic locations to detect maximum contamination events at the earliest the multi objective optimization moo of sensor placement is a complicated problem owing to its combinatorial nature interconnected and large wdn sizes and temporal flows producing complex outcomes for a given set of contamination events in this study a new method is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by condensing the nodal search space this method first segregates the nodes based on intrusion events detected using k means clustering followed by selecting nodes from each group based on the improvement observed in the objectives namely contamination event detection expected detection time and affected population the selected nodes formed the decision variable space for the moo study the developed strategy was tested on two benchmark networks bwsn network1 and c town network and its performance is compared with the traditional method in terms of hypervolume contribution rate cr indicator and the number of pareto points the optimal subset of nodes generated twice the number of pareto points than the complete set of nodes set for placing 20 sensors and had 10 more than cr indicator than the traditional method for the placement of 5 sensors the proposed solutions were better at the higher detection likelihood values which is required to achieve maximum detection the proposed sensor placement algorithm can be easily scaled to large wdns it is expected to provide a better optimal sensor placement solution irrespective of network size as compared to the traditional approach graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sensor placement water distribution network multiobjective optimization optimal sensor placement bwsn c town 1 introduction the advancements in sensors for water quality measurements have enabled water supply assurance and steadily shifted the focus towards monitoring and maintaining the quality of supplied water in water distribution networks wdn storey et al 2010 monitoring of wdns has been widely researched with the application of sensors in the network concentrating on collecting crucial supply data to facilitate swift mitigation procedures creaco et al 2019 nurani et al 2018 the placement of the sensors at niche locations is essential due to budgetary constraints thus allowing only a limited number of sensors to be placed in a vast network zeng et al 2018 this led to research in various sensor placement strategies aimed at monitoring of wdns with a limited number of sensors the main issue for placing sensors in a wdn arises in selecting the best solution from a vast number of feasible solutions available to utility managers the efficiency of the best solution has to be assessed and compared with other available solutions and this efficiency can be estimated based on the required goals or objectives for placing the sensors though the sensor placement problem spp can be constructed as an optimization problem finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive when deterministic methods are employed while stochastic approaches result in sub optimal solutions hu et al 2020 xu et al 2013 the intricacies of optimizing the sensor placement in a wdn are further explained in the following paragraphs the main components of the sensor placement problem that have been extensively researched are objectives optimization algorithm and decision variables with the network flow configuration and nodal demands of a wdn two crucial information can be estimated flow and contaminant concentration at any node and the time taken for the contaminant to travel in the network based on this data the battle of water sensor networks bwsn hart et al 2007 design challenge was conducted to compare various approaches to solving spp for wdns the problem was formulated with four objectives minimization of expected detection time minimization of the expected population affected minimization of expected amount of contaminated consumed and maximization of detection likelihood the study revealed that the first three objectives affected population contaminated water consumed and detection time conflicted with detection likelihood since then many researchers have discussed the multi objective optimization of spp mospp for wdn focusing on detecting events and either of the other three objectives hu et al 2018 the effect of contamination in wdn can be captured in pollution matrices and it can be developed by simulating a series of contamination scenarios in epanet 2 0 https www epa gov water research epanet rossman 2000 and recording the response from the network compactly in a matrix the pollution matrices have number of rows equal to the number of nodes in the network and columns equal to the number of contamination events that are simulated each value represents the information like contamination detection time taken for detection if contamination detected etc by the corresponding node row for the corresponding event column so each row provides values for the estimation of objective function if a sensor is placed at the corresponding node thus by adopting similar procedure for all the nodes rows the values required for estimation of the objective function for each node or set of nodes can be stored and estimated efficiently this step will reduce computation cost as during optimization pollution matrix is utilized to estimate the objective function rather than simulating all the contamination events for estimating the objective function for each sensor solution the information recorded in the pollution matrices depicted contamination presence time of detection water consumed before detection or the number of persons affected before detection etc chastain 2006 hart et al 2007 various optimization algorithms have been implemented to solve the spp and mospp such as genetic algorithm ga and its variants eliades and polycarpou 2006 hu et al 2020 preis and ostfeld 2007 greedy randomized adaptive search procedures grasp techniques berry et al 2006 krause et al 2008 heuristics aral et al 2010 guan et al 2006 particle swarm optimization pso hu et al 2015 marlim and kang 2021 and constrained mixed integer programming mip formulations berry et al 2008 also the teva spot software tool was developed by the u s epa to evaluate the contamination risks and design sensor monitoring stations for wdn teva spot allows the users to choose an objective among the following a number of failed detections b time of detection c estimated population exposed d estimation population contaminated e extent of contamination f mass of contaminated water consumed g length of pipe contaminated and h volume of water contaminated the objectives c d f and h are correlated with the time of detection while objectives e and g are correlated with objective a it can be seen that minimization of objective a is complementary to the maximization of objective number percentage of successful detections which is analogous to the detection likelihood objective considered in this study however teva spot carries out single objective optimization of the above mentioned objectives and the conflicting objectives have to be provided as a constraint us environmental protection agency 2012 stochastic techniques generate near optimal solutions with low memory requirements and cpu time for both spp and mospp while the mip formulations consume huge memory to provide optimal solutions for spp and constrained mospp nevertheless irrespective of the methods applied for optimizing sensor locations the complexity of wdn due to vastness complex interflows and temporal demands have kept the search for optimal sensor locations still a significant challenge adedoja et al 2019 hu et al 2018 the third component represents the decision variables given by the set of nodes in the network the problem size depends on the number of nodes considered for placing sensors as large number of nodes translate into large number of node sensor pairs this makes the problem computationally and memory wise expensive the problem can be interpreted as a combinatorial problem of choosing a solution from nck combinations where n is the number of nodes and k is the number of sensors blockeel et al 2013 however if a few nodes are deemed non potential and only m such nodes are considered for sensor placement the number of combinations reduces to mck which is lesser than nck for instance if a network has 100 nodes but only 90 nodes are chosen for the placement of 5 sensors then the total number of combinations reduces by more than 41 this led to the following studies that focused on improving the nodal search space by contracting the wdn using graph trimming methods and topography based clustering designing contamination events based on heuristics and decreasing decision variable nodes search space considered for optimization klise et al klise et al 2013 pruned large wdn using graph trimming techniques followed by a two tiered optimization procedure the first step involved grouping similar nodes based on topography and flow pattern into super nodes and finding the optimal super nodes for placing sensors and then fine tuning the sensor locations using the original nodes grouped in the optimal super nodes xu et al clustered the wdn into k regions for placing k sensors and from each cluster one node was selected based on maximum connectivity with other nodes in the cluster xu et al 2008 this selection of single node from k clusters was improvised by greedily selecting k nodes with better overall connectivity within the wdn leading to better observability of the whole network di nardo et al 2018 the above methods oversimplified the spp by overseeing the effects of temporal demands reverse flows and contaminant transport velocity as their applicability was tested only on a small number of contamination events diao et al implemented controllability analysis on bwsn network1 to condense the decision variable search space by diao and rauch 2013 choosing nodes that facilitated maximum network observability in a given time frame but this prioritized the observability at the expense of swiftness in detections when a set of nodes are considered together for sensor placement in contrast khorshid el al khorshidi et al 2018 developed a node selection strategy based on value of information voi and transinformation entropy te techniques the nodes were compared pair wise in terms detection time and grouped according to the swiftness in detecting the given set of contamination events the results of the voi te method were compared with the results from teva spot tool which uses grasp heuristics but the comparison with the traditional multi objective optimization is required to assess the efficiency of the voi te method mandel et al defined quality zones within the wdn by clustering the nodes based on time varying concentration data mandel et al 2015 but the study has not been extended to sensor placement problem the quality zones were developed by tracing the water from the source nodes using epanet2 0 but in a wdn the contaminant intrusion can occur at any node moreover the simulations were carried out at steady state conditions which are generally not observed in real wdns thus there is a need for a pre selection procedure to reduce the nodal search space that encompasses the dynamic water quality simulations with a focus on the sensor placement objectives the observations or pollution matrices acquired from the contamination transport simulations provide the required data on the objectives detection of contaminant time of arrival of contaminated water and population affected at the nodes based on this data the nodes from the wdn can be clustered in terms of similarity in detecting events followed by selecting nodes from these clusters with better objective function values in this study a novel strategy is developed based on k means clustering and cluster wise greedy selection to reduce the nodal search space for multi objective sensor placement study this strategy is based on the transport of contaminant both nodal observation and transportation time in the wdn rather than just the connectivity the resulting subset of nodes will be used for multi objective optimization to generate multiple sensor design solutions with trade offs between objectives the multi objective optimization is carried out for two sets of conflicting objectives 1 maximizing detection likelihood vs minimizing detection time and 2 maximizing detection likelihood vs minimizing the affected population the pattern search algorithm custódio et al 2011 which is based on direct search methods for optimization is implemented for finding the pareto points the node selection strategy is tested on two benchmark networks bwsn network1 and c town network finally the pareto front generated using the optimal subset of nodes are compared with the traditional method of performing mospp 2 methodology the work carried out in this study consists of three sections as described in fig 1 firstly the effect of contamination in the wdn is analysed by simulating various contamination events the conditions of each event time node etc is provided by matlab to epanet2 0 where extended hydraulic and water quality simulation of each event is carried out the parameters of the network nodal concentration time of contamination observance are then fed back to matlab for developing the pollution matrices the second step is identifying a crucial set of nodes that provide higher detection likelihood and lower detection time the nodes are first clustered in the node clustering module followed by cluster wise selection of nodes for the objectives considered in the node selection module both the modules are developed in matlab the selected nodes are then used for multi objective optimization study of sensor placement in the third step the dotted lines represent the paths that will provide the decision search space for the multi objective optimization generally only the first and third steps are carried out to find the optimal pareto which suggests that all the nodes of wdn are potential locations for placing sensors in order to compare with the proposed strategy the traditional method of estimating the pareto is also carried out 2 1 contaminant transport simulation and pollution matrix the two benchmark networks considered as test cases for the developed node selection strategy bwsn network1 and c town network are shown in fig 2 the contamination scenario for bwsn network 1 was a subset of bwsn challenge case a hart et al 2007 with an intrusion at every half an hour interval at each node for two hours the contamination event is defined by the parameters injection flow rate 125 l h contaminant concentration 230 000 mg l and injection duration 2 h this translates to intrusion of 479167 mg min of contamination for two hours it is assumed that the ingested contaminant remains inert throughout the network and it is consumed only at the demand nodes while in c town a 15 min interval for each contamination event was set to capture the intricacies of contaminant flow within the network the number of sensors to be placed was fixed to 5 and 20 translating to 3 8 and 15 of nodes in bwsn network1 respectively and 1 2 and 5 of the c town network it is assumed that sensors have a sensitivity limit of 0 01 mg l and there is no lag between detecting a contaminant by the sensor transmitting of information to the utility manager table 1 describes the contamination events design for both the wdns the contamination event simulations were carried out in epanet2 0 integrated with matlab 2020b the results of the contamination events were recorded in three pollution matrices depicting the detection of the event time to detection and population affected the events detections matrix edm is binary in nature where 1 represented if the contamination was observed and 0 otherwise the time to detection pollution matrix tdm stored the time delay in contaminant observation since the onset of contamination for each node for all the intrusion events similarly the population affected matrix pam provides the details about the number of people affected until the contamination is observed 2 2 generation of optimal subset of nodes this section discusses the objectives for the sensor placement study and the objective function based node selection strategy 2 2 1 definition of objective functions the objectives evaluated for the mospp study are a detection likelihood b expected time of detection and c expected population affected prior to detection a the detection likelihood z1 is defined as the percentage of contamination events detected for a given design of sensors 1 z 1 100 n i 1 n d i i 1 2 3 n where i 1 2 3 n refers to the n contamination events simulated for the network and di 1 if the contamination event i was detected otherwise 0 b the time of detection for a particular contamination event i td is the minimum time to detect among all sensors j present in the design 2 t d i m i n t i j and the expected time of detection z2 is the expected value of td over n contaminations given by 3 z 2 e t d i c similarly the expected population affected prior to detection is the expected value of population affected pa computed over the assumed probability distribution of i contamination events 4 z 3 e p a i the estimation of pa i is explained in section a 1 the objectives are taken as is from bwsn challenge hart et al 2007 in the following paragraphs the expected time of detection will be referred to as detection time and expected population affected prior to detection as affected population for ease of discussion 2 2 2 generating optimal subset of nodes the ideal case for complete observation of the wdn is to place sensors at all the nodes in the network but it is not possible due to various constraints the following best case scenario is to design the sensor placement such that all the contamination events can be detected but a guarantee of 100 detection is inefficient if the time to detect is large or large population gets affected before detection it is necessary to assess the nodes based on swift detection of the contamination events the objectives for improving the detections and detection time or affected population are competing in nature that is placing sensors for better detections will deteriorate the detection time or affected population consider the simple example network with six nodes in a straight line as shown in fig 3 a the example is explained for the moo study of detection likelihood vs detection time but can also be easily extended to detection likelihood vs affected population for placing only one sensor in the network it can be observed that placing a sensor at node 5 can detect all the events but the expected detection time will be maximum for this sensor placement design on the other hand if the sensor is placed at the tank node the expected detection time will be minimum as the detection time is estimated based only on the detected events and only those events will be detected that occur at the tank due to the conflicting nature each objective requires different nodes for optimal value but at the cost of the other objective however if two sensors are to be placed in this simple network then the first sensor can be dedicated to maximizing the detection likelihood node 5 and the second sensor that results in minimum detection time in combination with node 5 can be selected note that the number of combinations for placing two sensors in nodes 6c2 15 is reduced to just 5 pairs comprised of node 5 and other nodes this methodology can be extended to real wdns by selecting all the nodes that improve the detections predominantly dead end nodes followed by selecting nodes that improve the detection time of previously selected nodes the selection procedure is two phased as nodes will be first selected based on event detections followed by detection time or affected population but real wdns are much more complex in design than the above network in fig 3 and this will lead to loss of important information when these nodes are considered for mospp in real wdns multiple sources in the form of reservoirs and overhead tanks are installed for reliable water supply the nodes that are connected to two sources might receive water from either of the sources or in the cases where the nodes are present in between reservoir and overhead tanks a change in water flow direction is observed whenever the source of water supply changes so it must be noted that these nodes and the nodes in the downstream will only be contaminated by the current source of water supply these issues of changing water flow direction can be overcome by segregating the network into different groups or clusters based on the similarity in events detected and selecting the nodes from the group in the following paragraphs the clustering and greedy selection procedure are further explained 2 2 2 1 k means clustering and node selection the nodes of the wdn were segregated into clusters using k means clustering based on the dissimilarity of events detected by the nodes rather than the time variant contamination concentration in k means clustering the data is clustered into k groups based on the distance metric between the k centroids and the observation data points lloyd 1982 the difference in the detection ability of the nodes is translated into the distance metric using the event detection matrix edm the edm is built of 0 s and 1 s and the hamming distance metric was used to estimate the distance between two nodal observations the hamming distance is calculated based on the xor operation and it estimates the number of bits that are different in each of the strings for example the distance between 101011 and 110011 is given by 101011 110011 011000 h a m m i n g d i s t a n c e 2 when this metric is applied to the detection matrix nodes with similar number of detections at the same bit locations events will be grouped into one in other words this calculates the dissimilarity between the nodes in detecting a given set of contamination events also if neither the nodes detect the contamination it does not affect the distance metric this clustering methodology prioritizes the transportation of contaminant to nodes during contamination events over connectivity or closeness of nodes which is norm considered in previous literature the number of clusters is estimated by performing clustering with a multiple number of clusters and then fixing it based on statistical measures mandel et al 2015 or they can be fixed based on the number of sensors to be placed xu et al 2008 the former procedure requires multiple k means clustering runs while in the latter only one node is chosen per cluster for sensor placement these procedures result in larger computation time and neglect of many potential locations respectively in this study a heuristics based approach is developed by assuming that all the nodes in the wdn are selected by choosing k nodes from k clusters for each objective considered for moo study for two objectives in mospp this results in the equation 5 2 k 2 n u m b e r o f n o d e s upon rearranging the above the number of clusters can be calculated as 6 k r o u n d n u m b e r o f n o d e s 2 the number of clusters was fixed by eq 6 and from each cluster the nodes were selected as discussed below 2 2 2 2 selection of nodes the node selection procedure is two phased and in each phase the nodes are selected for each of the objectives in mospp in the order of importance first the nodes are chosen for event detection followed by the second competing objective detection time z2 or affected population z3 the selection procedure relies on the pollution matrices for assessing the importance of the nodes in the first phase nodes are selected from each cluster in the clustering module focusing on z1 the nodes belonging to each cluster are stored in sets gi where i 1 2 k represents cluster i from each gi set nodes are selected in the order of maximum number of events detected z1 using the event detection matrix and stored in set ng i the node selection for a cluster is terminated when no further improvements in z1 is observed in the example network fig 3 node 2 from cluster 1 will have the maximum z1 value and no other nodes in the cluster can improve z1 value similarly only node 5 from cluster 2 will be selected thus for a given wdn ng i i 1 2 k are generated that comprise the nodes selected from sets gi i 1 2 k respectively the nodes with higher sensitivity to detection likelihood z1 is given by the union of the sets ng i denoted as p dl i 1 k n g i in the second phase the nodes are selected based on the improvement observed in detection time the nodes are selected from each set gi and their union will be defined as nodes with higher sensitivity to detection time firstly sets tg i are defined for each set gi and the nodes in pdl are added to each of the tg i sets inclusion of set pdl in the set tg i before selecting nodes ensures that all the contamination events are detected and the selected node will improve the overall detection time the detection times corresponding to the nodes were estimated using the time to detect matrix tdm then from each set gi nodes are appended one by one to set tg i that results in the lowest value z2 the nodes are appended till no further decrease in the detection time is observed or a maximum of k nodes are selected the nodes in a wdn will provide the lowest detection time when they are the source of contamination and a sensor is placed at them however the trade off in improving z2 for each new node selected is very low when the number of nodes in set tg i is large thus to control the number of selected nodes the second terminating criteria mandates choosing of a maximum of only k nodes from each group the set of nodes selected based on detection time is given by the union of set tg i as p dt i 1 k t g i this is the optimal subset of nodes considered for moo of z1 vs z2 note that the nodes for improving detection likelihood have already been added to sets tg i and thus do not require to be added separately during the implementation of the above selection procedure the nodes that were already part of ng i pdl and tg i were removed from sets gi to avoid repeated computations of already selected nodes the cluster wise greedy selection of nodes results in choosing nodes with lower detection time which are generally located in the upstream of the cluster as well as nodes with maximum observability which are generally located in the downstream of the cluster thus the combination of k means clustering and greedy selection results in set of selected nodes that are targeted towards both objectives in contrast the previous studies only focused on the network connectivity closeness to other nodes for trimming the network or just maximum observability at the expense of detection time the flowchart for node selection procedure is shown in fig 4 an example of network clustering and node selection procedure is illustrated in appendix a 2 2 3 multi objective optimization moo and contribution rate indicator the pattern search algorithm from matlab2020b was implemented to find the pareto front this algorithm uses a derivative free methodology by extending direct search methods to multi objective problems custódio et al 2011 in the node selection procedure the objective functions would be evaluated for selecting nodes therefore to provide a fair comparison the number of objective function calls made during the selection procedure is reduced from the maximum number of function counts for the proposed method pareto fronts of the traditional and proposed methods were compared in terms of contribution rate cr indicator based on hypervolume developed by cao et al 2015 the pareto fronts pfi to be compared are first compiled to generate a surrogate true pareto front pfs then the contribution from each of the pfi s in pfs is estimated using hypervolume hypervolume measures the size of the space enclosed by all points on the pareto front and a user defined reference point and it is indicated as ih pf r for a given pareto front pf and a reference point r after the evaluation of the reference point estimated based on cao et al 2015 cr indicator of pareto fronts from each method was calculated the contribution rate cr associated with each of the pareto front are estimated as 7 c r i i h p f i r i h p f s r where pfi is the set of non dominating points of pareto front i present in the surrogate true pareto pfs r refers to the reference point and ih refers to hypervolume the procedure for estimation is explained in appendix a 3 the value of cri close to 1 means that pfi is closest to replicating the surrogate true pareto front compared to other pfs a higher cr indicator translates into higher hypervolume dominance 3 results and discussion 3 1 bwsn network1 the contamination event simulations for bwsn network1 yielded three pollution matrices of dimensions 129 6192 as 48 events per node were simulated for each of the 129 nodes it was observed that 622 events remained undetected due to zero flow conditions at the nodes during contaminant intrusion the nodes of bwsn network1 were clustered into 8 groups based on eq 6 and 21 nodes were selected based on edm 51 based on tdm and 48 based on the pam most of the dead ends have been selected except junction 13 and junction 36 due to zero flow ensuring that all the observable events will be detected the 8 clusters with the average number of detections are depicted in fig 5 a the average number of detections for clusters ranged from 203 4 3 6 of observable events at the network entrance nodes and low flow nodes to 2893 0 51 94 of observable events at the downstream nodes the 72 nodes selected for detection likelihood vs detection time and 69 nodes selected for detection likelihood vs affected population are shown in fig 5b and c respectively the first cluster had the lowest mean detections and consisted of junctions 1 7 38 109 124 128 and reservoir node 129 junction 1 7 38 and 124 were selected during first phase of selection leaving junctions 109 128 and 129 as no improvement in detections were observed on appending these nodes in the second phase of selection all three nodes improved detection time and were thus added to the optimal subset of nodes whereas only junction 109 was selected for the affected population it must be noted that all three nodes have zero base demand but as the algorithm chooses at least one node from each group the node at downstream was selected out of 48 nodes selected for the affected population 13 had zero base demands these nodes were selected either due to their position between two nodes with non zero base demands like junction 91 or due to condition that makes the algorithm select at least one node from each cluster as observed for junction 109 it can be observed that five nodes in cluster 2 are disjointed from cluster 2 and are separated by cluster 6 this is because though the disjointed nodes are located closer to and at the downstream of cluster 6 the events detected by these nodes are more similar to the events detected by nodes of cluster 6 this is verified by the average number of events detected by the disjointed nodes 1181 8 which is closer to average number of events detected of cluster 2 1081 02 than cluster 6 1796 28 the matching rate is defined as the percentage of nodes from bwsn results appearing in the pre selected nodes and it is provided in table 2 the sensor locations nodes in bwsn challenge were given by 14 different research groups using different methods to optimize these locations the efficiency of the proposed method is tested by comparing the optimal subset of nodes with the possible sensor nodes provided in bwsn the matching rate of the bwsn 5 spp solution nodes with the optimal subset of nodes set osn was 78 8 and 75 6 for z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study respectively while only 26 9 matching rate was observed in the controllability analysis method set cas described in diao and rauch 2013 for bwsn 20 spp 64 71 and 67 06 of the bwsn solution nodes matched with set osn compared to 57 4 for set cas the lower matching rate of set cas might be due to excluding the cumulative effect of selected nodes in improvising the detection time meanwhile the proposed methodology weighs the nodes in terms of their individual significance in detecting events and reducing detection time or exposed population the nodes of set osn and bwsn results are enumerated in appendix a 4 the percentage of events detected with respect to mean detection time for set osn and set cas diao and rauch 2013 are shown in fig 6 about 66 16 of events were detected by osn while cas detected only 41 36 within 5 min of contamination also the set cas observed a maximum of 94 5 of events while osn observed 100 of the events this shows that the selected nodes have quicker reaction time to the contamination events than dn nodes for comparison purposes the sensor solutions from bwsn 5 sensor set b5 and bwsn 20 sensor set b20 were also plotted fig 6 the order of improvement of event detection percentage with respect to detection time was b5 cas osn and finally b20 sets the set osn was swift in detecting events than the set b5 and set cas but lagged behind set b20 it must be noted that only the combination of nodes from set osn is required for placing the sensor and thus multi objective optimization was carried out to verify the efficiency of selected nodes the parameters for multi objective optimization study were number of runs 30 maximum function count 50000 bounds 1 number of nodes tolerance 1 10 6 final pareto front compiled non dominating set of all 30 runs the paretosearch tool of matlab2020b that incorporates pattern search technique was used for generating pareto fronts the legend traditional refers to the generic method where all the nodes in wdn are deemed as plausible sensor locations while the legend proposed refers to the method developed in this study where only the optimal subset of nodes osn are considered for placing sensors fig 7 represents the process to estimate the surrogate true pareto front for placing 20 sensors for objectives z1 and z2 fig 7a depicts the complete set of pareto points obtained from 30 runs of the optimization a clear separation of the pareto points between traditional and proposed procedures was observed with the latter dominating the former in the range 50 to 90 detection likelihood this effect is reiterated when compiled pareto points from 30 runs are compared in fig 7b based on these pareto fronts the surrogate true pareto front and reference point were obtained and depicted in fig 7 c the surrogate true pareto fronts with the reference points for 5 and 20 sensors placement for objectives z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study are shown in fig 8 an overview of pareto points for z1 vs z2 study revealed that the osn performs better than the complete set whereas in z1 vs z3 study for placing 5 sensors the optimal subset generated fewer pareto points than traditional method and most of these pareto points had higher detection likelihood values this could be due to the exclusion of nodes with very low base demand that were not selected and when these combined with zero demand nodes with higher detection ability it resulted in a low number of people affected at higher z1 value this trend was again pronounced in 20 sensor results shown in fig 8 d where all the pareto points at z1 65 were obtained from the traditional method and at z1 75 were from the proposed method the comparisons of both methods in terms of cr indicator is shown in table 3 the cr indicator of both methods for 5spp was same in z1 vs z2 study indicating that both procedures dominate a significant portion of hypervolume at the same level whereas in z1 vs z3 study the traditional method was higher by 4 16 the cr indicator for 20 spp was 190 and 22 7 more than the traditional method in z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study respectively this indicated that the optimal subset provided better pareto points in terms of hypervolume dominance since the solutions with lower detection likelihood cannot be considered for placing sensors a cut off criterion was maintained to assess the number of pareto points contributed by both methods only those solutions whose z1 value was more than 50 of maximum observed events 50 of max z1 were considered as potential solutions the number of these pareto points observed for 5 sensors were higher for the traditional method while for 20 sensors proposed method provided a higher number of solutions the time taken for estimating the final pareto front using the proposed method for 5spp was 25 by average less than the traditional method while it was less by only 0 7 by average for 20spp both traditional and proposed methods generated better pareto points in comparison to bwsn results only 4 pareto points from bwsn were coinciding with pareto fronts obtained in this study illustrated in appendix a 5 3 2 c town network the pollution matrices for the c town network had 38016 contamination events for 396 nodes yielding a pollution matrix of dimension 396 38016 three nodes in the network did not detect any event and their respective contamination events were undetected due to zero flow the c town network was segregated into 14 groups and 263 nodes were selected for z1 vs z2 study and 261 nodes were selected for z1 vs z3 study illustrated in a4 7 the surrogate true pareto front and reference point for cr indicator estimation for c town network is displayed in fig 9 for 5spp comparable pareto points are generated by both the methods for both the mospp studies in the case of z1 vs z3 the proposed methodology generated better pareto points for higher detection likelihood similar to the results observed for bwsn network1 but for 20spp most of the pareto points in pfs were generated from the proposed method these observations have been reflected in the cr value of the corresponding problem provided in table 4 the set osn yielded 96 6 and 74 6 of pareto points in pfs for z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 respectively for 20spp the time taken for estimating the final pareto front using the proposed method for z1 vs z2 study was 3 85 by average less than the traditional method whereas it was less by 9 75 by average for z1 vs z2 study from the results of both the methods it was observed that the pre selection procedure performs well when the number of combinations is huge as in 20spp 129c5 129c20 and 396c5 396c20 but the deterioration in performance was only observed for the lower detection likelihood solutions which are generally omitted 3 3 comparison of sensor placement solutions based on detection likelihood cut off the expected time for detection for various percentages of detections is described in table 5 for bwsn 5spp detection the maximum z1 value from traditional method was 84 01 and 84 78 for traditional method and proposed method respectively and for 20 sensors it was 89 21 and 89 95 on the other hand the detection time at the maximum z1 values were lower in proposed method but in order to provide a viable comparison z2 and z3 are compared at values at four fixed values of z1 starting at a minimum level of detecting 50 of the events and then increasing in the order of 10 it was observed that there is no significant difference in the traditional and proposed method for 5 spp while for 20 spp the expected time of detection reduces by 2 8 6 94 and 1 8 for 60 70 and 80 detections respectively the affected population metric was higher in the proposed method for 5 sensor design while it was lower for 20 sensor design at 60 70 and 80 detection likelihood the lowest z1 value pareto point for 20spp was 58 in proposed method and thus at cut off of 50 the corresponding affected population was 18 higher as shown in fig 10 the sensor locations for 70 detection for z1 vs z3 study for 5spp have 3 locations in common and one node in each solution had zero base demand while 12 sensor locations were similar for 20 spp with 5 and 7 zero demand nodes for traditional and proposed solutions respectively the sensor locations of 5 spp are not repeated in 20 spp which indicates that solutions of a smaller number of sensors cannot be replicated for a larger number of sensors and for each sensor design optimization is required to estimate the best location similarly z2 and z3 are compared at z1 values of 40 50 60 and 65 this range of z1 was fixed owing to the maximum z1 value of 53 and 71 observed for placing 5 and 20 sensors the expected time for detection for both 5 spp and 20 spp from the proposed method is comparable to values observed in the traditional method table 6 all the objective values obtained from the proposed method for objectives z2 and z3 except at z3 at 50 detection likelihood where it is almost equal are lower than the traditional method the sensor nodes at 50 detections is displayed in fig 11 where 3 out 5 sensor locations are at the same nodes for 5 sensors fig 11a and in the case of 20 sensors only 6 nodes are common in solutions provided by both methods fig 11b the sensor nodes from the proposed method are evenly distributed in the wdn such that the nodes are placed at the farthest ends to obtain maximum detections the set of nodes obtained from the proposed fig 11 are also present in the decision space of the traditional method but due to the combinatorial nature of the problem that particular solution was not obtained in the traditional method during the optimization process the focused optimal sub space developed in this study made it easy for the optimizer to determine a better combination of significant nodes as observed in the results of proposed method the repeatability of the pre selection strategy was tested out by running the selection module 100 times and estimating the percentage of the nodes from the final non dominating pareto fronts selected in all the 100 runs on average 80 of the nodes from pareto fronts were selected in all the runs while 90 5 of nodes were selected in at least 85 of runs appendix a 7 the average time for finding the optimal subset for bwsn was 3 01 secs and for c town network 156 57 secs 4 conclusion this study developed a strategy for the pre selection of nodes to reduce the decision variable space for optimal sensor placement in a wdn the network was split into clusters based on a novel heuristics based approach that incorporates the nodal disparity in detecting a set of contamination events the selection procedure was two phased first a set of nodes are selected based on their ability to detect events followed by selecting another set of nodes that improvised the detection time or affected population in combination with the previously selected nodes the proposed algorithm was tested on bwsn network1 and c town network and compared based on the quality of pareto front produced after moo to optimize detection likelihood and expected time of detection or expected affected population the search space was successfully reduced by 45 and 34 for the bwsn and c town network respectively and the pareto front obtained from the optimal subset of nodes was better in terms of cr indicator than the complete set of nodes the time taken for generating the final pareto front was better than the traditional method in 6 of 8 moo studies carried out in the study these cases are bwsn network 5spp and 20 spp for both z1 vs z2 and z1 vs z3 study and c town network 5spp and 20 spp for z1 vs z3 study the proposed method is robust and can be applied to any network irrespective of its complexity different design of contamination events and different objectives with appropriate modifications the only prerequisites required are the pollution matrices corresponding to the objectives considered for placing sensors further the selection strategy also guarantees that a major set of significant nodes i e 70 are always selected thus it can be integrated with the decision support system to monitor and maintain larger wdn in future studies the effect of modification and or improvisation in optimization algorithm specifically to mospp by methods like the inclusion of initial guesses tweaking of optimization parameters etc will be analysed to enhance the quality of pareto fronts funding this work is funded by dst and eu through the lotus project no dst imrcd india eu lotus 208 g and eu grant

was controlled at 1 3 and 2 0 simultaneous thickening and fermentation intensification were achieved compared with the control the ic despite the shorter hrts achieved 29 5 to 90 2 increase in the vfa yield 79 to 116 mg δvfa g vss vs 61 mg δvfa g vss and 16 2 to 56 4 increase 280 to 377 mg δscod g vss vs 241 mg δscod g vss in the hydrolysis yield fermentate from the ic exhibited comparable specific denitrification rates to acetate further the solids free condensate contained low nutrient concentrations and thus was far superior to a typical centrates from dewatering as a carbon source no adverse effects of vacuum on the activity of fermentative bacteria and methanogens were observed this study demonstrated that the ic can be deployed as an intensification technology for both fermentation and anaerobic digestion of biosolids with the additional significant advantage i e elimination of sidestream ammonia treatment requirements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic fermentation vacuum fermentation advanced biosolid treatment evaporation 1 introduction conventional anaerobic digestion cad is a well established technology that has been adopted especially in large water resource recovery facilities wrrf for biosolids minimization and energy recovery silvestre et al 2015 cad of municipal biosolids is usually performed at mesophilic 30 40 c or thermophilic 50 55 c conditions despite the benefits of cad at wrrfs its use is currently limited to application at large facilities 10 million gallons per day mgd due to low volatile solids vs degradation rates that result in large cad reactors with high capital costs compared to anaerobic digestion fermentation is a process that occurs at much shorter srts typically not exceeding 5 8 days ahn and speece 2006 zhou et al 2018 this process is gaining increased attention due to its ability to upgrade slowly biodegradable carbon to readily biodegradable carbon a beneficial outcome for carbon limited wrrfs employing biological nutrient removal bnr hydrolysis of particulates is the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion pratt et al 2012 volatile fatty acid vfa and hydrolysis yields vary substantially depending on the feedstock operational conditions and pretreatment techniques sánchez rubal et al 2012 yuan et al 2009 ahn and speece 2006 sánchez rubal et al 2012 observed a hydrolysis yield of 0 15 to 0 17 g scod g vss during primary sludge ps fermentation at 1 day srt and 30 c and 0 15 to 0 25 g scod g vss at 3 day srt similarly yuan et al 2009 observed a hydrolysis yield of 0 04 to 0 1 g scod g vss at room temperature 20 to 22 c fermentation of waste activated sludge was at 5 day srt ahn and speece 2006 reported a vfa yield of 180 mg cod g vs for thermophilic 55 c fermentation of primary sludge at ph 9 0 using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor this result is comparable to the vfa yield of 155 mg cod g vs for cellulosic primary sludge fermented at 55 c and ph 10 0 crutchik et al 2018 in a similar study using mixed primary sludge and waste activated sludge was vfa yields of 207 and 316 mg cod g vs were reported for mesophilic fermentation at uncontrolled ph 5 3 6 5 and ph 10 0 respectively longo et al 2015 in terms of vfa composition a mixture of acetic and propionic acids provides better performance than either pure acid for enhanced biological phosphorus removal li et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 several intensification strategies have been proposed and investigated to enhance fermentation and anaerobic digestion mcleod et al 2019 these strategies are typically applied outside anaerobic digesters like in sludge pretreatment e g thermal hydrolysis or post treatment e g recuperative thickening thermal hydrolysis a well established biosolids pretreatment technology has been most widely applied upstream of mesophilic cad for process intensification since the late 2000s in this process biosolids are subjected to high temperatures 100 c for a specified period 30 to 60 min pilli et al 2015 thermal hydrolysis increases solubilization of extracellular carbohydrate lipids etc and intracellular compounds proteins which increases the rate of cad and facilitates higher biogas production zhang et al 2019 key benefits of this pretreatment include enhanced biodegradability faster kinetics lower viscosity improved dewaterability and better quality of biosolids in terms of odor and pathogens kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 recuperative thickening which involves solids separation and recirculation into the digester has been used to increase reactor capacity by allowing higher organic loading rates without compromising biogas production and organics destruction li et al 2020 vanyushina et al 2012 recuperative thickening has been implemented using various solids separation and thickening techniques including anoxic gas flotation belt filter press thickening rotary drum thickeners and centrifuges cobbledick et al 2016 at an hrt of 9 days and srt of 19 days if of 2 1 a pilot scale anoxic gas flotation digester treating primary sludge and waste activated sludge was showed better vs destruction 64 compared to a cad process 59 burke 2000 the aforementioned study also reported a 50 lower polymer usage for dewatering and a 20 increase in dewatered cake solids two studies conducted in australian wrrfs using rotary drum thickeners showed that digester capacity could be increased by up to 26 with less than 20 reduction in specific methanogenic activity batstone et al 2015 ireland 2011 moreover bharambe et al 2015 reported that recuperative thickening using rotary drum thickeners resulted in a 20 increase in biogas production a 22 reduction in biosolids production and an 80 reduction in hydrogen sulfide release due to reduced activity of sulfate reducing bacteria recuperative thickening using a belt filter has also been combined with thermal hydrolysis to reduce digester hrt to 7 5 days while maintaining srt at 15 days compared to the control reactor with an srt of 15 days no negative impact or significant improvement on anaerobic digestion was observed in volatile solids reduction and methane production li et al 2020 vanyushina et al 2012 vacuum evaporation has been used for sludge dewatering at temperatures between 50 and 90 c and vacuum pressures 70 to 270 mbar yan et al 2009 as well as ammonia and volatiles recovery nguyen et al 2011 and hydrogen sonnleitner et al 2012 from yeast fermentation using vacuum thermal stripping vacuum application for biosolids treatment has only been considered in laboratory studies abbassi 2003 tested anaerobic digestion of was pretreated at 20 mbar for 30 min and observed increased biogas production by almost 97 compared to untreated was 335 vs 170 l kg was increased biogas production was attributed to vacuum enhanced cell disintegration and solubilization resulting in increased scod concentrations from 150 to 300 mg l zhang et al 2017 applied vacuum pretreatment at 133 mbar for 4 h to liquid swine manure to reduce free ammonia for thermophilic anaerobic digestion the aforementioned authors reported a 52 increase in methanogenesis and a 40 improvement in hydrolysis relative to the untreated sample only a few batch studies have discussed the impact of vacuum on hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogens gnida 2020 rajhi et al 2016 verseux 2020 kral et al 2011 long term effects on microbial communities remain largely unexplored kral et al 2011 investigated the impact of vacuum on different methanogens cultivated on mars soil simulant the authors reported that methanogens survived for 10 days under 400 mbar at 35 c but displayed minimal activity when pressure reached 50 mbar indicating that higher vacuum lower absolute pressure exerted more stress on methanogens rajhi et al 2016 studied the impact of vacuum on biohydrogen production using synthetic substrates such as glucose sucrose meat extract olive oil and municipal wastewater the inoculum was anaerobic granular sludge collected from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor treating brewery wastewater mahou guadalajara spain batches were run at 30 c ph of 7 with and without continuous vacuum for 30 days the authors reported that vacuum enhanced diversity of fermentative bacteria such as clostridium and promoted the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens over hydrogenotrophic bacteria the resulting microbial community improved hydrogen yield acetate consumption and cod removal efficiency the ic is a novel technology fig 1 that allows complete decoupling of hrt from srt via vacuum evaporation leading to a compact process that could be deployed at a broader range of facilities including small municipalities 10 mgd additionally the ability to selectively direct nutrients into liquid or particulate phases of the fermentate or condensate using ph and oxidation reduction potential controls can facilitate separation and recovery of resources such as ammonia phosphorus and vfas while simultaneously enhancing sludge thickening despite the potential advantages of the ic scientific and technological unknowns warrant further investigation of the ic including the impact of vacuum on microbial communities as well as vfa production and recovery the objectives of this study were to experimentally assess 1 the performance of ic operated as a fermenter with respect to acidification and hydrolysis yields under vacuum 2 the impact of vacuum on fermentative and methanogenic communities and the overall microbial ecology 3 fermentate quality as a supplemental carbon source for denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 the intensicarbtm process the ic is a patent pending treatment system jointly developed by usp technologies brown and caldwell and western university enabling vacuum enhanced biochemical fermentation and simultaneous thickening of municipal biosolids through vacuum evaporation at temperatures between 20 and 60 c this process combines thickening hydrolysis acidification gas stripping and dewatering in a single reactor biochemical and physicochemical treatment processes are simultaneously intensified through the nearly ideal solid liquid separation moreover depending on ph nitrogen can be either retained in the fermentate under acidic conditions ph 6 or directed to the condensate under alkaline conditions ph 8 the strong bubbling regime promoted by vacuum boiling intensifies mass transfer among the gas liquid and solid phases removing volatiles by vacuum evaporation also allows the complete retention of non volatile soluble fractions including nutrients such as ammonia and phosphates of fermented biosolids ancillary units for heat recovery are integrated with the vacuum evaporation chamber to recycle latent heat of evaporation back into the process a complete ic is comprised of a heat exchanger to pre heat the feed stock using recovered heat from the fermented sludge a main reactor vessel operating under vacuum which can perform both fermentation and thickening a vacuum pump to extract vapor produced during evaporation and a second heat exchanger to recover latent heat of evaporation to heat the reactor fig 1 based on the vacuum evaporation technology type and heat recovery features evaporation can be achieved with electrical power demands ranging from 50 to 150 kwh m3 of treated sludge in this study a bench scale ic with an operating volume of 3 l was placed on a plate induction heater and connected to a vacuum pump to establish the target vacuum pressure and temperature in parallel a control fermenter with an operating volume of 2 l was operated at the same srt of the ic process in both reactors temperature was maintained at 40 45 c table 1 presents the operating conditions and the experimental design for this study it should be noted that the absolute pressure of 110 mbar used in the ic is the boiling pressure of water at 45 c all systems were operated until pseudo steady state conditions were reached detailed characterization of the sludges used as feedstock is summarized in table s1 supplementary information both fermenters table 1 were fed with 50 50 on a volumetric basis of primary and thickened waste activated sludge twas from greenway wastewater treatment plant london on when required dilution with distilled water was provided to maintain influent total solids concentration of 2 2 5 throughout the study between vacuum extractions both the control and the ic

external lab using the astm d2908 91 test method 2 2 specific denitrification rate tests a series of batch denitrification tests were conducted following the protocols of kampas et al 2009 to assess the quality of the fermentates as a carbon source for biological nutrient removal soluble cod to nitrate ratios were maintained at a minimum of 8 10 to avoid carbon limitations during the test batch reactors containing mixed liquor suspended solids mlss controls were spiked with nitrate as a control to check for background denitrifying activity similarly reactors containing fermentate were spiked with nitrate fermentate controls to check whether the fermentate included viable denitrifiers to be accounted for in biomass specific denitrification rates sdnr calculations acetate was tested in parallel as a standard carbon source 2 3 microbial ecology analysis triplicate feed and fermentate samples obtained from the ic reactor operated at if 2 0 srt of 3d and hrt of 1 5d were submitted to

systems ibis at laval university quebec qc canada 1 ml of the feed sludge samples s1 s3 dilution factor 1 and 0 1 ml of the fermentate samples f1 f3 dilution factor 10 were collected over three

miseq at the genomic analysis platform institut de biologie intégrative et des systèmes ibis of université laval quebec canada the quality and quantity of the extracted genomic dna samples were determined spectrophotometrically with absorbance measurements at 260 and 280 nm using an a260 a280 ratio qpcr was used to detect total archaea bacteria with primers eub338 eub518 fierer et al 2005 archaebacterial and bacterial diversity were evaluated using metagenomic analyses the chao1 index chao 1987 was used to estimate species richness as it allows for better evaluation of rare species in this study the number of observed amplicon sequence variant asv was directly compared with chao1 with respect to α diversity additionally the shannon index shannon 1948 was used to account for asv richness and evenness where a larger shannon index relates to greater abundance in the ecosystem the three indices chao1 shannon and asv number were calculated on a standardized basis of 16 000 sequences per sample to evaluate the total microbial diversity richness of species in the reactors the structure of microbial communities was assessed utilizing metrics suited to describe richness α diversity and composition β diversity of microbes with respect to α diversity the number of observed amplicon sequence variant asv was directly compared with the chao1 index 2 4 short term impact of vacuum pressure on acidogenic microbial activity specific acidogenic fermentation activity tests were conducted to evaluate the activity of conventional anaerobic digested sludge ads intensicarb ads ic and chemically treated ads cads reflecting ph changes in the ic digester for biohydrogen potential bhp from glucose glucose is a readily biodegradable monosaccharides and most widely used as a substrate in acidogenic activity tests regueiro et al 2012 in the ic system vacuum was applied for 5 consecutive days 4 h d at 45 c and 110 mbar notably the ph of the sludge increased with vacuum ph changes over the experimental period are presented in table s2 the ph of the raw ads was 7 6 and increased by 0 9 standard units after 5 days of operation with the vacuum fermenter eventually stabilizing at 8 5 therefore cads ph was adjusted daily to the same ph as the ads using naoh 1 m to differentiate between the impact of vacuum and ph on acidogenic activity the optimum ph for the acidogenic activity test ph is 5 5 haroun et al 2016 therefore the initial phs of the tested sludges were adjusted using 2 m hcl prior to the acidogenic activity test heat treatment was applied at 70

referred to as a biohydrogen potential test bhp in bhp experiments glucose was used as the readily biodegradable substrate to investigate the activity of ic cads and ads the bhp test was conducted

biomass mg δvfa g vssr d to compare performance of different fermenters vfa production rates for conventional ic at if of 1 3 and 2 0 reactors were 28 33 and 43 mg δvfa g vssr d respectively similarly soluble cod production rates for the three reactors were 109 117 and 140 mg δcod g vssr d respectively vfa production rates indicate higher vfa production scod per unit biomass in the ic fermenter with an if 2 0 compared that with if 1 3 and the conventional fermenter these values show that despite the higher organic loading rates increased performance of the ic fermenter is not solely attributable to operation at higher biomass concentrations suggesting that ic is potentially more effective than mere physical solids concentration technologies like recuperative thickening as evidenced by li et al 2020 who only observed a marginal change in hydrolysis rate from 0 5 to 0 55 l day with recuperative thickening that doubled srt to 30 days the vfa and hydrolysis yields of the conventional if 1 0 and ic if 1 3 and if 2 00 versus the intensification factors applied at each experimental condition are shown in fig 2 as shown both yields show a positive linear correlation r2 0 97 with the intensification factor these results show that the ic fermenter effectively increased the volumetric loading rate of the feed sludge from 0 34 to 0 44 0 67 m3 sludge m3 fermenter d and solids loading from 4 2 to 5 4 10 1 kgvss m3 fermenter d indicating a significantly higher biosolids processing capacity 3 2 vfa fractionation to characterize vfas in the ic fermentate three samples of mixed feed and fermentates from three different cycles during the ic operation if 2 0 srt of 3 and hrt of 1 5 days were collected and analyzed als canada ltd london on the daily mass distributions of vfas in the feed condensate and fermentate samples are shown in fig 3 acetic propionic and butyric acids accounted for 45 7 28 1 and 13 2 respectively of the influent vfa mass rate on a cod basis fermentate vfa was comprised of 28 2 acetic 19 6 propionic and 26 8 butyric while the condensate vfas were 20 3 acetic 14 3 propionic and 29 0 butyric respectively 3 3 specific denitrification rate tests average nitrate nitrite and soluble cod profiles during denitrification tests are summarized in fig 4 a b and c respectively denitrification in control reactors fed only with mlss or fermentate was negligible indicating the lack of readily biodegradable carbon in the former and an insignificant concentration of active denitrifiers in the latter the nitrate and soluble cod profiles for the two sets of reactors fed with either fermentate or acetate as supplemental carbon showed significant nitrate and scod depletion upon addition of supplemental carbon while fig 4a indicates that all nitrates were denitrified within 1 5 h fig 4b shows residual nitrites of 10 0 and 6 0 mg l for the acetate and fermentate tests after 1 5 h respectively with full depletion of nitrite after 3 h in both reactors comparing the nitrate and nitrite profiles in fig 4a and b shows that while the rate of denitration for both fermentate and acetate were comparable in the first 1 5 h the rate of denitritation for the fermentate was superior to acetate indicating better partial denitrification rate for nitrites which may be beneficial for bnr plants using partial nitrification maximum biomass specific denitrification rates were calculated based on return activated sludge ras vss because the fermentate vss did not contribute to denitrification table 3 as shown sdnr using fermentate 0 24 0 06 mg no3 mg vss d is comparable to acetate 0 28 0 03 mg no3 mg vss d indicating the potential for the ic fermentate to enhance denitrification based on the vfa fractionation acetic acid formed only 29 of the total vfa cod in the fermentate considering the high scod no3 ratio of 8 0 10 0 at the start of the tests with the 31 acidification obtained during the vacuum fermentation process the vfa cod and acetate cod ratio to no3 at the beginning of the test were about 2 5 3 3 and 0 73 0 93 respectively well below the typical 5 8 requirement metcalf and eddy 2014 for naturally generated vfas denitrification rates have been reported in the range of 0 019 0 57 g no3 g vss d elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 specific denitrification rates of butyric valeric and propionic acids were reported at 86 7 81 6 and 60 of acetate sdnr respectively yatong 1996 the typically low acetate to nitrate in these denitrification tests shows that the combination of vfas and the impact of other non vfa organics in the fermentate contributed to the comparable denitrification with acetate interestingly using the relative sdnr for the vfa and the observed acetate sdnr of 0 28 mg no3 mg vss d table 3 combined with the fermentate vfa fractionation fig 3 the estimated sdnr of the fermentate was 0 235 mg no3 mg vss d in agreement with the observed value of 0 24 mg no3 mg vss d in addition the average cod and no3 concentrations at the beginning of the test 397 and 37 mg l declined to 177 and 1 1 mg l after 4 h indicating that on average 55 of the initial cod was consumed for full denitrification 97 removal efficiency this further demonstrates that non vfa carbon also contributed to denitrification because the total vfa were not sufficient on a stoichiometric basis propionic acetic and butyric acids are suitable for the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process pijuan et al 2009 however butyrate is not as effective as acetate or propionate from stoichiometric and kinetic perspectives it has been reported that the uptake rate by paos when butyrate is used as carbon source 0 017 mmol c gvss min was 70 lower than for acetate 0 058 mmol c gvss min and propionate 0 051 mmol c gvss min pijuan et al 2009 3 4 impact of vacuum on anaerobic fermentation acidification of glucose the impact of short term vacuum on fermentative bacteria hydrogen producing bacteria was investigated by testing ic cads and ads as inoculum and glucose as a substrate in ampts in triplicates vacuum treatment without ph control was conducted at 45 c 110 mbar and 4 h day for 5 consecutive days during which ph increased by less than one unit fig 5 shows hydrogen yields at standard temperature and pressure stp of 130 105 and 121 ml h2 g cod glucose added for ic cads and ads respectively the net biohydrogen data was fitted to the gompertz model eq 4 4 p t p exp exp r m e p λ t 1 where p t is the cumulative biohydrogen potential ml at time t λ is the lag phase h p is the hydrogen production potential ml rm is the biogas production rate ml h and e is exp 1 which is approx 2 7 the kinetic parameters according to the gompertz model table 4 demonstrate that the lag phase of ic was 11 7 h compared to 9 5 h and 11 5 h for cads and ads respectively this confirms that neither biohydrogen yield nor lag phase were negatively impacted by applying vacuum to the seed sludge compared to ads additionally comparable maximum specific hydrogen production rates mshpr for ic and ads 75 3 vs 76 9 ml h2 gvss h were observed however the mshpr for cads of 69 3 ml h2 gvss h was 10 lower compared to ic and ads this could be due to chemical treatment in addition to heat treatment results confirm that vacuum is not inhibitory to the fermentative bacteria as elucidated by comparable specific hydrogen production rates and yields these results are consistent with rajhi et al 2016 where vacuum application enhanced the diversity of fermentative bacteria such as clostridium gnida et al 2020 reported that fermentative bacteria such as clostridium may grow at 7 mbar similar to results in this study lee et al 2012 found that reduced pressure enhanced hydrogen yields the aforementioned authors investigated the impact of the reduced pressure vacuum ranging from 0 17 atm to 1 atm in a cstr using sucrose at a concentration of 17 8 g l ph of 5 5 37 c and hrt of 12 h and reported hydrogen yields of 1 64 mol mol hexose for the control at 1 atm compared to 1 8 mol mol hexose at 0 17 atm other researchers have reported no or insignificant impact of vacuum on biohydrogen production which confirms that vacuum has no negative impact on fermentative bacteria clark et al 2012 3 5 impact of vacuum on specific methanogenic activity sma specific methanogenic activity tests were conducted using ampts for ads ic and cads with acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate to investigate the impact of vacuum on specific methanogenic activity cads was tested to distinguish between the effects of vacuum induced and chemical and the ph increase since the ph increased from 7 56 to 8 5 after 5 days of vacuum table s2 interestingly ph increased from 7 56 to 9 4 after one day of vacuum 4 h day at 45 c and 110 mbar but decreased to 8 5 on the fifth day the increase in ph on the first day could be attributed to ammonia and carbon dioxide stripping and the decrease in ph on subsequent days could be attributed to ammonia stripping as a result of consecutive vacuum application table s2 the experimental data and the gompertz model fits for sma tests are shown in fig 6 with kinetic data presented in table 5 the methane yields my per g cod acetate for ic cads and ads were 351 364 and 362 ml ch4 g cod respectively fig 6 additionally the 5d lag phase for the ic was much longer than the 0 1 d for ads and 3 d for cads the gompertz model predicted longer lag phases for ic and cads 11 2 d vs 5 d for the ic and 7 4 d vs 3 d for the cads msmprs of 25 3 19 7 and 31 3 ml ch4 g vss d were observed for ic cads and ads respectively table 5 the msmprs of ic and cads were 19 2 and 37 lower than the ads this could be due to the impact of vacuum in the case of ic or chemical addition to adjust ph up to 9 4 on day 1 for cads elbeshbishy et al 2010 reported that high ph inhibits and suppresses methanogens despite enriching fermentative bacteria as shown in table 5 although there is a 19 reduction in msmpr in ic compared to ads methane yields per g cod acetate were comparable 351 ml ch4 g cod acetate added or ic vs 362 ml ch4 g cod acetate added for ads other researchers have reported that vacuum can inactivate bacterial cell membranes due to dehydration however this could be repaired during subsequent incubation bucker et al 1972 horneck 1981 however the negative impact of vacuum on methanogens is likely to be mitigated in full scale systems by the long hrt and srt which typically exceed 5 days and the much higher biomass concentrations ensuing from the decoupling of srt from hrt further it is envisioned that full scale application of vacuum will be applied on the effluent digestate with recirculation of the residual concentrated biosolids back to the digester thus on a daily basis only a very small percentage of methanogens will be subjected to vacuum i e at an hrt of 15 days only 6 67 of the digester biomass although assessment of the ic for anaerobic digestion of biosolids was beyond the scope of this study preliminary biomethanation potential tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of short term vacuum application to primary sludge twas and ads the results depicted in figs s5 and s6 suggest minimal impact on the anaerobic biodegradability of ps and twas solids 3 6 microbial ecology analysis the microbial ecology analysis fig 7 revealed the relative abundance of prokaryotes phylum observed in the feed and fermentate samples results showed that excluding a minor population of archaea bacteria were the most abundant microorganisms observed in the feed s1 s3 and fermentate f1 f3 samples from the ic with an if of 2 00 total prokaryote concentrations in the feed and fermentate samples were 9 6 109 2 2 108 and 2 8 1010 2 3 109 amplified unit number au ml respectively indicating a 2 8 fold increase in the concentration of prokaryotes the shannon values of 5 52 and 4 97 on average for the feed and fermentate samples respectively confirmed their high α diversity which was consistent with similar studies of 5 5 6 4 chen et al 2019 and 4 5 6 5 wang et al 2016 chao1 indices of 564 14 and 438 34 for the feed and fermentate samples respectively were however lower than the chao1 values of 6000 10 000 reported for diverse samples taken from reactors treating municipal wastewater chen et al 2019 but higher than the 12 26 reported for dark co fermentation of 80 tequila vinasse and 20 nixtamalization wastewater garcía depraect et al 2019 and 18 40 in reclaimed wastewater irrigated soil li et al 2019 this indicates that a moderate diversity in the microbial community of the feed sludge was reduced during the vacuum fermentation process the lower microbial diversity of the fermentate relative to the feed sludge could be attributed to the lower survival of some communities such as gemmatimonadetes planctomycetes and spirochaetae during the vacuum fermentation process to investigate the diversity in microbial composition β diversity was assessed using the unweighted unifrac distance metric lozupone and knight 2005 a description of which is presented in the supplementary information the principal coordinates pco plot fig s7 shows maximum variation of 93 2 pc1 and 2 5 pc2 the dissimilarities between samples are represented by the distance between them where longer distances are indicative of higher dissimilarities between samples the pco plot exhibits minimum dissimilarities in prokaryote composition in feed samples samples were clustered at the negative side of the first pco with no marked difference depending on the days cycle of sampling on the contrary fermentate samples clustered to the opposite side of the plot exhibiting a positive correlation with the first pco and a diverse correlation with the second pco and marking a significant difference in from corresponding feed in addition higher dissimilarities were displayed among fermentate samples by dispersed samples in comparison with feed samples it has been shown that the phyla bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant in the hydrolysis acidification reactors treating simulated starch based dyeing wastewater xie et al 2016 bacteroidetes and firmicutes are core microbiota of the human gut and are fermentative bacteria capable of degrading polysaccharides marx 2015 berman 2019 proteobacteria also belong to hydrogenogenic co oxidizers including phototrophs anaerobes facultative anaerobes fukuyama et al 2020 and sulfide oxidizers schmidt 2019 fermentative bacteria including firmicutes bacteriodetes protobacteria tenericutes and thermotogae formed 43 12 5 25 5 and 7 of the relative abundance of the prokaryotic genus in the fermentate thermotogae constituted 6 7 108 au ml relative abundance of 2 4 in the fermentate but was visibly absent in the feed this phylum comprise a group of extremely thermophilic rod shaped non spore forming heterotrophic bacteria conners et al 2006 with acetic acid carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas h2 as the main fermentation products huber et al 1986 van ooteghem et al 2002 tenericutes are gram stain negative bacteria without cell walls that metabolize propionic acid cibis et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 tenericutes affiliated bacteria are facultative thermophilic anaerobes produce acids under anaerobic conditions hence their proliferation may be linked to higher vfa yields li et al 2016 tenericutes constituted 4 8 108 au ml in the fermentate but were absent in the feed this indicates that the anaerobic process was at least partially facilitated by thermophilic fermentative bacteria 4 conclusions this study emphatically demonstrated the advantages of the vacuum enhanced fermentation technology with perfect decoupling of srt from hrt compared to conventional fermentation not only in terms of improved solubilization i e hydrolysis and acidification but also with respect to volumetric loadings and throughput the ic produced readily biodegradable organics that resulted in comparable denitrification rates to the best carbon source i e acetate long term tests showed that vacuum did not adversely impact the activity of fermenters and acetoclastic methanogens the following specific conclusions can be drawn compared to vfa yield for conventional fermentation of 61 mg δvfa g vss intensicarb increased vfa yields by 29 5 90 2 79 to 116 mg δvfa g vss and hydrolysis yields of 241 mg δscod g vss by 16 2 56 4 280 to 377 mg δscod g vss respectively the ic fermenter could effectively increase volumetric loading from 0 34 to 0 44 0 67 m3 sludge m3 fermenter d and solids loading from 4 2 to 5 4 10 1 kgvss m3 fermenter d vfa and hydrolysis yields increased linearly at higher intensification factors denitrification rates with ic fermentate were comparable to acetate despite comprising a mixture of acetate with other higher vfas and lower denitrification rates additionally the denitritation rate with the ic fermentate was superior to acetate which may be advantageous for partial nitrification systems vacuum did not exert any negative impact on acidogenic activity and fermenters both with respect to biohydrogen rates and yields maximum specific methane production rates in sma tests were 25 3 ml ch4 g vss d 19 7 ml ch4 g vss d and 31 3 ml ch4 g vss d while maximum specific hydrogen production rates from bhp tests were 75 3 69 3 and 76 9 ml h2 g vss h for ic cads and ads respectively although not explicitly discussed in this work the ability of the ic to strip ammonia by vacuum offers great advantages with respect to mitigation of ammonia inhibition in anaerobic digesters enabling higher loadings of municipal wastewater biosolids and also co digestion with protein rich food wastes ammonia stripping and separate recovery also reduces the need for sidestream treatment and mitigates struvite associated operational challenges in digesters to avert potential structural concerns associated with digesters operating under vacuum intensicarb can be applied external to anaerobic digesters for ammonia stripping and solids thickening prior to recicrculation to the digesters declaration of

15879,this study assessed the feasibility of a novel vacuum enhanced anaerobic digestion technology referred to as intensicarbtm ic under mild vacuum pressure 110 mbar compared to a control conventional fermenter and evaluated the impact of the vacuum on the activities of various microbial groups both fermenters test and control were operated with mixed 50 v v municipal sludge at solids concentrations of 2 2 5 ph of 7 8 8 1 40 45 c a theoretical solids retention time srt of 3 days with different hydraulic retention times hrt the intensification factor if of the ic defined as srt hrt was controlled at 1 3 and 2 0 simultaneous thickening and fermentation intensification were achieved compared with the control the ic despite the shorter hrts achieved 29 5 to 90 2 increase in the vfa yield 79 to 116 mg δvfa g vss vs 61 mg δvfa g vss and 16 2 to 56 4 increase 280 to 377 mg δscod g vss vs 241 mg δscod g vss in the hydrolysis yield fermentate from the ic exhibited comparable specific denitrification rates to acetate further the solids free condensate contained low nutrient concentrations and thus was far superior to a typical centrates from dewatering as a carbon source no adverse effects of vacuum on the activity of fermentative bacteria and methanogens were observed this study demonstrated that the ic can be deployed as an intensification technology for both fermentation and anaerobic digestion of biosolids with the additional significant advantage i e elimination of sidestream ammonia treatment requirements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic fermentation vacuum fermentation advanced biosolid treatment evaporation 1 introduction conventional anaerobic digestion cad is a well established technology that has been adopted especially in large water resource recovery facilities wrrf for biosolids minimization and energy recovery silvestre et al 2015 cad of municipal biosolids is usually performed at mesophilic 30 40 c or thermophilic 50 55 c conditions despite the benefits of cad at wrrfs its use is currently limited to application at large facilities 10 million gallons per day mgd due to low volatile solids vs degradation rates that result in large cad reactors with high capital costs compared to anaerobic digestion fermentation is a process that occurs at much shorter srts typically not exceeding 5 8 days ahn and speece 2006 zhou et al 2018 this process is gaining increased attention due to its ability to upgrade slowly biodegradable carbon to readily biodegradable carbon a beneficial outcome for carbon limited wrrfs employing biological nutrient removal bnr hydrolysis of particulates is the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion pratt et al 2012 volatile fatty acid vfa and hydrolysis yields vary substantially depending on the feedstock operational conditions and pretreatment techniques sánchez rubal et al 2012 yuan et al 2009 ahn and speece 2006 sánchez rubal et al 2012 observed a hydrolysis yield of 0 15 to 0 17 g scod g vss during primary sludge ps fermentation at 1 day srt and 30 c and 0 15 to 0 25 g scod g vss at 3 day srt similarly yuan et al 2009 observed a hydrolysis yield of 0 04 to 0 1 g scod g vss at room temperature 20 to 22 c fermentation of waste activated sludge was at 5 day srt ahn and speece 2006 reported a vfa yield of 180 mg cod g vs for thermophilic 55 c fermentation of primary sludge at ph 9 0 using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor this result is comparable to the vfa yield of 155 mg cod g vs for cellulosic primary sludge fermented at 55 c and ph 10 0 crutchik et al 2018 in a similar study using mixed primary sludge and waste activated sludge was vfa yields of 207 and 316 mg cod g vs were reported for mesophilic fermentation at uncontrolled ph 5 3 6 5 and ph 10 0 respectively longo et al 2015 in terms of vfa composition a mixture of acetic and propionic acids provides better performance than either pure acid for enhanced biological phosphorus removal li et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 several intensification strategies have been proposed and investigated to enhance fermentation and anaerobic digestion mcleod et al 2019 these strategies are typically applied outside anaerobic digesters like in sludge pretreatment e g thermal hydrolysis or post treatment e g recuperative thickening thermal hydrolysis a well established biosolids pretreatment technology has been most widely applied upstream of mesophilic cad for process intensification since the late 2000s in this process biosolids are subjected to high temperatures 100 c for a specified period 30 to 60 min pilli et al 2015 thermal hydrolysis increases solubilization of extracellular carbohydrate lipids etc and intracellular compounds proteins which increases the rate of cad and facilitates higher biogas production zhang et al 2019 key benefits of this pretreatment include enhanced biodegradability faster kinetics lower viscosity improved dewaterability and better quality of biosolids in terms of odor and pathogens kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 recuperative thickening which involves solids separation and recirculation into the digester has been used to increase reactor capacity by allowing higher organic loading rates without compromising biogas production and organics destruction li et al 2020 vanyushina et al 2012 recuperative thickening has been implemented using various solids separation and thickening techniques including anoxic gas flotation belt filter press thickening rotary drum thickeners and centrifuges cobbledick et al 2016 at an hrt of 9 days and srt of 19 days if of 2 1 a pilot scale anoxic gas flotation digester treating primary sludge and waste activated sludge was showed better vs destruction 64 compared to a cad process 59 burke 2000 the aforementioned study also reported a 50 lower polymer usage for dewatering and a 20 increase in dewatered cake solids two studies conducted in australian wrrfs using rotary drum thickeners showed that digester capacity could be increased by up to 26 with less than 20 reduction in specific methanogenic activity batstone et al 2015 ireland 2011 moreover bharambe et al 2015 reported that recuperative thickening using rotary drum thickeners resulted in a 20 increase in biogas production a 22 reduction in biosolids production and an 80 reduction in hydrogen sulfide release due to reduced activity of sulfate reducing bacteria recuperative thickening using a belt filter has also been combined with thermal hydrolysis to reduce digester hrt to 7 5 days while maintaining srt at 15 days compared to the control reactor with an srt of 15 days no negative impact or significant improvement on anaerobic digestion was observed in volatile solids reduction and methane production li et al 2020 vanyushina et al 2012 vacuum evaporation has been used for sludge dewatering at temperatures between 50 and 90 c and vacuum pressures 70 to 270 mbar yan et al 2009 as well as ammonia and volatiles recovery nguyen et al 2011 and hydrogen sonnleitner et al 2012 from yeast fermentation using vacuum thermal stripping vacuum application for biosolids treatment has only been considered in laboratory studies abbassi 2003 tested anaerobic digestion of was pretreated at 20 mbar for 30 min and observed increased biogas production by almost 97 compared to untreated was 335 vs 170 l kg was increased biogas production was attributed to vacuum enhanced cell disintegration and solubilization resulting in increased scod concentrations from 150 to 300 mg l zhang et al 2017 applied vacuum pretreatment at 133 mbar for 4 h to liquid swine manure to reduce free ammonia for thermophilic anaerobic digestion the aforementioned authors reported a 52 increase in methanogenesis and a 40 improvement in hydrolysis relative to the untreated sample only a few batch studies have discussed the impact of vacuum on hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogens gnida 2020 rajhi et al 2016 verseux 2020 kral et al 2011 long term effects on microbial communities remain largely unexplored kral et al 2011 investigated the impact of vacuum on different methanogens cultivated on mars soil simulant the authors reported that methanogens survived for 10 days under 400 mbar at 35 c but displayed minimal activity when pressure reached 50 mbar indicating that higher vacuum lower absolute pressure exerted more stress on methanogens rajhi et al 2016 studied the impact of vacuum on biohydrogen production using synthetic substrates such as glucose sucrose meat extract olive oil and municipal wastewater the inoculum was anaerobic granular sludge collected from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket bioreactor treating brewery wastewater mahou guadalajara spain batches were run at 30 c ph of 7 with and without continuous vacuum for 30 days the authors reported that vacuum enhanced diversity of fermentative bacteria such as clostridium and promoted the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens over hydrogenotrophic bacteria the resulting microbial community improved hydrogen yield acetate consumption and cod removal efficiency the ic is a novel technology fig 1 that allows complete decoupling of hrt from srt via vacuum evaporation leading to a compact process that could be deployed at a broader range of facilities including small municipalities 10 mgd additionally the ability to selectively direct nutrients into liquid or particulate phases of the fermentate or condensate using ph and oxidation reduction potential controls can facilitate separation and recovery of resources such as ammonia phosphorus and vfas while simultaneously enhancing sludge thickening despite the potential advantages of the ic scientific and technological unknowns warrant further investigation of the ic including the impact of vacuum on microbial communities as well as vfa production and recovery the objectives of this study were to experimentally assess 1 the performance of ic operated as a fermenter with respect to acidification and hydrolysis yields under vacuum 2 the impact of vacuum on fermentative and methanogenic communities and the overall microbial ecology 3 fermentate quality as a supplemental carbon source for denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 the intensicarbtm process the ic is a patent pending treatment system jointly developed by usp technologies brown and caldwell and western university enabling vacuum enhanced biochemical fermentation and simultaneous thickening of municipal biosolids through vacuum evaporation at temperatures between 20 and 60 c this process combines thickening hydrolysis acidification gas stripping and dewatering in a single reactor biochemical and physicochemical treatment processes are simultaneously intensified through the nearly ideal solid liquid separation moreover depending on ph nitrogen can be either retained in the fermentate under acidic conditions ph 6 or directed to the condensate under alkaline conditions ph 8 the strong bubbling regime promoted by vacuum boiling intensifies mass transfer among the gas liquid and solid phases removing volatiles by vacuum evaporation also allows the complete retention of non volatile soluble fractions including nutrients such as ammonia and phosphates of fermented biosolids ancillary units for heat recovery are integrated with the vacuum evaporation chamber to recycle latent heat of evaporation back into the process a complete ic is comprised of a heat exchanger to pre heat the feed stock using recovered heat from the fermented sludge a main reactor vessel operating under vacuum which can perform both fermentation and thickening a vacuum pump to extract vapor produced during evaporation and a second heat exchanger to recover latent heat of evaporation to heat the reactor fig 1 based on the vacuum evaporation technology type and heat recovery features evaporation can be achieved with electrical power demands ranging from 50 to 150 kwh m3 of treated sludge in this study a bench scale ic with an operating volume of 3 l was placed on a plate induction heater and connected to a vacuum pump to establish the target vacuum pressure and temperature in parallel a control fermenter with an operating volume of 2 l was operated at the same srt of the ic process in both reactors temperature was maintained at 40 45 c table 1 presents the operating conditions and the experimental design for this study it should be noted that the absolute pressure of 110 mbar used in the ic is the boiling pressure of water at 45 c all systems were operated until pseudo steady state conditions were reached detailed characterization of the sludges used as feedstock is summarized in table s1 supplementary information both fermenters table 1 were fed with 50 50 on a volumetric basis of primary and thickened waste activated sludge twas from greenway wastewater treatment plant london on when required dilution with distilled water was provided to maintain influent total solids concentration of 2 2 5 throughout the study between vacuum extractions both the control and the ic fermenter were maintained at 45 c using a water bath fermentation performance was evaluated by collecting and analyzing multiple samples of the liquid and solids for the liquid component measurements

symphony an external certified lab als canada london on followed their respective epa astm and apha methods to measure soluble anions nutrients and metals vfa fractions were measured by the same external lab using the astm d2908 91 test method 2 2 specific denitrification rate tests a series of batch denitrification tests were conducted following the protocols of kampas et al 2009 to assess the quality of the fermentates as a carbon source for biological nutrient removal soluble cod to nitrate ratios were maintained at a minimum of 8 10 to avoid carbon limitations during the test batch reactors containing mixed liquor suspended solids mlss controls were spiked with nitrate as a control to check for background denitrifying activity similarly reactors containing fermentate were spiked with nitrate fermentate controls to check whether the fermentate included viable denitrifiers to be accounted for in biomass specific denitrification rates sdnr calculations acetate was tested in parallel as a standard carbon source 2 3 microbial ecology analysis triplicate feed and fermentate samples obtained from the ic reactor operated at if 2 0 srt of 3d and hrt of 1 5d were submitted to

determined spectrophotometrically with absorbance measurements at 260 and 280 nm using an a260 a280 ratio qpcr was used to detect total archaea bacteria with primers eub338 eub518 fierer et al 2005 archaebacterial and bacterial diversity were evaluated using metagenomic analyses the chao1 index chao 1987 was used to estimate species richness as it allows for better evaluation of rare species in this study the number of observed amplicon sequence variant asv was directly compared with chao1 with respect to α diversity additionally the shannon index shannon 1948 was used to account for asv richness and evenness where a larger shannon index relates to greater abundance in the ecosystem the three indices chao1 shannon and asv number were calculated on a standardized basis of 16 000 sequences per sample to evaluate the total microbial diversity richness of species in the reactors the structure of microbial communities was assessed utilizing metrics suited to describe richness α diversity and composition β diversity of microbes with respect to α diversity the number of observed amplicon sequence variant asv was directly compared with the chao1 index 2 4 short term impact of vacuum pressure on acidogenic microbial activity specific acidogenic fermentation activity tests were conducted to evaluate the activity of conventional anaerobic digested sludge ads intensicarb ads ic and chemically treated ads cads reflecting ph changes in the ic digester for biohydrogen potential bhp from glucose glucose is a readily biodegradable monosaccharides and most widely used as a substrate in acidogenic activity tests regueiro et al 2012 in the ic system vacuum was applied for 5 consecutive days 4 h d at 45 c and 110 mbar notably the ph of the sludge increased with vacuum ph changes over the experimental period are presented in table s2 the ph of the raw ads was 7 6 and increased by 0 9 standard units after 5 days of operation with the vacuum fermenter eventually stabilizing at 8 5 therefore cads ph was adjusted daily to the same ph as the ads using naoh 1 m to differentiate between the impact of vacuum and ph on acidogenic activity the optimum ph for the acidogenic activity test ph is 5 5 haroun et al 2016 therefore the initial phs of the tested sludges were adjusted using 2 m hcl prior to the acidogenic activity test heat treatment was applied at 70 c for 30 min to suppress methanogenic activity and enrich hydrogen producing bacteria haroun et al 2016 vfas and hydrogen gas are the main products during acidification fermentation this test is referred to as a biohydrogen potential test bhp in bhp experiments glucose was used as the readily biodegradable substrate to investigate the activity of ic cads and ads the bhp test was conducted using the automated methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control lund sweden at 37 c ph of 5 5 food to microorganisms f m ratio of 4 g cod substrate g vss inoculum and glucose concentration of 5 g cod l the maximum specific hydrogen production rate mshpr was reported as ml h2 g vss inoculum h 2 5 short term impact of vacuum pressure on specific methanogenic activity sma sma tests were conducted with the ampts using acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate the sma tests were done to compare the activity of methanogens in the ic to those in the ads the operational conditions were 37 c ph 7 inoculum vss of 2 g l and acetate concentration of 1 g cod l vacuum was applied for 5 consecutive days 4 h d at 45 c and 110 mbar the maximum specific methane production rates msmprs were calculated by normalizing the maximum methane production rate to the inoculum vss in wang 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance analysis conventional and ic the temporal variations of the vfa yields hydrolysis yield and degree of acidification are depicted in fig s1 the steady state and cod mass balance closure for the three conditions in this experiment are summarized in table 2 these parameters were assessed using a cumulative mass balance approach as shown in eqs 1 3 saritpongteeraka et al 2014 where n is the number of sampling points with the subscripts in and out indicating the mass of a given variable fed and removed from the fermenter respectively 1 y i e l d v f a i 1 n v f a o u t v f a i n i i 1 n v s s i n i 2 y i e l d h y d r o l y s i s i 1 n s c o d o u t s c o d i n i 1 n v s s i n i 3 a c i d i f i c a t i o n i 1 n v f a o u t v f a i n i i 1 n s c o d o u t s c o d i n the cumulative net vfa production based on experimental results obtained at pseudo steady state conditions were plotted versus cumulative influent vss to determine vfa yield fig s2 the net daily vfa and hydrolysis yields cumulative hydrolysis yields and acidification based on cumulative vfa and scod data are presented in figs s2 s3 and s4 respectively as shown in table 2 the observed vfa yield of 61 mg vfa g vssin in the conventional fermenter increased by 29 5 and 90 2 as a result of changing the operation from conventional to the ic mode at if 1 33 and 2 0 respectively the hydrolysis yield of 241 mg δscod g vssin in the conventional fermentation increased by 16 2 and 56 4 in the ic fermenters at if of 1 33 and 2 0 respectively vfa production rates were calculated based on net generated vfa per unit vssr of reactor biomass mg δvfa g vssr d to compare performance of different fermenters vfa production rates for conventional ic at if of 1 3 and 2 0 reactors were 28 33 and 43 mg δvfa g vssr d respectively similarly soluble cod production rates for the three reactors were 109 117 and 140 mg δcod g vssr d respectively vfa production rates indicate higher vfa production scod per unit biomass in the ic fermenter with an if 2 0 compared that with if 1 3 and the conventional fermenter these values show that despite the higher organic loading rates increased performance of the ic fermenter is not solely attributable to operation at higher biomass concentrations suggesting that ic is potentially more effective than mere physical solids concentration technologies like recuperative thickening as evidenced by li et al 2020 who only observed a marginal change in hydrolysis rate from 0 5 to 0 55 l day with recuperative thickening that doubled srt to 30 days the vfa and hydrolysis yields of the conventional if 1 0 and ic if 1 3 and if 2 00 versus the intensification factors applied at each experimental condition are shown in fig 2 as shown both yields show a positive linear correlation r2 0 97 with the intensification factor these results show that the ic fermenter effectively increased the volumetric loading rate of the feed sludge from 0 34 to 0 44 0 67 m3 sludge m3 fermenter d and solids loading from 4 2 to 5 4 10 1 kgvss m3 fermenter d indicating a significantly higher biosolids processing capacity 3 2 vfa fractionation to characterize vfas in the ic fermentate three samples of mixed feed and fermentates from three different cycles during the ic operation if 2 0 srt of 3 and hrt of 1 5 days were collected and analyzed als canada ltd london on the daily mass distributions of vfas in the feed condensate and fermentate samples are shown in fig 3 acetic propionic and butyric acids accounted for 45 7 28 1 and 13 2 respectively of the influent vfa mass rate on a cod basis fermentate vfa was comprised of 28 2 acetic 19 6 propionic and 26 8 butyric while the condensate vfas were 20 3 acetic 14 3 propionic and 29 0 butyric respectively 3 3 specific denitrification rate tests average nitrate nitrite and soluble cod profiles during denitrification tests are summarized in fig 4 a b and c respectively denitrification in control reactors fed only with mlss or fermentate was negligible indicating the lack of readily biodegradable carbon in the former and an insignificant concentration of active denitrifiers in the latter the nitrate and soluble cod profiles for the two sets of reactors fed with either fermentate or acetate as supplemental carbon showed significant nitrate and scod depletion upon addition of supplemental carbon while fig 4a indicates that all nitrates were denitrified within 1 5 h fig 4b shows residual nitrites of 10 0 and 6 0 mg l for the acetate and fermentate tests after 1 5 h respectively with full depletion of nitrite after 3 h in both reactors comparing the nitrate and nitrite profiles in fig 4a and b shows that while the rate of denitration for both fermentate and acetate were comparable in the first 1 5 h the rate of denitritation for the fermentate was superior to acetate indicating better partial denitrification rate for nitrites which may be beneficial for bnr plants using partial nitrification maximum biomass specific denitrification rates were calculated based on return activated sludge ras vss because the fermentate vss did not contribute to denitrification table 3 as shown sdnr using fermentate 0 24 0 06 mg no3 mg vss d is comparable to acetate 0 28 0 03 mg no3 mg vss d indicating the potential for the ic fermentate to enhance denitrification based on the vfa fractionation acetic acid formed only 29 of the total vfa cod in the fermentate considering the high scod no3 ratio of 8 0 10 0 at the start of the tests with the 31 acidification obtained during the vacuum fermentation process the vfa cod and acetate cod ratio to no3 at the beginning of the test were about 2 5 3 3 and 0 73 0 93 respectively well below the typical 5 8 requirement metcalf and eddy 2014 for naturally generated vfas denitrification rates have been reported in the range of 0 019 0 57 g no3 g vss d elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 specific denitrification rates of butyric valeric and propionic acids were reported at 86 7 81 6 and 60 of acetate sdnr respectively yatong 1996 the typically low acetate to nitrate in these denitrification tests shows that the combination of vfas and the impact of other non vfa organics in the fermentate contributed to the comparable denitrification with acetate interestingly using the relative sdnr for the vfa and the observed acetate sdnr of 0 28 mg no3 mg vss d table 3 combined with the fermentate vfa fractionation fig 3 the estimated sdnr of the fermentate was 0 235 mg no3 mg vss d in agreement with the observed value of 0 24 mg no3 mg vss d in addition the average cod and no3 concentrations at the beginning of the test 397 and 37 mg l declined to 177 and 1 1 mg l after 4 h indicating that on average 55 of the initial cod was consumed for full denitrification 97 removal efficiency this further demonstrates that non vfa carbon also contributed to denitrification because the total vfa were not sufficient on a stoichiometric basis propionic acetic and butyric acids are suitable for the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process pijuan et al 2009 however butyrate is not as effective as acetate or propionate from stoichiometric and kinetic perspectives it has been reported that the uptake rate by paos when butyrate is used as carbon source 0 017 mmol c gvss min was 70 lower than for acetate 0 058 mmol c gvss min and propionate 0 051 mmol c gvss min pijuan et al 2009 3 4 impact of vacuum on anaerobic fermentation acidification of glucose the impact of short term vacuum on fermentative bacteria hydrogen producing bacteria was investigated by testing ic cads and ads as inoculum and glucose as a substrate in ampts in triplicates vacuum treatment without ph control was conducted at 45 c 110 mbar and 4 h day for 5 consecutive days during which ph increased by less than one unit fig 5 shows hydrogen yields at standard temperature and pressure stp of 130 105 and 121 ml h2 g cod glucose added for ic cads and ads respectively the net biohydrogen data was fitted to the gompertz model eq 4 4 p t p exp exp r m e p λ t 1 where p t is the cumulative biohydrogen potential ml at time t λ is the lag phase h p is the hydrogen production potential ml rm is the biogas production rate ml h and e is exp 1 which is approx 2 7 the kinetic parameters according to the gompertz model table 4 demonstrate that the lag phase of ic was 11 7 h compared to 9 5 h and 11 5 h for cads and ads respectively this confirms that neither biohydrogen yield nor lag phase were negatively impacted by applying vacuum to the seed sludge compared to ads additionally comparable maximum specific hydrogen production rates mshpr for ic and ads 75 3 vs 76 9 ml h2 gvss h were observed however the mshpr for cads of 69 3 ml h2 gvss h was 10 lower compared to ic and ads this could be due to chemical treatment in addition to heat treatment results confirm that vacuum is not inhibitory to the fermentative bacteria as elucidated by comparable specific hydrogen production rates and yields these results are consistent with rajhi et al 2016 where vacuum application enhanced the diversity of fermentative bacteria such as clostridium gnida et al 2020 reported that fermentative bacteria such as clostridium may grow at 7 mbar similar to results in this study lee et al 2012 found that reduced pressure enhanced hydrogen yields the aforementioned authors investigated the impact of the reduced pressure vacuum ranging from 0 17 atm to 1 atm in a cstr using sucrose at a concentration of 17 8 g l ph of 5 5 37 c and hrt of 12 h and reported hydrogen yields of 1 64 mol mol hexose for the control at 1 atm compared to 1 8 mol mol hexose at 0 17 atm other researchers have reported no or insignificant impact of vacuum on biohydrogen production which confirms that vacuum has no negative impact on fermentative bacteria clark et al 2012 3 5 impact of vacuum on specific methanogenic activity sma specific methanogenic activity tests were conducted using ampts for ads ic and cads with acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate to investigate the impact of vacuum on specific methanogenic activity cads was tested to distinguish between the effects of vacuum induced and chemical and the ph increase since the ph increased from 7 56 to 8 5 after 5 days of vacuum table s2 interestingly ph increased from 7 56 to 9 4 after one day of vacuum 4 h day at 45 c and 110 mbar but decreased to 8 5 on the fifth day the increase in ph on the first day could be attributed to ammonia and carbon dioxide stripping and the decrease in ph on subsequent days could be attributed to ammonia stripping as a result of consecutive vacuum application table s2 the experimental data and the gompertz model fits for sma tests are shown in fig 6 with kinetic data presented in table 5 the methane yields my per g cod acetate for ic cads and ads were 351 364 and 362 ml ch4 g cod respectively fig 6 additionally the 5d lag phase for the ic was much longer than the 0 1 d for ads and 3 d for cads the gompertz model predicted longer lag phases for ic and cads 11 2 d vs 5 d for the ic and 7 4 d vs 3 d for the cads msmprs of 25 3 19 7 and 31 3 ml ch4 g vss d were observed for ic cads and ads respectively table 5 the msmprs of ic and cads were 19 2 and 37 lower than the ads this could be due to the impact of vacuum in the case of ic or chemical addition to adjust ph up to 9 4 on day 1 for cads elbeshbishy et al 2010 reported that high ph inhibits and suppresses methanogens despite enriching fermentative bacteria as shown in table 5 although there is a 19 reduction in msmpr in ic compared to ads methane yields per g cod acetate were comparable 351 ml ch4 g cod acetate added or ic vs 362 ml ch4 g cod acetate added for ads other researchers have reported that vacuum can inactivate bacterial cell membranes due to dehydration however this could be repaired during subsequent incubation bucker et al 1972 horneck 1981 however the negative impact of vacuum on methanogens is likely to be mitigated in full scale systems by the long hrt and srt which typically exceed 5 days and the much higher biomass concentrations ensuing from the decoupling of srt from hrt further it is envisioned that full scale application of vacuum will be applied on the effluent digestate with recirculation of the residual concentrated biosolids back to the digester thus on a daily basis only a very small percentage of methanogens will be subjected to vacuum i e at an hrt of 15 days only 6 67 of the digester biomass although assessment of the ic for anaerobic digestion of biosolids was beyond the scope of this study preliminary biomethanation potential tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of short term vacuum application to primary sludge twas and ads the results depicted in figs s5 and s6 suggest minimal impact on the anaerobic biodegradability of ps and twas solids 3 6 microbial ecology analysis the microbial ecology analysis fig 7 revealed the relative abundance of prokaryotes phylum observed in the feed and fermentate samples results showed that excluding a minor population of archaea bacteria were the most abundant microorganisms observed in the feed s1 s3 and fermentate f1 f3 samples from the ic with an if of 2 00 total prokaryote concentrations in the feed and fermentate samples were 9 6 109 2 2 108 and 2 8 1010 2 3 109 amplified unit number au ml respectively indicating a 2 8 fold increase in the concentration of prokaryotes the shannon values of 5 52 and 4 97 on average for the feed and fermentate samples respectively confirmed their high α diversity which was consistent with similar studies of 5 5 6 4 chen et al 2019 and 4 5 6 5 wang et al 2016 chao1 indices of 564 14 and 438 34 for the feed and fermentate samples respectively were however lower than the chao1 values of 6000 10 000 reported for diverse samples taken from reactors treating municipal wastewater chen et al 2019 but higher than the 12 26 reported for dark co fermentation of 80 tequila vinasse and 20 nixtamalization wastewater garcía depraect et al 2019 and 18 40 in reclaimed wastewater irrigated soil li et al 2019 this indicates that a moderate diversity in the microbial community of the feed sludge was reduced during the vacuum fermentation process the lower microbial diversity of the fermentate relative to the feed sludge could be attributed to the lower survival of some communities such as gemmatimonadetes planctomycetes and spirochaetae during the vacuum fermentation process to investigate the diversity in microbial composition β diversity was assessed using the unweighted unifrac distance metric lozupone and knight 2005 a description of which is presented in the supplementary information the principal coordinates pco plot fig s7 shows maximum variation of 93 2 pc1 and 2 5 pc2 the dissimilarities between samples are represented by the distance between them where longer distances are indicative of higher dissimilarities between samples the pco plot exhibits minimum dissimilarities in prokaryote composition in feed samples samples were clustered at the negative side of the first pco with no marked difference depending on the days cycle of sampling on the contrary fermentate samples clustered to the opposite side of the plot exhibiting a positive correlation with the first pco and a diverse correlation with the second pco and marking a significant difference in from corresponding feed in addition higher dissimilarities were displayed among fermentate samples by dispersed samples in comparison with feed samples it has been shown that the phyla bacteroidetes proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant in the hydrolysis acidification reactors treating simulated starch based dyeing wastewater xie et al 2016 bacteroidetes and firmicutes are core microbiota of the human gut and are fermentative bacteria capable of degrading polysaccharides marx 2015 berman 2019 proteobacteria also belong to hydrogenogenic co oxidizers including phototrophs anaerobes facultative anaerobes fukuyama et al 2020 and sulfide oxidizers schmidt 2019 fermentative bacteria including firmicutes bacteriodetes protobacteria tenericutes and thermotogae formed 43 12 5 25 5 and 7 of the relative abundance of the prokaryotic genus in the fermentate thermotogae constituted 6 7 108 au ml relative abundance of 2 4 in the fermentate but was visibly absent in the feed this phylum comprise a group of extremely thermophilic rod shaped non spore forming heterotrophic bacteria conners et al 2006 with acetic acid carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas h2 as the main fermentation products huber et al 1986 van ooteghem et al 2002 tenericutes are gram stain negative bacteria without cell walls that metabolize propionic acid cibis et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 tenericutes affiliated bacteria are facultative thermophilic anaerobes produce acids under anaerobic conditions hence their proliferation may be linked to higher vfa yields li et al 2016 tenericutes constituted 4 8 108 au ml in the fermentate but were absent in the feed this indicates that the anaerobic process was at least partially facilitated by thermophilic fermentative bacteria 4 conclusions this study emphatically demonstrated the advantages of the vacuum enhanced fermentation technology with perfect decoupling of srt from hrt compared to conventional fermentation not only in terms of improved solubilization i e hydrolysis and acidification but also with respect to volumetric loadings and throughput the ic produced readily biodegradable organics that resulted in comparable denitrification rates to the best carbon source i e acetate long term tests showed that vacuum did not adversely impact the activity of fermenters and acetoclastic methanogens the following specific conclusions can be drawn compared to vfa yield for conventional fermentation of 61 mg δvfa g vss intensicarb increased vfa yields by 29 5 90 2 79 to 116 mg δvfa g vss and hydrolysis yields of 241 mg δscod g vss by 16 2 56 4 280 to 377 mg δscod g vss respectively the ic fermenter could effectively increase volumetric loading from 0 34 to 0 44 0 67 m3 sludge m3 fermenter d and solids loading from 4 2 to 5 4 10 1 kgvss m3 fermenter d vfa and hydrolysis yields increased linearly at higher intensification factors denitrification rates with ic fermentate were comparable to acetate despite comprising a mixture of acetate with other higher vfas and lower denitrification rates additionally the denitritation rate with the ic fermentate was superior to acetate which may be advantageous for partial nitrification systems vacuum did not exert any negative impact on acidogenic activity and fermenters both with respect to biohydrogen rates and yields maximum specific methane production rates in sma tests were 25 3 ml ch4 g vss d 19 7 ml ch4 g vss d and 31 3 ml ch4 g vss d while maximum specific hydrogen production rates from bhp tests were 75 3 69 3 and 76 9 ml h2 g vss h for ic cads and ads respectively although not explicitly discussed in this work the ability of the ic to strip ammonia by vacuum offers great advantages with respect to mitigation of ammonia inhibition in anaerobic digesters enabling higher loadings of municipal wastewater biosolids and also co digestion with protein rich food wastes ammonia stripping and separate recovery also reduces the need for sidestream treatment and mitigates struvite associated operational challenges in digesters to avert potential structural concerns associated with digesters operating under vacuum intensicarb can be applied external to anaerobic digesters for ammonia stripping and solids thickening prior to recicrculation to the digesters declaration of
