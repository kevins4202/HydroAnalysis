20130,floods affect a large fraction of the indian population during the monsoon june september every year floods disrupt all aspects of the socio economic conditions and cause enormous damage to infrastructure and agriculture human mortality and economic losses due to floods have increased in india during recent decades moreover floods are projected to occur more frequently in the future under the warming climate both structural and non structural measures are common in india to mitigate the detrimental impacts of floods however the challenges and opportunities for operational flood forecast systems in india have not been carefully evaluated here we review the current status and future requirements to strengthen the flood early warning systems in india india made tremendous progress in developing the ensemble prediction system for precipitation forecast precipitation forecast is available at various spatial and temporal resolutions which provides a skilful prediction of extreme precipitation at short 1 3 day and longer 15 20 day lead times however the spatial and temporal resolutions and lead time need to be improved for precipitation forecast in smaller catchments and urban areas which are prone to flash flooding there is a need to translate the ensemble weather and climate forecast to hydrologic ensemble prediction hep system through the integration of improved meteorological forecast hydrologic and hydraulic modelling data assimilation and post processing we also highlight the role of improved inflow forecast at the appropriate lead for reservoir operations as the decisions related to reservoir operations can be critical for flood management we finally discuss the need for an integrated approach at various levels to enhance the operational flood forecast in india which is essential for the development of an effective flood early warning system 1 introduction floods are one of the major climate related disasters in india which share more than half of the total natural disasters since the 1990s 111 the central water commission cwc of india reports reveal that india lost over a hundred thousand lives due to floods and resulted in a total economic loss of 4 69 trillion inr during the 1952 2018 period 89 a large part of the country has a considerable risk of floods which mostly occur during the summer monsoon season fig 1 about 14 of the land area of india is flood prone 59 135 and 16 of the flood prone area is affected every year with estimated annual flood damage of over 18 billion inr 27 the losses caused by floods are increasing 41 59 93 for instance the economic loss due to floods in 2018 was about 2 6 times that of 2017 89 among all the major floods since 1951 a substantially higher loss of human lives above 250 per event occurred in the 21st century em dat https public emdat be data table 1 there are both direct and indirect impacts of flooding which disproportionally affect the vulnerable sections of the society 1 31 70 111 161 messner meyer 92 argued that most of the flood damage indicators fail to incorporate indirect economic implications outside the flood impacted zones in the flood damage calculations flood damage outside the affected zones extends to disruptions in businesses and markets health impacts loss of wages impediments to welfare activities of governments and so on 70 93 111 145 155 consequently floods act as a counterforce to economic mobility 111 thus effective management of floods not only addresses the sustainable development goal sdg 13 which is related to climate action but it also aids in the implementation of sdgs 1 and 2 that are associated with combating poverty and hunger respectively 153 an efficient flood forecasting and early warning system enhance disaster preparedness in lines with the sendai framework on disaster risk reduction 154 climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation 4 56 100 109 157 and flooding 2 5 64 93 roxy et al 124 reported a three fold rise in extreme precipitation events over central india from 1951 to 2015 the warming climate is also projected to cause variability in the seasonal precipitation patterns 6 13 56 91 147 wasko et al 158 reported a reduction in the spatial area of extreme events with increased temperature in australian catchments also localized convective precipitation increases in the warming climate leading to a rise in extreme precipitation events in smaller catchments 19 further the urban heat island effect enhances convective precipitation which can potentially drive flash flooding in urban areas 76 urban areas have emerged as a major hotspot of flooding in india 43 108 176 many indian cities mumbai 2005 hyderabad 2000 2016 and 2020 chennai 2015 ahmedabad 2001 and 2017 delhi 2012 2009 and 2010 surat 2006 kolkata 2007 srinagar 2014 jaipur 2020 cochin in 2018 kerala floods experienced flooding during the recent decades structural measures which include the construction of levees flood control reservoirs and river training works are used to control flooding however there are numerous cases in which structural systems failed in preventing floods leading to catastrophic damages 82 119 for instance the kosi river breach in 2008 and embankment breach of the ganga river at farakka in 1998 caused major floods 59 90 133 137 which emphasizes the necessity of enhancing non structural measures for tackling floods in the last few decades non structural measures like zoning and regulations early warning systems and timely evacuation have captured global attention as an effective flood preparedness measure 80 81 96 moreover the interconnection of oceanic circulations to indian summer monsoon precipitation has been well established 84 95 126 129 the linkage between large scale climatic circulations and river discharge is widely studied globally 19 30 118 140 however efforts to examine the connections between large scale atmospheric oceanic circulation and floods in the indian river basins remain limited understanding the relationship between these circulations and high flows during the summer monsoon can be critical in improving flood forecasts at appropriate lead times a flood forecasting and warning system is a non structural intervention which is widely adopted in addressing the flood condition 160 however flood forecasting and early warning systems in india need to be updated based on the most advanced global practices 62 therefore setting up a reliable forecast and early warning system is inevitable to prevent human losses and economic disruptions the major prerequisites in developing a flood forecasting system are 1 accurate and high resolution weather forecasts 2 availability of accurate ground observations for data assimilation 3 due consideration to the hydrological and meteorological aspects of flooding 4 skilled personnel to interpret and issue timely warnings and 5 effective communication of warning signals to the most vulnerable sections of the population here we provide an overview of the existing flood warning system in india besides we identify the significant challenges and opportunities in developing an adequate flood forecasting infrastructure in the country first we discuss the precipitation forecast system in india then we highlight the limitations of the existing flood forecasting systems finally we provide insights into the areas that need enhancements to improve the flood warning systems in india 2 prediction of extreme precipitation in india extreme precipitation events have increased in most parts of india causing fluvial and pluvial floods fig 2 india meteorological department imd and national centre for medium range weather forecast ncmwrf issue weather forecast in india imd provides short term medium term and extended range precipitation forecasts 79 precipitation forecast from imd is developed using two numerical weather prediction nwp models global forecast system gfs at 12 km resolution and extended range forecast system erfs at 1 degree resolution apart from these weather forecast at high spatial resolution 3 4 km is developed by ncmwrf we estimated the skill of gfs in predicting the three major recent floods uttarakhand 2013 gujarat 2016 and kerala 2018 at 1 3 days lead time fig 3 notwithstanding that the gfs precipitation forecast has an uncertainty associated with the location of the storm centres extreme precipitation was successfully captured at 1 3 day lead we note that the precipitation forecast accuracy decreases with an increase in the lead time further improvements in the precipitation forecast system are required for accurate flood estimation sridevi et al 139 found the gfs forecasts to be skilful in predicting the 2015 monsoon but they found considerable fluctuations in the location and magnitude of prediction of extreme precipitation similar issues with the extreme precipitation forecast were also observed in the deterministic nwp model 125 also sridevi et al 139 highlighted the need for improvements in precipitation forecast in the high elevation areas the erfs reasonably captures the intra seasonal variations active break spells withdrawal and onset of the summer monsoon from 2009 to 2018 113 recently tiwari et al 151 reported that the bias correction of precipitation forecast at 1 3 day lead time significantly improves the accuracy however the forecast skill for extreme precipitation and its utility for flood forecast in india needs to be carefully examined in the different parts of the country especially in the regions that are frequently affected by floods imd adopted the ensemble prediction system eps on 1 june 2018 for weather forecast up to 10 days lead 113 148 an eps comprises a single or multiple numerical weather prediction nwp model s eps has evolved globally as an attempt to quantify uncertainties in the prediction due to the errors in model initial conditions a possible best estimate of model initial conditions is used in a deterministic nwp model and the forecast based on it is called a control model forecast 78 117 in the eps the initial conditions of control model forecasts are perturbed using different statistical approaches like monte carlo simulations to produce various ensembles 33 50 the occurrence of a particular event can be represented in terms of probability through an ensemble forecast an ensemble forecast thus provides a probabilistic forecast in terms of a probability distribution function of the estimate instead of a point estimate 10 thus an ensemble prediction describes the uncertainty while a single model driven deterministic forecast fails to represent the uncertainty 33 42 50 141 ncmrwf develops precipitation forecast based on its nwp models it provides a 4 km precipitation forecast at three days lead and a 12 km forecast at ten days lead over the indian region https www ncmrwf gov in in addition to the deterministic nwp models ncmrwf also produces global ncmwrf global ensemble prediction system neps g and regional ensemble forecasts ncmwrf regional ensemble prediction system neps r at three days lead 116 both neps g and neps r are produced in partnership with the unified model um the former operates at 12 km resolution and has 11 ensemble members while the latter operates at 4 km spatial resolution ncmrwf also provides severe weather forecasts at five day lead and generates five day ensemble precipitation forecasts for each district in india 2 1 limitations and opportunities in precipitation forecast in india although india has advanced its precipitation forecast systems by embracing ensemble prediction certain areas need further enhancements precipitation forecast needs improvements in spatial and temporal resolutions accurate forecast of intensity storm location lead time and frequency 36 50 166 fine resolution forecasts are required in addressing local scale processes like convection that drive flash flooding 22 36 55 166 171 similarly sub daily and hourly precipitation forecast is required to develop flood warning systems in smaller river basins and urban areas 58 60 131 flash flooding is driven by intense rainfall occurring in comparatively small river basins area 100 km2 with a time of concentration of less than six hours 8 73 136 the meteorological and hydrological drivers of flash floods are different from the river basin scale flooding 22 60 73 in addition the significant sources of uncertainty in flash flood forecasting are due to inaccuracies in precipitation forecasts 60 130 an accurate prediction of extreme precipitation at the desired spatial and temporal resolutions is required 8 123 also sufficient lead time which is greater than the time of concentration of the catchment and precise location is required for flash flood forecasting 166 urban flooding is a particular case of flash flooding relatively small catchment area and shorter time of concentration in the range of a few minutes to hours are the distinctive features of floods in urban areas 21 58 131 imd provides quantitative precipitation forecast qpf for major cities which is available on the customized rainfall information system cris website however it gives only daily precipitation forecast with up to three days lead in addition the existing automated rain gauges only collect hourly rainfall data for managing urban flooding we need precipitation observations every five minutes 21 58 along with the precipitation forecast at higher spatial and temporal resolutions at sufficient lead time there is also unavailability of the intensity duration and frequency idf curves of different cities at daily to sub daily time scales 58 hapuarachchi et al 60 reported that existing models are not capable of providing reliable flash flood forecast in urban watersheds ghosh et al 54 developed india s first integrated urban flood forecast system for chennai the proposed framework integrates several components including regional weather forecast tide and storm surge modelling monitoring of rainfall and flows upstream hydrological modelling and urban flood modelling 54 however the weather forecast which is probably one of the most important components of the system needs to be improved for spatial and temporal resolutions as well as the lead time the available rain gauge network density cannot usually capture the causative intense precipitation at localized scales 120 rain gauges provide the most accurate information which is essential for the evaluation of gridded precipitation products 47 115 152 uncertainty in precipitation estimates due to rain gauge density is the highest in north india while the lowest in central india 115 therefore there is a critical need to evaluate the density of rain gauge stations in the flood affected regions which is important for the correction of observed and predicted precipitation 72 besides there are significant lapses in the installation of precipitation gauges and telemetric stations in india 27 for instance the doppler weather radar measurement which is based on cloud reflectivity can provide quantitative precipitation estimation qpe of a large area with 3 days lead time in place of point estimates provided by rain gauges 131 171 https moes gov in programmes commissioning polarimetric doppler weather radars dwrs however imd has only 35 s band radars while india requires 80 100 radars to cover the whole territory 62 https ddgmui imd gov in radar newradarstatuslivereport1 php radar observations with high spatial and temporal resolution can be used to develop precipitation nowcasts which is essential for urban and flash flood prediction 55 109 120 131 169 170 radar observations are also used for data assimilation to improve the performance of flood forecast systems 123 however the radar measurements require correction of instrumental errors and uncertainty that can arise due to complex atmospheric processes 53 83 85 169 recently yang et al 169 introduced a long short term memory lstm network based method to improve radar based precipitation estimates also the 2017 comptroller and auditor general cag report on the schemes of flood control and forecasting has found inadequate flood preparation non establishment of telemetry and flood forecasting stations as per the xii five year plan document and non usage of the existing telemetry data in the formulation of flood forecast 27 overall both observations and forecast of precipitation need enhancements for their utility in the development of flood early warning systems 3 flood forecast system in india the cwc under the ministry of jal shakti is the nodal agency that performs flood forecasting in india they maintain a network of observation stations across major rivers and their tributaries and issue flood warning at 324 stations which includes 196 water level forecasts and 128 reservoir inflow forecasts 40 currently they employ deterministic flood forecasting based on observations of precipitation and streamflow the cwc uses statistical methods such as i gauge to gauge correlation ii gauge discharge relations iii multiple coaxial correlations using the gauge precipitation and antecedent precipitation index api data for flood forecasting 40 148 they cwc also use rainfall runoff modelling by combining both hydrologic and hydraulic modelling tools the cwc issues daily flood forecast with 24 36 h lead for major rivers besides twice a day forecast with 12 to 24 h lead is issued for medium rivers while multiple daily forecasts with a lead time of fewer than 12 h are issued for flashy river basins with a shorter time of concentration 148 using the unit hydrograph method and correlational curves they generate 6 24 h short range forecast at divisional sub divisional levels and medium range forecasts for 72 h are formulated at headquarters 40 overall forecast accuracy of the existing flood forecasting system is 97 wherein the forecasts were correct within a threshold of 15 cm and 20 of the discharge value 39 3 1 limitation of the current flood prediction in india the cwc in 2017 began to provide flood forecasting with 3 days lead using mathematical modelling tools on a trial basis 40 notwithstanding the high accuracy in the flood forecast developed by cwc there are several sources of uncertainty for instance errors and uncertainty in the weather forecast can translate to flood forecast 152 moreover the flood forecast accuracy can be considerably lower in the smaller and fast responding catchments that often witness flash flooding the flood forecast methodology used by cwc is deterministic and there is a lack of quantification of uncertainty the cwc has not yet established ensemble flood forecasting methods by taking advantage of the advances in the ensemble weather forecast system in india 62 an ensemble flood forecasting system could provide predictions with sufficient lead times and by incorporating model uncertainties 33 50 78 therefore there is a need to develop an ensemble flood forecast system in india which can help stakeholders in decision making indian river basins are considerably affected by water storage and diversion the presence of dams and reservoirs in the river basins influence the natural variability of streamflow 17 45 the reservoir operations can also affect the timing and magnitude of floods in the downstream areas 94 102 therefore an important aspect that needs consideration in the flood mitigation efforts is the presence of reservoirs across the river basins in india faulty dam operations can exacerbate flooding 71 112 for instance reservoir operations played a crucial role in enhancing the 2018 kerala floods 67 94 the main focus of reservoir operation is on water conservation for the dry season thus establishing a trade off between the contrasting roles of reservoirs is a major challenge in flood mitigation 143 there are about 5745 large dams in india 38 however cwc provides inflow information only at 128 stations 40 a reliable inflow and weather forecast is required in making timely release decisions to reduce the role of reservoirs on flooding especially in the case of reservoirs designed for water conservation purposes 102 narasimhan et al 102 in their assessment of the 2015 chennai floods observed that inaccuracies in the inflow forecast derail proper dam operations sudheer et al 143 also highlighted the role of extended and reliable extreme precipitation forecasts coupled with inflow forecasts for proper reservoir operations most of the large dams rely on rule curves for dam operations which are made under the guidelines of the dam safety organization dso 96 nevertheless the rule curves of dams are not updated based on changes in inflow carrying capacity of the downstream river channel land use changes and so on moreover a shift from rule curves to dynamic operating curves is required as adopted globally 63 75 101 the non availability of data regarding the operations of dams in the public domain is another concern 106 which refrains the informed participation of various stakeholders in the decision making process in india dam authority in the respective states is the nodal agency in determining the dam operation policy however there are several interstate rivers which make the reservoirs in a single basin under the control of different authorities hence there is a lack of coordination in reservoir operations we need to consider all the reservoirs in a basin as a single entity and has to formulate policies for multi reservoir operations there are numerous examples of various multi reservoir optimization schemes helping in flood mitigation 14 105 159 for instance the storage capacity of downstream reservoirs could be augmented by reducing the outflow from the upstream reservoirs 174 also information on the potential inflow volumes helps in better decision making for the downstream reservoir operation during flood events the proper management of reservoirs during extreme events could reduce and delay flood peaks 9 3 2 opportunities to enhance the flood forecast in india inflow forecast with sufficient lead time for reservoirs is essential for flood control operations in india uncertainties in inflow forecasting are the primary cause of the failure of proper reservoir operations 167 the probabilistic estimation of reservoir inflows would provide an accurate estimation of uncertainty which can help in decisions associated with reservoir operations yan et al 167 proposed a method to estimate uncertainty in inflow forecasts and used the error distribution to decide flood control operations similarly zhou guo 175 reported the use of a seasonal flood limited water level flwl during the flood season instead of a constant flwl to maximize the use of floodwater without reducing the flood control potential of the dam there have been several data science approaches proposed for simulating reservoir inflows 7 12 49 however the use of these methods is limited by the lack of long term observations the reservoirs with long term inflow observations can use the data driven approaches for inflow forecasting for the reservoirs moreover many reservoirs in india during the monsoon season operate based on the meteorological forecast which may not be appropriate therefore there is a need to develop a long lead inflow forecast based on an ensemble prediction system for reservoir operations in india the application of fine resolution nwp models along with ensemble radar nowcasts at 0 3 hr lead time could be used for flash flood forecasts in the smaller but flood prone catchments 74 there have been several attempts on flash flood forecasting based on rainfall and discharge comparison lumped and distributed hydrological models data science and statistical approaches in the united states us flash food guidance system ffg which is a comparison between threshold precipitation and forecasted precipitation is used for issuing flash flood warnings since the 1970s 32 57 60 130 hardy et al 61 introduced a probabilistic flash flood forecasting system using an ensemble of qpfs with due consideration to the location uncertainty in the qpf precipitation forecasts a probabilistic forecast system can address the uncertainties associated with hydrologic and hydraulic systems in flash flood forecasts 107 a multilevel approach to estimate flash flood risk is proposed in the yunnan province of china using a cascading flash flood guidance system 173 silvestro et al 134 developed an impact based assessment of flash flood forecast that considers the economic and population impacts in addition to discharge and inundation forecasts neural networks recurrent neural network rnn and lstm networks are widely used for flash flood forecasting 87 98 however as in the case of inflow forecasts the shortage of long term streamflow record hinders the use of data driven approaches overall we need to integrate different frameworks data driven and process based models to develop an effective flash flood forecast system in india the urban flood forecast system in india needs enhancements due to rising incidents of urban flooding under the warming climate urban pluvial flooding in india is accentuated due to clogged and insufficient capacity of stormwater drainage 23 58 66 however most of the urban flooding models shy away from modelling stormwater systems 23 moreover india s flood prone urban cities lie along the coastal plains and hence the risk of storm surges adds to the vulnerability of the coastal cities 43 for instance urban areas of surat mumbai and kolkata have experienced flooding due to extreme precipitation and high tides 43 112 121 an urban flood forecast system in india needs to address these challenges ghosh et al 54 used high resolution light detection and ranging lidar terrain data for the hydrologic and hydraulic modelling of chennai city in india taking into account both storm surges and extreme precipitation events previous studies have used varied methods like combining multiple radar forecasts 104 and incorporating nwp outputs with qpes from radars 88 172 for improving precipitation forecasts a probabilistic forecast of urban flooding by integrating qpes with real time hydrological and hydraulic modelling is proposed by brendel et al 23 they brendel et al also developed a real time application that estimates the risk to existing infrastructure like sewers in the time of flooding dhiman et al 43 examined the flood risk and adaptation strategies in the four major flood prone coastal cities in india they observed the success of community based flood mitigation measures in reducing the flood impacts coupling ensemble precipitation forecast with the rainfall runoff model is the best available practice in flood forecasting 50 61 141 using eps for flood forecasting is referred to globally as hydrologic ensemble prediction hep the basic schematic of hep and the causes of uncertainties are represented in fig 4 hep has been used since the early 2000s across the world 3 51 149 165 similar to an ensemble weather prediction system hep can incorporate uncertainty in flood forecasts 35 uncertainty is added to the flood forecasts from initial conditions model parameters and systemic errors of the nwp models and the hydrologic models 33 35 an increase in the ensemble numbers and model diversity increases the forecast skills 34 wu et al 166 in a comprehensive review on ensemble flood forecast systems summarized the challenges and opportunities in adopting the hep system for flood forecasting and management they suggested focusing on 1 improving data quality and availability 2 addressing different category of flood events 3 extending flood forecast variables from streamflow forecast to water level inundation depth and flow velocity forecasts 3 increasing forecast lead time and 4 increasing ensemble generation and model evaluation methods all the suggestions are relevant for the enhancement of flood warning systems in india india employs different systems for the data collection of conventional observations 37 99 inconsistencies sparse station locations lack of free access to observations and unavailability of metadata hamper the advancements in the flood forecast and early warning systems the lack of metadata on the methodologies of recording instruments used for measurement and the lack of clarity in the primary variables recorded make it almost impossible to estimate uncertainty in observations 166 reliable ground observations are inevitable for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models data assimilation and the calibration of remote sensing observations 44 156 166 increasing the density of ground based observation stations ensuring timely recording and the availability of flow and reservoir storage can help us in improving flood forecasting infrastructure 142 satellite observations of precipitation reservoir storage and streamflow can fill the gaps in the sparsely covered areas 3 55 164 the progress in satellite remote sensing in india provides remotely sensed data for accurate topographic depiction measurement of soil moisture assessment of vegetation parameters and land use classification which are required for flood modelling at finer resolutions 130 150 163 168 an accurate terrain model is required for setting up hydrodynamic models for inundation depth forecasts 29 127 the advances in satellite remote sensing are employed in nwp via data assimilation 103 we need to extend the use of these resources for hydrologic and hydraulic modelling on operational scales the major impediments in the implementation of hep are a lack of skilled personnel 62 technological improvements reliable data and computational power fig 5 the existing technological capabilities should be enhanced for the implementation of the hep system in india there are however major caveats in adopting the hep system for flood forecasting such as 1 the representation of uncertainty 2 forecast verification and 3 challenges in the interpretation and communication of hep forecasts at flood dissemination centres 42 50 therefore there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation of the cascading of uncertainties in the streamflow forecast in india in most of the previous studies 11 55 69 the uncertainty in streamflow predictions fig 4 is quantified in terms of the uncertainty in the representation of initial conditions of the nwp models 86 the uncertainty due to the hydrological model structure parametrization and systemic errors of the nwp models is often neglected 33 incorporating data assimilation in the streamflow forecasts could potentially narrow the uncertainty in streamflow predictions 50 there are also attempts in calibrating the forecast system using the observations 65 grand ensemble techniques get use multiple nwp models instead of a single nwp used in ensemble precipitation forecasts the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge thorpex is a wmo organization that aims at improving forecast accuracy up to 14 days lead time was launched in march 2005 by the world meteorological organization wmo 26 110 which is an attempt to incorporate multiple model ensemble to improve numerical weather prediction moreover incorporating model parameter and systematic uncertainties in addition to the uncertainties produced by the choice of initial conditions can be helpful in the streamflow forecast 26 emerton et al 50 reported that the relative importance of uncertainty in flow prediction depends on the lead time of the forecast system catchment characteristics model resolution and magnitude of the event uncertainty can also arise in the process of downscaling and bias correction of precipitation used in the hydrologic model and data assimilation adopted for correcting the precipitation and streamflow forecasts the hydrologic ensemble prediction experiments hepex project intend to incorporate uncertainties that develop in various stages in the hep system and also works towards developing forecast verification 128 https hepex inrae fr verification of streamflow forecast is an essential component of the flood early warning system usually predictions are verified comparing it with discharge observations 149 however in ungauged stations it is challenging to implement donnelly et al 46 developed a model that captures the spatial variability of flow by correlating the physiographic characteristics to the flow generation mechanisms and found them to be useful in testing ungauged stations in addition to the accuracy of prediction of the peak discharges 149 the sufficiency of the lead time is also assessed in several hep systems 20 http www bom gov au water 7daystreamflow 138 www smhi se the hydrologic ensemble forecast system of the united states us uses ensemble verification system evs which assess the bias skill and lead time of the ensemble forecasts 24 another crucial area is the forecast communication to the public though hep systems are used since the 2000s the interpretation and use of the forecast by the operational flood forecasting agencies are not encouraging 42 the ensemble prediction system transfers the responsibility of decision making from the forecast agencies to the end users demeritt et al 42 reported improper understanding and interpretations of the ensemble forecasts by the forecast agencies most of the operational forecasters rely more on deterministic forecasts and use the ensemble forecasts to support the decision making stephens cloke 141 has noted the following measures to improve the use of hep 1 providing training to improve the interpretation of the probabilistic prediction and 2 shifting from the discharge threshold or water level predictions to quantify flood damage impact which would be more relatable to the end user 4 development of a flood early warning system in india we need to adopt a bottom up approach to address the complex flood challenge in india the flood drivers are different for different river basins 15 16 18 146 therefore a comprehensive study on the identification of major drivers of floods in the indian river basin is required to further enhance the flood early warning system in india we need a hierarchical system with cwc as the nodal agency catchment scale forecast centres cfc and sub catchment scale regional forecast centres rfc to tackle the recurring flood situation in india fig 6 since major river basins extend beyond the state boundaries cooperation among states is also vital at the bottom level of the hierarchy specialized forecast centres for urban and flash flood prone catchments in addition to sub catchment scale rfcs can address the catchment specific characteristics that may influence flood occurrence also a special centre may control and coordinate the activities of urban and flash flood prone catchments policies for the management and proper execution of the flood early warning system at different levels need to be strengthened cwc being the nodal agency can lead the efforts to develop hydrologic ensemble prediction hep system for flood forecast ensemble precipitation forecast is available at 4 km resolution which can be used for developing hep for the entire country furthermore radar qpes or probabilistic nowcasts can be incorporated with the ensemble precipitation forecasts to improve precipitation forecasts guidelines need to be re evaluated for the optimal operation of the reservoirs moreover data transparency and data sharing related to the reservoir operations need to be strengthened in addition steps for proper flood plain zoning and mapping across india are required to reduce flood damages the cfcs could coordinate flood forecasting activities within a catchment they could also aid in establishing transparency in the operations of inter state dams within a catchment cfcs may formulate multi reservoir operational policies and incorporate the catchment specific characteristics and reservoir operations in the hydrological and hydraulic modelling the probabilistic streamflow forecasts generated at the cwc can be used by the cfcs to generate inundation depths and accurate inflow forecasts for the reservoirs also they can coordinate rfcs in urban and flash flood prone catchments the rfcs may further augment the hep by increasing the temporal and spatial resolution by incorporating specific catchment information in the flash flood prone catchments accurate terrain data need to be developed using lidar further efforts are required to establish state of the art methodologies that can improve flood forecast for urban areas and fast responding catchments rfcs need to be established to take the responsibility of disseminating flood warning to the community furthermore the involvement of all the stakeholders people public and private agencies in the forecast dissemination is essential data transparency and the communication of probabilistic risk on time to all the stakeholders will improve the public trust in the flood forecasting system issuing flood warning by the proper interpretation of the forecasts and comparison with the precipitation or flow thresholds is essential there are important examples of community based flood early warning systems cbfews that have successfully aided in the dissemination of timely information on impending floods in the districts of assam in india and also across the indo nepal border 144 involving community participation in the forecast dissemination aids in impact reduction adequate training and capacity building is required for resilient flood warning infrastructure harsha 62 reported the lack of a technically capable workforce as the major impediment in the implementation of the ensemble flood forecasting system in india furthermore a technically sound forecast system will not be sufficient without proper penetration of the warning 25 there are cases wherein the lack of sufficient communication failed to garner proactive responses 48 77 132 162 the emergency communication channels need to be strengthened to ensure that early warnings travel the last mile to reach the most vulnerable population at the remotest location moreover a proper system should be designed and tested for swift response to reduce flood damages perera et al 114 conducted a comprehensive review of the non technical aspects of flood early warning system and have compiled a list of challenges in emergency communication they perera et al reiterate the need for standardization increasing the credibility and timely penetration of warning signals tailoring the dissemination according to the needs of the population strengthening the communication channels by incorporating civil society organizations csos and building local communication pathways peculiar to each community though the main goal of emergency response is to avoid human losses it is also found to reduce economic losses and damages 77 97 the flood damage in developed nations has been substantially reduced through emergency communication and response on the other hand flood damages are increasing in developing nations due to inefficient early warning systems along with the rising frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events therefore there is an urgent need for developing regional strategies for forecast dissemination 132 the initial response of a population to the warning signal is to confirm the warning and to organize the response action 77 this time can be reduced by increasing the public trust in the dissemination agency increasing the lead time by bolstering the emergency channels and setting up a resilient system to facilitate evacuation india can easily harness the local self government agencies for effective communication and response by providing adequate training and capacity building incorporation of csos non governmental organizations ngos and ensuring community participation can significantly improve the effectiveness of flood early warnings in addition conducting mock drills prior to the summer monsoon season among the frequently affected population could help in evaluating the response action which would help in understanding the issues and enhancing the coordination among various departmental agencies and stakeholders 52 5 discussion and conclusions the annual occurrence of floods during the monsoon season june september is an unavoidable phenomenon in india however the damage caused by floods could be reduced by strengthening our disaster preparedness infrastructure the flood forecasting and warning system is a major non structural intervention that can effectively aid in flood preparedness and response 28 59 96 india has achieved great progress in the precipitation forecast however the same has not reflected in the flood forecast 113 139 there are numerous challenges in enhancing the existing flood forecast system in india for instance the dearth of sufficient data insufficient use of available data in flood forecasting applications lack of regional flood forecasting stations improper monitoring and lack of trained manpower play an essential role in the ineffectiveness of the flood warning systems 27 we list the significant challenges and ways to overcome those as 1 there is a need for a proper framework and consistency in recording precipitation and discharge data consistent observations at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions are necessary for understanding the characteristics of extreme events assessing uncertainties in observations correcting satellite observations and improving forecasts via data assimilation 2 dams can be effectively used for flood mitigation however improper dam operations exacerbate flooding in india 94 106 112 143 we need to establish sufficient inflow forecast infrastructure commensurate to the number of dams in the country besides we need to evolve a comprehensive approach for inter state rivers in managing the dam operations in the case of reservoir operations an urgent shift from the existing rule curve method to dynamic operational curves with due focus on flood mitigation is required 3 there is a need to develop an ensemble flood prediction system which is considered the most effective system in flood forecasting globally 33 50 141 the cwc needs to revamp the guidelines for flood forecasting and can lead the efforts to develop and enhance the ensemble forecast system taking advantage of the existing ensemble precipitation forecast systems 4 even though indian terrain is highly prone to flash floods 136 there have been only a few attempts at studying the flash flood susceptibility of indian catchments while dedicated flash flood forecast systems exist globally since the early 21st century 60 122 urban areas in india are exposed to the double risk of coastal flooding and flash flooding driven by extreme precipitation events however apart from precipitation forecasts serious attempts at setting up an operational flood forecasting system are lacking for the majority of the flood prone cities 5 there have not been sufficient studies in india that look into the flood generation and propagation aspects in a catchment with a regional outlook the importance of incorporating the regional dimensions in the flood forecasting infrastructure is recognized globally 146 the flood forecasting system developed for chennai that considers the specific flood risk of the terrain is among the few attempts in this direction 54 6 india needs a proper framework for establishing a comprehensive flood forecast and warning system we need a structural hierarchy with the cwc as the nodal agency forecast centres at the catchment and the sub basin levels with a specialized focus on the flash flood prone catchments and urban areas 7 there should be a strong emphasis on the last mile communication of flood risk to the most vulnerable population at sufficient lead time the governmental and non governmental agencies should be trained to work in coordination and to understand the uncertainties in the flood forecast communications further mock drills can be conducted among the frequently affected population to increase flood preparedness and to evaluate the strength of communication channels and swiftness of flood response every year thousands of people lose their lives while millions are rendered homeless in india due to floods jameel et al 68 in a letter to science has advocated for a new flood policy citing the recurring floods and increasing damages in the states of bihar and assam they jameel et al reported that india needs to overlook the structural flood control measures which fail annually setting up flood early warning infrastructure would be costly however it will override its cost by the benefits the nation could accrue in the long run india spent more money on post flood recovery than investing in pre flood mitigation schemes 96 an efficient flood early warning system could not only reduce the extensive damages caused during the flood season but also aid in reducing economic inequality and vulnerability of a more extensive section of the population

20130,floods affect a large fraction of the indian population during the monsoon june september every year floods disrupt all aspects of the socio economic conditions and cause enormous damage to infrastructure and agriculture human mortality and economic losses due to floods have increased in india during recent decades moreover floods are projected to occur more frequently in the future under the warming climate both structural and non structural measures are common in india to mitigate the detrimental impacts of floods however the challenges and opportunities for operational flood forecast systems in india have not been carefully evaluated here we review the current status and future requirements to strengthen the flood early warning systems in india india made tremendous progress in developing the ensemble prediction system for precipitation forecast precipitation forecast is available at various spatial and temporal resolutions which provides a skilful prediction of extreme precipitation at short 1 3 day and longer 15 20 day lead times however the spatial and temporal resolutions and lead time need to be improved for precipitation forecast in smaller catchments and urban areas which are prone to flash flooding there is a need to translate the ensemble weather and climate forecast to hydrologic ensemble prediction hep system through the integration of improved meteorological forecast hydrologic and hydraulic modelling data assimilation and post processing we also highlight the role of improved inflow forecast at the appropriate lead for reservoir operations as the decisions related to reservoir operations can be critical for flood management we finally discuss the need for an integrated approach at various levels to enhance the operational flood forecast in india which is essential for the development of an effective flood early warning system 1 introduction floods are one of the major climate related disasters in india which share more than half of the total natural disasters since the 1990s 111 the central water commission cwc of india reports reveal that india lost over a hundred thousand lives due to floods and resulted in a total economic loss of 4 69 trillion inr during the 1952 2018 period 89 a large part of the country has a considerable risk of floods which mostly occur during the summer monsoon season fig 1 about 14 of the land area of india is flood prone 59 135 and 16 of the flood prone area is affected every year with estimated annual flood damage of over 18 billion inr 27 the losses caused by floods are increasing 41 59 93 for instance the economic loss due to floods in 2018 was about 2 6 times that of 2017 89 among all the major floods since 1951 a substantially higher loss of human lives above 250 per event occurred in the 21st century em dat https public emdat be data table 1 there are both direct and indirect impacts of flooding which disproportionally affect the vulnerable sections of the society 1 31 70 111 161 messner meyer 92 argued that most of the flood damage indicators fail to incorporate indirect economic implications outside the flood impacted zones in the flood damage calculations flood damage outside the affected zones extends to disruptions in businesses and markets health impacts loss of wages impediments to welfare activities of governments and so on 70 93 111 145 155 consequently floods act as a counterforce to economic mobility 111 thus effective management of floods not only addresses the sustainable development goal sdg 13 which is related to climate action but it also aids in the implementation of sdgs 1 and 2 that are associated with combating poverty and hunger respectively 153 an efficient flood forecasting and early warning system enhance disaster preparedness in lines with the sendai framework on disaster risk reduction 154 climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation 4 56 100 109 157 and flooding 2 5 64 93 roxy et al 124 reported a three fold rise in extreme precipitation events over central india from 1951 to 2015 the warming climate is also projected to cause variability in the seasonal precipitation patterns 6 13 56 91 147 wasko et al 158 reported a reduction in the spatial area of extreme events with increased temperature in australian catchments also localized convective precipitation increases in the warming climate leading to a rise in extreme precipitation events in smaller catchments 19 further the urban heat island effect enhances convective precipitation which can potentially drive flash flooding in urban areas 76 urban areas have emerged as a major hotspot of flooding in india 43 108 176 many indian cities mumbai 2005 hyderabad 2000 2016 and 2020 chennai 2015 ahmedabad 2001 and 2017 delhi 2012 2009 and 2010 surat 2006 kolkata 2007 srinagar 2014 jaipur 2020 cochin in 2018 kerala floods experienced flooding during the recent decades structural measures which include the construction of levees flood control reservoirs and river training works are used to control flooding however there are numerous cases in which structural systems failed in preventing floods leading to catastrophic damages 82 119 for instance the kosi river breach in 2008 and embankment breach of the ganga river at farakka in 1998 caused major floods 59 90 133 137 which emphasizes the necessity of enhancing non structural measures for tackling floods in the last few decades non structural measures like zoning and regulations early warning systems and timely evacuation have captured global attention as an effective flood preparedness measure 80 81 96 moreover the interconnection of oceanic circulations to indian summer monsoon precipitation has been well established 84 95 126 129 the linkage between large scale climatic circulations and river discharge is widely studied globally 19 30 118 140 however efforts to examine the connections between large scale atmospheric oceanic circulation and floods in the indian river basins remain limited understanding the relationship between these circulations and high flows during the summer monsoon can be critical in improving flood forecasts at appropriate lead times a flood forecasting and warning system is a non structural intervention which is widely adopted in addressing the flood condition 160 however flood forecasting and early warning systems in india need to be updated based on the most advanced global practices 62 therefore setting up a reliable forecast and early warning system is inevitable to prevent human losses and economic disruptions the major prerequisites in developing a flood forecasting system are 1 accurate and high resolution weather forecasts 2 availability of accurate ground observations for data assimilation 3 due consideration to the hydrological and meteorological aspects of flooding 4 skilled personnel to interpret and issue timely warnings and 5 effective communication of warning signals to the most vulnerable sections of the population here we provide an overview of the existing flood warning system in india besides we identify the significant challenges and opportunities in developing an adequate flood forecasting infrastructure in the country first we discuss the precipitation forecast system in india then we highlight the limitations of the existing flood forecasting systems finally we provide insights into the areas that need enhancements to improve the flood warning systems in india 2 prediction of extreme precipitation in india extreme precipitation events have increased in most parts of india causing fluvial and pluvial floods fig 2 india meteorological department imd and national centre for medium range weather forecast ncmwrf issue weather forecast in india imd provides short term medium term and extended range precipitation forecasts 79 precipitation forecast from imd is developed using two numerical weather prediction nwp models global forecast system gfs at 12 km resolution and extended range forecast system erfs at 1 degree resolution apart from these weather forecast at high spatial resolution 3 4 km is developed by ncmwrf we estimated the skill of gfs in predicting the three major recent floods uttarakhand 2013 gujarat 2016 and kerala 2018 at 1 3 days lead time fig 3 notwithstanding that the gfs precipitation forecast has an uncertainty associated with the location of the storm centres extreme precipitation was successfully captured at 1 3 day lead we note that the precipitation forecast accuracy decreases with an increase in the lead time further improvements in the precipitation forecast system are required for accurate flood estimation sridevi et al 139 found the gfs forecasts to be skilful in predicting the 2015 monsoon but they found considerable fluctuations in the location and magnitude of prediction of extreme precipitation similar issues with the extreme precipitation forecast were also observed in the deterministic nwp model 125 also sridevi et al 139 highlighted the need for improvements in precipitation forecast in the high elevation areas the erfs reasonably captures the intra seasonal variations active break spells withdrawal and onset of the summer monsoon from 2009 to 2018 113 recently tiwari et al 151 reported that the bias correction of precipitation forecast at 1 3 day lead time significantly improves the accuracy however the forecast skill for extreme precipitation and its utility for flood forecast in india needs to be carefully examined in the different parts of the country especially in the regions that are frequently affected by floods imd adopted the ensemble prediction system eps on 1 june 2018 for weather forecast up to 10 days lead 113 148 an eps comprises a single or multiple numerical weather prediction nwp model s eps has evolved globally as an attempt to quantify uncertainties in the prediction due to the errors in model initial conditions a possible best estimate of model initial conditions is used in a deterministic nwp model and the forecast based on it is called a control model forecast 78 117 in the eps the initial conditions of control model forecasts are perturbed using different statistical approaches like monte carlo simulations to produce various ensembles 33 50 the occurrence of a particular event can be represented in terms of probability through an ensemble forecast an ensemble forecast thus provides a probabilistic forecast in terms of a probability distribution function of the estimate instead of a point estimate 10 thus an ensemble prediction describes the uncertainty while a single model driven deterministic forecast fails to represent the uncertainty 33 42 50 141 ncmrwf develops precipitation forecast based on its nwp models it provides a 4 km precipitation forecast at three days lead and a 12 km forecast at ten days lead over the indian region https www ncmrwf gov in in addition to the deterministic nwp models ncmrwf also produces global ncmwrf global ensemble prediction system neps g and regional ensemble forecasts ncmwrf regional ensemble prediction system neps r at three days lead 116 both neps g and neps r are produced in partnership with the unified model um the former operates at 12 km resolution and has 11 ensemble members while the latter operates at 4 km spatial resolution ncmrwf also provides severe weather forecasts at five day lead and generates five day ensemble precipitation forecasts for each district in india 2 1 limitations and opportunities in precipitation forecast in india although india has advanced its precipitation forecast systems by embracing ensemble prediction certain areas need further enhancements precipitation forecast needs improvements in spatial and temporal resolutions accurate forecast of intensity storm location lead time and frequency 36 50 166 fine resolution forecasts are required in addressing local scale processes like convection that drive flash flooding 22 36 55 166 171 similarly sub daily and hourly precipitation forecast is required to develop flood warning systems in smaller river basins and urban areas 58 60 131 flash flooding is driven by intense rainfall occurring in comparatively small river basins area 100 km2 with a time of concentration of less than six hours 8 73 136 the meteorological and hydrological drivers of flash floods are different from the river basin scale flooding 22 60 73 in addition the significant sources of uncertainty in flash flood forecasting are due to inaccuracies in precipitation forecasts 60 130 an accurate prediction of extreme precipitation at the desired spatial and temporal resolutions is required 8 123 also sufficient lead time which is greater than the time of concentration of the catchment and precise location is required for flash flood forecasting 166 urban flooding is a particular case of flash flooding relatively small catchment area and shorter time of concentration in the range of a few minutes to hours are the distinctive features of floods in urban areas 21 58 131 imd provides quantitative precipitation forecast qpf for major cities which is available on the customized rainfall information system cris website however it gives only daily precipitation forecast with up to three days lead in addition the existing automated rain gauges only collect hourly rainfall data for managing urban flooding we need precipitation observations every five minutes 21 58 along with the precipitation forecast at higher spatial and temporal resolutions at sufficient lead time there is also unavailability of the intensity duration and frequency idf curves of different cities at daily to sub daily time scales 58 hapuarachchi et al 60 reported that existing models are not capable of providing reliable flash flood forecast in urban watersheds ghosh et al 54 developed india s first integrated urban flood forecast system for chennai the proposed framework integrates several components including regional weather forecast tide and storm surge modelling monitoring of rainfall and flows upstream hydrological modelling and urban flood modelling 54 however the weather forecast which is probably one of the most important components of the system needs to be improved for spatial and temporal resolutions as well as the lead time the available rain gauge network density cannot usually capture the causative intense precipitation at localized scales 120 rain gauges provide the most accurate information which is essential for the evaluation of gridded precipitation products 47 115 152 uncertainty in precipitation estimates due to rain gauge density is the highest in north india while the lowest in central india 115 therefore there is a critical need to evaluate the density of rain gauge stations in the flood affected regions which is important for the correction of observed and predicted precipitation 72 besides there are significant lapses in the installation of precipitation gauges and telemetric stations in india 27 for instance the doppler weather radar measurement which is based on cloud reflectivity can provide quantitative precipitation estimation qpe of a large area with 3 days lead time in place of point estimates provided by rain gauges 131 171 https moes gov in programmes commissioning polarimetric doppler weather radars dwrs however imd has only 35 s band radars while india requires 80 100 radars to cover the whole territory 62 https ddgmui imd gov in radar newradarstatuslivereport1 php radar observations with high spatial and temporal resolution can be used to develop precipitation nowcasts which is essential for urban and flash flood prediction 55 109 120 131 169 170 radar observations are also used for data assimilation to improve the performance of flood forecast systems 123 however the radar measurements require correction of instrumental errors and uncertainty that can arise due to complex atmospheric processes 53 83 85 169 recently yang et al 169 introduced a long short term memory lstm network based method to improve radar based precipitation estimates also the 2017 comptroller and auditor general cag report on the schemes of flood control and forecasting has found inadequate flood preparation non establishment of telemetry and flood forecasting stations as per the xii five year plan document and non usage of the existing telemetry data in the formulation of flood forecast 27 overall both observations and forecast of precipitation need enhancements for their utility in the development of flood early warning systems 3 flood forecast system in india the cwc under the ministry of jal shakti is the nodal agency that performs flood forecasting in india they maintain a network of observation stations across major rivers and their tributaries and issue flood warning at 324 stations which includes 196 water level forecasts and 128 reservoir inflow forecasts 40 currently they employ deterministic flood forecasting based on observations of precipitation and streamflow the cwc uses statistical methods such as i gauge to gauge correlation ii gauge discharge relations iii multiple coaxial correlations using the gauge precipitation and antecedent precipitation index api data for flood forecasting 40 148 they cwc also use rainfall runoff modelling by combining both hydrologic and hydraulic modelling tools the cwc issues daily flood forecast with 24 36 h lead for major rivers besides twice a day forecast with 12 to 24 h lead is issued for medium rivers while multiple daily forecasts with a lead time of fewer than 12 h are issued for flashy river basins with a shorter time of concentration 148 using the unit hydrograph method and correlational curves they generate 6 24 h short range forecast at divisional sub divisional levels and medium range forecasts for 72 h are formulated at headquarters 40 overall forecast accuracy of the existing flood forecasting system is 97 wherein the forecasts were correct within a threshold of 15 cm and 20 of the discharge value 39 3 1 limitation of the current flood prediction in india the cwc in 2017 began to provide flood forecasting with 3 days lead using mathematical modelling tools on a trial basis 40 notwithstanding the high accuracy in the flood forecast developed by cwc there are several sources of uncertainty for instance errors and uncertainty in the weather forecast can translate to flood forecast 152 moreover the flood forecast accuracy can be considerably lower in the smaller and fast responding catchments that often witness flash flooding the flood forecast methodology used by cwc is deterministic and there is a lack of quantification of uncertainty the cwc has not yet established ensemble flood forecasting methods by taking advantage of the advances in the ensemble weather forecast system in india 62 an ensemble flood forecasting system could provide predictions with sufficient lead times and by incorporating model uncertainties 33 50 78 therefore there is a need to develop an ensemble flood forecast system in india which can help stakeholders in decision making indian river basins are considerably affected by water storage and diversion the presence of dams and reservoirs in the river basins influence the natural variability of streamflow 17 45 the reservoir operations can also affect the timing and magnitude of floods in the downstream areas 94 102 therefore an important aspect that needs consideration in the flood mitigation efforts is the presence of reservoirs across the river basins in india faulty dam operations can exacerbate flooding 71 112 for instance reservoir operations played a crucial role in enhancing the 2018 kerala floods 67 94 the main focus of reservoir operation is on water conservation for the dry season thus establishing a trade off between the contrasting roles of reservoirs is a major challenge in flood mitigation 143 there are about 5745 large dams in india 38 however cwc provides inflow information only at 128 stations 40 a reliable inflow and weather forecast is required in making timely release decisions to reduce the role of reservoirs on flooding especially in the case of reservoirs designed for water conservation purposes 102 narasimhan et al 102 in their assessment of the 2015 chennai floods observed that inaccuracies in the inflow forecast derail proper dam operations sudheer et al 143 also highlighted the role of extended and reliable extreme precipitation forecasts coupled with inflow forecasts for proper reservoir operations most of the large dams rely on rule curves for dam operations which are made under the guidelines of the dam safety organization dso 96 nevertheless the rule curves of dams are not updated based on changes in inflow carrying capacity of the downstream river channel land use changes and so on moreover a shift from rule curves to dynamic operating curves is required as adopted globally 63 75 101 the non availability of data regarding the operations of dams in the public domain is another concern 106 which refrains the informed participation of various stakeholders in the decision making process in india dam authority in the respective states is the nodal agency in determining the dam operation policy however there are several interstate rivers which make the reservoirs in a single basin under the control of different authorities hence there is a lack of coordination in reservoir operations we need to consider all the reservoirs in a basin as a single entity and has to formulate policies for multi reservoir operations there are numerous examples of various multi reservoir optimization schemes helping in flood mitigation 14 105 159 for instance the storage capacity of downstream reservoirs could be augmented by reducing the outflow from the upstream reservoirs 174 also information on the potential inflow volumes helps in better decision making for the downstream reservoir operation during flood events the proper management of reservoirs during extreme events could reduce and delay flood peaks 9 3 2 opportunities to enhance the flood forecast in india inflow forecast with sufficient lead time for reservoirs is essential for flood control operations in india uncertainties in inflow forecasting are the primary cause of the failure of proper reservoir operations 167 the probabilistic estimation of reservoir inflows would provide an accurate estimation of uncertainty which can help in decisions associated with reservoir operations yan et al 167 proposed a method to estimate uncertainty in inflow forecasts and used the error distribution to decide flood control operations similarly zhou guo 175 reported the use of a seasonal flood limited water level flwl during the flood season instead of a constant flwl to maximize the use of floodwater without reducing the flood control potential of the dam there have been several data science approaches proposed for simulating reservoir inflows 7 12 49 however the use of these methods is limited by the lack of long term observations the reservoirs with long term inflow observations can use the data driven approaches for inflow forecasting for the reservoirs moreover many reservoirs in india during the monsoon season operate based on the meteorological forecast which may not be appropriate therefore there is a need to develop a long lead inflow forecast based on an ensemble prediction system for reservoir operations in india the application of fine resolution nwp models along with ensemble radar nowcasts at 0 3 hr lead time could be used for flash flood forecasts in the smaller but flood prone catchments 74 there have been several attempts on flash flood forecasting based on rainfall and discharge comparison lumped and distributed hydrological models data science and statistical approaches in the united states us flash food guidance system ffg which is a comparison between threshold precipitation and forecasted precipitation is used for issuing flash flood warnings since the 1970s 32 57 60 130 hardy et al 61 introduced a probabilistic flash flood forecasting system using an ensemble of qpfs with due consideration to the location uncertainty in the qpf precipitation forecasts a probabilistic forecast system can address the uncertainties associated with hydrologic and hydraulic systems in flash flood forecasts 107 a multilevel approach to estimate flash flood risk is proposed in the yunnan province of china using a cascading flash flood guidance system 173 silvestro et al 134 developed an impact based assessment of flash flood forecast that considers the economic and population impacts in addition to discharge and inundation forecasts neural networks recurrent neural network rnn and lstm networks are widely used for flash flood forecasting 87 98 however as in the case of inflow forecasts the shortage of long term streamflow record hinders the use of data driven approaches overall we need to integrate different frameworks data driven and process based models to develop an effective flash flood forecast system in india the urban flood forecast system in india needs enhancements due to rising incidents of urban flooding under the warming climate urban pluvial flooding in india is accentuated due to clogged and insufficient capacity of stormwater drainage 23 58 66 however most of the urban flooding models shy away from modelling stormwater systems 23 moreover india s flood prone urban cities lie along the coastal plains and hence the risk of storm surges adds to the vulnerability of the coastal cities 43 for instance urban areas of surat mumbai and kolkata have experienced flooding due to extreme precipitation and high tides 43 112 121 an urban flood forecast system in india needs to address these challenges ghosh et al 54 used high resolution light detection and ranging lidar terrain data for the hydrologic and hydraulic modelling of chennai city in india taking into account both storm surges and extreme precipitation events previous studies have used varied methods like combining multiple radar forecasts 104 and incorporating nwp outputs with qpes from radars 88 172 for improving precipitation forecasts a probabilistic forecast of urban flooding by integrating qpes with real time hydrological and hydraulic modelling is proposed by brendel et al 23 they brendel et al also developed a real time application that estimates the risk to existing infrastructure like sewers in the time of flooding dhiman et al 43 examined the flood risk and adaptation strategies in the four major flood prone coastal cities in india they observed the success of community based flood mitigation measures in reducing the flood impacts coupling ensemble precipitation forecast with the rainfall runoff model is the best available practice in flood forecasting 50 61 141 using eps for flood forecasting is referred to globally as hydrologic ensemble prediction hep the basic schematic of hep and the causes of uncertainties are represented in fig 4 hep has been used since the early 2000s across the world 3 51 149 165 similar to an ensemble weather prediction system hep can incorporate uncertainty in flood forecasts 35 uncertainty is added to the flood forecasts from initial conditions model parameters and systemic errors of the nwp models and the hydrologic models 33 35 an increase in the ensemble numbers and model diversity increases the forecast skills 34 wu et al 166 in a comprehensive review on ensemble flood forecast systems summarized the challenges and opportunities in adopting the hep system for flood forecasting and management they suggested focusing on 1 improving data quality and availability 2 addressing different category of flood events 3 extending flood forecast variables from streamflow forecast to water level inundation depth and flow velocity forecasts 3 increasing forecast lead time and 4 increasing ensemble generation and model evaluation methods all the suggestions are relevant for the enhancement of flood warning systems in india india employs different systems for the data collection of conventional observations 37 99 inconsistencies sparse station locations lack of free access to observations and unavailability of metadata hamper the advancements in the flood forecast and early warning systems the lack of metadata on the methodologies of recording instruments used for measurement and the lack of clarity in the primary variables recorded make it almost impossible to estimate uncertainty in observations 166 reliable ground observations are inevitable for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models data assimilation and the calibration of remote sensing observations 44 156 166 increasing the density of ground based observation stations ensuring timely recording and the availability of flow and reservoir storage can help us in improving flood forecasting infrastructure 142 satellite observations of precipitation reservoir storage and streamflow can fill the gaps in the sparsely covered areas 3 55 164 the progress in satellite remote sensing in india provides remotely sensed data for accurate topographic depiction measurement of soil moisture assessment of vegetation parameters and land use classification which are required for flood modelling at finer resolutions 130 150 163 168 an accurate terrain model is required for setting up hydrodynamic models for inundation depth forecasts 29 127 the advances in satellite remote sensing are employed in nwp via data assimilation 103 we need to extend the use of these resources for hydrologic and hydraulic modelling on operational scales the major impediments in the implementation of hep are a lack of skilled personnel 62 technological improvements reliable data and computational power fig 5 the existing technological capabilities should be enhanced for the implementation of the hep system in india there are however major caveats in adopting the hep system for flood forecasting such as 1 the representation of uncertainty 2 forecast verification and 3 challenges in the interpretation and communication of hep forecasts at flood dissemination centres 42 50 therefore there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation of the cascading of uncertainties in the streamflow forecast in india in most of the previous studies 11 55 69 the uncertainty in streamflow predictions fig 4 is quantified in terms of the uncertainty in the representation of initial conditions of the nwp models 86 the uncertainty due to the hydrological model structure parametrization and systemic errors of the nwp models is often neglected 33 incorporating data assimilation in the streamflow forecasts could potentially narrow the uncertainty in streamflow predictions 50 there are also attempts in calibrating the forecast system using the observations 65 grand ensemble techniques get use multiple nwp models instead of a single nwp used in ensemble precipitation forecasts the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge thorpex is a wmo organization that aims at improving forecast accuracy up to 14 days lead time was launched in march 2005 by the world meteorological organization wmo 26 110 which is an attempt to incorporate multiple model ensemble to improve numerical weather prediction moreover incorporating model parameter and systematic uncertainties in addition to the uncertainties produced by the choice of initial conditions can be helpful in the streamflow forecast 26 emerton et al 50 reported that the relative importance of uncertainty in flow prediction depends on the lead time of the forecast system catchment characteristics model resolution and magnitude of the event uncertainty can also arise in the process of downscaling and bias correction of precipitation used in the hydrologic model and data assimilation adopted for correcting the precipitation and streamflow forecasts the hydrologic ensemble prediction experiments hepex project intend to incorporate uncertainties that develop in various stages in the hep system and also works towards developing forecast verification 128 https hepex inrae fr verification of streamflow forecast is an essential component of the flood early warning system usually predictions are verified comparing it with discharge observations 149 however in ungauged stations it is challenging to implement donnelly et al 46 developed a model that captures the spatial variability of flow by correlating the physiographic characteristics to the flow generation mechanisms and found them to be useful in testing ungauged stations in addition to the accuracy of prediction of the peak discharges 149 the sufficiency of the lead time is also assessed in several hep systems 20 http www bom gov au water 7daystreamflow 138 www smhi se the hydrologic ensemble forecast system of the united states us uses ensemble verification system evs which assess the bias skill and lead time of the ensemble forecasts 24 another crucial area is the forecast communication to the public though hep systems are used since the 2000s the interpretation and use of the forecast by the operational flood forecasting agencies are not encouraging 42 the ensemble prediction system transfers the responsibility of decision making from the forecast agencies to the end users demeritt et al 42 reported improper understanding and interpretations of the ensemble forecasts by the forecast agencies most of the operational forecasters rely more on deterministic forecasts and use the ensemble forecasts to support the decision making stephens cloke 141 has noted the following measures to improve the use of hep 1 providing training to improve the interpretation of the probabilistic prediction and 2 shifting from the discharge threshold or water level predictions to quantify flood damage impact which would be more relatable to the end user 4 development of a flood early warning system in india we need to adopt a bottom up approach to address the complex flood challenge in india the flood drivers are different for different river basins 15 16 18 146 therefore a comprehensive study on the identification of major drivers of floods in the indian river basin is required to further enhance the flood early warning system in india we need a hierarchical system with cwc as the nodal agency catchment scale forecast centres cfc and sub catchment scale regional forecast centres rfc to tackle the recurring flood situation in india fig 6 since major river basins extend beyond the state boundaries cooperation among states is also vital at the bottom level of the hierarchy specialized forecast centres for urban and flash flood prone catchments in addition to sub catchment scale rfcs can address the catchment specific characteristics that may influence flood occurrence also a special centre may control and coordinate the activities of urban and flash flood prone catchments policies for the management and proper execution of the flood early warning system at different levels need to be strengthened cwc being the nodal agency can lead the efforts to develop hydrologic ensemble prediction hep system for flood forecast ensemble precipitation forecast is available at 4 km resolution which can be used for developing hep for the entire country furthermore radar qpes or probabilistic nowcasts can be incorporated with the ensemble precipitation forecasts to improve precipitation forecasts guidelines need to be re evaluated for the optimal operation of the reservoirs moreover data transparency and data sharing related to the reservoir operations need to be strengthened in addition steps for proper flood plain zoning and mapping across india are required to reduce flood damages the cfcs could coordinate flood forecasting activities within a catchment they could also aid in establishing transparency in the operations of inter state dams within a catchment cfcs may formulate multi reservoir operational policies and incorporate the catchment specific characteristics and reservoir operations in the hydrological and hydraulic modelling the probabilistic streamflow forecasts generated at the cwc can be used by the cfcs to generate inundation depths and accurate inflow forecasts for the reservoirs also they can coordinate rfcs in urban and flash flood prone catchments the rfcs may further augment the hep by increasing the temporal and spatial resolution by incorporating specific catchment information in the flash flood prone catchments accurate terrain data need to be developed using lidar further efforts are required to establish state of the art methodologies that can improve flood forecast for urban areas and fast responding catchments rfcs need to be established to take the responsibility of disseminating flood warning to the community furthermore the involvement of all the stakeholders people public and private agencies in the forecast dissemination is essential data transparency and the communication of probabilistic risk on time to all the stakeholders will improve the public trust in the flood forecasting system issuing flood warning by the proper interpretation of the forecasts and comparison with the precipitation or flow thresholds is essential there are important examples of community based flood early warning systems cbfews that have successfully aided in the dissemination of timely information on impending floods in the districts of assam in india and also across the indo nepal border 144 involving community participation in the forecast dissemination aids in impact reduction adequate training and capacity building is required for resilient flood warning infrastructure harsha 62 reported the lack of a technically capable workforce as the major impediment in the implementation of the ensemble flood forecasting system in india furthermore a technically sound forecast system will not be sufficient without proper penetration of the warning 25 there are cases wherein the lack of sufficient communication failed to garner proactive responses 48 77 132 162 the emergency communication channels need to be strengthened to ensure that early warnings travel the last mile to reach the most vulnerable population at the remotest location moreover a proper system should be designed and tested for swift response to reduce flood damages perera et al 114 conducted a comprehensive review of the non technical aspects of flood early warning system and have compiled a list of challenges in emergency communication they perera et al reiterate the need for standardization increasing the credibility and timely penetration of warning signals tailoring the dissemination according to the needs of the population strengthening the communication channels by incorporating civil society organizations csos and building local communication pathways peculiar to each community though the main goal of emergency response is to avoid human losses it is also found to reduce economic losses and damages 77 97 the flood damage in developed nations has been substantially reduced through emergency communication and response on the other hand flood damages are increasing in developing nations due to inefficient early warning systems along with the rising frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events therefore there is an urgent need for developing regional strategies for forecast dissemination 132 the initial response of a population to the warning signal is to confirm the warning and to organize the response action 77 this time can be reduced by increasing the public trust in the dissemination agency increasing the lead time by bolstering the emergency channels and setting up a resilient system to facilitate evacuation india can easily harness the local self government agencies for effective communication and response by providing adequate training and capacity building incorporation of csos non governmental organizations ngos and ensuring community participation can significantly improve the effectiveness of flood early warnings in addition conducting mock drills prior to the summer monsoon season among the frequently affected population could help in evaluating the response action which would help in understanding the issues and enhancing the coordination among various departmental agencies and stakeholders 52 5 discussion and conclusions the annual occurrence of floods during the monsoon season june september is an unavoidable phenomenon in india however the damage caused by floods could be reduced by strengthening our disaster preparedness infrastructure the flood forecasting and warning system is a major non structural intervention that can effectively aid in flood preparedness and response 28 59 96 india has achieved great progress in the precipitation forecast however the same has not reflected in the flood forecast 113 139 there are numerous challenges in enhancing the existing flood forecast system in india for instance the dearth of sufficient data insufficient use of available data in flood forecasting applications lack of regional flood forecasting stations improper monitoring and lack of trained manpower play an essential role in the ineffectiveness of the flood warning systems 27 we list the significant challenges and ways to overcome those as 1 there is a need for a proper framework and consistency in recording precipitation and discharge data consistent observations at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions are necessary for understanding the characteristics of extreme events assessing uncertainties in observations correcting satellite observations and improving forecasts via data assimilation 2 dams can be effectively used for flood mitigation however improper dam operations exacerbate flooding in india 94 106 112 143 we need to establish sufficient inflow forecast infrastructure commensurate to the number of dams in the country besides we need to evolve a comprehensive approach for inter state rivers in managing the dam operations in the case of reservoir operations an urgent shift from the existing rule curve method to dynamic operational curves with due focus on flood mitigation is required 3 there is a need to develop an ensemble flood prediction system which is considered the most effective system in flood forecasting globally 33 50 141 the cwc needs to revamp the guidelines for flood forecasting and can lead the efforts to develop and enhance the ensemble forecast system taking advantage of the existing ensemble precipitation forecast systems 4 even though indian terrain is highly prone to flash floods 136 there have been only a few attempts at studying the flash flood susceptibility of indian catchments while dedicated flash flood forecast systems exist globally since the early 21st century 60 122 urban areas in india are exposed to the double risk of coastal flooding and flash flooding driven by extreme precipitation events however apart from precipitation forecasts serious attempts at setting up an operational flood forecasting system are lacking for the majority of the flood prone cities 5 there have not been sufficient studies in india that look into the flood generation and propagation aspects in a catchment with a regional outlook the importance of incorporating the regional dimensions in the flood forecasting infrastructure is recognized globally 146 the flood forecasting system developed for chennai that considers the specific flood risk of the terrain is among the few attempts in this direction 54 6 india needs a proper framework for establishing a comprehensive flood forecast and warning system we need a structural hierarchy with the cwc as the nodal agency forecast centres at the catchment and the sub basin levels with a specialized focus on the flash flood prone catchments and urban areas 7 there should be a strong emphasis on the last mile communication of flood risk to the most vulnerable population at sufficient lead time the governmental and non governmental agencies should be trained to work in coordination and to understand the uncertainties in the flood forecast communications further mock drills can be conducted among the frequently affected population to increase flood preparedness and to evaluate the strength of communication channels and swiftness of flood response every year thousands of people lose their lives while millions are rendered homeless in india due to floods jameel et al 68 in a letter to science has advocated for a new flood policy citing the recurring floods and increasing damages in the states of bihar and assam they jameel et al reported that india needs to overlook the structural flood control measures which fail annually setting up flood early warning infrastructure would be costly however it will override its cost by the benefits the nation could accrue in the long run india spent more money on post flood recovery than investing in pre flood mitigation schemes 96 an efficient flood early warning system could not only reduce the extensive damages caused during the flood season but also aid in reducing economic inequality and vulnerability of a more extensive section of the population

20131,climate change and socio economic development result in increasing flood risk which challenges flood risk management policy making and practice each situation however is different and calls for not only understanding the natural context but also the socio economic and cultural context only then flood risk management strategies can be designed that are not only 1 fit for purpose but also 2 feasible for local implementation and 3 sustainable into the future flood consequences that are accepted in some cultures fatalist may not be acceptable in other cultures controlist this calls for considering the local normative context in order to understand current differences in policy and practice more importantly the design of strategic alternatives for flood risk management into the future should consider this socio economic and cultural context as well because not every society aims for the same goals in the same proportion nor is equally willing or capable to implement and maintain sophisticated infrastructure and dedicated institutions based on literature on cultural theory and national cultures we hypothesized that acknowledging socio economic and cultural differences would allow to better appreciate the rationale of current flood risk management policies and practices in different parts of the world by analysing cases related to deltares projects abroad we explored whether these factors explain the main differences observed based on this preliminary exploration we propose a shortlist of factors to consider when designing future flood risk management strategies tailored to local socio economic and cultural contexts keywords flood risk management cultural theory planning development funding 1 the setting flood risk management is one of many means to achieve sustainable development and not a goal in itself reducing risks is quintessential to support socio economic development because recovering from disasters costs lots of money and effort which cannot be spent on development cf oecd 2019 it is noted that some flood prone countries like bangladesh or mozambique are perhaps trapped in a vicious cycle of recurrent disasters and only partial recovery slowing down their development this notion lies behind the policy of international agencies like the world bank or asian development bank who support flood risk management projects and capacity building in view of enhancing economic development in contrast implementing and maintaining a preventative flood risk management strategy also costs substantial amounts of money and effort and hence requires a certain degree of development flood risk management can thus be considered a balancing act in which the costs of designing implementing and sustaining a strategy should be proportional to the benefits of having the strategy in terms of reduced risks van der most et al 2014 kind 2014 and hence development potential this is the simple utilitarian perspective cf eijgenraam et al 2017 it gives preference to designing strategies that are fit for purpose in the sense that they achieve the largest reduction of risk against the least costs but strategies and interventions that have proved successful in one country may fail to be so when transferred to another country often because they are insufficiently suited to the local socio economic situation or the cultural setting increasingly developing countries complain about the many plans drafted by foreign consultants that do not come with the required funding or call for huge loans or that are otherwise unsuited for local implementation from the perspective of the consultants it is frustrating to see that projects that have been proposed are not implemented or not being adequately used or maintained or simply not finalized and hence not effective minkman et al 2019 to our opinion both frustrations call for another approach to the design of flood risk management strategies which we call tailored flood risk management in the sense that they should not only be 1 fit for purpose but they should also be 2 feasible for local implementation and 3 sustainable into the future tailored flood risk management requires an understanding of not only the risk situation but also of the local policy context an analysis and assessment of the risk situation is already commonplace as defined by hazard vulnerability and the intersect of these exposure floodsite 2009b klijn et al 2015 or in other terms the physiographic setting the existing flood management infrastructure and the people and their assets at stake such an analysis and assessment of risk increasingly not only considers current flood risk but also the development of flood risk into the future as physical developments e g climate change and subsidence as well as socio economic developments e g demographic and economic developments cause a steady increase as wmo et al 2017 state development of a well balanced strategy should start with a proper understanding of the flood risk not only examining the characteristics of past floods but also looking into possible future situations and also effective measures for reducing flood risk will be location specific there is no single solution for all flood problems a variety of measures a strategy will be required to reduce flood risk to a societally agreed upon acceptable level these views were also expressed in the ten golden rules to guide a sound approach for strategic flood management by sayers et al 2015 for example in rules 4 recognize that the future will be different from the past the world is changing and 10 the development of any strategy will therefore be location specific reflecting the specific risks that must be faced sentence parts swapped by the authors as evidenced by these examples there is already quite some consensus and guidance about what should be done for a sound flood risk analysis and assessment and how it should be done to be as instrumental as possible for the next stage a sound policy analysis mayer van der most bots 2002 requires that the flood risk assessment is followed by the design of strategic alternatives as well as their full assessment and culminating in the definition of a preferred strategy in this context a flood risk management strategy can be defined by its content i e as a comprehensive set of physical interventions and policy instruments cf floodsite 2009 marchand et al 2012 wmo 2017 but a strategy is usually also understood as implying a process of implementation and maintenance thus comprising an institutional governance structure and funding arrangements as for the content of alternative strategies their fitness for purpose is usually assessed by evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency as well as all relevant side effects on society economy and ecology cf floodsite 2009 this relates to the three main objective domains of sustainable development people prosperity and planet so including social equity and environmental issues as currently captured by the term inclusive green growth nowadays one might also refer to the widely endorsed sustainable development goals un 2015 we might therefore conclude that designing or selecting a strategy that is fit for purpose is already sufficiently sustained by appropriate assessment methods whether societal cost benefit analysis ecosystem service based assessment or multi criteria analysis but what about assessing the feasibility for implementation and sustainability into the future as for the first a partial and hence limited assessment of technical feasibility is often applied or simply expert judgement whether a strategy really fits in certain socio economic and cultural settings may require a more thorough analysis however and as for the second the sustainability into the future this is of course partly covered by looking into long term and off site side effects of interventions and policy instruments but usually does not cover an assessment of the sustainability of operation and maintenance which so often causes a strategy to not remain effective indeed it is sustained governance we need to consider as well regarding the governance of flood risk management oecd recently issued a report titled applying the oecd principles on water governance to floods oecd 2019 in which 11 principles for good water governance oecd 2015 were specified to flood risk management literally it is stated that the oecd principles on water governance are developed on the premise that there is no one size fits all solution to water challenges worldwide they recognize that governance is highly contextual that water policies need to be tailored to different water resources and places whereas the need for tailoring is acknowledged the actual principles are quite prescriptive and formulated from the perspective of the oecd members i e developed countries whether they apply equally well elsewhere is yet to be seen in this paper we therefore adopt a more analytical investigative perspective and first try to establish how a policy context co defines current strategies as applied in different parts of the world our aim is therefore to not prescribe a certain approach too soon but to rather sensitize technical specialists and consulting engineers who work or are going to work abroad 2 research approach and set up of this paper this paper firstly explores why different flood risk management strategies are being applied in different situations and in different parts of the world and more specifically to what extent socio economic and cultural differences explain the differences in strategy relative to differences in the physical risk situation secondly we aim to make recommendations on how to account for socio economic and cultural differences in order to ensure that flood risk management strategies are not only fit for purpose but also feasible for implementation and sustainable into the future i e are truly tailored to this end we first delve shallowly into the literature on relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics as well as into common practice within the world bank and similar institutions that support development planning flood risk management projects and programmes or disaster risk reduction policies from this literature search we propose a shortlist of key socio economic and cultural characteristics which we hypothesize should be considered when analyzing a certain risk management policy context next we test our hypothesis by exploring a number of cases and comparing these to the netherlands and bangladesh as references we selected 5 cases spread over several continents and different cultures based on the pragmatic criterion that we have been or are currently engaged in flood risk management policy planning and design fig 1 our home country is our first reference case for obvious reasons though the netherlands may be regarded distinctly off average and bangladesh is the second as it is the most threatened delta in the world with the longest experience in living with floods cf zevenbergen et al 2018 whilst socio economically and culturally it is almost the opposite of the netherlands and hence an adequate counterpart for each case we described the current flood risk management strategy and subsequently tried to establish to what extent the observed differences between them could be attributed to differences in the potentially explanatory socio economic and cultural characteristics using the proposed shortlist of relevant characteristics finally we discuss our findings and try to translate our understanding into recommendations on how to proceed when designing a flood risk management strategy abroad 3 what literature says about relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics many countries have a distinct flood risk management culture often related to their history e g bubeck et al 2017 this constitutes what we may call the policy context an analysis of the policy context therefore may help understand why certain flood risk management approaches and interventions have been chosen i e in hindsight to define a policy context we may look at 1 the general socio economic context in which a management policy and related institutional setting developed e g kaufman et al 2010 and 2 the cultural normative context first however we want to emphasize that there are obvious differences in policy between well established democracies and countries that have been more centrally and autocratically led for decades centuries or ages both however have shown to be able to persist and both may have well established institutions and regardless of how a country is led or organized managing flood risk can be a concern it is important to realize that for flood risk management planning the state system is not something that can be easily changed or even influenced in behalf of a more desirable strategy and must be considered as a given it is undeniably context still we may desire to roughly qualify a particular country s governance setting which we may derive from the worldwide governance indicators wgi kaufman et al 2010 for example those representing rule of law and control of corruption the importance of the general socio economic setting is especially stressed by the united nations un the oecd the international monetary fund imf and the world bank wb and other donor institutions this setting or state of development may also partly clarify a country s priorities in flood risk management there is for example a correlation between the degree of development of a country and the degree of protection that is being aimed for in most developed countries protection levels of about 1 100 to 1 500 apply related to the magnitude of the expected economic consequences of flooding whereas in developing countries such levels are often regarded as unattainable the general socio economic context also relates to the availability of funding and willingness and capability to spend money on flood protection here we may thus recognize three other relevant characteristics namely 1 the degree of institutionalization 2 the availability of money for investments in flood risk reduction and 3 the education level of the population in general and of the responsible authorities and engineers in particular this is what we might call the institutional setting related to the general socio economic context for a first estimate the degree of institutionalization can also be derived from the already mentioned worldwide governance indicators in particular government effectiveness similarly the availability of money for investments in flood risk management can be deduced from databases on gross domestic product whether per country or per capita or translated into per capita purchasing power parity ppp as made available by the world bank wb or the international monetary fund imf the level of education in a country finally can be retrieved from the human development index of the united nations un or from a list of the oecd see wikipedia the latter specifies the percentage of a country s population that has received primary secondary or tertiary education but is limited to the oecd countries plus some other large countries only the un hdi mapped all countries and translated the outcomes into a single index with the databases on indices mentioned above we might obtain quantitative information about many individual indicators of governance economic development and human development and hence an adequate overview of a country s or regions socio economic development status this is relevant for the question how feasible expensive technical interventions requiring highly skilled personnel or computerized operation or complicated institutional arrangements would be in a certain policy setting one might say to cover the idea of governance feasibility this does however not yet cover the cultural dimension so let us have a closer look at cultural differences next in the 1980ies and 1990ies cultural differences have attained lots of interest in anthropology and sociology usually to identify the most distinguishing factors in a multi dimensional hyperspace of possibly relevant factors from a wealth of empirical research especially by groups around thompson and wildavsky cf thompson et al 1990 the factors group and grid emerged as being the most differentiating the terms group and grid represent a the degree of individualism versus collectivism and b the degree of freedom of choice prescribing free or prescribed externally imposed restrictions on choice schwarz and thompson 1990 these two factors have proved quite useful as main axes in attempts to distinguish different cultures e g sun ki chai et al 2009 the two factors also proved useful in communicating cultural theory see thompson 2002 as they allowed the characterization of four distinct perspectives of the world a hierarchist controlist an individualist market optimist an egalitarian environmental pessimist and a fatalist in turn these four perspectives helped to understand conflicting opinions on preferred policy directions as they could be translated into 1 views on how the world functions and 2 preferred management styles after van asselt et al 2001 fig 2 cf also offermans et al 2013 another possibility to characterize cultural contexts is by dimensions of national culture as identified by hofstede 2001 hofstede et al 2010 he proposes six dimensions of culture viz collectivism individualism power distance femininity masculinity uncertainty avoidance long term orientation and indulgence we consider hofstede s dimensions as more useful to understand the perceptions and behavior of individual people in a certain culture than for characterizing a national or regional cultural setting that is because the perspective of hofstede s dimensions is primarily psychological rather than related to a country s institutions and capacities to address public policy issues although the same could be maintained about thompson s factors still the perceptions and related behavior of most of the people are very relevant as the majority of the people tend to determine tacit culture one would expect that at least collectivism individualism e g germany vs usa and long term orientation e g china vs african countries are relevant differentiating factors at national level and obviously collectivism individualism is very similar to thompson s interpretation of group whereas it has already been identified as partly explaining differences in flood risk management between e g the netherland and the usa bubeck et al 2017 in contrast we consider feminity masculinity as not really relevant as it primarily describes whether it is accepted that a strong leader institution enforces his its will but if interpreted in this sense power distance is very similar as it describes whether less strong parties accept that their power and influence is limited on the other hand it is not unlikely that some of hofstede s psychological dimensions are also already partly covered by what we above called state system and dominant world view i e if we consider these as reflecting a country s culture this applies especially for power distance and indulgence 4 key socio economic and cultural characteristics a proposal from the above mentioned literature esp thompson and hofstede and practice world bank and oecd we first derived a longlist of possibly relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics next we did some profound pruning in order to derive a homologous short list of about 6 10 characteristics only we achieved this by scrutiny of each characteristic cross comparison and in many cases simply by sound reasoning we thus got rid of most redundancies and overlaps and propose the following shortlist of 8 relevant socio economic and cultural differentiating characteristics to characterize a policy context state system varying from restrained to free and from top down control to bottom up self organizing examples centrally led strong leader e g china russia democratic decentralized and strongly institutionalized germany nordic countries free market mechanism capitalism usa uk institutions presence of well established organizations rules and regulations to implement a policy and to maintain technical interventions funds availability of or access to funding for both the implementation of interventions as well as their management and maintenance skills capacity to plan design build and maintain complex technical interventions orientation long term vs short term uncertainty avoidance in a long term oriented culture a basic notion is that preparing for the future is always needed whereas a short time oriented culture considers the past to provide an adequate moral and practical compass uncertainty avoidance refers to a society s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity and hence has to do with anxiety in the face of the unknown it strongly corresponds to the difference between controlism and fatalism as reflected by support to institutionalization rules and regulations large role for authorities and experts versus the opposite collectivism individualism the extent to which people trust authorities and support public services as opposed to fostering independency and favouring private action degree of commitment degree to which all relevant flood risk management actors often primarily the responsible authorities are committed to implement and sustain a certain strategy also including commitment to integration and co operation public support likelihood of support or opposition from stakeholders and ngo s who may benefit or bear the burden of interventions and may feel unheard of these 8 the first is an unchangeable given which although it cannot be changed does constrain the freedom of choice of interventions and especially policy instruments the next three define the overall degree of development and its likely development into the future which primarily constrains how institutionally complex a policy might be and how technically sophisticated and expensive to implement and maintain technical interventions the next two characteristics orientation and collectivism individualism are the most truly culturally rooted differences they reflect the main dimensions found in cultural theory and related empirical studies and wrap together some of the cultural dimensions proposed by hofstede they further constrain the range of interventions and policy instruments that are feasible finally the degree of commitment of the responsible authorities is added as stakeholders identified it as the key to successful implementation whereas the counterpart public support by the stakeholders was considered the key to success by the responsible authorities e g klijn et al 2013 see also bogdan 2019 of all 8 factors the last two may be the most easily accommodated in the course of designing a flood risk management strategy it could therefore be questioned whether they should be part of the context analysis or part of the strategy development for our current case study analysis they are certainly relevant context 4 1 operationalization preliminary indicators in order to be able to compare our 5 cases mutually and with our reference countries the netherlands and bangladesh we operationalized our 8 proposed characteristics by using readily available indicators that allow adequate semi quantification therefore we used indicators that are available in databases covering all or at least most countries as follows for the state system we used the world bank s governance indicators rule of law and control of corruption which are closely correlated the rule of law reflects perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society and in particular the quality of contract enforcement property rights the police and the courts as well as the likelihood of crime and violence the indicator control of corruption reflects perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests both indicators are ranked as percentile so ranging from 0 to 100 and as they proved strongly correlated we simply calculated the mean for an indication of the adequacy of institutions we consider the worldbank s governance indicator government effectiveness an adequate representation this reflects perceptions of the quality of public services the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures the quality of policy formulation and implementation and the credibility of the government s commitment to such policies despite its being limited to civil i e public services and hence not covering possible private institutions we consider it a good indicator as flood risk management is largely a matter of public policy making for funds we regard the gross domestic product gdp at purchasing power parity ppp per capita a good indicator i e the purchasing power parity value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year divided by the average or mid year population for the same year this indicator takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries wikipedia gives a list of countries ranked by their ppp international monetary fund 2019 which we transformed to a measure from 0 to 100 for an mere first indication of skills we draw from the human development index hdi of undp and the global innovation index gii of cornell university et al 2019 the human development index is partly based on an education index but unfortunately also partly on gdp the gii focuses on medical innovation but its ranking is based on the presence of and relationships with science and technology clusters both rankings were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 interestingly it was found that the hdi scores much lower than the gii which might reflect inequities still we calculated their mean as the ranking was quite similar for orientation we use two of the cultural dimensions as recognized by hofstede as indicators namely long term orientation and uncertainty avoidance hofstede s dimensions already range from 0 to 100 as the correlation between the two was less than expected and resulted in different rankings we kept their individual scores and distinguish orientation 1 and 2 for collectivism individualism we can directly use hofstede s quantification for this dimension for the degree of commitment of the policy makers we have not found any worldwide database that might apply on the other hand the description of the worldbank s governance indicator for government effectiveness suggests that it includes the credibility of the government s commitment italics by us as this indicator was already used for institutions see above we have not attempted to identify any other indicator for this left out for public support we can use both hofstede s dimension power distance or the worldbank s governance indicator voice and accountability as these are negatively correlated we transformed power distance to power proximity such that both indicators are positively correlated and represent an increasing degree of potential stakeholder involvement or participation 5 case studies first we described all the cases in terms of flood risk situation governance arrangements and management strategy the focus was on understanding the specific risk situation as well as its management next we tried to identify whether the socio economic and cultural setting explained the current management strategy or desired changes to it 5 1 different physical risk contexts the 5 cases are quite different vancouver british columbia canada and the vietnamese mekong delta are both located in a delta hence relatively flat and threatened by river floods as well as coastal storm surges the mekong delta however lies in a tropical monsoon climate with extreme amounts of rainfall on the delta itself during the wet season whereas vancouver is primarily threatened by the fraser river coming from the maritime west side of the rocky mountains calgary alberta canada is also threatened by river floods originating in the rocky mountains but it lies on the continental i e dry side of the mountains the northern extensions of the great plains with a badland like topography the rivers here tend to rather lose water than grow during their flow to the east great lakes miami and fort lauderdale florida usa is special in the sense that it is very low above sea level and mainly composed of raised coral reefs and their weathering products sandy beach ridges on calcareous rocks all very permeable this implies that groundwater levels rise and drop with the tides at sea it also means that sea level rise influences the inland water levels almost proportionally and uncontrollably the coast is primarily threatened by hurricanes with huge amounts of rainfall storm surges and huge waves the democratic republic of são tomé and príncipe stp finally is an archipelago comprised of two main islands and several islets in the gulf of guinea afrika here coastal communities are being threatened by swell waves and storm surges but they are also affected by runoff from the hills and pluvial flooding the climate is tropical with average rainfall ranging up to 7 000 mm in the southeast as for the exposure and vulnerability we see large differences between the case study areas partly related to their size in são tomé and príncipe stp the rural coastal communities at risk vary in size from 270 to 3300 people and mainly live from fisheries in timber houses that are usually raised a few meters above ground level except for those closest to the beach because of the high wind speeds there vancouver and calgary instead are large cities of about 2 5 i e metropolitan vancouver and 1 2 million inhabitants town only respectively with business centres with high rise buildings downtown calgary s downtown is spatially confined and largely located on the alluvial fan of the elbow river at the confluence with the bow river this fact and the development of parts of the floodplain of these rivers for urban sprawl explains the large damage incurred during the 2013 flood an about 1 100 per year probability flood that affected 8 of calgary s population and did 7 billion dollars of damage fig 3 a vancouver s downtown in contrast lies mainly on elevated ground but parts of larger vancouver and adjacent towns are in embanked polders along the fraser river or on the actual delta miami and fort lauderdale are almost fully built up areas along florida s long coast fig 3b which is regarded the place to be for the better off americans during holidays second homes or after retirement this attracted a huge recreational industry with many hotels on the outer ridge during heavy rainfall events or storms at sea the streets are very regularly but shallowly flooded still regarded as a common nuisance rather than as life threatening except for the occasional hurricane landfall when evacuation is required vietnams mekong delta is again totally different in the sense that it is primarily agricultural with settlements since ancient times on slightly higher beach ridges and river levees each year the daily life of more than 2 million people is affected when about half the delta s surface area is flooded this normal flooding has been welcomed for ages as it supports the growing of rice fig 3d and hence contributed to vietnam being the second largest rice exporter in the world marchandet al 2012 it also explains why the people of the mekong delta are originally so well adapted to flooding pham cong cuu 2011 recently however industrial development and accelerated urbanization increasingly take up space in the delta especially near major cities such as can tho moreover agriculture has intensified opting for artificially irrigated triple rice cultivation instead of traditional double rice consequently the delta s vulnerability to extreme flooding has increased 5 2 different risk management strategies adequately but briefly characterizing the flood risk management strategy of each case is difficult if not impossible as stated in the introduction a flood risk management strategy can be defined by its content or also by its governance structure in our analysis we focused on the content only implying an interpretation in terms of the physical interventions and policy instruments applied cf floodsite 2009 asce 2014 marchand et al 2012 wmo 2017 cf fig 4 instead of presenting a systematic analysis of each case s strategy here we only give a brief characterization this is obviously selective and hence biased but a full description would require too much text the case descriptions are available on request whereas a list of each case s interventions and instruments would to our opinion not yield an adequate overview of the complexity and historical development of the different management strategies either until the 2013 flood neither the city of calgary nor the province of alberta had a clear risk management strategy since then plans were drafted which not only included an initiative to increase the protection level by flood mitigation and protection measures but also included measures to reduce the vulnerability of people and objects e g by making money available for buy outs relocate or rebuild and by issuing a building code bulletin that might be considered an indication of an underlying integrated view although there does not appear to be one common and well defined policy on preventative flood risk management neither at local provincial nor federal level instead however at all levels relevant elements of such a comprehensive strategy can be found including a legal framework dedicated departments in provincial ministries and the city flood maps warning systems involvement of consulting engineers and well established stakeholder groups watersmart solutions ltd 2013 vancouver or rather the lower mainland of british columbia relies strongly on flood defences but complemented by early warning floodplain regulation and building resilience into communities the embankments along the fraser river and its tributaries in the lower mainland have been constructed between 1968 and 1995 by the federal provincial fraser river flood control program they were intended to withstand the flood of record dating back as far as 1894 with 0 6 m of freeboard the 1894 flood was previously assessed as a 1 200 per year flood but is now considered to likely have been a 1 500 per year flood a 1 200 design flood applies for all areas along the fraser river since 2003 the responsibility for flood management and floodplain regulation was shifted from the province to local governments although the province remains involved in the infrastructure through the dike maintenance act the provincial river forecast center provides information on current water levels as well as 5 and 10 day predictions currently the fraser basin council a non profit organization comprising federal provincial local and first nations governments considers an upgrade of the infrastructure in anticipation of sea level rise and other climate change related impacts as well as an improvement of the resilience of the communities for the funding of major infrastructural projects local governments can apply to the disaster mitigation and adaptation fund dmaf which was launched by the federal government the funding of the risk assessments flood mapping mitigation planning and small scale mitigation works comes from the national disaster mitigation program funding also established by federal government in 2015 but administered by the province of british columbia interestingly the municipality of richmond a city surrounded by water from the fraser river and the ocean is the only taxing its citizens directly for flood protection the extra funds are used to upgrade the flood defences and pumping stations this municipality sticks out for its projects and taxation fort lauderdale s inhabitants primarily regard floods as a nuisance which comes with the location the town has very few technical means to control the flood hazard except raising its roads and other infrastructure and flood proofing or raising properties a strategy of constant repair and building back better it implies that for property owners buying insurance or accepting the recurrent losses is the only resort as the majority of the area lies within the 100 year flood zone buying insurance is obliged by the flood disaster protection act which the us passed in 1973 it requires participation in the federal emergency management agency s fema national flood insurance program nfip fema 2011 this calls for flood proofing has many exceptions from its policies has a cap on its payments and may ask very high rates in flood prone areas it hence favours the rich and excludes the poor still it is not actuarily sound gao 2007 penning rowsell priest 2014 sao tome and principe have three ministries with responsibilities for elements of flood risk management under supervision of a national council for the prevention and response to disasters conprec established in 2011 which is supported by undp it does however not have a formal flood risk management policy nor an official plan legal framework or budget available for flood risk management in practice focus lies strongly on disaster prevention and response with a strong emphasis on building societal resilience through individual measures the strategy does involve the protection of key infrastructure e g by floodwalls along coastal and riverine roads but the main idea is to keep the people out of harm s way as the hazards are too intense to be controlled spatial planning is hence recognized as crucial but relocating land owners from hazardous locations is found to be difficult people said they were prepared to move but not at their own costs and not from locations with obvious advantages such as the coast for fishermen or valleys for farmers to less favourable locations consequently common practice is still that property owners need to take their own measures mainly by building on stilts or on a concrete basement of sufficient height the height not being prescribed but established locally by experience because of regional differences in physiography vietnam defined strategies for flood disaster mitigation and management for three distinct geographic areas van staveren 2007 for southern vietnam the strategy reads living with floods and creating sustainable development historically there was no rationale for full flood control in the mekong delta and people lived with floods for centuries since the end of the war in 1975 this strategy has gradually been changed and the flood defence infrastructure has been extended to protect the growing cities and in behalf of agricultural intensification van staveren et al 2018 this strategy has been reinforced by mard decision 101 qd bnn tt 2015 on the master plan on rice production in the autumn winter season in the mekong delta to 2020 with an outlook to 2030 consequently the ancient system of low august dikes which left room for high floods thanh et al 2019 is now systematically being replaced by high flood defences which completely prevent the annual floods undp 2017 this policy change is sometimes attributed to the dominance of a hydraulic bureaucracy evers benedikter 2009 with intricate linkages between government and the hydraulic construction sector and an intuitive preference for modern technology this policy has however also stirred significant criticism because of the risk shifts it comes with for the heightening of the embankments results in higher flood levels elsewhere käkönen 2008 affecting cities like can tho but especially rural areas moreover the perceived better flood protection induces the so called levee effect white 1945 of investing in protected areas and thus increasing the vulnerability to flooding käkönen 2008 in the mekong delta plan mdp 2013 which was endorsed by vietnam s government as well as development partners in december 2013 a shift in mindset emerged resulting in the adoption in parliament in 2017 of several guiding principles for flood risk management including to respect natural law and practical conditions avoid violently interfering in the nature select models of nature based adaptation environmentally sound and sustainable development on the basis of actively living with flood brackish and salt water despite all the differences common to all cases was that the strategies were all quite comprehensive in the sense that combinations of many different measures and policy instruments were applied in which many actors were involved and that the strategies had all constantly been adapted in response to experience in recent events fashion and changing insights 6 results the cases compared by indicators for the key socio economic and cultural characteristics fig 5 shows how the cases score on the 8 differentiating characteristics we proposed the most obvious difference is that between the most developed countries and the least developed countries especially on the first four characteristics canada and the us very much resemble the netherlands as for state system rule of law control of corruption institutions government effectiveness funds gdp ppp per capita and skills human development index and global innovation index regarding these characteristics vietnam takes an intermediate position with a relatively high score for skills thanks to a high innovation index when we look at the 4 characteristics that rather reflect the cultural setting than the socio economic context there are remarkable differences as well as unexpected similarities for example the relatively long term orientation of the netherlands is almost equaled by vietnam which also develops a delta plan for its mekong delta the degree of uncertainty avoidance orientation 2 of the three richest countries is exceeded by bangladesh and equaled by that of sao tome and principe and the expected largest degree of individualism of the us is counterbalanced by higher scores for public support to government institutions in canada and the netherlands 7 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr frans klijn had no involvement in the peer review of this article and has no access to information regarding its peer review full responsibility for the editorial process for this article was delegated to dr michel lang 8 is there any explanatory value in the identified socio economic and cultural characteristics the characteristics related to socio economic development i e institutions funds and skills might explain a preference for highly technical and expensive structural interventions in the rich developed countries versus more local and low cost interventions in the other cases however this difference proved not so marked in practice this may be explained by the fact that the physical setting of the cases is so different whilst also the risk level and the acceptance of risk differs vietnam s mekong delta of course heavily relies on sound flood risk management for ages already whereas calgary has hardly any history of recent flooding and can easily recover from a flood as evidenced by the aftermath of the 2013 flood and fort lauderdale is located in such a disadvantageous physiographic setting that structural flood defence measures are bound to fail anyway also notable is that for the vietnam case it was found that a strong lobby has been actively arguing for technical flood protection whilst funding agencies also prefer to invest in structural measures even when from a local and cultural perspective these are perhaps not the most preferable cf also minkman 2021 as to the acceptance of risk it is remarkable that the score for uncertainty avoidance orientation certainty in canada and the us is not much lower than that in the netherlands the score for long termism orientation long term is however quite different this could explain the relatively late development of comprehensive flood risk management policies in canada and the us although both countries seem to be increasingly aware of the need to respond to a changing climate and rising sea level for the us case this is even essential for its chances of survival at the same time the us s preference for individual action is only marginally reflected by a different score on individualism in comparison to canada and the netherlands perhaps this indicator does not so much reflect preferences about interventions as expected vietnam s long term orientation may be either considered a reflection of its dependency on sound flood risk management or as an explanation for its policy here the question arises whether culture is partly the result of a physical setting or whether culture explains how natural risk is perceived and hence the approach to flood risk management similarly the short termism of sao tome and principe can equally be attributed to the still low socio economic status of this young democracy or alternatively be considered the explanation of an apparent acceptance of living with risk of the communities along the coast which largely depend on fisheries and hence have no other option than to settle in hazardous places where vietnam and sao tome deviate strongly on long term orientation they also do on public support voice and accountability which would indicate that the vietnamese people are being ruled rather than intensely participate in policy making whereas the opposite seems true for sao tome in vietnam we indeed see that embankments are being installed or raised even when the farmers prefer their rice fields to be flooded or where they suffer from the increased flood levels in the river as its discharge capacity is being reduced it seems thus that not all stakeholders are being heard certainly not those off site but often not even those on site all in all we must admit that the characteristics we defined and the available indicators we used to qualify the socio economic and cultural setting of each case proved less of an explanation of the current flood risk management policy than we expected we already mentioned that the physical risk situation may be so important that the influence of stage of development and culture may be too small to be noticeable especially also due to the limited number and large variety of cases we investigated each with comprehensive but also complex policies but cf noll et al 2020 who looked at one type of intervention only even more importantly the in depth descriptions of the cases showed that each case has a special history which is so rich that only by a very thorough investigation one can obtain sufficient insight in the possible why of elements of the current flood risk management strategy 9 findings and discussion we argued that each flood risk situation calls for the design of a flood risk management policy tailored to the specific setting we stated that not only the physical context and risk situation are relevant for the design of such a policy but also the socio economic and cultural context we hypothesized that if that be true we ought to be able to detect differences between current flood risk management policies between different cases which could be explained by a characterization of this context we then identified key characteristics to describe the socio economic and cultural setting and selected indicators by which our cases could be compared we found that the policies in the cases show large differences but that our presumed differentiating characteristics only explain these differences to a small extent perhaps the physical conditions are much more important than previously envisaged or the number of cases is simply too small and their variety too large or our hypothesis is mistaken which we rather not admit yet after all the world bank and other funding agencies as well as oecd see a clear relationship between degree of development and being able to adequately manage flood risk whether this relationship is one way or the other or both ways is however yet to be seen does development depend on sound flood risk management or is it a prerequisite for well established institutions sufficient funding and the good skills that are needed to implement a comprehensive and effective flood risk management policy and its related interventions as for the experience with the 8 socio economic and cultural characteristics we proposed as well as with the globally available indicators we still recommend anybody who is going to work abroad to have a look at them just as a first acquaintance further a sensitive and open attitude to the culture one is going to work in seems the best recommendation not in order to simply accept or adopt its peculiarities but to prevent an insufficiently humble attitude as to the local cultural setting which might result in ineffective advice on what to do or how to do it declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20131,climate change and socio economic development result in increasing flood risk which challenges flood risk management policy making and practice each situation however is different and calls for not only understanding the natural context but also the socio economic and cultural context only then flood risk management strategies can be designed that are not only 1 fit for purpose but also 2 feasible for local implementation and 3 sustainable into the future flood consequences that are accepted in some cultures fatalist may not be acceptable in other cultures controlist this calls for considering the local normative context in order to understand current differences in policy and practice more importantly the design of strategic alternatives for flood risk management into the future should consider this socio economic and cultural context as well because not every society aims for the same goals in the same proportion nor is equally willing or capable to implement and maintain sophisticated infrastructure and dedicated institutions based on literature on cultural theory and national cultures we hypothesized that acknowledging socio economic and cultural differences would allow to better appreciate the rationale of current flood risk management policies and practices in different parts of the world by analysing cases related to deltares projects abroad we explored whether these factors explain the main differences observed based on this preliminary exploration we propose a shortlist of factors to consider when designing future flood risk management strategies tailored to local socio economic and cultural contexts keywords flood risk management cultural theory planning development funding 1 the setting flood risk management is one of many means to achieve sustainable development and not a goal in itself reducing risks is quintessential to support socio economic development because recovering from disasters costs lots of money and effort which cannot be spent on development cf oecd 2019 it is noted that some flood prone countries like bangladesh or mozambique are perhaps trapped in a vicious cycle of recurrent disasters and only partial recovery slowing down their development this notion lies behind the policy of international agencies like the world bank or asian development bank who support flood risk management projects and capacity building in view of enhancing economic development in contrast implementing and maintaining a preventative flood risk management strategy also costs substantial amounts of money and effort and hence requires a certain degree of development flood risk management can thus be considered a balancing act in which the costs of designing implementing and sustaining a strategy should be proportional to the benefits of having the strategy in terms of reduced risks van der most et al 2014 kind 2014 and hence development potential this is the simple utilitarian perspective cf eijgenraam et al 2017 it gives preference to designing strategies that are fit for purpose in the sense that they achieve the largest reduction of risk against the least costs but strategies and interventions that have proved successful in one country may fail to be so when transferred to another country often because they are insufficiently suited to the local socio economic situation or the cultural setting increasingly developing countries complain about the many plans drafted by foreign consultants that do not come with the required funding or call for huge loans or that are otherwise unsuited for local implementation from the perspective of the consultants it is frustrating to see that projects that have been proposed are not implemented or not being adequately used or maintained or simply not finalized and hence not effective minkman et al 2019 to our opinion both frustrations call for another approach to the design of flood risk management strategies which we call tailored flood risk management in the sense that they should not only be 1 fit for purpose but they should also be 2 feasible for local implementation and 3 sustainable into the future tailored flood risk management requires an understanding of not only the risk situation but also of the local policy context an analysis and assessment of the risk situation is already commonplace as defined by hazard vulnerability and the intersect of these exposure floodsite 2009b klijn et al 2015 or in other terms the physiographic setting the existing flood management infrastructure and the people and their assets at stake such an analysis and assessment of risk increasingly not only considers current flood risk but also the development of flood risk into the future as physical developments e g climate change and subsidence as well as socio economic developments e g demographic and economic developments cause a steady increase as wmo et al 2017 state development of a well balanced strategy should start with a proper understanding of the flood risk not only examining the characteristics of past floods but also looking into possible future situations and also effective measures for reducing flood risk will be location specific there is no single solution for all flood problems a variety of measures a strategy will be required to reduce flood risk to a societally agreed upon acceptable level these views were also expressed in the ten golden rules to guide a sound approach for strategic flood management by sayers et al 2015 for example in rules 4 recognize that the future will be different from the past the world is changing and 10 the development of any strategy will therefore be location specific reflecting the specific risks that must be faced sentence parts swapped by the authors as evidenced by these examples there is already quite some consensus and guidance about what should be done for a sound flood risk analysis and assessment and how it should be done to be as instrumental as possible for the next stage a sound policy analysis mayer van der most bots 2002 requires that the flood risk assessment is followed by the design of strategic alternatives as well as their full assessment and culminating in the definition of a preferred strategy in this context a flood risk management strategy can be defined by its content i e as a comprehensive set of physical interventions and policy instruments cf floodsite 2009 marchand et al 2012 wmo 2017 but a strategy is usually also understood as implying a process of implementation and maintenance thus comprising an institutional governance structure and funding arrangements as for the content of alternative strategies their fitness for purpose is usually assessed by evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency as well as all relevant side effects on society economy and ecology cf floodsite 2009 this relates to the three main objective domains of sustainable development people prosperity and planet so including social equity and environmental issues as currently captured by the term inclusive green growth nowadays one might also refer to the widely endorsed sustainable development goals un 2015 we might therefore conclude that designing or selecting a strategy that is fit for purpose is already sufficiently sustained by appropriate assessment methods whether societal cost benefit analysis ecosystem service based assessment or multi criteria analysis but what about assessing the feasibility for implementation and sustainability into the future as for the first a partial and hence limited assessment of technical feasibility is often applied or simply expert judgement whether a strategy really fits in certain socio economic and cultural settings may require a more thorough analysis however and as for the second the sustainability into the future this is of course partly covered by looking into long term and off site side effects of interventions and policy instruments but usually does not cover an assessment of the sustainability of operation and maintenance which so often causes a strategy to not remain effective indeed it is sustained governance we need to consider as well regarding the governance of flood risk management oecd recently issued a report titled applying the oecd principles on water governance to floods oecd 2019 in which 11 principles for good water governance oecd 2015 were specified to flood risk management literally it is stated that the oecd principles on water governance are developed on the premise that there is no one size fits all solution to water challenges worldwide they recognize that governance is highly contextual that water policies need to be tailored to different water resources and places whereas the need for tailoring is acknowledged the actual principles are quite prescriptive and formulated from the perspective of the oecd members i e developed countries whether they apply equally well elsewhere is yet to be seen in this paper we therefore adopt a more analytical investigative perspective and first try to establish how a policy context co defines current strategies as applied in different parts of the world our aim is therefore to not prescribe a certain approach too soon but to rather sensitize technical specialists and consulting engineers who work or are going to work abroad 2 research approach and set up of this paper this paper firstly explores why different flood risk management strategies are being applied in different situations and in different parts of the world and more specifically to what extent socio economic and cultural differences explain the differences in strategy relative to differences in the physical risk situation secondly we aim to make recommendations on how to account for socio economic and cultural differences in order to ensure that flood risk management strategies are not only fit for purpose but also feasible for implementation and sustainable into the future i e are truly tailored to this end we first delve shallowly into the literature on relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics as well as into common practice within the world bank and similar institutions that support development planning flood risk management projects and programmes or disaster risk reduction policies from this literature search we propose a shortlist of key socio economic and cultural characteristics which we hypothesize should be considered when analyzing a certain risk management policy context next we test our hypothesis by exploring a number of cases and comparing these to the netherlands and bangladesh as references we selected 5 cases spread over several continents and different cultures based on the pragmatic criterion that we have been or are currently engaged in flood risk management policy planning and design fig 1 our home country is our first reference case for obvious reasons though the netherlands may be regarded distinctly off average and bangladesh is the second as it is the most threatened delta in the world with the longest experience in living with floods cf zevenbergen et al 2018 whilst socio economically and culturally it is almost the opposite of the netherlands and hence an adequate counterpart for each case we described the current flood risk management strategy and subsequently tried to establish to what extent the observed differences between them could be attributed to differences in the potentially explanatory socio economic and cultural characteristics using the proposed shortlist of relevant characteristics finally we discuss our findings and try to translate our understanding into recommendations on how to proceed when designing a flood risk management strategy abroad 3 what literature says about relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics many countries have a distinct flood risk management culture often related to their history e g bubeck et al 2017 this constitutes what we may call the policy context an analysis of the policy context therefore may help understand why certain flood risk management approaches and interventions have been chosen i e in hindsight to define a policy context we may look at 1 the general socio economic context in which a management policy and related institutional setting developed e g kaufman et al 2010 and 2 the cultural normative context first however we want to emphasize that there are obvious differences in policy between well established democracies and countries that have been more centrally and autocratically led for decades centuries or ages both however have shown to be able to persist and both may have well established institutions and regardless of how a country is led or organized managing flood risk can be a concern it is important to realize that for flood risk management planning the state system is not something that can be easily changed or even influenced in behalf of a more desirable strategy and must be considered as a given it is undeniably context still we may desire to roughly qualify a particular country s governance setting which we may derive from the worldwide governance indicators wgi kaufman et al 2010 for example those representing rule of law and control of corruption the importance of the general socio economic setting is especially stressed by the united nations un the oecd the international monetary fund imf and the world bank wb and other donor institutions this setting or state of development may also partly clarify a country s priorities in flood risk management there is for example a correlation between the degree of development of a country and the degree of protection that is being aimed for in most developed countries protection levels of about 1 100 to 1 500 apply related to the magnitude of the expected economic consequences of flooding whereas in developing countries such levels are often regarded as unattainable the general socio economic context also relates to the availability of funding and willingness and capability to spend money on flood protection here we may thus recognize three other relevant characteristics namely 1 the degree of institutionalization 2 the availability of money for investments in flood risk reduction and 3 the education level of the population in general and of the responsible authorities and engineers in particular this is what we might call the institutional setting related to the general socio economic context for a first estimate the degree of institutionalization can also be derived from the already mentioned worldwide governance indicators in particular government effectiveness similarly the availability of money for investments in flood risk management can be deduced from databases on gross domestic product whether per country or per capita or translated into per capita purchasing power parity ppp as made available by the world bank wb or the international monetary fund imf the level of education in a country finally can be retrieved from the human development index of the united nations un or from a list of the oecd see wikipedia the latter specifies the percentage of a country s population that has received primary secondary or tertiary education but is limited to the oecd countries plus some other large countries only the un hdi mapped all countries and translated the outcomes into a single index with the databases on indices mentioned above we might obtain quantitative information about many individual indicators of governance economic development and human development and hence an adequate overview of a country s or regions socio economic development status this is relevant for the question how feasible expensive technical interventions requiring highly skilled personnel or computerized operation or complicated institutional arrangements would be in a certain policy setting one might say to cover the idea of governance feasibility this does however not yet cover the cultural dimension so let us have a closer look at cultural differences next in the 1980ies and 1990ies cultural differences have attained lots of interest in anthropology and sociology usually to identify the most distinguishing factors in a multi dimensional hyperspace of possibly relevant factors from a wealth of empirical research especially by groups around thompson and wildavsky cf thompson et al 1990 the factors group and grid emerged as being the most differentiating the terms group and grid represent a the degree of individualism versus collectivism and b the degree of freedom of choice prescribing free or prescribed externally imposed restrictions on choice schwarz and thompson 1990 these two factors have proved quite useful as main axes in attempts to distinguish different cultures e g sun ki chai et al 2009 the two factors also proved useful in communicating cultural theory see thompson 2002 as they allowed the characterization of four distinct perspectives of the world a hierarchist controlist an individualist market optimist an egalitarian environmental pessimist and a fatalist in turn these four perspectives helped to understand conflicting opinions on preferred policy directions as they could be translated into 1 views on how the world functions and 2 preferred management styles after van asselt et al 2001 fig 2 cf also offermans et al 2013 another possibility to characterize cultural contexts is by dimensions of national culture as identified by hofstede 2001 hofstede et al 2010 he proposes six dimensions of culture viz collectivism individualism power distance femininity masculinity uncertainty avoidance long term orientation and indulgence we consider hofstede s dimensions as more useful to understand the perceptions and behavior of individual people in a certain culture than for characterizing a national or regional cultural setting that is because the perspective of hofstede s dimensions is primarily psychological rather than related to a country s institutions and capacities to address public policy issues although the same could be maintained about thompson s factors still the perceptions and related behavior of most of the people are very relevant as the majority of the people tend to determine tacit culture one would expect that at least collectivism individualism e g germany vs usa and long term orientation e g china vs african countries are relevant differentiating factors at national level and obviously collectivism individualism is very similar to thompson s interpretation of group whereas it has already been identified as partly explaining differences in flood risk management between e g the netherland and the usa bubeck et al 2017 in contrast we consider feminity masculinity as not really relevant as it primarily describes whether it is accepted that a strong leader institution enforces his its will but if interpreted in this sense power distance is very similar as it describes whether less strong parties accept that their power and influence is limited on the other hand it is not unlikely that some of hofstede s psychological dimensions are also already partly covered by what we above called state system and dominant world view i e if we consider these as reflecting a country s culture this applies especially for power distance and indulgence 4 key socio economic and cultural characteristics a proposal from the above mentioned literature esp thompson and hofstede and practice world bank and oecd we first derived a longlist of possibly relevant socio economic and cultural characteristics next we did some profound pruning in order to derive a homologous short list of about 6 10 characteristics only we achieved this by scrutiny of each characteristic cross comparison and in many cases simply by sound reasoning we thus got rid of most redundancies and overlaps and propose the following shortlist of 8 relevant socio economic and cultural differentiating characteristics to characterize a policy context state system varying from restrained to free and from top down control to bottom up self organizing examples centrally led strong leader e g china russia democratic decentralized and strongly institutionalized germany nordic countries free market mechanism capitalism usa uk institutions presence of well established organizations rules and regulations to implement a policy and to maintain technical interventions funds availability of or access to funding for both the implementation of interventions as well as their management and maintenance skills capacity to plan design build and maintain complex technical interventions orientation long term vs short term uncertainty avoidance in a long term oriented culture a basic notion is that preparing for the future is always needed whereas a short time oriented culture considers the past to provide an adequate moral and practical compass uncertainty avoidance refers to a society s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity and hence has to do with anxiety in the face of the unknown it strongly corresponds to the difference between controlism and fatalism as reflected by support to institutionalization rules and regulations large role for authorities and experts versus the opposite collectivism individualism the extent to which people trust authorities and support public services as opposed to fostering independency and favouring private action degree of commitment degree to which all relevant flood risk management actors often primarily the responsible authorities are committed to implement and sustain a certain strategy also including commitment to integration and co operation public support likelihood of support or opposition from stakeholders and ngo s who may benefit or bear the burden of interventions and may feel unheard of these 8 the first is an unchangeable given which although it cannot be changed does constrain the freedom of choice of interventions and especially policy instruments the next three define the overall degree of development and its likely development into the future which primarily constrains how institutionally complex a policy might be and how technically sophisticated and expensive to implement and maintain technical interventions the next two characteristics orientation and collectivism individualism are the most truly culturally rooted differences they reflect the main dimensions found in cultural theory and related empirical studies and wrap together some of the cultural dimensions proposed by hofstede they further constrain the range of interventions and policy instruments that are feasible finally the degree of commitment of the responsible authorities is added as stakeholders identified it as the key to successful implementation whereas the counterpart public support by the stakeholders was considered the key to success by the responsible authorities e g klijn et al 2013 see also bogdan 2019 of all 8 factors the last two may be the most easily accommodated in the course of designing a flood risk management strategy it could therefore be questioned whether they should be part of the context analysis or part of the strategy development for our current case study analysis they are certainly relevant context 4 1 operationalization preliminary indicators in order to be able to compare our 5 cases mutually and with our reference countries the netherlands and bangladesh we operationalized our 8 proposed characteristics by using readily available indicators that allow adequate semi quantification therefore we used indicators that are available in databases covering all or at least most countries as follows for the state system we used the world bank s governance indicators rule of law and control of corruption which are closely correlated the rule of law reflects perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society and in particular the quality of contract enforcement property rights the police and the courts as well as the likelihood of crime and violence the indicator control of corruption reflects perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests both indicators are ranked as percentile so ranging from 0 to 100 and as they proved strongly correlated we simply calculated the mean for an indication of the adequacy of institutions we consider the worldbank s governance indicator government effectiveness an adequate representation this reflects perceptions of the quality of public services the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures the quality of policy formulation and implementation and the credibility of the government s commitment to such policies despite its being limited to civil i e public services and hence not covering possible private institutions we consider it a good indicator as flood risk management is largely a matter of public policy making for funds we regard the gross domestic product gdp at purchasing power parity ppp per capita a good indicator i e the purchasing power parity value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year divided by the average or mid year population for the same year this indicator takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries wikipedia gives a list of countries ranked by their ppp international monetary fund 2019 which we transformed to a measure from 0 to 100 for an mere first indication of skills we draw from the human development index hdi of undp and the global innovation index gii of cornell university et al 2019 the human development index is partly based on an education index but unfortunately also partly on gdp the gii focuses on medical innovation but its ranking is based on the presence of and relationships with science and technology clusters both rankings were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 interestingly it was found that the hdi scores much lower than the gii which might reflect inequities still we calculated their mean as the ranking was quite similar for orientation we use two of the cultural dimensions as recognized by hofstede as indicators namely long term orientation and uncertainty avoidance hofstede s dimensions already range from 0 to 100 as the correlation between the two was less than expected and resulted in different rankings we kept their individual scores and distinguish orientation 1 and 2 for collectivism individualism we can directly use hofstede s quantification for this dimension for the degree of commitment of the policy makers we have not found any worldwide database that might apply on the other hand the description of the worldbank s governance indicator for government effectiveness suggests that it includes the credibility of the government s commitment italics by us as this indicator was already used for institutions see above we have not attempted to identify any other indicator for this left out for public support we can use both hofstede s dimension power distance or the worldbank s governance indicator voice and accountability as these are negatively correlated we transformed power distance to power proximity such that both indicators are positively correlated and represent an increasing degree of potential stakeholder involvement or participation 5 case studies first we described all the cases in terms of flood risk situation governance arrangements and management strategy the focus was on understanding the specific risk situation as well as its management next we tried to identify whether the socio economic and cultural setting explained the current management strategy or desired changes to it 5 1 different physical risk contexts the 5 cases are quite different vancouver british columbia canada and the vietnamese mekong delta are both located in a delta hence relatively flat and threatened by river floods as well as coastal storm surges the mekong delta however lies in a tropical monsoon climate with extreme amounts of rainfall on the delta itself during the wet season whereas vancouver is primarily threatened by the fraser river coming from the maritime west side of the rocky mountains calgary alberta canada is also threatened by river floods originating in the rocky mountains but it lies on the continental i e dry side of the mountains the northern extensions of the great plains with a badland like topography the rivers here tend to rather lose water than grow during their flow to the east great lakes miami and fort lauderdale florida usa is special in the sense that it is very low above sea level and mainly composed of raised coral reefs and their weathering products sandy beach ridges on calcareous rocks all very permeable this implies that groundwater levels rise and drop with the tides at sea it also means that sea level rise influences the inland water levels almost proportionally and uncontrollably the coast is primarily threatened by hurricanes with huge amounts of rainfall storm surges and huge waves the democratic republic of são tomé and príncipe stp finally is an archipelago comprised of two main islands and several islets in the gulf of guinea afrika here coastal communities are being threatened by swell waves and storm surges but they are also affected by runoff from the hills and pluvial flooding the climate is tropical with average rainfall ranging up to 7 000 mm in the southeast as for the exposure and vulnerability we see large differences between the case study areas partly related to their size in são tomé and príncipe stp the rural coastal communities at risk vary in size from 270 to 3300 people and mainly live from fisheries in timber houses that are usually raised a few meters above ground level except for those closest to the beach because of the high wind speeds there vancouver and calgary instead are large cities of about 2 5 i e metropolitan vancouver and 1 2 million inhabitants town only respectively with business centres with high rise buildings downtown calgary s downtown is spatially confined and largely located on the alluvial fan of the elbow river at the confluence with the bow river this fact and the development of parts of the floodplain of these rivers for urban sprawl explains the large damage incurred during the 2013 flood an about 1 100 per year probability flood that affected 8 of calgary s population and did 7 billion dollars of damage fig 3 a vancouver s downtown in contrast lies mainly on elevated ground but parts of larger vancouver and adjacent towns are in embanked polders along the fraser river or on the actual delta miami and fort lauderdale are almost fully built up areas along florida s long coast fig 3b which is regarded the place to be for the better off americans during holidays second homes or after retirement this attracted a huge recreational industry with many hotels on the outer ridge during heavy rainfall events or storms at sea the streets are very regularly but shallowly flooded still regarded as a common nuisance rather than as life threatening except for the occasional hurricane landfall when evacuation is required vietnams mekong delta is again totally different in the sense that it is primarily agricultural with settlements since ancient times on slightly higher beach ridges and river levees each year the daily life of more than 2 million people is affected when about half the delta s surface area is flooded this normal flooding has been welcomed for ages as it supports the growing of rice fig 3d and hence contributed to vietnam being the second largest rice exporter in the world marchandet al 2012 it also explains why the people of the mekong delta are originally so well adapted to flooding pham cong cuu 2011 recently however industrial development and accelerated urbanization increasingly take up space in the delta especially near major cities such as can tho moreover agriculture has intensified opting for artificially irrigated triple rice cultivation instead of traditional double rice consequently the delta s vulnerability to extreme flooding has increased 5 2 different risk management strategies adequately but briefly characterizing the flood risk management strategy of each case is difficult if not impossible as stated in the introduction a flood risk management strategy can be defined by its content or also by its governance structure in our analysis we focused on the content only implying an interpretation in terms of the physical interventions and policy instruments applied cf floodsite 2009 asce 2014 marchand et al 2012 wmo 2017 cf fig 4 instead of presenting a systematic analysis of each case s strategy here we only give a brief characterization this is obviously selective and hence biased but a full description would require too much text the case descriptions are available on request whereas a list of each case s interventions and instruments would to our opinion not yield an adequate overview of the complexity and historical development of the different management strategies either until the 2013 flood neither the city of calgary nor the province of alberta had a clear risk management strategy since then plans were drafted which not only included an initiative to increase the protection level by flood mitigation and protection measures but also included measures to reduce the vulnerability of people and objects e g by making money available for buy outs relocate or rebuild and by issuing a building code bulletin that might be considered an indication of an underlying integrated view although there does not appear to be one common and well defined policy on preventative flood risk management neither at local provincial nor federal level instead however at all levels relevant elements of such a comprehensive strategy can be found including a legal framework dedicated departments in provincial ministries and the city flood maps warning systems involvement of consulting engineers and well established stakeholder groups watersmart solutions ltd 2013 vancouver or rather the lower mainland of british columbia relies strongly on flood defences but complemented by early warning floodplain regulation and building resilience into communities the embankments along the fraser river and its tributaries in the lower mainland have been constructed between 1968 and 1995 by the federal provincial fraser river flood control program they were intended to withstand the flood of record dating back as far as 1894 with 0 6 m of freeboard the 1894 flood was previously assessed as a 1 200 per year flood but is now considered to likely have been a 1 500 per year flood a 1 200 design flood applies for all areas along the fraser river since 2003 the responsibility for flood management and floodplain regulation was shifted from the province to local governments although the province remains involved in the infrastructure through the dike maintenance act the provincial river forecast center provides information on current water levels as well as 5 and 10 day predictions currently the fraser basin council a non profit organization comprising federal provincial local and first nations governments considers an upgrade of the infrastructure in anticipation of sea level rise and other climate change related impacts as well as an improvement of the resilience of the communities for the funding of major infrastructural projects local governments can apply to the disaster mitigation and adaptation fund dmaf which was launched by the federal government the funding of the risk assessments flood mapping mitigation planning and small scale mitigation works comes from the national disaster mitigation program funding also established by federal government in 2015 but administered by the province of british columbia interestingly the municipality of richmond a city surrounded by water from the fraser river and the ocean is the only taxing its citizens directly for flood protection the extra funds are used to upgrade the flood defences and pumping stations this municipality sticks out for its projects and taxation fort lauderdale s inhabitants primarily regard floods as a nuisance which comes with the location the town has very few technical means to control the flood hazard except raising its roads and other infrastructure and flood proofing or raising properties a strategy of constant repair and building back better it implies that for property owners buying insurance or accepting the recurrent losses is the only resort as the majority of the area lies within the 100 year flood zone buying insurance is obliged by the flood disaster protection act which the us passed in 1973 it requires participation in the federal emergency management agency s fema national flood insurance program nfip fema 2011 this calls for flood proofing has many exceptions from its policies has a cap on its payments and may ask very high rates in flood prone areas it hence favours the rich and excludes the poor still it is not actuarily sound gao 2007 penning rowsell priest 2014 sao tome and principe have three ministries with responsibilities for elements of flood risk management under supervision of a national council for the prevention and response to disasters conprec established in 2011 which is supported by undp it does however not have a formal flood risk management policy nor an official plan legal framework or budget available for flood risk management in practice focus lies strongly on disaster prevention and response with a strong emphasis on building societal resilience through individual measures the strategy does involve the protection of key infrastructure e g by floodwalls along coastal and riverine roads but the main idea is to keep the people out of harm s way as the hazards are too intense to be controlled spatial planning is hence recognized as crucial but relocating land owners from hazardous locations is found to be difficult people said they were prepared to move but not at their own costs and not from locations with obvious advantages such as the coast for fishermen or valleys for farmers to less favourable locations consequently common practice is still that property owners need to take their own measures mainly by building on stilts or on a concrete basement of sufficient height the height not being prescribed but established locally by experience because of regional differences in physiography vietnam defined strategies for flood disaster mitigation and management for three distinct geographic areas van staveren 2007 for southern vietnam the strategy reads living with floods and creating sustainable development historically there was no rationale for full flood control in the mekong delta and people lived with floods for centuries since the end of the war in 1975 this strategy has gradually been changed and the flood defence infrastructure has been extended to protect the growing cities and in behalf of agricultural intensification van staveren et al 2018 this strategy has been reinforced by mard decision 101 qd bnn tt 2015 on the master plan on rice production in the autumn winter season in the mekong delta to 2020 with an outlook to 2030 consequently the ancient system of low august dikes which left room for high floods thanh et al 2019 is now systematically being replaced by high flood defences which completely prevent the annual floods undp 2017 this policy change is sometimes attributed to the dominance of a hydraulic bureaucracy evers benedikter 2009 with intricate linkages between government and the hydraulic construction sector and an intuitive preference for modern technology this policy has however also stirred significant criticism because of the risk shifts it comes with for the heightening of the embankments results in higher flood levels elsewhere käkönen 2008 affecting cities like can tho but especially rural areas moreover the perceived better flood protection induces the so called levee effect white 1945 of investing in protected areas and thus increasing the vulnerability to flooding käkönen 2008 in the mekong delta plan mdp 2013 which was endorsed by vietnam s government as well as development partners in december 2013 a shift in mindset emerged resulting in the adoption in parliament in 2017 of several guiding principles for flood risk management including to respect natural law and practical conditions avoid violently interfering in the nature select models of nature based adaptation environmentally sound and sustainable development on the basis of actively living with flood brackish and salt water despite all the differences common to all cases was that the strategies were all quite comprehensive in the sense that combinations of many different measures and policy instruments were applied in which many actors were involved and that the strategies had all constantly been adapted in response to experience in recent events fashion and changing insights 6 results the cases compared by indicators for the key socio economic and cultural characteristics fig 5 shows how the cases score on the 8 differentiating characteristics we proposed the most obvious difference is that between the most developed countries and the least developed countries especially on the first four characteristics canada and the us very much resemble the netherlands as for state system rule of law control of corruption institutions government effectiveness funds gdp ppp per capita and skills human development index and global innovation index regarding these characteristics vietnam takes an intermediate position with a relatively high score for skills thanks to a high innovation index when we look at the 4 characteristics that rather reflect the cultural setting than the socio economic context there are remarkable differences as well as unexpected similarities for example the relatively long term orientation of the netherlands is almost equaled by vietnam which also develops a delta plan for its mekong delta the degree of uncertainty avoidance orientation 2 of the three richest countries is exceeded by bangladesh and equaled by that of sao tome and principe and the expected largest degree of individualism of the us is counterbalanced by higher scores for public support to government institutions in canada and the netherlands 7 discloser statement given his role as guest editor dr frans klijn had no involvement in the peer review of this article and has no access to information regarding its peer review full responsibility for the editorial process for this article was delegated to dr michel lang 8 is there any explanatory value in the identified socio economic and cultural characteristics the characteristics related to socio economic development i e institutions funds and skills might explain a preference for highly technical and expensive structural interventions in the rich developed countries versus more local and low cost interventions in the other cases however this difference proved not so marked in practice this may be explained by the fact that the physical setting of the cases is so different whilst also the risk level and the acceptance of risk differs vietnam s mekong delta of course heavily relies on sound flood risk management for ages already whereas calgary has hardly any history of recent flooding and can easily recover from a flood as evidenced by the aftermath of the 2013 flood and fort lauderdale is located in such a disadvantageous physiographic setting that structural flood defence measures are bound to fail anyway also notable is that for the vietnam case it was found that a strong lobby has been actively arguing for technical flood protection whilst funding agencies also prefer to invest in structural measures even when from a local and cultural perspective these are perhaps not the most preferable cf also minkman 2021 as to the acceptance of risk it is remarkable that the score for uncertainty avoidance orientation certainty in canada and the us is not much lower than that in the netherlands the score for long termism orientation long term is however quite different this could explain the relatively late development of comprehensive flood risk management policies in canada and the us although both countries seem to be increasingly aware of the need to respond to a changing climate and rising sea level for the us case this is even essential for its chances of survival at the same time the us s preference for individual action is only marginally reflected by a different score on individualism in comparison to canada and the netherlands perhaps this indicator does not so much reflect preferences about interventions as expected vietnam s long term orientation may be either considered a reflection of its dependency on sound flood risk management or as an explanation for its policy here the question arises whether culture is partly the result of a physical setting or whether culture explains how natural risk is perceived and hence the approach to flood risk management similarly the short termism of sao tome and principe can equally be attributed to the still low socio economic status of this young democracy or alternatively be considered the explanation of an apparent acceptance of living with risk of the communities along the coast which largely depend on fisheries and hence have no other option than to settle in hazardous places where vietnam and sao tome deviate strongly on long term orientation they also do on public support voice and accountability which would indicate that the vietnamese people are being ruled rather than intensely participate in policy making whereas the opposite seems true for sao tome in vietnam we indeed see that embankments are being installed or raised even when the farmers prefer their rice fields to be flooded or where they suffer from the increased flood levels in the river as its discharge capacity is being reduced it seems thus that not all stakeholders are being heard certainly not those off site but often not even those on site all in all we must admit that the characteristics we defined and the available indicators we used to qualify the socio economic and cultural setting of each case proved less of an explanation of the current flood risk management policy than we expected we already mentioned that the physical risk situation may be so important that the influence of stage of development and culture may be too small to be noticeable especially also due to the limited number and large variety of cases we investigated each with comprehensive but also complex policies but cf noll et al 2020 who looked at one type of intervention only even more importantly the in depth descriptions of the cases showed that each case has a special history which is so rich that only by a very thorough investigation one can obtain sufficient insight in the possible why of elements of the current flood risk management strategy 9 findings and discussion we argued that each flood risk situation calls for the design of a flood risk management policy tailored to the specific setting we stated that not only the physical context and risk situation are relevant for the design of such a policy but also the socio economic and cultural context we hypothesized that if that be true we ought to be able to detect differences between current flood risk management policies between different cases which could be explained by a characterization of this context we then identified key characteristics to describe the socio economic and cultural setting and selected indicators by which our cases could be compared we found that the policies in the cases show large differences but that our presumed differentiating characteristics only explain these differences to a small extent perhaps the physical conditions are much more important than previously envisaged or the number of cases is simply too small and their variety too large or our hypothesis is mistaken which we rather not admit yet after all the world bank and other funding agencies as well as oecd see a clear relationship between degree of development and being able to adequately manage flood risk whether this relationship is one way or the other or both ways is however yet to be seen does development depend on sound flood risk management or is it a prerequisite for well established institutions sufficient funding and the good skills that are needed to implement a comprehensive and effective flood risk management policy and its related interventions as for the experience with the 8 socio economic and cultural characteristics we proposed as well as with the globally available indicators we still recommend anybody who is going to work abroad to have a look at them just as a first acquaintance further a sensitive and open attitude to the culture one is going to work in seems the best recommendation not in order to simply accept or adopt its peculiarities but to prevent an insufficiently humble attitude as to the local cultural setting which might result in ineffective advice on what to do or how to do it declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20132,there is growing attention to the importance of water issues in the mining sector from companies community members investors and governments declining ore grades concerns about mine closure legacies and vulnerability to physical water risks such as water scarcity and flooding are just some of the factors suggesting that mine water issues will continue to grow in magnitude significance and complexity in this paper i introduce the water security community to key water issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector further i argue that mining companies have historically adopted an internally oriented definition of water risks and argue for greater attention to the outbound risks that may arise for other actors i conclude by discussing outstanding research challenges and opportunities that would benefit from improved engagement with the broader community of scholars working on water security challenges keywords water risk mining water stewardship water management corporate sustainability reporting responsible investment social risk 1 introduction some of the world s most sensitive ecosystems and vulnerable communities are located in regions with valuable mineral resources this poses a challenge for large scale mining and minerals processing projects hereafter referred to as mining projects which rely on water as a production input and can have long term impacts on surface and groundwater systems the mining sector s interactions with water have long been recognized as important 1 however in recent decades the physical risks of water scarcity and flooding have compromised operations across mining regions globally while water related impacts have become a central issue of concern within many community mining company conflicts 2 water is now recognized as a key business risk not only to large scale mining companies but also among the broader investment community 3 a 2018 survey of 54 of the world s largest listed mining companies completed by the cdp found that 91 of respondents were exposed to water related risks with an estimated financial impact totaling us 24 9 billion 4 mining projects have unique interdependencies with water in ways that are distinct from other forms of industrial systems such as manufacturing and refining facilities 5 mine sites typically span across large geographical areas with storage dams open to atmosphere and connected to groundwater such that the overall fluxes of water to from and within the mine lease boundary are closely coupled to local climatic conditions 6 7 there is growing recognition among those in the industry that mining companies are not only in the business of mining and ore processing but also in the business of water management this is exemplified in recent calculations by goldcorp which revealed that the quantity of water handled at some of their sites is over 15 times the quantity of material processed 8 the development of a mining project can also interfere with hydro politics creating new legal geographies for human interactions with water systems campero and harris 9 demonstrated that the expansion of desalinated water infrastructure due to new mining projects in the atacama region of chile has disrupted water supply arrangements for communities and compromised access to groundwater fraser 10 has conversely shown how a mining project in peru created a positive outcome for communities through treating and reusing otherwise contaminated water as a source of operational water supply the environmental impacts of mining on water are an important consideration across all phases of the mine life cycle from exploration to closure however the latter is especially concerning poor practices in water and mine waste management during mining projects have led to million and even billion dollar cleanup costs for example the remediation of the faro mine in the yukon territory of canada was estimated to cost more than cad 500 million in 2009 primarily due to issues associated with acid mine drainage amd 11 amd is the most widely recognized water quality issue associated with mining and can arise when the process of mining increases the exposure of sulphide bearing minerals to both oxygen and water triggering a chemical reaction that produces acid and poses subsequent environmental impacts on surrounding surface and groundwater systems 1 however mining can also pose many other water quality issues for example in the elk valley region of canada waste rock dumps from historic coal mining operations have been linked to selenium release into local catchments compromising drinking water supplies and fish habitats in downstream waterways 12 13 the overarching purpose of this paper is to introduce the water security community to key water stewardship issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector in the hope that it will inspire and motivate others to take an interest in this sector the paper reviews evolving trends in mine water issues from the perspective of diverse stakeholders with interests in the mining sector companies communities investors and governments it begins with a discussion of how mining projects use and interact with water and describes the industry s transition from a water management to stewardship approach common community concerns about mine water use are discussed and it is argued that it is important to distinguish between water issues affecting mining companies inbound risks from the ways in which mine water use can impact communities outbound risks the growing influence of investors in mine water management is highlighted and the important role of governments in regulating the mining sector is emphasized the discussion concludes by identifying directions for future research to enhance water security in mining regions 2 water use and management by mining companies 2 1 water risks in mining mining projects have a close relationship with and dependency on water the extraction of ore through open pit and underground mining methods relies on water for dust suppression equipment washing cooling and for maintaining the proper functioning of pumps drills and other equipment water is also an essential input during minerals processing for example water is the primary medium used in flotation whereby valuable minerals attach to rising bubbles to allow separation from unwanted waste material other uses of water within a mining project include the transportation of ore and waste and potable uses 14 15 the water related risks affecting mine sites are complex and diverse however the most immediate impacts on production typically arise due to physical risks associated with scarcity or flooding estimates suggest that roughly two thirds of the world s largest mines are now located in countries experiencing severe water scarcity 16 this has led to increased conflict with surrounding communities and significant capital expenditure on water related infrastructure to transport water to mines 17 unexpected drought conditions can also necessitate short term water supply investments by miners for example recent drought conditions in australia prompted some operations to transport water by train from nearby towns to sustain mineral production 18 flooding risks are equally of concern for miners when an orebody is located below the local groundwater table or in a region of high precipitation water becomes a nuisance creating hydrogeological challenges and high pumping expenditure for example the grasberg mine in the mountains of indonesia receives up to 5 m of rainfall per year necessitating a complex web of dewatering systems to prevent the collapse of its block caving operations 19 however even in typically arid environments flooding risks can be concerning for miners in 2011 the coal mining sector in australia encountered billion dollar production losses due to flooding of mining pits caused by unusually high precipitation events 20 excess rainfall is one of several factors that can compromise the geotechnical stability of tailings storage facilities and in turn contribute to dam failures 21 22 2 2 mine water accounting and reporting most major mining companies regularly report information about their water use and management practices through annual sustainability reports despite roughly two decades of public disclosures on water use previous analyses have found poor rigour and inconsistencies in water use disclosures across and even within companies 23 24 recent improvements in industry specific reporting standards such as the minerals council of australia water accounting framework mca waf 25 and the international council on mining metals icmm water reporting guidelines 26 seek to address these gaps at this stage there is insufficient data over time to evaluate if the introduction of such standards has contributed to notable improvements in the consistency of reporting practices one challenge lies in the self reported nature of the data which makes it challenging to audit and verify furthermore and as is a characteristic issue of sustainability reporting more generally companies are motivated to emphasize positive achievements rather than necessarily disclosing data in a reliable and consistent manner 27 beyond the challenges of consistent reporting there are a range of factors that can contribute to differences in the quantity of water used between mining projects 24 the type of commodity has a notable influence on water use per tonne of product for example it takes orders of magnitude more water to produce a tonne of diamonds than a tonne of coal due to the additional processing needed to separate the valuable product from the waste material 23 the ore grade of a mineral deposit i e the percentage of valuable mineral within the mined ore also influences the nature of downstream processing needed to produce the desired product consequently lower ore grades require more water and energy for processing and generate greater quantities of waste material per tonne of product 28 other factors that can influence the quantity of water used in a mining project include mineralogy which dictates the choice of downstream processing methods climate and geography and regulatory pressures a recent historical analysis from 1986 to 2016 of 359 mining company sustainability reports and environmental management reports completed by northey et al 23 found that mining projects are overwhelmingly reliant on surface water and or groundwater as a water source with limited use of third party supply e g recycled sewage potable water or sea water the reliance on the latter is likely to change in future particularly within water scarce but mining intensive regions in chile and peru where sea water use is in some cases becoming mandated for new projects 9 the analysis by northey et al 23 also revealed that companies tend to report less information about the discharge of water from their operations compared with withdrawals as the authors explain this may be because many mines may be effectively zero discharge operations with water exiting the system primarily via evaporative losses however the inadequacy of water discharge reporting leaves this reality unclear for interested stakeholders such information is particularly important for mines in water abundant regions which may have significant discharges or diversions especially in years of above average rainfall northey et al s 23 analysis also found that companies report limited information about the quality of the water used or discharged within sustainability reports i e the majority indicate total volumes i e water quantity without distinguishing between the water quality categories defined by the mca waf or icmm guidelines interestingly the authors found that water quality reporting was much more common in environmental management reports submitted to government authorities and regulatory bodies as a condition of permitting these data would however be challenging to interpret for a non specialist and even more difficult to compare with other operations because water quality monitoring is highly site specific and dictated by local conditions e g local environmental regulation mine type geochemistry climate and site management practices etc 2 3 competing goals in mine water management mining projects implement a range of strategies to improve the ways in which they use and manage water which may vary depending on local contextual conditions objectives of a mine water management system may include meeting operational water supply needs through reliable sources avoiding discharge volumes or qualities that exceed local regulations maintaining an acceptable water quality within the processing plant such that metal recovery is not compromised reusing recycling water to minimize the volume of water imported to site and or minimizing water losses such as evaporation for example 5 6 14 29 kunz et al 6 distinguishes between three overarching strategies that operations can use to achieve these objectives 1 operational changing management practices 2 technological installing new products or technologies or 3 infrastructural implementing fundamental changes to the site configuration an interesting challenge that can arise in achieving some or all of above objectives is that there may be conflict with other site goals for example there is a tight dependency between water and energy use on mines 30 31 the energy requirements for pumping water at mines can be substantial and there is hence a strong argument for optimizing water and energy efficiency objectives in a coupled manner 31 nguyen et al 30 have further shown that strategies to reduce water use can either reduce or increase overall site energy use depending on the local context for example energy intensive technologies such as advanced tailings thickening which reduce evaporative water losses during tailings disposal may result in a net reduction in overall site energy use for water scarce mines that pump their make up water supply from a substantial distance the opposite may be true for mines whose water source is located nearby there is also a close relationship between water quantity and quality on mines changes in the exposure of tailings waste to oxygen and water can affect geochemistry and increase acid rock drainage ard potential 32 therefore reducing the quantity of water sent to tailings storage facilities e g through implementing advanced tailings thickening systems could potentially contribute to new water quality challenges if not adequately managed water quality changes within a processing circuit due to improvements in the quantity of water recycled can also have negative impacts on mineral recovery 33 additionally there may be water quality implications when considering how much water to store onsite vs when to discharge excess water on the one hand storing the water received during high rainfall periods may prevent potential water shortage issues in subsequent dry periods conversely storing too much water may make it more challenging to meet water quality guidelines when the need arises to discharge water off site in summary mine water systems represent complex systems with many feedbacks whereby resolving one problem may unintentionally create another 34 35 2 4 from water management to water stewardship over the past decade there has been a gradual transition in the approach that major mining companies adopt for addressing water issues whereby the concept of water stewardship has gradually gained recognition as a desirable operating philosophy 36 37 a stewardship approach can be distinguished from a management approach in that the former considers opportunities to improve the ways that mines interact with other water users and the environment beyond the boundary of the mine lease 5 the icmm 38 identifies four pillars of a stewardship approach 1 transparency and accountability in public reporting 2 proactive and inclusive engagement with other stakeholders beyond the company 3 adoption of a catchment based approach to decision making and 4 the effective management of water within the operational boundary of the mine site water stewardship thus includes but goes beyond an internally oriented management approach the adoption of a stewardship approach by mining companies has contributed to progress across the four pillars outlined by icmm as discussed earlier section 2 2 the mining sector has made gradual improvements in its water accounting and reporting practices such that mine water use data are nowadays regularly reported in the annual sustainability reports produced by most major companies 23 companies also purport to engage more actively with stakeholders beyond the company for example participatory water monitoring committees are frequently used to facilitate direct involvement from communities in monitoring the impacts of mining on surrounding surface and groundwater resources 39 40 however there remain opportunities for mining companies to improve water stewardship implementation for example a challenge with most public facing water reporting data is that they are often disclosed at an aggregate level across many sites owned by the same company the transparency of water reporting would therefore benefit from site level as opposed to company level disclosure of water use data 23 there is also evidence that participatory water monitoring committees tend to be company led and financed rather than representing a community driven accountability mechanism 41 the question of who leads catchment scale approaches warrants further research attention as is further explored in the subsequent section 3 diverse perspectives on mine water risks 3 1 community concerns to mining companies concerns about water related risks tend to focus on the ways in which water related issues may compromise mineral production or result in reputational damage that could prevent the expansion of new projects in future 6 42 for example the ceo water mandate to which a number of major mining companies are signatories define water risks as the possibility of an entity experiencing a water related challenge e g water scarcity water stress flooding infrastructure decay drought 43 this definition does not capture the ways in which local community members may conceptualize water risks as their concerns may rather be oriented towards the longer term legacy impacts on water quality and or quantity associated with a mining project s interactions with water 36 these competing worldviews can result in very different concerns and priorities when it comes to identifying desirable operating philosophies for managing water 44 in the broader field of stakeholder engagement kemp et al 45 have also criticised the industry s use of the term social risk which they argue has been conflated to mining companies and investors social risk typically refers to inbound risks on the business that arise from social unrest to communities social risk rather refers to outbound risks with respect to how mining projects can cause social or environmental impact in this paper it is argued that this same philosophy is equally helpful for distinguishing water risks from company vs community perspectives fig 1 the above distinction has important implications for the ways in which mining companies conceptualize and respond to water related risks while mining companies often have the right skills and knowledge to address risks on both the left hand and right hand side of fig 1 company attention and resourcing typically focusses on water risks from an inbound perspective this issue partially arises because the community relations and environmental teams that focus on outbound risks are disconnected from and often undervalued by production oriented engineering departments with an inbound risk orientation 46 47 from a company perspective this is problematic because a failure to address the outbound risks of concern to local communities may contribute to inbound risks in the form of community conflicts or protests with significant financial ramifications therefore the mining sector would benefit from adopting a broadened view of water risks that recognizes alternative perspectives from surrounding stakeholders and that considers the dynamics between inbound vs outbound risks an example of a project that has suffered consequences from an internally oriented perspective on risk is the proposed but as yet undeveloped 1 4 billion tia maria mine in the arequipa region of peru 10 communities have been strongly opposed to the project since its inception due to concerns about increased competition for water and potential water contamination the proponent southern copper did not adequately recognize these concerns during the initial mine permitting process proposing the use of groundwater resources for mineral supply in 2011 after the government first approved the project s eia violent conflicts ensued leaving four people dead despite numerous resubmissions of its eia with mitigation measures to address the community concerns raised they have still not proven effective at regaining community trust 10 although the peruvian government recently gave its approval for southern copper to recommence project construction the potential for ongoing conflict remains high with local farmers environmental groups and councillors still strongly opposed to the project 48 3 2 the evolving role of the investment community the investment community recognizes the ways in which water related issues can pose risks to investment portfolios in the mining business with the physical risks of scarcity and flooding of particular concern the costs of constructing water infrastructure to supply water to mines can be a significant capex investment in water scarce areas 3 for example the chilean mining sector has had a growing reliance on desalinated seawater for water supply due to a lack of freshwater in the atacama desert where the majority of mines are located the capital and operating costs for seawater desalination and transportation have reportedly been as high as us 4 0 m3 for some mines located at up to 4000 m about sea level 49 likewise the risks of stranded assets whereby the costs of project reconstruction following a catastrophic event become prohibitive are of growing concern to mining investors 50 for example the catastrophic floods that hit queensland in 2011 caused extensive damage to coal mining projects and associated infrastructure by some estimates these production losses amounted to 1 billion weighing significantly on investor sentiment for australian stocks 51 investors are also recognizing the outbound risks posed by poor water management practices with assets encountering rebound effects due to community concerns that have compromised the development of new projects this is evidenced in statistics from the international finance corporation which reveal that in the 17 years between 2000 and 2017 58 of complaints about ifc investments in the mining sector included water issues 2 the recent rejection of the taseko mines new prosperity project in canada primarily due to concerns from first nation leaders about environmental impacts to a lake of cultural significance presents another example of how community tension can constrain mining development 52 it is reasonable to expect that investor interest in mine water issues will continue to grow the cdp a not for profit charity that runs a global disclosure system targeted primarily at the investor community has been collecting and reporting water related data from the world s largest listed mining companies for over a decade 4 the devastating brumadinho tailings dam failure in 2019 of which poor water management represented one of several triggers has prompted a widespread call from institutional investors for significant improvements in public disclosure of tailings related data 53 3 3 the important role of government the increased interest from investors and corporations in responding to the outbound risks associated with water and mining issues raises interesting questions regarding the broader political economy in which the mining sector operates on the one hand water stewardship represents an aspirational effort by corporations to collaborate with communities governments other industries and civil society to address shared water risks 54 55 a stewardship approach facilitates conversations between important actors within the same water catchment area which is necessary to ensure that diverse voices are heard and that collective goals can be implemented most effectively 56 however water stewardship efforts by private corporations have faced their critics as explained by sojamo 57 stewardship efforts may contribute to concerning levels of corporate influence over water allocation decisions and institutional capture there are heightened fears in regions where the capacity of public institutions is weak which is often the case within mining regions the risk of institutional capture may also be greatest in jurisdictions where mining contributes a disproportionate amount of economic weight compared to other water users it is for this reason that the desirable end point for water stewardship efforts should entail the strengthening of public institutions for making trade offs rather than business taking the role of arbiter and enforcer 56 p 22 one can make a similar argument regarding the growing interest of investors in the addressing the outbound risks of water and mining projects i e there remains a critical role for governments at all levels to enforce continued improvements in responsible mining practices rather than society placing an overreliance on voluntary initiatives driven by investor and corporate interests the need for effective partnerships between diverse actors will thus become ever more important 36 in establishing such partnerships the mining sector may benefit from engaging with initiatives such as the water integrity network a collaboration between public private and civil society partners which has recently sought to improve the integrity and transparency of private sector water stewardship initiatives at a global scale 58 4 discussion and prospects for future research the overarching purpose of this paper has been to introduce the water security community to key water stewardship issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector in the hope that it will inspire and motivate others to take an interest in this sector a central premise presented in this paper is that mining companies have traditionally adopted an inward focused approach to water related risks but that there is a rapidly evolving need for greater attention to the outbound risks that mines pose on local communities and the ways in which these risks can rebound back on the

20132,there is growing attention to the importance of water issues in the mining sector from companies community members investors and governments declining ore grades concerns about mine closure legacies and vulnerability to physical water risks such as water scarcity and flooding are just some of the factors suggesting that mine water issues will continue to grow in magnitude significance and complexity in this paper i introduce the water security community to key water issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector further i argue that mining companies have historically adopted an internally oriented definition of water risks and argue for greater attention to the outbound risks that may arise for other actors i conclude by discussing outstanding research challenges and opportunities that would benefit from improved engagement with the broader community of scholars working on water security challenges keywords water risk mining water stewardship water management corporate sustainability reporting responsible investment social risk 1 introduction some of the world s most sensitive ecosystems and vulnerable communities are located in regions with valuable mineral resources this poses a challenge for large scale mining and minerals processing projects hereafter referred to as mining projects which rely on water as a production input and can have long term impacts on surface and groundwater systems the mining sector s interactions with water have long been recognized as important 1 however in recent decades the physical risks of water scarcity and flooding have compromised operations across mining regions globally while water related impacts have become a central issue of concern within many community mining company conflicts 2 water is now recognized as a key business risk not only to large scale mining companies but also among the broader investment community 3 a 2018 survey of 54 of the world s largest listed mining companies completed by the cdp found that 91 of respondents were exposed to water related risks with an estimated financial impact totaling us 24 9 billion 4 mining projects have unique interdependencies with water in ways that are distinct from other forms of industrial systems such as manufacturing and refining facilities 5 mine sites typically span across large geographical areas with storage dams open to atmosphere and connected to groundwater such that the overall fluxes of water to from and within the mine lease boundary are closely coupled to local climatic conditions 6 7 there is growing recognition among those in the industry that mining companies are not only in the business of mining and ore processing but also in the business of water management this is exemplified in recent calculations by goldcorp which revealed that the quantity of water handled at some of their sites is over 15 times the quantity of material processed 8 the development of a mining project can also interfere with hydro politics creating new legal geographies for human interactions with water systems campero and harris 9 demonstrated that the expansion of desalinated water infrastructure due to new mining projects in the atacama region of chile has disrupted water supply arrangements for communities and compromised access to groundwater fraser 10 has conversely shown how a mining project in peru created a positive outcome for communities through treating and reusing otherwise contaminated water as a source of operational water supply the environmental impacts of mining on water are an important consideration across all phases of the mine life cycle from exploration to closure however the latter is especially concerning poor practices in water and mine waste management during mining projects have led to million and even billion dollar cleanup costs for example the remediation of the faro mine in the yukon territory of canada was estimated to cost more than cad 500 million in 2009 primarily due to issues associated with acid mine drainage amd 11 amd is the most widely recognized water quality issue associated with mining and can arise when the process of mining increases the exposure of sulphide bearing minerals to both oxygen and water triggering a chemical reaction that produces acid and poses subsequent environmental impacts on surrounding surface and groundwater systems 1 however mining can also pose many other water quality issues for example in the elk valley region of canada waste rock dumps from historic coal mining operations have been linked to selenium release into local catchments compromising drinking water supplies and fish habitats in downstream waterways 12 13 the overarching purpose of this paper is to introduce the water security community to key water stewardship issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector in the hope that it will inspire and motivate others to take an interest in this sector the paper reviews evolving trends in mine water issues from the perspective of diverse stakeholders with interests in the mining sector companies communities investors and governments it begins with a discussion of how mining projects use and interact with water and describes the industry s transition from a water management to stewardship approach common community concerns about mine water use are discussed and it is argued that it is important to distinguish between water issues affecting mining companies inbound risks from the ways in which mine water use can impact communities outbound risks the growing influence of investors in mine water management is highlighted and the important role of governments in regulating the mining sector is emphasized the discussion concludes by identifying directions for future research to enhance water security in mining regions 2 water use and management by mining companies 2 1 water risks in mining mining projects have a close relationship with and dependency on water the extraction of ore through open pit and underground mining methods relies on water for dust suppression equipment washing cooling and for maintaining the proper functioning of pumps drills and other equipment water is also an essential input during minerals processing for example water is the primary medium used in flotation whereby valuable minerals attach to rising bubbles to allow separation from unwanted waste material other uses of water within a mining project include the transportation of ore and waste and potable uses 14 15 the water related risks affecting mine sites are complex and diverse however the most immediate impacts on production typically arise due to physical risks associated with scarcity or flooding estimates suggest that roughly two thirds of the world s largest mines are now located in countries experiencing severe water scarcity 16 this has led to increased conflict with surrounding communities and significant capital expenditure on water related infrastructure to transport water to mines 17 unexpected drought conditions can also necessitate short term water supply investments by miners for example recent drought conditions in australia prompted some operations to transport water by train from nearby towns to sustain mineral production 18 flooding risks are equally of concern for miners when an orebody is located below the local groundwater table or in a region of high precipitation water becomes a nuisance creating hydrogeological challenges and high pumping expenditure for example the grasberg mine in the mountains of indonesia receives up to 5 m of rainfall per year necessitating a complex web of dewatering systems to prevent the collapse of its block caving operations 19 however even in typically arid environments flooding risks can be concerning for miners in 2011 the coal mining sector in australia encountered billion dollar production losses due to flooding of mining pits caused by unusually high precipitation events 20 excess rainfall is one of several factors that can compromise the geotechnical stability of tailings storage facilities and in turn contribute to dam failures 21 22 2 2 mine water accounting and reporting most major mining companies regularly report information about their water use and management practices through annual sustainability reports despite roughly two decades of public disclosures on water use previous analyses have found poor rigour and inconsistencies in water use disclosures across and even within companies 23 24 recent improvements in industry specific reporting standards such as the minerals council of australia water accounting framework mca waf 25 and the international council on mining metals icmm water reporting guidelines 26 seek to address these gaps at this stage there is insufficient data over time to evaluate if the introduction of such standards has contributed to notable improvements in the consistency of reporting practices one challenge lies in the self reported nature of the data which makes it challenging to audit and verify furthermore and as is a characteristic issue of sustainability reporting more generally companies are motivated to emphasize positive achievements rather than necessarily disclosing data in a reliable and consistent manner 27 beyond the challenges of consistent reporting there are a range of factors that can contribute to differences in the quantity of water used between mining projects 24 the type of commodity has a notable influence on water use per tonne of product for example it takes orders of magnitude more water to produce a tonne of diamonds than a tonne of coal due to the additional processing needed to separate the valuable product from the waste material 23 the ore grade of a mineral deposit i e the percentage of valuable mineral within the mined ore also influences the nature of downstream processing needed to produce the desired product consequently lower ore grades require more water and energy for processing and generate greater quantities of waste material per tonne of product 28 other factors that can influence the quantity of water used in a mining project include mineralogy which dictates the choice of downstream processing methods climate and geography and regulatory pressures a recent historical analysis from 1986 to 2016 of 359 mining company sustainability reports and environmental management reports completed by northey et al 23 found that mining projects are overwhelmingly reliant on surface water and or groundwater as a water source with limited use of third party supply e g recycled sewage potable water or sea water the reliance on the latter is likely to change in future particularly within water scarce but mining intensive regions in chile and peru where sea water use is in some cases becoming mandated for new projects 9 the analysis by northey et al 23 also revealed that companies tend to report less information about the discharge of water from their operations compared with withdrawals as the authors explain this may be because many mines may be effectively zero discharge operations with water exiting the system primarily via evaporative losses however the inadequacy of water discharge reporting leaves this reality unclear for interested stakeholders such information is particularly important for mines in water abundant regions which may have significant discharges or diversions especially in years of above average rainfall northey et al s 23 analysis also found that companies report limited information about the quality of the water used or discharged within sustainability reports i e the majority indicate total volumes i e water quantity without distinguishing between the water quality categories defined by the mca waf or icmm guidelines interestingly the authors found that water quality reporting was much more common in environmental management reports submitted to government authorities and regulatory bodies as a condition of permitting these data would however be challenging to interpret for a non specialist and even more difficult to compare with other operations because water quality monitoring is highly site specific and dictated by local conditions e g local environmental regulation mine type geochemistry climate and site management practices etc 2 3 competing goals in mine water management mining projects implement a range of strategies to improve the ways in which they use and manage water which may vary depending on local contextual conditions objectives of a mine water management system may include meeting operational water supply needs through reliable sources avoiding discharge volumes or qualities that exceed local regulations maintaining an acceptable water quality within the processing plant such that metal recovery is not compromised reusing recycling water to minimize the volume of water imported to site and or minimizing water losses such as evaporation for example 5 6 14 29 kunz et al 6 distinguishes between three overarching strategies that operations can use to achieve these objectives 1 operational changing management practices 2 technological installing new products or technologies or 3 infrastructural implementing fundamental changes to the site configuration an interesting challenge that can arise in achieving some or all of above objectives is that there may be conflict with other site goals for example there is a tight dependency between water and energy use on mines 30 31 the energy requirements for pumping water at mines can be substantial and there is hence a strong argument for optimizing water and energy efficiency objectives in a coupled manner 31 nguyen et al 30 have further shown that strategies to reduce water use can either reduce or increase overall site energy use depending on the local context for example energy intensive technologies such as advanced tailings thickening which reduce evaporative water losses during tailings disposal may result in a net reduction in overall site energy use for water scarce mines that pump their make up water supply from a substantial distance the opposite may be true for mines whose water source is located nearby there is also a close relationship between water quantity and quality on mines changes in the exposure of tailings waste to oxygen and water can affect geochemistry and increase acid rock drainage ard potential 32 therefore reducing the quantity of water sent to tailings storage facilities e g through implementing advanced tailings thickening systems could potentially contribute to new water quality challenges if not adequately managed water quality changes within a processing circuit due to improvements in the quantity of water recycled can also have negative impacts on mineral recovery 33 additionally there may be water quality implications when considering how much water to store onsite vs when to discharge excess water on the one hand storing the water received during high rainfall periods may prevent potential water shortage issues in subsequent dry periods conversely storing too much water may make it more challenging to meet water quality guidelines when the need arises to discharge water off site in summary mine water systems represent complex systems with many feedbacks whereby resolving one problem may unintentionally create another 34 35 2 4 from water management to water stewardship over the past decade there has been a gradual transition in the approach that major mining companies adopt for addressing water issues whereby the concept of water stewardship has gradually gained recognition as a desirable operating philosophy 36 37 a stewardship approach can be distinguished from a management approach in that the former considers opportunities to improve the ways that mines interact with other water users and the environment beyond the boundary of the mine lease 5 the icmm 38 identifies four pillars of a stewardship approach 1 transparency and accountability in public reporting 2 proactive and inclusive engagement with other stakeholders beyond the company 3 adoption of a catchment based approach to decision making and 4 the effective management of water within the operational boundary of the mine site water stewardship thus includes but goes beyond an internally oriented management approach the adoption of a stewardship approach by mining companies has contributed to progress across the four pillars outlined by icmm as discussed earlier section 2 2 the mining sector has made gradual improvements in its water accounting and reporting practices such that mine water use data are nowadays regularly reported in the annual sustainability reports produced by most major companies 23 companies also purport to engage more actively with stakeholders beyond the company for example participatory water monitoring committees are frequently used to facilitate direct involvement from communities in monitoring the impacts of mining on surrounding surface and groundwater resources 39 40 however there remain opportunities for mining companies to improve water stewardship implementation for example a challenge with most public facing water reporting data is that they are often disclosed at an aggregate level across many sites owned by the same company the transparency of water reporting would therefore benefit from site level as opposed to company level disclosure of water use data 23 there is also evidence that participatory water monitoring committees tend to be company led and financed rather than representing a community driven accountability mechanism 41 the question of who leads catchment scale approaches warrants further research attention as is further explored in the subsequent section 3 diverse perspectives on mine water risks 3 1 community concerns to mining companies concerns about water related risks tend to focus on the ways in which water related issues may compromise mineral production or result in reputational damage that could prevent the expansion of new projects in future 6 42 for example the ceo water mandate to which a number of major mining companies are signatories define water risks as the possibility of an entity experiencing a water related challenge e g water scarcity water stress flooding infrastructure decay drought 43 this definition does not capture the ways in which local community members may conceptualize water risks as their concerns may rather be oriented towards the longer term legacy impacts on water quality and or quantity associated with a mining project s interactions with water 36 these competing worldviews can result in very different concerns and priorities when it comes to identifying desirable operating philosophies for managing water 44 in the broader field of stakeholder engagement kemp et al 45 have also criticised the industry s use of the term social risk which they argue has been conflated to mining companies and investors social risk typically refers to inbound risks on the business that arise from social unrest to communities social risk rather refers to outbound risks with respect to how mining projects can cause social or environmental impact in this paper it is argued that this same philosophy is equally helpful for distinguishing water risks from company vs community perspectives fig 1 the above distinction has important implications for the ways in which mining companies conceptualize and respond to water related risks while mining companies often have the right skills and knowledge to address risks on both the left hand and right hand side of fig 1 company attention and resourcing typically focusses on water risks from an inbound perspective this issue partially arises because the community relations and environmental teams that focus on outbound risks are disconnected from and often undervalued by production oriented engineering departments with an inbound risk orientation 46 47 from a company perspective this is problematic because a failure to address the outbound risks of concern to local communities may contribute to inbound risks in the form of community conflicts or protests with significant financial ramifications therefore the mining sector would benefit from adopting a broadened view of water risks that recognizes alternative perspectives from surrounding stakeholders and that considers the dynamics between inbound vs outbound risks an example of a project that has suffered consequences from an internally oriented perspective on risk is the proposed but as yet undeveloped 1 4 billion tia maria mine in the arequipa region of peru 10 communities have been strongly opposed to the project since its inception due to concerns about increased competition for water and potential water contamination the proponent southern copper did not adequately recognize these concerns during the initial mine permitting process proposing the use of groundwater resources for mineral supply in 2011 after the government first approved the project s eia violent conflicts ensued leaving four people dead despite numerous resubmissions of its eia with mitigation measures to address the community concerns raised they have still not proven effective at regaining community trust 10 although the peruvian government recently gave its approval for southern copper to recommence project construction the potential for ongoing conflict remains high with local farmers environmental groups and councillors still strongly opposed to the project 48 3 2 the evolving role of the investment community the investment community recognizes the ways in which water related issues can pose risks to investment portfolios in the mining business with the physical risks of scarcity and flooding of particular concern the costs of constructing water infrastructure to supply water to mines can be a significant capex investment in water scarce areas 3 for example the chilean mining sector has had a growing reliance on desalinated seawater for water supply due to a lack of freshwater in the atacama desert where the majority of mines are located the capital and operating costs for seawater desalination and transportation have reportedly been as high as us 4 0 m3 for some mines located at up to 4000 m about sea level 49 likewise the risks of stranded assets whereby the costs of project reconstruction following a catastrophic event become prohibitive are of growing concern to mining investors 50 for example the catastrophic floods that hit queensland in 2011 caused extensive damage to coal mining projects and associated infrastructure by some estimates these production losses amounted to 1 billion weighing significantly on investor sentiment for australian stocks 51 investors are also recognizing the outbound risks posed by poor water management practices with assets encountering rebound effects due to community concerns that have compromised the development of new projects this is evidenced in statistics from the international finance corporation which reveal that in the 17 years between 2000 and 2017 58 of complaints about ifc investments in the mining sector included water issues 2 the recent rejection of the taseko mines new prosperity project in canada primarily due to concerns from first nation leaders about environmental impacts to a lake of cultural significance presents another example of how community tension can constrain mining development 52 it is reasonable to expect that investor interest in mine water issues will continue to grow the cdp a not for profit charity that runs a global disclosure system targeted primarily at the investor community has been collecting and reporting water related data from the world s largest listed mining companies for over a decade 4 the devastating brumadinho tailings dam failure in 2019 of which poor water management represented one of several triggers has prompted a widespread call from institutional investors for significant improvements in public disclosure of tailings related data 53 3 3 the important role of government the increased interest from investors and corporations in responding to the outbound risks associated with water and mining issues raises interesting questions regarding the broader political economy in which the mining sector operates on the one hand water stewardship represents an aspirational effort by corporations to collaborate with communities governments other industries and civil society to address shared water risks 54 55 a stewardship approach facilitates conversations between important actors within the same water catchment area which is necessary to ensure that diverse voices are heard and that collective goals can be implemented most effectively 56 however water stewardship efforts by private corporations have faced their critics as explained by sojamo 57 stewardship efforts may contribute to concerning levels of corporate influence over water allocation decisions and institutional capture there are heightened fears in regions where the capacity of public institutions is weak which is often the case within mining regions the risk of institutional capture may also be greatest in jurisdictions where mining contributes a disproportionate amount of economic weight compared to other water users it is for this reason that the desirable end point for water stewardship efforts should entail the strengthening of public institutions for making trade offs rather than business taking the role of arbiter and enforcer 56 p 22 one can make a similar argument regarding the growing interest of investors in the addressing the outbound risks of water and mining projects i e there remains a critical role for governments at all levels to enforce continued improvements in responsible mining practices rather than society placing an overreliance on voluntary initiatives driven by investor and corporate interests the need for effective partnerships between diverse actors will thus become ever more important 36 in establishing such partnerships the mining sector may benefit from engaging with initiatives such as the water integrity network a collaboration between public private and civil society partners which has recently sought to improve the integrity and transparency of private sector water stewardship initiatives at a global scale 58 4 discussion and prospects for future research the overarching purpose of this paper has been to introduce the water security community to key water stewardship issues as they relate to the large scale mining sector in the hope that it will inspire and motivate others to take an interest in this sector a central premise presented in this paper is that mining companies have traditionally adopted an inward focused approach to water related risks but that there is a rapidly evolving need for greater attention to the outbound risks that mines pose on local communities and the ways in which these risks can rebound back on the corporation heightened investor pressure and community concerns are just some of the diverse perspectives and viewpoints that warrant further research attention to be successful this will require a research approach which is both interdisciplinary transcending academic disciplines as well as transdisciplinary engaging diverse actors from beyond academe to resolve real world problems 59 in

20133,this paper presents a research project spanning over 15 years dealing with territorial resilience to flooding this paper presents a global retrospective view on how research on the concept of resilience began with a primary focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks these infrastructures are always identified by experts as an aggravating factor leading to territorial systems disruptions the focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks served as an important first step to improve knowledge on mechanism failures and their impacts on communities however this first step was insufficient in providing more resilient systems and territories to floods today other approaches are useful for implementing strategies of resilience to answer city managers needs such as organizational strategies including participative tools long term resilience is addressed within this research for territorial resilience monitoring and planning this article is primarily based and illustrated on the research projects and scientific advances conducted by the authors keywords urban resilience critical infrastructure spatial decision support systems resilience assessment observatory 1 introduction in a context of climate change urban areas are facing an increase in the recurrence and intensity of disasters among these disasters floods have impacted up to 2 billion people over the period 1998 2017 european environment agency 2017 faced with these challenges and related uncertainties urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to urban networks disruption risks these disruptions can therefore produce cascading effects impacting areas that were originally not at risk or vulnerable boin and mcconnell 2007 these service disruptions weaken urban areas and activities and raise questions about risk management risk management in itself has had to evolve in order to adapt to these new risks and uncertainties related to climate change and the concentration of issues economic dynamics buildings infrastructure assets social dynamics political trends etc in urban areas the concept of resilience has therefore been gradually integrated into risk management in order to prepare territories and populations for the increasing hazards and their consequences to relaunch an activity resilience has been integrated into risk management since the 2000s campanella 2006 but it is still an unclear concept today and poorly integrated into risk management strategies a variety of definitions exist today in hopes of clarifying the concept of resilience meerow et al 2016

territory components in order to analyze its risk reaction however the current understanding and operationalizing of the concept of resilience is limited and remains an important issue which must be addressed this research is principally divided into two approaches a technical functional approach and a more organizational approach serre 2018 serre and heinzlef 2018 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the technical functional approach focuses on assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure which concentrate all urban functions escarameia and stone 2013 kunz et al 2013 pescaroli and kelman 2017 pescaroli and nones 2016 and their ability to withstand and recover from a disruption these critical infrastructure are considered essential for the political territory well being and territorial dynamics it includes infrastructure such as telecommunication energy transport networks emergency services critical buildings hospitals defense institutions etc water and food supply cyber or economic interactions etc among these critical infrastructure urban networks illustrate and concentrate several issues in order to improve the resilience of cities technical networks have already been identified as entry points for failures serre 2018 lhomme et al 2013 and therefore constitute the systems on which technical and management measures will focus indeed networks behave both as propagators of failure through their geographical extension and interdependencies and are at the same time essential for reconstruction serre 2016 networks are thus the nervous system of the city in which the slightest failure can have significant consequences on the entire urban system gonzva et al 2017 assessing the urban technical networks resilience therefore appears to be a critical step to increase cities resilience to guide the responses to reduce the effects of floods such as network improvements evacuation recommendations prioritization of interventions etc robert and morabito 2009 mcnally et al 2007 the organizational approach seeks to approach resilience from a more general analyse perspective than technical functional resilience toubin et al 2015 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 2020a resilience is a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach that integrates many social and territorial elements both tangible such as critical infrastructure buildings and so on and intangible such as cultural aspects asprone et al 2014 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b assessing the resilience potential of an organization or territory is necessary to mobilize managers in order to lead to the anticipation of disruptive events and the planning of management measures the idea is to understand all the elements that promote resilience namely a better response from critical infrastructures the built environment managers local actors and residents in order to cope with a disruption and restart an activity and a dynamic in response to it heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the objective of this article is to present the methodologies and results coming from these two main approaches namely the technical functional and organizational approaches leading to a clearer urban resilience operationalization faced with various limitations raised by current studies this article proposes to develop the contribution of new techniques and research perspectives in particular through the development of spatial decision support systems under the form of a resilience observatory the first portion of this article presents the challenges of urban flood risks and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures while the second and third portions describe different approaches based on the technical functional analysis of resilience and the advantages and limits of organizational approaches respectively the final portion presents the perspectives of authors focused on the resilience observatory project in order to respond to the challenges of planning and decision making processes in risk management strategies 2 vulnerable infrastructure a critical issue for flood risk management urban areas concentrate economic political human technical and urban challenges on increasingly limited geographical areas areas that are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the climate disasters among these urban areas some infrastructure are more or less essential to the functioning of the territory these critical infrastructure ci concentrate all the main functions which are necessary for the proper functioning of a territory serre and heinzlef 2018 these ci can represent systems facilities technologies networks assets and services essential to the health safety security or economic well being of inhabitants and the effective functioning of government fig 1 critical infrastructure can be stand alone or interconnected and interdependent most of these critical infrastructure interact however these interactions are often complex and unrecognized because they transcend the geographic political cultural and organizational boundaries of the systems fekete et al 2015 for example the fall of the world trade center towers in new york in 2001 caused among other things a breakdown of the web in south africa germany italy and romania disruptions of critical infrastructure could result in catastrophic loss of life adverse economic effects and significant harm to public confidence these interdependencies then play the role of a risk diffusion factor lhomme et al 2013 according to the concept of the domino effects bach et al 2014 galland 2010 nones and pescaroli 2016 pescaroli and nones 2016 i e a chain reaction causing changes in a territory some areas come to be impacted by the disaster even if they were not located in the same area directly in the flood hazard extension zone among these ci urban networks are a good example in an interconnected world urban networks connect more and more people and territories and offer a wide variety of resources and opportunities however they also create complex situations of interdependence public transport electricity gas telephone heating waste etc make the management of the urban system more complex serre and heinzlef 2018 while they are essential for creating dynamics relationships economies these networks are also extremely vulnerable in the event of a crisis on account of their interconnectivity all urban operations depend on them serre 2018 a single failure can have cascading effects and disturb the entire network and because of the reticular aspects of urban systems the whole city serre 2016 therefore some damages are not caused by direct physical damage but by the interruption of activities supported by critical infrastructure heinzlef et al 2020a a distinction is made between direct and indirect impacts nones and pescaroli 2016 direct impacts are directly caused by the disaster and may refer for example to damages to physical elements furniture buildings stocks equipment etc impacts become indirect when they are not caused by the disaster itself indirect impacts can be related to the interruption or damage of critical infrastructure service the dependencies of a city which relies on critical infrastructure increases the vulnerability of cities to risks aggravated by the emergence of new risks and uncertainties to face such a challenge risk management is beginning to evolve especially in integrating the concept of resilience as a concept with multiple interpretations resilience remains complex to operationalize and integrate into risk management strategies at least at local scales several methodological approaches have emerged in order to respond to these limits of appropriation among these approaches critical infrastructure interdependencies were useful to first increase knowledge in this area 3 modelling critical infrastructure networks interdependencies a partial view of urban resilience this part is partly based on an approach we designed within a european fp7 project namely floodprobe and described in this report floodprobe 2013 http www floodprobe eu partner assets documents floodprobe deliverable report task21 4march2013 pdf we invite the interested reader to read this report for a full presentation of the step wise approach we developed below we present only the most advanced step to integrate critical infrastructure networks interdependencies unpublished in scientific journals at this time this corresponds to step 4 only of the fig 3 most critical infrastructure systems interact peerenboom 2001 through direct connectivity policies and procedures or geospatial proximity floodprobe 2013 the modelling and analysis of interdependencies between critical infrastructure elements is a relatively new and very important field of study pederson et al 2006 it illustrates common representations of infrastructures based on the scenario of a flooding event and the subsequent response there are ties and dependencies within each infrastructure and between the different sectors the solid lines in crossing sectors and connecting nodes represent internal dependencies fig 2 while the dashed lines represent dependencies that also exist between different infrastructures infrastructure interdependencies floodprobe 2013 the failure of one ci may cause disruption in others for instance the utility of traffic control in a municipality is generally provided by a system of three cis power grid telecommunication network and traffic control boxes however the proper functioning of the three ci system components is only a necessary condition for the normal operation of the traffic control system it alone is not sufficient the criteria for the connections between the three ics such as the nature and extent of their bonding or the self regulating and management mechanisms are essential elements for the proper functioning of the traffic control system but only exist when the three ics are interconnected mcnally et al 2007 ci can be considered as complex systems which can be defined as follows traditionally a system is said to be complex if its attributes are commonly out of the norm as compared with other systems complex systems are characterized by having a large number of dimensions nonlinear or nonexistent models strong interactions unknown or inherently random plant parameters time delays in the dynamical structure etc jamshidi 1983 additional characteristics of complex systems are an adaptive emergent behavior and feedback loops cis can be described as a system of systems a system of systems sos consists of multiple heterogeneous distributed occasionally independently operating systems embedded in networks at multiple levels which evolve over time delaurentis and duffy 2007 alternatively system of systems can be defined using the term complex systems systems of systems are large scale concurrent and distributed systems that are comprised of complex systems kotov 1997 the questions are how to deal with the complexity and how to model such systems consequently it is important to draw distinctions between two related but different concepts a ci system and a system of cis hall et al 2013 a ci system is an assemblage of functional objects fratini et al 2012 that provides a certain essential good or service a power supply system for example provides electrical service through the synergistic interactions among its components the power plant substations transformers and transmission and distribution lines at the same time a ci system is also a part of an even larger system a system of cis which offers a range of public goods and services through the collaborative operations of or interdependencies among its individual ci system components the behavior of a system of cis as a manifestation of the usually complex interdependencies cannot be fully described and understood by the behaviors of its ci system components rinaldi et al 2001 in the case of flooding hoang and fenner 2016 it is essential for the functioning of the society to know where are the weak points in urban infrastructure networks floodprobe 2013 this knowledge is essential for flood risk management and mitigation measures some municipalities and other local governments are already well prepared and have a running flood risk management plan others have not even started the dialogue between the many people and institutions which are responsible in the case of flood events the stepwise approach provides a guide for risk assessment from a basic to an advanced assessment process fig 3 starting with simple generic risk analyses continuing with a computer based tool showing the weakest infrastructure asset in a municipality including existing urban flood simulation and risk mapping and concluding with gis based numerical model and risk mapping provides the framework support in the entire assessment process floodprobe 2013 the first two general approaches increase the awareness of the driving forces for flood risk management and mitigation step three flood risk mapping previously referred to as the classical risk assessment methodology until today is an essential input for step 4 which shows the interdependencies between critical infrastructures the weak nodes in the system and sub system and the cascading effects all four steps can be run independently indeed these steps are adapted according to the risk data of the different municipalities depending on their knowledge skills advances tools the analysis can either implement the 4 steps or develop some of them according to the needs these steps do not depend on a chronological order but on expressed and observed needs deciding which steps are required depends on the aim of the user and of the outcomes of the first steps however if the first steps show that there are cis at risk from flooding the latter two steps are needed to provide a full picture of the flood risks for cis it is an essential and crucial part and its success mainly depends on the good will of the stakeholders the last step can be difficult to understand and used by managers due to the over technicality which complicates the urban managers appropriation furthermore an urban territory is composed by several components integrating social dimensions age of population professional situation habits etc economic dynamics land uses etc analyzing and understanding urban resilience needs to consider all these characteristics and elements in order to study the complexity of urban risks therefore this primarily urban engineering approach must be processed with a more organizational and participative approaches to operationalize the concept of resilience heinzlef et al 2020a to answer this issue recent research on critical infrastructure interdependencies is taking three main directions an engineering path leading to direct collaboration between experts and operators this comes in the form of performance engineering civil engineering and complex project engineering robert and morabito 2009 the second path consists in developing collaborative approaches mixing modelling sciences and social sciences to better involve the majority of important stakeholders localized on specific territories heinzlef et al 2020b finally the methods we developed to model critical infrastructure networks interdependencies lhomme et al 2013 was a way to model the effects of flood propagation in cities as well as their consequences on a specific network and its cascading effects on others such a result is based on an urban complex analysis interested readers can consult serre et al 2008 bambara et al 2015 4 achieving flood resilience through organizational answers a more comprehensive approach faced with the limitations of a network centric and technical functional approach a more global and comprehensive approach has been developed this approach sought to address several pitfalls namely the measurement and mapping of resilience the visualization and understanding of the concept and the appropriation of the concept by local stakeholders heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 4 1 assessing resilience a large part of operationalization consists in determining how a concept can be measured and selecting which indicators will be used to measure the concept in order to generate data about it adger et al 2004 the assessment of resilience is therefore a matter of measurement and the designing of indicators dauphiné and provitolo 2007 the use of indicators has spread in the field of risk the measurement of territories and populations vulnerability and resilience to risks one of the first arguments to build indicators is that by defining and characterizing a fuzzy concept indicators raise awareness of complex issues among the scientific community as well as the general public prior and hagmann 2014 furthermore resilience indicators can make major contributions to assessing community needs and objectives while aiding to set up resilience strategies cutter 2016 by providing information on the territory the risks and the level of resilience these indicators make it possible to build new knowledge by raising the awareness of the populations and by accompanying the actors towards a transition towards more resilient risk management these indicators which are useful when designing a strategy are also valuable for monitoring the progress of work decision making and progress made by a community measuring resilience has therefore become an international priority in order to build strategies to risk management winderl 2014 the question of how resilience is measured is as old and important as the concept itself prior and hagmann 2014 numerous indices and indicators of resilience have been developed in various disciplines freudenberg 2003 while some research has established global indicators physical economical and social indicators on a national scale others have favored a local scale at the infrastructure level by focusing on technical functional indicators few researches have managed to reconcile the issue of decision support with a comprehensive approach to the concept of local infrastructure cutter et al 2010 in this context of organizational resilience we developed three indicators in order to measure urban technical and social resilience at a local urban scale serre and heinzlef 2018 to address the issue of risks in urban areas the choice was made to analyze resilience over a long period of time before during and after a crisis and no longer by only following a shock heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this article has made it possible to understand the determining components useful for a resilience strategy design this positioning has allowed for a deeper more thorough conceptual framework for resilience thanks to the identification of these components three indicators were designed as below fig 4 an urban resilience indicator urban resilience embraces all urban dynamics physical such as buildings age of the building elevation for example and critical infrastructure or virtual such as economic dynamics we have analyzed the influence zones of critical infrastructure within a 100 m radius access to medical infrastructure in ten minutes tourism and economic dynamics business creation and disappearance a social resilience indicator social resilience is defined here as the ability of a population to adapt and recover from a disturbance several factors enable a population to act proactively react and redevelop activities and interactions during and after a crisis these factors may include age calculation made for example on the ratio of the elderly to the total population socio economic status education level habits government support etc in this analysis social resilience is approached as a community resilience not individual resilience a technical resilience indicator as previously established urban networks are essential in the analysis of resilience in this analysis we integrate both the diversity of networks the number of different networks within a 100 m radius and the accessibility of these networks the length in meters of public roads to access these networks in the area the data for each indicator was 90 open source after selecting the raw data the data was transformed and normalized in order to understand the frequency of each variable each raw data item was transformed into percentages heinzlef et al 2020a each variable had a weight of 1 this unique weighting is explained by the desire to avoid disparities between variables fekete 2009 as some of them are sensitive and subjective following this process it was necessary to determine the normalization normalization allows a series of values usually representing a set of measures to be adjusted according to a transformation function in order to make them comparable at specific reference points a min max normalization was performed to illustrate variable which have a positive resilience impact such as working people and young people and variable which have a negative resilience impact such as the very old or very young where each variable is decomposed into an identical range between zero worst rank and 1 best rank to create indicators with similar measurement scales and to compare them with the same set of measures heinzlef et al 2020a this research answered the local challenges of defining and measuring resilience heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this research has been developed tested and applied on the city of avignon france a collaborative approach has enabled the results of the indicators to be put in place and led to long term thinking to implement resilient risk management strategies as the research had previously focused on technical functional resilience this part allows for the understanding of resilience through a more exhaustive prism including urban social and technical characteristics in order to analyze territorial resilience in all its complexity the challenge now is to work on the accessibility of these indicators in order to make them understandable usable and reusable by different local actors in order to be able to produce a broader resilience index heinzlef et al 2020b 4 2 mapping and visualizing resilience faced with a lack of integration of resilience models in risk management plans we looked for a possible approach where the concept of resilience could better integrate future plans after having constructed a conceptual model of resilience and three measurement indicators it was decided to use geo visualization techniques to operationalize the resilience concept kwan and lee 2003 marzouki et al 2017 kurwakumire et al 2019 geo visualization techniques group together visualization practices mapping data analysis and production etc in order to participate in decision making nöllenburg et al 2007 the processing tool feature manipulation engine uses an interface instead of code lines which makes the computer script more accessible and understandable heinzlef et al 2020a in addition the accessibility updating and reuse of data is promoted by 90 use of open access data national institute of statistics and economic studies heinzlef et al 2020a this willingness to transmit research beyond the study itself was reflected in the choice of open data and open access tools in addition this willingness to promote the results is explained by the fact that urban managers do not fully understand how to use the concept of resilience in their plans heinzlef et al 2020b using known free and accessible data helps to promote understanding and use of the established methodology open data and open access tools liberate knowledge and construct knowledge goëta and mabi 2014 janssen et al 2012 the interest of the method is expressed by the local scale modelling of the elements of urban technical and social resilience and the collaborative approach with local actors heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this collaboration did not take place a posteriori to the design of the spatial decision support system but at each stage moreover each step of the script data used and results are easily understandable and accessible thanks to the choice of tools and data most models do not make their processing or databases accessible resilience is also limited to a technical functional analysis by integrating the impacts of domino effects this research led to designing a spatial decision support system that enables the visualization understanding and accessibility of treatments and results for local stakeholders heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 2020b the design was carried out in collaboration allowing local actors to integrate the methodology but also to share their expertise the spatial decision support system makes it possible to assess and map urban technical social and environmental resilience the challenge now consists in making these models accessible by changing the scales of analysis and the study area sub district neighbourhood city networks etc the idea is to think about a tool that allows for the confrontation of different scales thanks to a visualization that is easy and accessible for local actors 4 3 operationalize the concept of resilience through collaborative approaches involving local people or people directly concerned by the issues studied does not seem to be new and even less original toubin et al 2015 the richness of having people from all walks of life interact allows for exploring the world of possibilities callon et al 2001 enriching discussions encouraging cross fertilization of views on the same subject to be both more measured and more incisive in a specific field resilience a social and tricky concept is therefore a subject that requires a confrontation of views knowledge scientific and practical knowledge perceptions and interpretations nevertheless despite the population being often the first impacted by natural hazards and their difficult management the inhabitants kuhlicke et al 2011 as well as the urban services toubin et al 2015 which are nonetheless actors most directly impacted are not sufficiently involved we defend the idea that the conception of a hybrid knowledge allowing the involvement of all actors of the territory from inhabitants to managers via scientists and or facilitators would allow the operationalization of urban resilience thanks to an appropriation of the concept and stakes of urban risks heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b it would therefore be beneficial to build this shared vision and commitment around the concept of resilience an approach that would also allow a transition in the ways of conceiving the city and understanding risks in urban environments heinzlef et al 2020b we therefore propose to develop strategies for integrating resilience in a co designed manner with city s stakeholders this would allow their direct involvement as well as the application of this strategy before or during a crisis serre 2013 involvement at the level of conception may guarantee the sustainable use of the resilience concept in flood risk management strategies heinzlef et al 2020b 4 3 1 parisian case study toubin et al 2015 developed a methodology to contribute to improving conditions of urban resilience and more particularly resilience of parisian urban networks face to urban floods based on the 1910 case study indeed the paris conurbation is exposed to the risk of major but infrequent floods the inevitable occurrence of flooding is all the more worrying for the authorities as they see other major world cities hit hard sometimes a few years apart by similar events new york or prague for example the flood of 1910 is the focus of attention because it is rich in lessons for the modern paris that was already taking shape at the time it is also interesting to note that paris status as a world city embodied notably by the 1900 universal exhibition was not called into question after the 1910 flood however prospective studies show that such a flood today would be much more critical for the metropolis with its major economic and political stakes supported by complex urban services this analysis of interactions and interdependencies of urban networks allowed highlighting intrinsic fragilities of urban systems and their management in the event of a crisis toubin et al 2012 in the context of the issues observed the objective of the research was therefore to develop approaches and tools to help urban service managers to identify and implement the most appropriate characterize technical and organizational interdependencies to ensure the continuity of service despite disruption propagations in such critical infrastructure networks the approach was built by integrating urban managers of the services areas of the city of paris this research draws up and analyzes the interdependencies of parisian urban networks it highlights certain dependencies particularly those on electricity telecommunications and transportation the collaborative approach involved managers and forced them to think about strategies to mitigate or at least manage these interdependencies together in addition the collaborative process illustrated the need to move beyond isolated approaches fig 5 but rather to foster a common vision toubin et al 2015 the collaborative approach can for example be used to illustrate the interdependencies between networks fig 5 the compartmentalized risk management between public and private actors in the city s services fig 5 and shed light on the major obstacles to the implementation of adaptation of the urban system to improve its overall resilience the interweaving of scales as well of services makes cooperation and transparency between operators and decision makers indispensable for the construction of a more resilient city toubin et al 2015 4 3 2 avignon case study seeking to analyze resilience through the three measurement indicators previously identified a study in avignon put forward the collaborative approach from a more exhaustive angle serre and heinzlef 2018 the approach developed emphasized collaboration between scientific experts and local actors building a common approach has made it possible to clarify the concept of resilience and translate it into a risk management strategy this collaboration was carried out with the gis service of the city of avignon the collaboration crystallized at several stages of the research heinzlef et al 2020b after an analysis of the concept of resilience via a study of the scientific literature a confrontation between scientific positioning and the knowledge of local actors took place indeed it was necessary to reassess the envisaged indicators in light of the data used by the gis department after establishing the conceptual model of resilience with the indicators the choice of processing tools was based on those used and known by the actors the data processing and analysis was carried out at a regular frequency with the gis department as the spatial decision support system is being built a number of meetings with managers of critical infrastructures were held to test and validate the results thus each stage was confronted with the reality of the actors their understanding and their future use of the tool this collaborative approach questioned the operationalization of the resilience and proposed an approach to meet these challenges it appeared necessary to involve local knowledge habits and practices in the construction of the tool to ensure its usefulness and subsequent use vanderlinden et al 2017 collaborative strategies allow for a common knowledge to be built around a complex concept this allows fuzzy concepts to be debated dissected and operationalized a spatial decision support system was designed with and for urban managers heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the challenge is to deepen this collaborative dimension by offering a platform for meetings exchanges and local scientific expert collaboration in order to promote the operationalization of resilience in risk management strategies these previous studies have helped to address some of the challenges of operationalizing resilience nevertheless the obvious weakness of these studies is its multitude and the difficulty of local actors to integrate and understand it easily the objective of this long term work on the integration of the concept of resilience into risk management strategies is to envisage a living laboratory and an information system software structure that would bring together advances in the field and provide support for awkward resilience strategies and technical advances for scientists and local experts 5 an observatory design a long term and inclusive resilience monitoring and planning the operationalization of resilience faces two major limitations the difficult understanding of the concept itself its application to the risk management dimension the challenge of integrating resilience into risk management is part of a complex and constantly evolving context climate change and associated uncertainties faced with this climatic context and with political social economic and territorial elements that evolve there is an ever increasing need for understanding and observation serre et al 2019a heinzlef et al 2019b it is therefore a question of understanding territorial systems in all their complexity by bringing together data and information produced by and for stakeholders as a result local actors are able to come together around issues that will require the implementation of development or management actions observatories are tools whose objective is to observe monitor analyze understand on a portion of space representative of a territorial entity the socio environmental dynamics resulting from dynamic interactions of socio economic and biophysical systems they are a place of production exchange and sharing of information and knowledge that is sustainable observatories at the interface between complex reality and knowledge de sède marceau and moine 2012 are therefore effective decision making tools gayte et al 1997 heinzlef and serre 2020 territorial dynamics and structures are changing very rapidly due to political environmental demographic montgomery 2008 spatial organizational governance mendizabal et al 2018 transformations and other factors these rapid changes lead to a growing need for information and observation in order to understand these complex territorial systems de sède marceau et al 2009 observatories are therefore beneficial tools for understanding decision support tools for planners and elected officials and a place for producing exchanging and sharing information and knowledge over the long term heinzlef and serre 2020 to support territorial management this observatory has to provide diagnostic functions to perform the evaluation of implemented actions for instance it may help to have a global perception of different issues on an urban project to measure positive and negative impacts on flood risk territories it should also be associated with prognostic functions in order to have the capacity to alert and guide managers in their decision making process in the short and medium term in addition spatial decision support tools are often dependent on a specific territory and actors an observatory is a spatial decision support tool on a larger scale which can compare and confront several case studies actors experts methodologies there are currently various active observatories dedicated to the observation of the territory and space phenomena they exist in the form of a virtual structure such as for the national observatory of natural risks and the territorial observatory etc their objective is to gather analyze and disseminate data relating to territorial dynamics and disparities and to allow everyone professionals and individuals to easily access data relating to natural risks produced by organizations for a better understanding of these phenomena and their impacts however these observatories combine neither scientific advances nor local knowledge do not propose a double entity virtual structure living laboratory and stop at the data acquisition part the future observatory would be a toolbox developing refining and applying various methodologies to operationalize resilience initially conceived as a spatial decision support system an evolution towards a living laboratory would be an essential transition composed of a university team and local actors the human dimension of the observatory could enable in situ testing of resilience strategies and foster collaborative approaches fig 6 a test site will therefore be chosen according to the issues related to risks and will serve as a crucible for innovation and as a prototype observatory it is then a necessity to develop an observatory for reflection and action around the concept of resilience in the face of risk management it is one important step to prepare territories populations and local actors for climate disruption 5 1 increasing risk knowledge the primary objective of this observatory is to produce condense multiply and transmit knowledge on risks and resilience to this end defining and assessing resilience at the local level is required in order to drive a decision support process this step is built on previous research on the design of resilience indicators dealing with urban social and technical aspects the challenge is to make them generic and reusable on different case studies and for various local actors in various contexts the objective is to develop and deepen the pre existing indicators in order to nuance the analysis with in particular a governance indicator community investment of populations action policies dissemination of information concerning risks land use planning policies risk management etc 5 2 collecting data and mapping beyond enhancing the value of pre existing open access data the observatory would be a key tool for producing new forms of data tools such as uavs unmanned aerial vehicle would contribute to improving knowledge on territories at risk in a very precise manner and in particular to define the adaptive potential of these territories moreover the data acquired via uavs would be processed by the resilience observatory and could provide a valuable decision making aid for many decision makers the interest of uavs in risk management is manifold their low cost use ensures the widespread adoption of these tools serre et al 2019 in addition the automation of the tool can allow a repeatability of measurement which would be valuable in the monitoring of space evolutions leading to a more accurate and complete spatio temporal monitoring finally such tools are advantageous for accessing territories that are difficult for individuals to access in addition to data acquisition data processing and visualization will be an important area of development particularly with geo visualization techniques 5 3 engaging stakeholders since the 1990s there has been a growing interest in the geospatial dimension of data particularly in reason of the dissemination of geographic information systems and technologies andrienko et al 2007 these technologies include geographic information systems gis low cost gps equipment and satellite imagery among others appeaning addo et al 2018 recently software for the collection storage and analysis of geo referenced information is becoming increasingly user friendly thus development practitioners activists and researchers are turning to gis to increase the participation of local people in planning processes at the local or regional level and to facilitate the dialogue between policymakers and communities on the ownership use and control of natural resources as a result a growing number of community based initiatives are emerging to collect organize visualize and geo reference the knowledge of local people using what is generally referred to as participatory gis participatory gis is actually an approach born out of the combination of participatory learning and action methods and traditional gis it is based on the integrated use of tools methods technologies and systems ranging from simple map sketches to participatory three dimensional modelling common interpretation of aerial photos and the use of gps and various gis applications through participatory gis local people s knowledge is translated into two or three dimensional physical open access maps and used as interactive tools for geospatial learning information exchange decision support natural resource use planning and advocacy the observatory would therefore integrate a kind of participatory gis for local actors to promote understanding van de ven et al 2016 perception and integration of the concept of resilience into risk management strategies 5 4 a pacific resilience observatory a research project led by the ird and the cnrs has been set up in order to respond to the challenges of operationalizing resilience in french polynesia the objective of this pacific island long term resilience ilots project is to initiate reflection on a resilience observatory in order to work on the limits and biases of the concept and its operationalization serre et al 2019 building a resilience observatory prototype in the pacific islands makes sense in light of the risks to which they are exposed the french overseas islands have a high level of hydrometeorological hazards and often inadequate risk management methods tools and strategies a 2014 interministerial report also highlights the difficultly of sharing responsibilities between national and local authorities with regard to poor risk management processes with one crucial point in particular the national risk observatory does not cover the overseas territories at the same time local authorities do not seem to be willing to fully engage in risk management with the exception of hurricane related issues due to the cultural awareness of the population in the face of these hazards a more critical problem is the lack of control of land and urban development by local authorities the report also contains recommendations to improve risk management strategies in overseas regions such as the ambition to transform overseas territories into territories of innovation for risk management by engaging the scientific communities and to make urban planning a non structural measure to reduce risks by taking into greater account of the impacts of climate change the observatory project will therefore make it possible to design a framework to meet the needs in terms of scientific technical social and territorial advances thus the observatory prototype is innovative at several levels responding to an assessed need intensity and recurrence of disasters with a solution that does not yet exist carrying out the observatory with new models to assess the level of resilience to floods in a multi scale perspective space and time and using open source tools data and solutions as much as possible in order to minimize the cost of the observatory and maximize its future use this observatory project would therefore be justified from an economic point of view the emphasis on open source tools and the use of existing data that is not very valuable or not cross referenced in an enriching way to operationalize resilience makes the cost of the tool almost non existent for local actors the current costs are linked to the research teams but only financed by the scientific projects of the academic team subsequently it will be a question of training local actors in the use of the tool for these reasons a prototype toolbox such as an observatory takes on its full meaning in the pacific island territories 6 conclusion faced with the challenges of climate change and the uncertainties related to risk management the concept of resilience has emerged as an innovative and promising way to prepare territories populations and territorial actors however this concept is still unclear and difficult for local actors to understand and operationalize this article highlights two methodologies aimed at addressing the limitations of integrating the concept of resilience into risk management strategies a technical functional methodology and a more organizational one the technical approach has the advantage of responding to critical infrastructure issues and interdependencies that increase territorial vulnerability however this approach is limited because it reduces territorial complexity to critical infrastructures the organizational approach tends to respond to these limitations by proposing to analyze the different elements that make up the territory and participate in increasing and or reducing resilience while these two approaches make it possible to advance in the clarification and use of the concept by local stakeholders the multitude of tools their temporal limitation of use and their very localized action make these methodologies limited and too localized on account of this observation a global tool project has been envisaged a resilience observatory a resilience observatory would make it possible to develop a comprehensive human and computer based tool to condense compare develop and bring out different methodologies for operationalizing resilience based on several pillars defining and measuring resilience acquiring processing and visualizing data promoting and developing the integration of local stakeholders in the process of cultivating resilience etc the observatory would make it possible to reconcile local international and scientific advances in order to provide a structure for reflection and action to operationalize resilience in addition such a structure would make it possible to develop tools and methodologies that address resilience in a comprehensive and exhaustive way but also over a long period of time indeed the monitoring acquisition and use of past and current data would make it possible to apprehend the territory the risks and the resilience over the long term in order to adapt risk management strategies in the face of a spatial but also social trend this temporal dimension is essential in order to allow appropriation to consider the concept of resilience and to promote decision support such a prototype has been launched and tested in the pacific and more particularly in french polynesia in order to serve as a reference case study to develop this kind of observatory

20133,this paper presents a research project spanning over 15 years dealing with territorial resilience to flooding this paper presents a global retrospective view on how research on the concept of resilience began with a primary focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks these infrastructures are always identified by experts as an aggravating factor leading to territorial systems disruptions the focus on critical infrastructure resilience networks served as an important first step to improve knowledge on mechanism failures and their impacts on communities however this first step was insufficient in providing more resilient systems and territories to floods today other approaches are useful for implementing strategies of resilience to answer city managers needs such as organizational strategies including participative tools long term resilience is addressed within this research for territorial resilience monitoring and planning this article is primarily based and illustrated on the research projects and scientific advances conducted by the authors keywords urban resilience critical infrastructure spatial decision support systems resilience assessment observatory 1 introduction in a context of climate change urban areas are facing an increase in the recurrence and intensity of disasters among these disasters floods have impacted up to 2 billion people over the period 1998 2017 european environment agency 2017 faced with these challenges and related uncertainties urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to urban networks disruption risks these disruptions can therefore produce cascading effects impacting areas that were originally not at risk or vulnerable boin and mcconnell 2007 these service disruptions weaken urban areas and activities and raise questions about risk management risk management in itself has had to evolve in order to adapt to these new risks and uncertainties related to climate change and the concentration of issues economic dynamics buildings infrastructure assets social dynamics political trends etc in urban areas the concept of resilience has therefore been gradually integrated into risk management in order to prepare territories and populations for the increasing hazards and their consequences to relaunch an activity resilience has been integrated into risk management since the 2000s campanella 2006 but it is still an unclear concept today and poorly integrated into risk management strategies a variety of definitions exist today in hopes of clarifying the concept of resilience meerow et al 2016 belonging to multiple disciplines alexander 2013 resilience in risk management can at the same time be related to capacities of resistance to shock serre 2018 absorption cardona 2004 adaptation pelling 2003 reactivity pickett et al 2004 reconstruction walker et al 2004 learning carpenter et al 2001 klein et al 2003 rebound davoudi et al 2012 etc the main idea is that a system sayers et al 2013 is resilient if it recovers from a shock by limiting the negative impacts butler et al 2014 and subsequently restarts activities defined as the capacity of a territory and its population to plan for adapt absorb recover from learn and evolve unisdr 2009 cardona 2004 pelling 2011 walker and salt 2006 carpenter et al 2001 klein et al 2003 davoudi et al 2012 resilience has to address all territory components in order to analyze its risk reaction however the current understanding and operationalizing of the concept of resilience is limited and remains an important issue which must be addressed this research is principally divided into two approaches a technical functional approach and a more organizational approach serre 2018 serre and heinzlef 2018 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the technical functional approach focuses on assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure which concentrate all urban functions escarameia and stone 2013 kunz et al 2013 pescaroli and kelman 2017 pescaroli and nones 2016 and their ability to withstand and recover from a disruption these critical infrastructure are considered essential for the political territory well being and territorial dynamics it includes infrastructure such as telecommunication energy transport networks emergency services critical buildings hospitals defense institutions etc water and food supply cyber or economic interactions etc among these critical infrastructure urban networks illustrate and concentrate several issues in order to improve the resilience of cities technical networks have already been identified as entry points for failures serre 2018 lhomme et al 2013 and therefore constitute the systems on which technical and management measures will focus indeed networks behave both as propagators of failure through their geographical extension and interdependencies and are at the same time essential for reconstruction serre 2016 networks are thus the nervous system of the city in which the slightest failure can have significant consequences on the entire urban system gonzva et al 2017 assessing the urban technical networks resilience therefore appears to be a critical step to increase cities resilience to guide the responses to reduce the effects of floods such as network improvements evacuation recommendations prioritization of interventions etc robert and morabito 2009 mcnally et al 2007 the organizational approach seeks to approach resilience from a more general analyse perspective than technical functional resilience toubin et al 2015 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 2020a resilience is a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach that integrates many social and territorial elements both tangible such as critical infrastructure buildings and so on and intangible such as cultural aspects asprone et al 2014 heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b assessing the resilience potential of an organization or territory is necessary to mobilize managers in order to lead to the anticipation of disruptive events and the planning of management measures the idea is to understand all the elements that promote resilience namely a better response from critical infrastructures the built environment managers local actors and residents in order to cope with a disruption and restart an activity and a dynamic in response to it heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the objective of this article is to present the methodologies and results coming from these two main approaches namely the technical functional and organizational approaches leading to a clearer urban resilience operationalization faced with various limitations raised by current studies this article proposes to develop the contribution of new techniques and research perspectives in particular through the development of spatial decision support systems under the form of a resilience observatory the first portion of this article presents the challenges of urban flood risks and the vulnerability of critical infrastructures while the second and third portions describe different approaches based on the technical functional analysis of resilience and the advantages and limits of organizational approaches respectively the final portion presents the perspectives of authors focused on the resilience observatory project in order to respond to the challenges of planning and decision making processes in risk management strategies 2 vulnerable infrastructure a critical issue for flood risk management urban areas concentrate economic political human technical and urban challenges on increasingly limited geographical areas areas that are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the climate disasters among these urban areas some infrastructure are more or less essential to the functioning of the territory these critical infrastructure ci concentrate all the main functions which are necessary for the proper functioning of a territory serre and heinzlef 2018 these ci can represent systems facilities technologies networks assets and services essential to the health safety security or economic well being of inhabitants and the effective functioning of government fig 1 critical infrastructure can be stand alone or interconnected and interdependent most of these critical infrastructure interact however these interactions are often complex and unrecognized because they transcend the geographic political cultural and organizational boundaries of the systems fekete et al 2015 for example the fall of the world trade center towers in new york in 2001 caused among other things a breakdown of the web in south africa germany italy and romania disruptions of critical infrastructure could result in catastrophic loss of life adverse economic effects and significant harm to public confidence these interdependencies then play the role of a risk diffusion factor lhomme et al 2013 according to the concept of the domino effects bach et al 2014 galland 2010 nones and pescaroli 2016 pescaroli and nones 2016 i e a chain reaction causing changes in a territory some areas come to be impacted by the disaster even if they were not located in the same area directly in the flood hazard extension zone among these ci urban networks are a good example in an interconnected world urban networks connect more and more people and territories and offer a wide variety of resources and opportunities however they also create complex situations of interdependence public transport electricity gas telephone heating waste etc make the management of the urban system more complex serre and heinzlef 2018 while they are essential for creating dynamics relationships economies these networks are also extremely vulnerable in the event of a crisis on account of their interconnectivity all urban operations depend on them serre 2018 a single failure can have cascading effects and disturb the entire network and because of the reticular aspects of urban systems the whole city serre 2016 therefore some damages are not caused by direct physical damage but by the interruption of activities supported by critical infrastructure heinzlef et al 2020a a distinction is made between direct and indirect impacts nones and pescaroli 2016 direct impacts are directly caused by the disaster and may refer for example to damages to physical elements furniture buildings stocks equipment etc impacts become indirect when they are not caused by the disaster itself indirect impacts can be related to the interruption or damage of critical infrastructure service the dependencies of a city which relies on critical infrastructure increases the vulnerability of cities to risks aggravated by the emergence of new risks and uncertainties to face such a challenge risk management is beginning to evolve especially in integrating the concept of resilience as a concept with multiple interpretations resilience remains complex to operationalize and integrate into risk management strategies at least at local scales several methodological approaches have emerged in order to respond to these limits of appropriation among these approaches critical infrastructure interdependencies were useful to first increase knowledge in this area 3 modelling critical infrastructure networks interdependencies a partial view of urban resilience this part is partly based on an approach we designed within a european fp7 project namely floodprobe and described in this report floodprobe 2013 http www floodprobe eu partner assets documents floodprobe deliverable report task21 4march2013 pdf we invite the interested reader to read this report for a full presentation of the step wise approach we developed below we present only the most advanced step to integrate critical infrastructure networks interdependencies unpublished in scientific journals at this time this corresponds to step 4 only of the fig 3 most critical infrastructure systems interact peerenboom 2001 through direct connectivity policies and procedures or geospatial proximity floodprobe 2013 the modelling and analysis of interdependencies between critical infrastructure elements is a relatively new and very important field of study pederson et al 2006 it illustrates common representations of infrastructures based on the scenario of a flooding event and the subsequent response there are ties and dependencies within each infrastructure and between the different sectors the solid lines in crossing sectors and connecting nodes represent internal dependencies fig 2 while the dashed lines represent dependencies that also exist between different infrastructures infrastructure interdependencies floodprobe 2013 the failure of one ci may cause disruption in others for instance the utility of traffic control in a municipality is generally provided by a system of three cis power grid telecommunication network and traffic control boxes however the proper functioning of the three ci system components is only a necessary condition for the normal operation of the traffic control system it alone is not sufficient the criteria for the connections between the three ics such as the nature and extent of their bonding or the self regulating and management mechanisms are essential elements for the proper functioning of the traffic control system but only exist when the three ics are interconnected mcnally et al 2007 ci can be considered as complex systems which can be defined as follows traditionally a system is said to be complex if its attributes are commonly out of the norm as compared with other systems complex systems are characterized by having a large number of dimensions nonlinear or nonexistent models strong interactions unknown or inherently random plant parameters time delays in the dynamical structure etc jamshidi 1983 additional characteristics of complex systems are an adaptive emergent behavior and feedback loops cis can be described as a system of systems a system of systems sos consists of multiple heterogeneous distributed occasionally independently operating systems embedded in networks at multiple levels which evolve over time delaurentis and duffy 2007 alternatively system of systems can be defined using the term complex systems systems of systems are large scale concurrent and distributed systems that are comprised of complex systems kotov 1997 the questions are how to deal with the complexity and how to model such systems consequently it is important to draw distinctions between two related but different concepts a ci system and a system of cis hall et al 2013 a ci system is an assemblage of functional objects fratini et al 2012 that provides a certain essential good or service a power supply system for example provides electrical service through the synergistic interactions among its components the power plant substations transformers and transmission and distribution lines at the same time a ci system is also a part of an even larger system a system of cis which offers a range of public goods and services through the collaborative operations of or interdependencies among its individual ci system components the behavior of a system of cis as a manifestation of the usually complex interdependencies cannot be fully described and understood by the behaviors of its ci system components rinaldi et al 2001 in the case of flooding hoang and fenner 2016 it is essential for the functioning of the society to know where are the weak points in urban infrastructure networks floodprobe 2013 this knowledge is essential for flood risk management and mitigation measures some municipalities and other local governments are already well prepared and have a running flood risk management plan others have not even started the dialogue between the many people and institutions which are responsible in the case of flood events the stepwise approach provides a guide for risk assessment from a basic to an advanced assessment process fig 3 starting with simple generic risk analyses continuing with a computer based tool showing the weakest infrastructure asset in a municipality including existing urban flood simulation and risk mapping and concluding with gis based numerical model and risk mapping provides the framework support in the entire assessment process floodprobe 2013 the first two general approaches increase the awareness of the driving forces for flood risk management and mitigation step three flood risk mapping previously referred to as the classical risk assessment methodology until today is an essential input for step 4 which shows the interdependencies between critical infrastructures the weak nodes in the system and sub system and the cascading effects all four steps can be run independently indeed these steps are adapted according to the risk data of the different municipalities depending on their knowledge skills advances tools the analysis can either implement the 4 steps or develop some of them according to the needs these steps do not depend on a chronological order but on expressed and observed needs deciding which steps are required depends on the aim of the user and of the outcomes of the first steps however if the first steps show that there are cis at risk from flooding the latter two steps are needed to provide a full picture of the flood risks for cis it is an essential and crucial part and its success mainly depends on the good will of the stakeholders the last step can be difficult to understand and used by managers due to the over technicality which complicates the urban managers appropriation furthermore an urban territory is composed by several components integrating social dimensions age of population professional situation habits etc economic dynamics land uses etc analyzing and understanding urban resilience needs to consider all these characteristics and elements in order to study the complexity of urban risks therefore this primarily urban engineering approach must be processed with a more organizational and participative approaches to operationalize the concept of resilience heinzlef et al 2020a to answer this issue recent research on critical infrastructure interdependencies is taking three main directions an engineering path leading to direct collaboration between experts and operators this comes in the form of performance engineering civil engineering and complex project engineering robert and morabito 2009 the second path consists in developing collaborative approaches mixing modelling sciences and social sciences to better involve the majority of important stakeholders localized on specific territories heinzlef et al 2020b finally the methods we developed to model critical infrastructure networks interdependencies lhomme et al 2013 was a way to model the effects of flood propagation in cities as well as their consequences on a specific network and its cascading effects on others such a result is based on an urban complex analysis interested readers can consult serre et al 2008 bambara et al 2015 4 achieving flood resilience through organizational answers a more comprehensive approach faced with the limitations of a network centric and technical functional approach a more global and comprehensive approach has been developed this approach sought to address several pitfalls namely the measurement and mapping of resilience the visualization and understanding of the concept and the appropriation of the concept by local stakeholders heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 4 1 assessing resilience a large part of operationalization consists in determining how a concept can be measured and selecting which indicators will be used to measure the concept in order to generate data about it adger et al 2004 the assessment of resilience is therefore a matter of measurement and the designing of indicators dauphiné and provitolo 2007 the use of indicators has spread in the field of risk the measurement of territories and populations vulnerability and resilience to risks one of the first arguments to build indicators is that by defining and characterizing a fuzzy concept indicators raise awareness of complex issues among the scientific community as well as the general public prior and hagmann 2014 furthermore resilience indicators can make major contributions to assessing community needs and objectives while aiding to set up resilience strategies cutter 2016 by providing information on the territory the risks and the level of resilience these indicators make it possible to build new knowledge by raising the awareness of the populations and by accompanying the actors towards a transition towards more resilient risk management these indicators which are useful when designing a strategy are also valuable for monitoring the progress of work decision making and progress made by a community measuring resilience has therefore become an international priority in order to build strategies to risk management winderl 2014 the question of how resilience is measured is as old and important as the concept itself prior and hagmann 2014 numerous indices and indicators of resilience have been developed in various disciplines freudenberg 2003 while some research has established global indicators physical economical and social indicators on a national scale others have favored a local scale at the infrastructure level by focusing on technical functional indicators few researches have managed to reconcile the issue of decision support with a comprehensive approach to the concept of local infrastructure cutter et al 2010 in this context of organizational resilience we developed three indicators in order to measure urban technical and social resilience at a local urban scale serre and heinzlef 2018 to address the issue of risks in urban areas the choice was made to analyze resilience over a long period of time before during and after a crisis and no longer by only following a shock heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this article has made it possible to understand the determining components useful for a resilience strategy design this positioning has allowed for a deeper more thorough conceptual framework for resilience thanks to the identification of these components three indicators were designed as below fig 4 an urban resilience indicator urban resilience embraces all urban dynamics physical such as buildings age of the building elevation for example and critical infrastructure or virtual such as economic dynamics we have analyzed the influence zones of critical infrastructure within a 100 m radius access to medical infrastructure in ten minutes tourism and economic dynamics business creation and disappearance a social resilience indicator social resilience is defined here as the ability of a population to adapt and recover from a disturbance several factors enable a population to act proactively react and redevelop activities and interactions during and after a crisis these factors may include age calculation made for example on the ratio of the elderly to the total population socio economic status education level habits government support etc in this analysis social resilience is approached as a community resilience not individual resilience a technical resilience indicator as previously established urban networks are essential in the analysis of resilience in this analysis we integrate both the diversity of networks the number of different networks within a 100 m radius and the accessibility of these networks the length in meters of public roads to access these networks in the area the data for each indicator was 90 open source after selecting the raw data the data was transformed and normalized in order to understand the frequency of each variable each raw data item was transformed into percentages heinzlef et al 2020a each variable had a weight of 1 this unique weighting is explained by the desire to avoid disparities between variables fekete 2009 as some of them are sensitive and subjective following this process it was necessary to determine the normalization normalization allows a series of values usually representing a set of measures to be adjusted according to a transformation function in order to make them comparable at specific reference points a min max normalization was performed to illustrate variable which have a positive resilience impact such as working people and young people and variable which have a negative resilience impact such as the very old or very young where each variable is decomposed into an identical range between zero worst rank and 1 best rank to create indicators with similar measurement scales and to compare them with the same set of measures heinzlef et al 2020a this research answered the local challenges of defining and measuring resilience heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this research has been developed tested and applied on the city of avignon france a collaborative approach has enabled the results of the indicators to be put in place and led to long term thinking to implement resilient risk management strategies as the research had previously focused on technical functional resilience this part allows for the understanding of resilience through a more exhaustive prism including urban social and technical characteristics in order to analyze territorial resilience in all its complexity the challenge now is to work on the accessibility of these indicators in order to make them understandable usable and reusable by different local actors in order to be able to produce a broader resilience index heinzlef et al 2020b 4 2 mapping and visualizing resilience faced with a lack of integration of resilience models in risk management plans we looked for a possible approach where the concept of resilience could better integrate future plans after having constructed a conceptual model of resilience and three measurement indicators it was decided to use geo visualization techniques to operationalize the resilience concept kwan and lee 2003 marzouki et al 2017 kurwakumire et al 2019 geo visualization techniques group together visualization practices mapping data analysis and production etc in order to participate in decision making nöllenburg et al 2007 the processing tool feature manipulation engine uses an interface instead of code lines which makes the computer script more accessible and understandable heinzlef et al 2020a in addition the accessibility updating and reuse of data is promoted by 90 use of open access data national institute of statistics and economic studies heinzlef et al 2020a this willingness to transmit research beyond the study itself was reflected in the choice of open data and open access tools in addition this willingness to promote the results is explained by the fact that urban managers do not fully understand how to use the concept of resilience in their plans heinzlef et al 2020b using known free and accessible data helps to promote understanding and use of the established methodology open data and open access tools liberate knowledge and construct knowledge goëta and mabi 2014 janssen et al 2012 the interest of the method is expressed by the local scale modelling of the elements of urban technical and social resilience and the collaborative approach with local actors heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b this collaboration did not take place a posteriori to the design of the spatial decision support system but at each stage moreover each step of the script data used and results are easily understandable and accessible thanks to the choice of tools and data most models do not make their processing or databases accessible resilience is also limited to a technical functional analysis by integrating the impacts of domino effects this research led to designing a spatial decision support system that enables the visualization understanding and accessibility of treatments and results for local stakeholders heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b 2020b the design was carried out in collaboration allowing local actors to integrate the methodology but also to share their expertise the spatial decision support system makes it possible to assess and map urban technical social and environmental resilience the challenge now consists in making these models accessible by changing the scales of analysis and the study area sub district neighbourhood city networks etc the idea is to think about a tool that allows for the confrontation of different scales thanks to a visualization that is easy and accessible for local actors 4 3 operationalize the concept of resilience through collaborative approaches involving local people or people directly concerned by the issues studied does not seem to be new and even less original toubin et al 2015 the richness of having people from all walks of life interact allows for exploring the world of possibilities callon et al 2001 enriching discussions encouraging cross fertilization of views on the same subject to be both more measured and more incisive in a specific field resilience a social and tricky concept is therefore a subject that requires a confrontation of views knowledge scientific and practical knowledge perceptions and interpretations nevertheless despite the population being often the first impacted by natural hazards and their difficult management the inhabitants kuhlicke et al 2011 as well as the urban services toubin et al 2015 which are nonetheless actors most directly impacted are not sufficiently involved we defend the idea that the conception of a hybrid knowledge allowing the involvement of all actors of the territory from inhabitants to managers via scientists and or facilitators would allow the operationalization of urban resilience thanks to an appropriation of the concept and stakes of urban risks heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b it would therefore be beneficial to build this shared vision and commitment around the concept of resilience an approach that would also allow a transition in the ways of conceiving the city and understanding risks in urban environments heinzlef et al 2020b we therefore propose to develop strategies for integrating resilience in a co designed manner with city s stakeholders this would allow their direct involvement as well as the application of this strategy before or during a crisis serre 2013 involvement at the level of conception may guarantee the sustainable use of the resilience concept in flood risk management strategies heinzlef et al 2020b 4 3 1 parisian case study toubin et al 2015 developed a methodology to contribute to improving conditions of urban resilience and more particularly resilience of parisian urban networks face to urban floods based on the 1910 case study indeed the paris conurbation is exposed to the risk of major but infrequent floods the inevitable occurrence of flooding is all the more worrying for the authorities as they see other major world cities hit hard sometimes a few years apart by similar events new york or prague for example the flood of 1910 is the focus of attention because it is rich in lessons for the modern paris that was already taking shape at the time it is also interesting to note that paris status as a world city embodied notably by the 1900 universal exhibition was not called into question after the 1910 flood however prospective studies show that such a flood today would be much more critical for the metropolis with its major economic and political stakes supported by complex urban services this analysis of interactions and interdependencies of urban networks allowed highlighting intrinsic fragilities of urban systems and their management in the event of a crisis toubin et al 2012 in the context of the issues observed the objective of the research was therefore to develop approaches and tools to help urban service managers to identify and implement the most appropriate characterize technical and organizational interdependencies to ensure the continuity of service despite disruption propagations in such critical infrastructure networks the approach was built by integrating urban managers of the services areas of the city of paris this research draws up and analyzes the interdependencies of parisian urban networks it highlights certain dependencies particularly those on electricity telecommunications and transportation the collaborative approach involved managers and forced them to think about strategies to mitigate or at least manage these interdependencies together in addition the collaborative process illustrated the need to move beyond isolated approaches fig 5 but rather to foster a common vision toubin et al 2015 the collaborative approach can for example be used to illustrate the interdependencies between networks fig 5 the compartmentalized risk management between public and private actors in the city s services fig 5 and shed light on the major obstacles to the implementation of adaptation of the urban system to improve its overall resilience the interweaving of scales as well of services makes cooperation and transparency between operators and decision makers indispensable for the construction of a more resilient city toubin et al 2015 4 3 2 avignon case study seeking to analyze resilience through the three measurement indicators previously identified a study in avignon put forward the collaborative approach from a more exhaustive angle serre and heinzlef 2018 the approach developed emphasized collaboration between scientific experts and local actors building a common approach has made it possible to clarify the concept of resilience and translate it into a risk management strategy this collaboration was carried out with the gis service of the city of avignon the collaboration crystallized at several stages of the research heinzlef et al 2020b after an analysis of the concept of resilience via a study of the scientific literature a confrontation between scientific positioning and the knowledge of local actors took place indeed it was necessary to reassess the envisaged indicators in light of the data used by the gis department after establishing the conceptual model of resilience with the indicators the choice of processing tools was based on those used and known by the actors the data processing and analysis was carried out at a regular frequency with the gis department as the spatial decision support system is being built a number of meetings with managers of critical infrastructures were held to test and validate the results thus each stage was confronted with the reality of the actors their understanding and their future use of the tool this collaborative approach questioned the operationalization of the resilience and proposed an approach to meet these challenges it appeared necessary to involve local knowledge habits and practices in the construction of the tool to ensure its usefulness and subsequent use vanderlinden et al 2017 collaborative strategies allow for a common knowledge to be built around a complex concept this allows fuzzy concepts to be debated dissected and operationalized a spatial decision support system was designed with and for urban managers heinzlef et al 2019a 2019b the challenge is to deepen this collaborative dimension by offering a platform for meetings exchanges and local scientific expert collaboration in order to promote the operationalization of resilience in risk management strategies these previous studies have helped to address some of the challenges of operationalizing resilience nevertheless the obvious weakness of these studies is its multitude and the difficulty of local actors to integrate and understand it easily the objective of this long term work on the integration of the concept of resilience into risk management strategies is to envisage a living laboratory and an information system software structure that would bring together advances in the field and provide support for awkward resilience strategies and technical advances for scientists and local experts 5 an observatory design a long term and inclusive resilience monitoring and planning the operationalization of resilience faces two major limitations the difficult understanding of the concept itself its application to the risk management dimension the challenge of integrating resilience into risk management is part of a complex and constantly evolving context climate change and associated uncertainties faced with this climatic context and with political social economic and territorial elements that evolve there is an ever increasing need for understanding and observation serre et al 2019a heinzlef et al 2019b it is therefore a question of understanding territorial systems in all their complexity by bringing together data and information produced by and for stakeholders as a result local actors are able to come together around issues that will require the implementation of development or management actions observatories are tools whose objective is to observe monitor analyze understand on a portion of space representative of a territorial entity the socio environmental dynamics resulting from dynamic interactions of socio economic and biophysical systems they are a place of production exchange and sharing of information and knowledge that is sustainable observatories at the interface between complex reality and knowledge de sède marceau and moine 2012 are therefore effective decision making tools gayte et al 1997 heinzlef and serre 2020 territorial dynamics and structures are changing very rapidly due to political environmental demographic montgomery 2008 spatial organizational governance mendizabal et al 2018 transformations and other factors these rapid changes lead to a growing need for information and observation in order to understand these complex territorial systems de sède marceau et al 2009 observatories are therefore beneficial tools for understanding decision support tools for planners and elected officials and a place for producing exchanging and sharing information and knowledge over the long term heinzlef and serre 2020 to support territorial management this observatory has to provide diagnostic functions to perform the evaluation of implemented actions for instance it may help to have a global perception of different issues on an urban project to measure positive and negative impacts on flood risk territories it should also be associated with prognostic functions in order to have the capacity to alert and guide managers in their decision making process in the short and medium term in addition spatial decision support tools are often dependent on a specific territory and actors an observatory is a spatial decision support tool on a larger scale which can compare and confront several case studies actors experts methodologies there are currently various active observatories dedicated to the observation of the territory and space phenomena they exist in the form of a virtual structure such as for the national observatory of natural risks and the territorial observatory etc their objective is to gather analyze and disseminate data relating to territorial dynamics and disparities and to allow everyone professionals and individuals to easily access data relating to natural risks produced by organizations for a better understanding of these phenomena and their impacts however these observatories combine neither scientific advances nor local knowledge do not propose a double entity virtual structure living laboratory and stop at the data acquisition part the future observatory would be a toolbox developing refining and applying various methodologies to operationalize resilience initially conceived as a spatial decision support system an evolution towards a living laboratory would be an essential transition composed of a university team and local actors the human dimension of the observatory could enable in situ testing of resilience strategies and foster collaborative approaches fig 6 a test site will therefore be chosen according to the issues related to risks and will serve as a crucible for innovation and as a prototype observatory it is then a necessity to develop an observatory for reflection and action around the concept of resilience in the face of risk management it is one important step to prepare territories populations and local actors for climate disruption 5 1 increasing risk knowledge the primary objective of this observatory is to produce condense multiply and transmit knowledge on risks and resilience to this end defining and assessing resilience at the local level is required in order to drive a decision support process this step is built on previous research on the design of resilience indicators dealing with urban social and technical aspects the challenge is to make them generic and reusable on different case studies and for various local actors in various contexts the objective is to develop and deepen the pre existing indicators in order to nuance the analysis with in particular a governance indicator community investment of populations action policies dissemination of information concerning risks land use planning policies risk management etc 5 2 collecting data and mapping beyond enhancing the value of pre existing open access data the observatory would be a key tool for producing new forms of data tools such as uavs unmanned aerial vehicle would contribute to improving knowledge on territories at risk in a very precise manner and in particular to define the adaptive potential of these territories moreover the data acquired via uavs would be processed by the resilience observatory and could provide a valuable decision making aid for many decision makers the interest of uavs in risk management is manifold their low cost use ensures the widespread adoption of these tools serre et al 2019 in addition the automation of the tool can allow a repeatability of measurement which would be valuable in the monitoring of space evolutions leading to a more accurate and complete spatio temporal monitoring finally such tools are advantageous for accessing territories that are difficult for individuals to access in addition to data acquisition data processing and visualization will be an important area of development particularly with geo visualization techniques 5 3 engaging stakeholders since the 1990s there has been a growing interest in the geospatial dimension of data particularly in reason of the dissemination of geographic information systems and technologies andrienko et al 2007 these technologies include geographic information systems gis low cost gps equipment and satellite imagery among others appeaning addo et al 2018 recently software for the collection storage and analysis of geo referenced information is becoming increasingly user friendly thus development practitioners activists and researchers are turning to gis to increase the participation of local people in planning processes at the local or regional level and to facilitate the dialogue between policymakers and communities on the ownership use and control of natural resources as a result a growing number of community based initiatives are emerging to collect organize visualize and geo reference the knowledge of local people using what is generally referred to as participatory gis participatory gis is actually an approach born out of the combination of participatory learning and action methods and traditional gis it is based on the integrated use of tools methods technologies and systems ranging from simple map sketches to participatory three dimensional modelling common interpretation of aerial photos and the use of gps and various gis applications through participatory gis local people s knowledge is translated into two or three dimensional physical open access maps and used as interactive tools for geospatial learning information exchange decision support natural resource use planning and advocacy the observatory would therefore integrate a kind of participatory gis for local actors to promote understanding van de ven et al 2016 perception and integration of the concept of resilience into risk management strategies 5 4 a pacific resilience observatory a research project led by the ird and the cnrs has been set up in order to respond to the challenges of operationalizing resilience in french polynesia the objective of this pacific island long term resilience ilots project is to initiate reflection on a resilience observatory in order to work on the limits and biases of the concept and its operationalization serre et al 2019 building a resilience observatory prototype in the pacific islands makes sense in light of the risks to which they are exposed the french overseas islands have a high level of hydrometeorological hazards and often inadequate risk management methods tools and strategies a 2014 interministerial report also highlights the difficultly of sharing responsibilities between national and local authorities with regard to poor risk management processes with one crucial point in particular the national risk observatory does not cover the overseas territories at the same time local authorities do not seem to be willing to fully engage in risk management with the exception of hurricane related issues due to the cultural awareness of the population in the face of these hazards a more critical problem is the lack of control of land and urban development by local authorities the report also contains recommendations to improve risk management strategies in overseas regions such as the ambition to transform overseas territories into territories of innovation for risk management by engaging the scientific communities and to make urban planning a non structural measure to reduce risks by taking into greater account of the impacts of climate change the observatory project will therefore make it possible to design a framework to meet the needs in terms of scientific technical social and territorial advances thus the observatory prototype is innovative at several levels responding to an assessed need intensity and recurrence of disasters with a solution that does not yet exist carrying out the observatory with new models to assess the level of resilience to floods in a multi scale perspective space and time and using open source tools data and solutions as much as possible in order to minimize the cost of the observatory and maximize its future use this observatory project would therefore be justified from an economic point of view the emphasis on open source tools and the use of existing data that is not very valuable or not cross referenced in an enriching way to operationalize resilience makes the cost of the tool almost non existent for local actors the current costs are linked to the research teams but only financed by the scientific projects of the academic team subsequently it will be a question of training local actors in the use of the tool for these reasons a prototype toolbox such as an observatory takes on its full meaning in the pacific island territories 6 conclusion faced with the challenges of climate change and the uncertainties related to risk management the concept of resilience has emerged as an innovative and promising way to prepare territories populations and territorial actors however this concept is still unclear and difficult for local actors to understand and operationalize this article highlights two methodologies aimed at addressing the limitations of integrating the concept of resilience into risk management strategies a technical functional methodology and a more organizational one the technical approach has the advantage of responding to critical infrastructure issues and interdependencies that increase territorial vulnerability however this approach is limited because it reduces territorial complexity to critical infrastructures the organizational approach tends to respond to these limitations by proposing to analyze the different elements that make up the territory and participate in increasing and or reducing resilience while these two approaches make it possible to advance in the clarification and use of the concept by local stakeholders the multitude of tools their temporal limitation of use and their very localized action make these methodologies limited and too localized on account of this observation a global tool project has been envisaged a resilience observatory a resilience observatory would make it possible to develop a comprehensive human and computer based tool to condense compare develop and bring out different methodologies for operationalizing resilience based on several pillars defining and measuring resilience acquiring processing and visualizing data promoting and developing the integration of local stakeholders in the process of cultivating resilience etc the observatory would make it possible to reconcile local international and scientific advances in order to provide a structure for reflection and action to operationalize resilience in addition such a structure would make it possible to develop tools and methodologies that address resilience in a comprehensive and exhaustive way but also over a long period of time indeed the monitoring acquisition and use of past and current data would make it possible to apprehend the territory the risks and the resilience over the long term in order to adapt risk management strategies in the face of a spatial but also social trend this temporal dimension is essential in order to allow appropriation to consider the concept of resilience and to promote decision support such a prototype has been launched and tested in the pacific and more particularly in french polynesia in order to serve as a reference case study to develop this kind of observatory

20134,water recycling has been offered as an important adaptation for urban water systems facing deficits due to climate change while the volume of recycled water has increased exponentially since the 2000s its integration into municipal supply has not reached its potential to better understand the processes that influence its uptake this paper synthesizes published research that describes and analyzes adoption of water reuse in urban areas globally we identified 39 articles published between 2010 and 2019 which document drivers and barriers of water reuse for 54 urban areas in 20 countries evidence shows that external environmental shocks like drought may be a catalyst but a nexus of place based factors combined with economic regulatory and political alignment more likely foster systemic change in water systems keywords water reuse water recycling urban water systems systematic review 1 introduction existing freshwater sources and water infrastructure projects are not sufficient or adequate to address the challenges of urban water demand under conditions of climate change recent studies estimate that a quarter of the world s population living in large cities or 385 million people globally rely on water systems that are stressed by 2050 over 993 million people will live in cities with perennial water shortage and 3 1 billion urban residents may confront seasonal water shortages despite continued large scale infrastructure development 1 3 water reuse a common term that refers to water recycling or water reclamation is considered a key adaptation for many cities facing climate constraints on supply 4 6 reused water is a year round hydrologically independent source that can buffer the impacts of water scarcity water reuse follows several pathways from utilizing secondary effluent for non potable uses and indirect potable reuse ipr to direct potable reuse dpr for cities water reuse includes blending treated wastewater into water supply storage directly adding treated water into water distribution systems supplying industrial customers or providing various forms of treated water for non potable recreational environmental and residential uses global water reuse capacity has risen from 33 7 gigaliters per day gl d in 2010 to 54 5 gl day in 2015 7 several cities have integrated reclamation and recycling into their water systems 8 for example singapore is one of the urban areas where water reuse has been successfully integrated into the water system 9 10 yet the use of reclaimed water for municipal supply has not reached its potential not including de facto water reuse when a system draws water from a river that includes wastewater from upstream communities 11 integration of wastewater into municipal systems still remains low in north america for example annual reuse of treated wastewater is only 3 8 of the wastewater treated in the region 12 several reviews of the scholarly literature have examined water reuse but few have systematically examined existing research on drivers and barriers for urban water recycling globally one review examined water reuse as a means to not only augment supply in various global regions but to support a transition to a circular economy 13 other reviews of water reuse also provide broad summaries of needs technologies and application 7 8 14 17 while others assess water reuse in sustainability assessments 18 the most recent scholarly synthesis of drivers for and against municipal water reuse developed an analytical framework to examine 25 cities in australia a country which has experienced an increase in water recycling over the past twenty years 19 our paper seeks to update these assessments with a global review of existing peer reviewed scholarship of urban water reuse drivers and barriers between 2010 and 2019 following a systematic review method we identify 39 peer reviewed publications that assess or include a discussion of the factors that contribute to or limit urban water reuse for 54 urban areas in 20 countries we apply a pestle policy economic social technical legal institutional and environmental approach as a conceptual framework to synthesize the case studies thus offering a broader perspective on water reuse than previous reviews 20 28 evidence shows that external environmental shocks like drought may be a catalyst but a nexus of place based factors combined with economic regulatory and political alignment more likely foster systemic change in the final section we argue that while a simple barriers drivers analysis is initially helpful researchers need to situate the uptake of water reuse processes in a dynamic urban systems framework if it is to become a viable climate change adaptation for urban water supply we propose three system interactions that need to be taken into account for urban water reuse to reach its potential multi scalar governance interactions existing water system institutions and physical infrastructure with reuse needs and competing water sources 2 method 2 1 database and search strategies following the standard systematic review protocols preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis protocols prisma 29 our search includes empirical studies on the drivers and barriers for urban water reuse from across the globe different than a critical or narrative review in which the analysis engages a limited and potentially idiosyncratic selection of studies the systematic review offers the reader a clear pathway to reproduce the study through an explicit process of database searching search strings and selection and exclusion criteria tables 1 and 2 water reuse nomenclature varies across studies technically reclaimed water means treated or processed wastewater for safe reuse 30 when treated or untreated wastewater is used for the same purpose as the source water it is considered recycled water treated or untreated wastewater for other purposes is considered reused water 30 our search revealed that researchers do not frequently specify the type of reused water and commonly use the terms recycled reclaimed and reused interchangeably we included studies with different sources facility treated wastewater and stormwater and different end uses potable and non potable but we excluded studies of industrial water reuse or water recycling and studies that included agriculture while our search terms include variations for reclaimed water water recycling and water reuse we use the term water reuse in this paper as a general term that refers to the various forms of water recycling captured in the studies all results from the database searches were first uploaded to the rayyan https rayyan qcri org a free web application for the initial screening of titles abstracts and keywords in the systematic reviews 31 we followed the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to remove duplicates and screen titles and abstracts table 2 and selected 92 articles for full text screening thirty nine articles that included studies of 54 urban areas in 20 countries were selected for final analysis fig 1 2 2 data analysis integration of water reuse into urban water systems is not merely a technological switch it requires systems to change across multiple domains that is water reuse is an outcome of various changes that cut across technology place based factors social organization political alignments and cultural values in order to capture these dimensions we adopted the pestle approach to guide our systematic review table 3 the pestle approach has been applied in studies on environmental issues such as renewable energy 20 24 water management 25 26 environmental management 27 28 table 4 summarizes the list of articles analyzed and indicates which pestle factors were discussed in the articles 3 results table 5 summarizes urban water reuse drivers and barriers selected for this analysis table 5 3 1 drivers to urban water reuse 3 1 1 policy factors policy factors include strategies targets and guidelines directly related to the integration of water reuse in urban water systems 32 39 as we know from previous studies australia developed water reuse policies at all levels of government which in turn directly contributed to increased water reuse in sydney and melbourne 36 39 for example the national recycling target influenced the city of melbourne s policy to recycle 20 of its municipal wastewater 39 another example is california s recycled water policy 2009 a major factor in water recycling for municipalities in northern california by providing standards and guidelines 32 40 41 sustainability and resilience policies such as green building mandates and incentives also encourage the implementation of urban water reuse 36 in barcelona spain municipal ordinances which require the installation of greywater reuse in all new buildings contributed to increased overall urban water reuse 33 in sydney the building sustainability index drove greywater reuse and stormwater reuse uptake by requiring that all new homes reduce water consumption 36 3 1 2 economic factors project finance such as government subsidies price rebates tax incentives and foreign assistance contributes to the integration of water recycling into urban water systems 36 42 45 government funding can encourage private investment in water reuse in berlin brandenburg germany for example a municipal water reuse project relied on subsides 43 price rebates and tax incentives also supported water reuse in abu dhabi and dubai uae 44 in one case we also noted that foreign assistance for economic growth and development has been shown to also support urban water reuse through targeted investments as was the case of amman jordan 44 residential cost savings and a demonstrated willingness to pay offer utilities clear incentives to invest in water reuse when compared with other water supply options 35 46 49 when the tariff for treated wastewater is lower than drinking water the willingness to pay of urban residents in cape town south africa for example increased 46 residents in the australian cities of melbourne brisbane canberra and sydney also showed their willingness to pay for dual pipe systems to avoid having severe water restrictions during drought events 44 3 1 3 social factors public perception and social values are important components to the success of urban water reuse programs many studies found that an informed public with higher environmental awareness and environmental responsibility had positive opinions regarding potable and non potable water 35 37 40 44 47 56 other studies indicated that the public s water security concerns especially for cities with historical experiences of drought were critical factors in the adoption of water reclamation 34 38 49 50 52 54 56 in sabadell spain public awareness of water scarcity and the impact of climate change on the local area was relatively high due to the collective memory of the region s experience in droughts and conservation strategies 34 a survey in tucson arizona showed that residents believed reclaimed water was necessary because it would contribute to groundwater conservation water supply security and reduced dependence on water from colorado river 54 while environmental and social values provide the ideological openings for acceptance of water reuse policies and systems public education programs about urban water reuse also contributed to increased public acceptance of water reuse media educational programs community engagement visitor centers 42 56 57 and social pressure 32 40 41 all bolstered the successful implementation of water reuse programs in singapore stellenbosch and cities in california and australia 3 1 4 technical factors as most urban water reuse systems rely on municipal wastewater treatment facilities technical aspects of wastewater treatment influence the adoption of water reuse evidence from the case studies indicate that new treatment technologies designed to address concerns like cost and quality enable cities to adopt water reuse systems 35 44 57 for example advanced membrane technologies could reduce the cost and improve the quality of treated water in municipal wastewater treatment facilities 35 44 in singapore the development of more reliable and cost efficient technology also made it possible to implement high grade reclaimed water under the newater project banner 57 good maintenance operation and monitoring of recycled water quality also support the adoption of water reuse for urban supply portfolios 34 35 42 57 in the case of singapore rigorous water sampling and monitoring bolstered public trust of water and contributed to the adoption of newater system 57 in sabadell spain the advanced monitoring system to alarm water contamination and leakage promoted water reuse 34 3 1 5 legal and institutional factors legal and institutional dimensions of water quality and water rights form the regulatory landscape that contribute to advancing urban water reuse priorities 32 36 51 58 in california for example department of public health regulatory requirements to control in stream wastewater discharge forced wastewater facilities to adapt and increase their water recycling at the municipal level to stay in compliance 32 in sydney newly adopted water restrictions required the city to increase non potable recycled water usage for parks play grounds and golf courses 36 there is also evidence that institutional cooperation between the water supply and wastewater facilities can promote the adoption of water reuse 32 our analysis also revealed that a centralized water governance structure is more likely to open pathways for urban water reuse and recycling projects than decentralized systems hughes 2013 59 showed that water systems managed by a single full service state owned corporation as is the case in most australian cities were more effective adopting water reuse than decentralized systems in which authority for water decision making and planning is allocated to local water departments special district governments and private sector as is the case in california lane et al 2017 58 also argued that the stable and centralized role of trusted government agencies with relevant experts are important factors in water reuse adoption the cases of singapore and windhoek namibia showed that the integrated agency which took charge of both water supply and wastewater management contributed to the implementation of the direct potable reuse water system 35 57 this follows then that successful urban water reuse also requires considerable political will and support from government agencies 32 33 57 singapore is a case in point 57 from the 1970s the government considered water security as a top priority and tried to make self sufficient in water for reducing dependence on imported water from johor malaysia 57 the nation wide shift in water politics and the new water culture movement in spain also stimulated municipal governments to develop water reuse plans 33 3 1 6 environmental factors water scarcity is a catalyst for several municipalities and utilities to consider water reuse as part of their water augmentation strategy 32 34 39 42 44 46 47 50 60 61 in some areas water scarcity has been a chronic problem due to climate conditions 35 37 38 44 46 50 61 and lack of alternative sources 35 37 in addition increasing demand 32 46 62 severe drought 35 36 39 44 60 climate change 42 43 and natural disasters 47 exacerbate urban water security concerns and cause municipalities and utilities to seek alternative sources in one case urban resiliency policy after disaster increased water reuse after the 2011 earthquake in christchurch new zealand the city installed a greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting system for commercial buildings in order to provide water during and after a natural disaster 47 the urban landscape also offers opportunities for water recycling one study conducted in 15 chinese cities reveals that access to urban green space drives a high percentage of wastewater reuse because urban green space is the most common usage of recycled water 62 other environmental factors that catalyzed municipal governments to seek water reuse options include ecological protection and enhancement 32 and seawater intrusion 32 3 2 barriers to urban water reuse 3 2 1 policy factors policy frameworks that lack openness 63 lock in regulatory pathways 44 and are fragmented or contradicting 34 44 45 are cited as major barriers to urban water reuse our review indicates that in many cases the absence of policies that guide water reuse from higher levels of government hinders the integration of alternative water systems at the municipal level 42 45 50 64 in the case of abu dhabi and dubai uae the national policy locked in desalination which blocked the development of urban water reuse projects 44 a comparative study of seven cities revealed that lack of policy openness to water reuse was a major barrier to increasing water reuse 63 policy fragmentation or contradictory polices across agencies also undermine water reuse in the case of melbourne brisbane canberra and sydney australia conflicts between the federal and state government hindered water reuse advancement the national government recommended wastewater reuse but state government policies still restricted the extent of water recycling applications 44 in one case policies for one sector determined aspects of urban water policy land use policy in the copiapó river basin chile limited or even restricted use of recycled water 45 political change in government is another barrier after the election of late 2010 the new regional government in catalonia spain had dismantled the urban water reuse initiatives which the previous administration launched 33 evidence from case studies also indicate that a lack of cooperation and communication among stakeholders 33 34 51 and limited stakeholder engagement in the decision making process 34 45 are political barriers to urban water reuse 3 2 2 economic factors inclusion of water reuse into a city water supply portfolio requires substantial capital while in some cases cost savings advance water recycling projects case study examples in the published literature have highlighted how the initial investment can hinder the uptake of water reuse systems investment in water recycling systems are variable depending on the utilities overall projected integration plan but it may include installation maintenance and operation of treatment facility storage space and distribution system 32 47 50 51 53 56 63 indeed the case evidence indicates that installation costs and distribution for reclaimed water necessary to fulfill legal requirements also limit urban water reuse in arizona 50 for rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling in new zealand the lack of additional infrastructure for storage hindered water reuse expansion 47 due to the additional costs lack of funding for necessary to update the wastewater treatment facilities could reduce the likelihood of reuse adoption 32 51 56 59 for example municipal wastewater managers in northern california pointed out the cost of implementing potable reuse was a barrier because additional cost of infrastructure exceeded customers willingness to pay 56 other economic barriers include water affordability at the household level 63 limited market creation 34 and economic risks 37 in addition relative cost of recycled water to other options also reduced willingness to pay 34 36 46 47 64 for example the cost of domestic water in saudi arabia is too low to provide any incentives for using recycled water 64 similarly in cape town another study demonstrated that the willingness to pay for recycled water decreased when the tariff of drinking water was lower than recycled water 46 studies also demonstrate that locked in pricing systems hinder the widespread adoption of water reuse sydney has the historical legacy of monopoly pricing regulation which prohibits to investment in a water reuse system 36 the stakeholders of wastewater reuse in amman jordan pointed out economic risk to financial loss and economic constraints limit wastewater collection and treatment as a barrier to water reuse 37 3 2 3 social factors public perception of risk has been a major theme in research on the development of water reuse over the past decade negative public perception is based on concerns related to risks lack of trust psychological barriers and cultural factors studies demonstrate the wide ranging concerns around water recycling projects and human health risks related to water quality chemical contamination microbial pathogens cross contamination with potable water and system cleanliness 42 56 57 many studies demonstrated that a lack of trust toward utilities 60 technology 46 53 authorities 52 and service providers 42 46 54 impeded acceptance of water reuse according to a survey in tucson people trusted academic researchers and the their water utility but did not trust the media and local government officials who they believed were influenced by special interests in the business community 54 psychological factors also limit interest in water reuse especially for the general public 32 37 41 63 for example a psychological aversion to wastewater due to their images of dirt was one of the barriers in amman jordan 37 reluctance to make the necessary behavioral changes was another barrier to grey water and stormwater reuse in places like perth toowoomba austria and cities in the netherlands 41 55 65 finally cultural factors especially religion impeded adoption of water reuse systems in several cities for cities with large muslim populations the halal status of treated water for municipal use was an issue while islam does not prohibit the use of treated water for irrigation recycled or reused water for municipal purposes was deemed unclean 37 44 48 in jakarta it was reported that people tried to minimize direct contact with recycled water for religious reasons 48 3 2 4 technical factors insufficient wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure is one of the barriers to adapt water reuse especially in developing countries 37 44 for those urban areas with adequate facilities for wastewater treatment to support reuse its location may impede adoption because of added costs such as pipe to transfer the treated water 43 46 56 similarly poor maintenance operation and monitoring issues in the municipal wastewater treatment facility also block any substantive shift to water recycling because of limited technical capacity 33 37 51 as wastewater treatment plants are usually located in a convenient place to discharge they often do not have infrastructure to distribute treated water back to the urban area 43 46 56 in addition to the location of current facilities the technology used in the wastewater treatment facility is not sufficient to produce potable reuse water as most municipal wastewater facilities operate primary or secondary treatment additional infrastructure or advanced treatment are required to broaden reuse options 37 44 56 for example experts in the northern california pointed out the change of chemical and brine treatment method are additionally required for direct potable water reuse 56 3 2 5 legal and institutional factors current research indicates the lack of regulation impedes municipal level water reuse adoption 32 42 44 46 48 50 56 66 in jakarta current water quality standards are not specific to water reuse 48 while in the united states a lack of regulatory systems at the federal and state levels do not provide sufficient guidance for utilities and water managers at the municipal level 66 even when regulations exist they may still restrict the adoption of water reuse the regulations can be flawed or unevenly applied 32 34 56 provide unclear institutional responsibility 36 poorly enforced 37 or inconsistent 34 for example the plumbing code in california currently limits the use of reused water for outdoor spray irrigation and indoor toilets 56 insufficient institutional support and coordination among institutions pose other challenges 33 44 45 59 for example the fragmented responsibility among state agencies in california impeded to adopt water reuse 59 3 2 6 environmental factors very few environmental factors were identified as barriers to water reuse in the empirical cases one notable factor was the return to post drought conditions reducing political and utility interest in water reuse case studies describe how the commitment to water reuse decreased after the drought in urban area in australia 36 44 and in sabadell spain water shortage and scarcity had temporarily been put aside by stakeholders once water reservoirs were full 34 concerns over environmental degradation also limited uptake of urban water reuse projects 37 4 discussion rethinking urban water reuse for water security the pestle framework is a first step to classify the drivers and barriers to urban water reuse and our results in this paper align with the broader discussions and debates on water recycling and reuse however we argue that it is important to consider the adoption of water reuse in terms of broader urban water systems rather than independent factors evidence shows that external environmental shocks like drought may be a catalyst but a nexus of place based factors combined with economic regulatory and political alignment more likely foster systemic change in this section we reframe the discussion of urban water reuse to address the systemic changes that need to be made for this to become a viable adaptation to climate change that is we propose that policies to advance water reuse need to be evaluated in terms of relationships with polyvalent governance structures with existing infrastructure of the water system and with other water supply options such relationships can be explained by the structural elements of the diagnostic framework which consist of actors the system of concern and context 67 fig 2 in this case the larger water regime which includes place based social political institutional and economic system dynamics needs to be taken into account if climate adaptation policies are to shift urban water reuse potential to a reality the multi scalar structures of water reuse regulation and policy demand that we look simultaneously at all relations within the systems that influence urban water reuse many national or state governments provide guidelines for local reuse implementation 36 in several countries urban water reuse is launched as a national project or strategy such as the water sensitive city in australia the newater in singapore and the new sanitation in the netherlands yet local or municipal governments implement and navigate national policy and facilitate water management vision by developing detailed project and strategies 34 36 when the municipal government implements on water reuse they often contract with the private sector request advice from experts and communicate with the public the municipal government is a center of this relationship and facilitates the governance among stakeholders therefore to understand more accurately that factors that support and hinder water reuse adoption attention needs to focus on the intersections of these relationships at points of cooperation and conflict in a broader systems of water governance rather than simply identify one policy or another advances or prevents water recycling in municipal systems we see that several barriers arose when there was conflict between the federal government and local government or between local government and experts or the public such conflicts are based on different understandings of water reuse the study on amman jordan revealed the divergent views on water reuse between ngos and government employees 37 while government officials had more positive opinions the people from ngos showed negative opinions due to concerns about government failure 37 in california experts expressed different opinions on the health risks of water reuse wastewater supply professionals believed their technology is appropriate to provide potable water while public health professional warned that the technology could not remove emerging chemicals and pathogens 56 research conducted in three australian cities pointed out that the public is far more receptive to water reuse than water experts and thus increased water reuse or other water augmentation technologies required a new hydro social contract 68 a relational approach to technology and infrastructure also provides a more comprehensive framework to better map these interacting place based drivers and barriers to municipal water recycling programs the cases examined in this paper illustrated various water reuse options in terms of the source end use and scale most of the research was based on the treated domestic municipal or industrial wastewater for both potable and non potable use at a municipal level while only few studies examined greywater recycling for non potable purposes adopted at smaller scales the source purpose and scale of urban water reuse pivots on stakeholder needs and the current urban water and wastewater system both physically and institutionally because the current wastewater facilities and infrastructure were not designed to produce recycled water for potable and non potable use adoption of reused water requires additional investment for upgraded technology additional treatment and pipeline for distribution urban water supply systems not only refer to infrastructure they include policies regulations and institutions that govern the system in many cases cited in this review the lack of policy and regulation was cited as the most frequent barrier to urban water reuse similarly policy and regulatory fragmentation between different service or regulatory sectors drinking water and wastewater health and water or between different regulatory scales national state municipal limited needed coordination to launch viable urban water reuse programs in many cases thus it is clear from this review that intentional alignment and coordination across sectors and institutions are required to reach the potential of water reuse as a viable and sustainable urban climate adaption strategy finally our review underscored that water recycling may compete with other unconventional water sources one observation across the cases is that the urban water reuse system may compete with desalination taking a pathway toward urban water reuse is the result of the selection process by stakeholders to be a preferred pathway the water reuse system has to have an advantage compared with other options in terms of cost efficiency resource efficiency availability technology flexibility and quality in addition there needs to be political support for water reuse over or in addition to desalination in jordan water reuse was the only option while water reuse in uae competed with the desalination technology which already received significant investment to become the dominant water augmentation technology 44 in sydney australia the interest in water reuse decreased once their desalination plant was built 36 this trade off with other water supply options can explain why some cities follow the pathways toward the urban water reuse while others do not 5 conclusion water reuse offers a major pathway for cities to develop their future water supply under conditions of climate change in principal wastewater can be used for any application as long as treatment meets the requirement for the intended use while the percentage of wastewater entering a process of recycling and reuse has increased over the past two decades water reuse has not reached its potential to augment the world s urban water supply our review illustrates there are complex and intersecting forces that may inhibit municipalities and utilities from taking advantage of its potential in this paper we followed systematic review procedures to select relevant published scholarship on urban water recycling to extract key drivers and barriers to this transformation there are three limits to this review first the relative influence or strength of the drivers and barriers of urban water reuse are not addressed second our review attended to scholarship published during the past decade so it may not be relevant for more historical perspectives finally we did not separate the different types of urban water reuse wastewater reclamation grey water reuse and stormwater reuse further analysis would be needed to consider the different types of water reuse we expect that this review provides a robust synthesis to support a relational perspective on water reuse one that considers how drivers and barriers operate across and through water systems we identified three relational dynamics governance technology and water source competition that may help map the pathways for researchers to more precisely identify key areas for future study and aid policy makers as they pursue strategies for transitioning their water systems to a more sustainable and water secure future credit authorship contribution statement kyungsun lee

systematically examined existing research on drivers and barriers for urban water recycling globally one review examined water reuse as a means to not only augment supply in various global regions but to support a transition to a circular economy 13 other reviews of water reuse also provide broad summaries of needs technologies and application 7 8 14 17 while others assess water reuse in sustainability assessments 18 the most recent scholarly synthesis of drivers for and against municipal water reuse developed an analytical framework to examine 25 cities in australia a country which has experienced an increase in water recycling over the past twenty years 19 our paper seeks to update these assessments with a global review of existing peer reviewed scholarship of urban water reuse drivers and barriers between 2010 and 2019 following a systematic review method we identify 39 peer reviewed publications that assess or include a discussion of the factors that contribute to or limit urban water reuse for 54 urban areas in 20 countries we apply a pestle policy economic social technical legal institutional and environmental approach as a conceptual framework to synthesize the case studies thus offering a broader perspective on water reuse than previous reviews 20 28 evidence shows that external environmental shocks like drought may be a catalyst but a nexus of place based factors combined with economic regulatory and political alignment more likely foster systemic change in the final section we argue that while a simple barriers drivers analysis is initially helpful researchers need to situate the uptake of water reuse processes in a dynamic urban systems framework if it is to become a viable climate change adaptation for urban water supply we propose three system interactions that need to be taken into account for urban water reuse to reach its potential multi scalar governance interactions existing water system institutions and physical infrastructure with reuse needs and competing water sources 2 method 2 1 database and search strategies following the standard systematic review protocols preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis protocols prisma 29 our search includes empirical studies on the drivers and barriers for urban water reuse from across the globe different than a critical or narrative review in which the analysis engages a limited and potentially idiosyncratic selection of studies the systematic review offers the reader a clear pathway to reproduce the study through an explicit process of database searching search strings and selection and exclusion criteria tables 1 and 2 water reuse nomenclature varies across studies technically reclaimed water means treated or processed wastewater for safe reuse 30 when treated or untreated wastewater is used for the same purpose as the source water it is considered recycled water treated or untreated wastewater for other purposes is considered reused water 30 our search revealed that researchers do not frequently specify the type of reused water and commonly use the terms recycled reclaimed and reused interchangeably we included studies with different sources facility treated wastewater and stormwater and different end uses potable and non potable but we excluded studies of industrial water reuse or water recycling and studies that included agriculture while our search terms include variations for reclaimed water water recycling and water reuse we use the term water reuse in this paper as a general term that refers to the various forms of water recycling captured in the studies all results from the database searches were first uploaded to the rayyan https rayyan qcri org a free web application for the initial screening of titles abstracts and keywords in the systematic reviews 31 we followed the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to remove duplicates and screen titles and abstracts table 2 and selected 92 articles for full text screening thirty nine articles that included studies of 54 urban areas in 20 countries were selected for final analysis fig 1 2 2 data analysis integration of water reuse into urban water systems is not merely a technological switch it requires systems to change across multiple domains that is water reuse is an outcome of various changes that cut across technology place based factors social organization political alignments and cultural values in order to capture these dimensions we adopted the pestle approach to guide our systematic review table 3 the pestle approach has been applied in studies on environmental issues such as renewable energy 20 24 water management 25 26 environmental management 27 28 table 4 summarizes the list of articles analyzed and indicates which pestle factors were discussed in the articles 3 results table 5 summarizes urban water reuse drivers and barriers selected for this analysis table 5 3 1 drivers to urban water reuse 3 1 1 policy factors policy factors include strategies targets and guidelines directly related to the integration of water reuse in urban water systems 32 39 as we know from previous studies australia developed water reuse policies at all levels of government which in turn directly contributed to increased water reuse in sydney and melbourne 36 39 for example the national recycling target influenced the city of melbourne s policy to recycle 20 of its municipal wastewater 39 another example is california s recycled water policy 2009 a major factor in water recycling for municipalities in northern california by providing standards and guidelines 32 40 41 sustainability and resilience policies such as green building mandates and incentives also encourage the implementation of urban water reuse 36 in barcelona spain municipal ordinances which require the installation of greywater reuse in all new buildings contributed to increased overall urban water reuse 33 in sydney the building sustainability index drove greywater reuse and stormwater reuse uptake by requiring that all new homes reduce water consumption 36 3 1 2 economic factors project finance such as government subsidies price rebates tax incentives and foreign assistance contributes to the integration of water recycling into urban water systems 36 42 45 government funding can encourage private investment in water reuse in berlin brandenburg germany for example a municipal water reuse project relied on subsides 43 price rebates and tax incentives also supported water reuse in abu dhabi and dubai uae 44 in one case we also noted that foreign assistance for economic growth and development has been shown to also support urban water reuse through targeted investments as was the case of amman jordan 44 residential cost savings and a demonstrated willingness to pay offer utilities clear incentives to invest in water reuse when compared with other water supply options 35 46 49 when the tariff for treated wastewater is lower than drinking water the willingness to pay of urban residents in cape town south africa for example increased 46 residents in the australian cities of melbourne brisbane canberra and sydney also showed their willingness to pay for dual pipe systems to avoid having severe water restrictions during drought events 44 3 1 3 social factors public perception and social values are important components to the success of urban water reuse programs many studies found that an informed public with higher environmental awareness and environmental responsibility had positive opinions regarding potable and non potable water 35 37 40 44 47 56 other studies indicated that the public s water security concerns especially for cities with historical experiences of drought were critical factors in the adoption of water reclamation 34 38 49 50 52 54 56 in sabadell spain public awareness of water scarcity and the impact of climate change on the local area was relatively high due to the collective memory of the region s experience in droughts and conservation strategies 34 a survey in tucson arizona showed that residents believed reclaimed water was necessary because it would contribute to groundwater conservation water supply security and reduced dependence on water from colorado river 54 while environmental and social values provide the ideological openings for acceptance of water reuse policies and systems public education programs about urban water reuse also contributed to increased public acceptance of water reuse media educational programs community engagement visitor centers 42 56 57 and social pressure 32 40 41 all bolstered the successful implementation of water reuse programs in singapore stellenbosch and cities in california and australia 3 1 4 technical factors as most urban water reuse systems rely on municipal wastewater treatment facilities technical aspects of wastewater treatment influence the adoption of water reuse evidence from the case studies indicate that new treatment technologies designed to address concerns like cost and quality enable cities to adopt water reuse systems 35 44 57 for example advanced membrane technologies could reduce the cost and improve the quality of treated water in municipal wastewater treatment facilities 35 44 in singapore the development of more reliable and cost efficient technology also made it possible to implement high grade reclaimed water under the newater project banner 57 good maintenance operation and monitoring of recycled water quality also support the adoption of water reuse for urban supply portfolios 34 35 42 57 in the case of singapore rigorous water sampling and monitoring bolstered public trust of water and contributed to the adoption of newater system 57 in sabadell spain the advanced monitoring system to alarm water contamination and leakage promoted water reuse 34 3 1 5 legal and institutional factors legal and institutional dimensions of water quality and water rights form the regulatory landscape that contribute to advancing urban water reuse priorities 32 36 51 58 in california for example department of public health regulatory requirements to control in stream wastewater discharge forced wastewater facilities to adapt and increase their water recycling at the municipal level to stay in compliance 32 in sydney newly adopted water restrictions required the city to increase non potable recycled water usage for parks play grounds and golf courses 36 there is also evidence that institutional cooperation between the water supply and wastewater facilities can promote the adoption of water reuse 32 our analysis also revealed that a centralized water governance structure is more likely to open pathways for urban water reuse and recycling projects than decentralized systems hughes 2013 59 showed that water systems managed by a single full service state owned corporation as is the case in most australian cities were more effective adopting water reuse than decentralized systems in which authority for water decision making and planning is allocated to local water departments special district governments and private sector as is the case in california lane et al 2017 58 also argued that the stable and centralized role of trusted government agencies with relevant experts are important factors in water reuse adoption the cases of singapore and windhoek namibia showed that the integrated agency which took charge of both water supply and wastewater management contributed to the implementation of the direct potable reuse water system 35 57 this follows then that successful urban water reuse also requires considerable political will and support from government agencies 32 33 57 singapore is a case in point 57 from the 1970s the government considered water security as a top priority and tried to make self sufficient in water for reducing dependence on imported water from johor malaysia 57 the nation wide shift in water politics and the new water culture movement in spain also stimulated municipal governments to develop water reuse plans 33 3 1 6 environmental factors water scarcity is a catalyst for several municipalities and utilities to consider water reuse as part of their water augmentation strategy 32 34 39 42 44 46 47 50 60 61 in some areas water scarcity has been a chronic problem due to climate conditions 35 37 38 44 46 50 61 and lack of alternative sources 35 37 in addition increasing demand 32 46 62 severe drought 35 36 39 44 60 climate change 42 43 and natural disasters 47 exacerbate urban water security concerns and cause municipalities and utilities to seek alternative sources in one case urban resiliency policy after disaster increased water reuse after the 2011 earthquake in christchurch new zealand the city installed a greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting system for commercial buildings in order to provide water during and after a natural disaster 47 the urban landscape also offers opportunities for water recycling one study conducted in 15 chinese cities reveals that access to urban green space drives a high percentage of wastewater reuse because urban green space is the most common usage of recycled water 62 other environmental factors that catalyzed municipal governments to seek water reuse options include ecological protection and enhancement 32 and seawater intrusion 32 3 2 barriers to urban water reuse 3 2 1 policy factors policy frameworks that lack openness 63 lock in regulatory pathways 44 and are fragmented or contradicting 34 44 45 are cited as major barriers to urban water reuse our review indicates that in many cases the absence of policies that guide water reuse from higher levels of government hinders the integration of alternative water systems at the municipal level 42 45 50 64 in the case of abu dhabi and dubai uae the national policy locked in desalination which blocked the development of urban water reuse projects 44 a comparative study of seven cities revealed that lack of policy openness to water reuse was a major barrier to increasing water reuse 63 policy fragmentation or contradictory polices across agencies also undermine water reuse in the case of melbourne brisbane canberra and sydney australia conflicts between the federal and state government hindered water reuse advancement the national government recommended wastewater reuse but state government policies still restricted the extent of water recycling applications 44 in one case policies for one sector determined aspects of urban water policy land use policy in the copiapó river basin chile limited or even restricted use of recycled water 45 political change in government is another barrier after the election of late 2010 the new regional government in catalonia spain had dismantled the urban water reuse initiatives which the previous administration launched 33 evidence from case studies also indicate that a lack of cooperation and communication among stakeholders 33 34 51 and limited stakeholder engagement in the decision making process 34 45 are political barriers to urban water reuse 3 2 2 economic factors inclusion of water reuse into a city water supply portfolio requires substantial capital while in some cases cost savings advance water recycling projects case study examples in the published literature have highlighted how the initial investment can hinder the uptake of water reuse systems investment in water recycling systems are variable depending on the utilities overall projected integration plan but it may include installation maintenance and operation of treatment facility storage space and distribution system 32 47 50 51 53 56 63 indeed the case evidence indicates that installation costs and distribution for reclaimed water necessary to fulfill legal requirements also limit urban water reuse in arizona 50 for rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling in new zealand the lack of additional infrastructure for storage hindered water reuse expansion 47 due to the additional costs lack of funding for necessary to update the wastewater treatment facilities could reduce the likelihood of reuse adoption 32 51 56 59 for example municipal wastewater managers in northern california pointed out the cost of implementing potable reuse was a barrier because additional cost of infrastructure exceeded customers willingness to pay 56 other economic barriers include water affordability at the household level 63 limited market creation 34 and economic risks 37 in addition relative cost of recycled water to other options also reduced willingness to pay 34 36 46 47 64 for example the cost of domestic water in saudi arabia is too low to provide any incentives for using recycled water 64 similarly in cape town another study demonstrated that the willingness to pay for recycled water decreased when the tariff of drinking water was lower than recycled water 46 studies also demonstrate that locked in pricing systems hinder the widespread adoption of water reuse sydney has the historical legacy of monopoly pricing regulation which prohibits to investment in a water reuse system 36 the stakeholders of wastewater reuse in amman jordan pointed out economic risk to financial loss and economic constraints limit wastewater collection and treatment as a barrier to water reuse 37 3 2 3 social factors public perception of risk has been a major theme in research on the development of water reuse over the past decade negative public perception is based on concerns related to risks lack of trust psychological barriers and cultural factors studies demonstrate the wide ranging concerns around water recycling projects and human health risks related to water quality chemical contamination microbial pathogens cross contamination with potable water and system cleanliness 42 56 57 many studies demonstrated that a lack of trust toward utilities 60 technology 46 53 authorities 52 and service providers 42 46 54 impeded acceptance of water reuse according to a survey in tucson people trusted academic researchers and the their water utility but did not trust the media and local government officials who they believed were influenced by special interests in the business community 54 psychological factors also limit interest in water reuse especially for the general public 32 37 41 63 for example a psychological aversion to wastewater due to their images of dirt was one of the barriers in amman jordan 37 reluctance to make the necessary behavioral changes was another barrier to grey water and stormwater reuse in places like perth toowoomba austria and cities in the netherlands 41 55 65 finally cultural factors especially religion impeded adoption of water reuse systems in several cities for cities with large muslim populations the halal status of treated water for municipal use was an issue while islam does not prohibit the use of treated water for irrigation recycled or reused water for municipal purposes was deemed unclean 37 44 48 in jakarta it was reported that people tried to minimize direct contact with recycled water for religious reasons 48 3 2 4 technical factors insufficient wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure is one of the barriers to adapt water reuse especially in developing countries 37 44 for those urban areas with adequate facilities for wastewater treatment to support reuse its location may impede adoption because of added costs such as pipe to transfer the treated water 43 46 56 similarly poor maintenance operation and monitoring issues in the municipal wastewater treatment facility also block any substantive shift to water recycling because of limited technical capacity 33 37 51 as wastewater treatment plants are usually located in a convenient place to discharge they often do not have infrastructure to distribute treated water back to the urban area 43 46 56 in addition to the location of current facilities the technology used in the wastewater treatment facility is not sufficient to produce potable reuse water as most municipal wastewater facilities operate primary or secondary treatment additional infrastructure or advanced treatment are required to broaden reuse options 37 44 56 for example experts in the northern california pointed out the change of chemical and brine treatment method are additionally required for direct potable water reuse 56 3 2 5 legal and institutional factors current research indicates the lack of regulation impedes municipal level water reuse adoption 32 42 44 46 48 50 56 66 in jakarta current water quality standards are not specific to water reuse 48 while in the united states a lack of regulatory systems at the federal and state levels do not provide sufficient guidance for utilities and water managers at the municipal level 66 even when regulations exist they may still restrict the adoption of water reuse the regulations can be flawed or unevenly applied 32 34 56 provide unclear institutional responsibility 36 poorly enforced 37 or inconsistent 34 for example the plumbing code in california currently limits the use of reused water for outdoor spray irrigation and indoor toilets 56 insufficient institutional support and coordination among institutions pose other challenges 33 44 45 59 for example the fragmented responsibility among state agencies in california impeded to adopt water reuse 59 3 2 6 environmental factors very few environmental factors were identified as barriers to water reuse in the empirical cases one notable factor was the return to post drought conditions reducing political and utility interest in water reuse case studies describe how the commitment to water reuse decreased after the drought in urban area in australia 36 44 and in sabadell spain water shortage and scarcity had temporarily been put aside by stakeholders once water reservoirs were full 34 concerns over environmental degradation also limited uptake of urban water reuse projects 37 4 discussion rethinking urban water reuse for water security the pestle framework is a first step to classify the drivers and barriers to urban water reuse and our results in this paper align with the broader discussions and debates on water recycling and reuse however we argue that it is important to consider the adoption of water reuse in terms of broader urban water systems rather than independent factors evidence shows that external environmental shocks like drought may be a catalyst but a nexus of place based factors combined with economic regulatory and political alignment more likely foster systemic change in this section we reframe the discussion of urban water reuse to address the systemic changes that need to be made for this to become a viable adaptation to climate change that is we propose that policies to advance water reuse need to be evaluated in terms of relationships with polyvalent governance structures with existing infrastructure of the water system and with other water supply options such relationships can be explained by the structural elements of the diagnostic framework which consist of actors the system of concern and context 67 fig 2 in this case the larger water regime which includes place based social political institutional and economic system dynamics needs to be taken into account if climate adaptation policies are to shift urban water reuse potential to a reality the multi scalar structures of water reuse regulation and policy demand that we look simultaneously at all relations within the systems that influence urban water reuse many national or state governments provide guidelines for local reuse implementation 36 in several countries urban water reuse is launched as a national project or strategy such as the water sensitive city in australia the newater in singapore and the new sanitation in the netherlands yet local or municipal governments implement and navigate national policy and facilitate water management vision by developing detailed project and strategies 34 36 when the municipal government implements on water reuse they often contract with the private sector request advice from experts and communicate with the public the municipal government is a center of this relationship and facilitates the governance among stakeholders therefore to understand more accurately that factors that support and hinder water reuse adoption attention needs to focus on the intersections of these relationships at points of cooperation and conflict in a broader systems of water governance rather than simply identify one policy or another advances or prevents water recycling in municipal systems we see that several barriers arose when there was conflict between the federal government and local government or between local government and experts or the public such conflicts are based on different understandings of water reuse the study on amman jordan revealed the divergent views on water reuse between ngos and government employees 37 while government officials had more positive opinions the people from ngos showed negative opinions due to concerns about government failure 37 in california experts expressed different opinions on the health risks of water reuse wastewater supply professionals believed their technology is appropriate to provide potable water while public health professional warned that the technology could not remove emerging chemicals and pathogens 56 research conducted in three australian cities pointed out that the public is far more receptive to water reuse than water experts and thus increased water reuse or other water augmentation technologies required a new hydro social contract 68 a relational approach to technology and infrastructure also provides a more comprehensive framework to better map these interacting place based drivers and barriers to municipal water recycling programs the cases examined in this paper illustrated various water reuse options in terms of the source end use and scale most of the research was based on the treated domestic municipal or industrial wastewater for both potable and non potable use at a municipal level while only few studies examined greywater recycling for non potable purposes adopted at smaller scales the source purpose and scale of urban water reuse pivots on stakeholder needs and the current urban water and wastewater system both physically and institutionally because the current wastewater facilities and infrastructure were not designed to produce recycled water for potable and non potable use adoption of reused water requires additional investment for upgraded technology additional treatment and pipeline for distribution urban water supply systems not only refer to infrastructure they include policies regulations and institutions that govern the system in many cases cited in this review the lack of policy and regulation was cited as the most frequent barrier to urban water reuse similarly policy and regulatory fragmentation between different service or regulatory sectors drinking water and wastewater health and water or between different regulatory scales national state municipal limited needed coordination to launch viable urban water reuse programs in many cases thus it is clear from this review that intentional alignment and coordination across sectors and institutions are required to reach the potential of water reuse as a viable and sustainable urban climate adaption strategy finally our review underscored that water recycling may compete with other unconventional water sources one observation across the cases is that the urban water reuse system may compete with desalination taking a pathway toward urban water reuse is the result of the selection process by stakeholders to be a preferred pathway the water reuse system has to have an advantage compared with other options in terms of cost efficiency resource efficiency availability technology flexibility and quality in addition there needs to be political support for water reuse over or in addition to desalination in jordan water reuse was the only option while water reuse in uae competed with the desalination technology which already received significant investment to become the dominant water augmentation technology 44 in sydney australia the interest in water reuse decreased once their desalination plant was built 36 this trade off with other water supply options can explain why some cities follow the pathways toward the urban water reuse while others do not 5 conclusion water reuse offers a major pathway for cities to develop their future water supply under conditions of climate change in principal wastewater can be used for any application as long as treatment meets the requirement for the intended use while the percentage of wastewater entering a process of recycling and reuse has increased over the past two decades water reuse has not reached its potential to augment the world s urban water supply our review illustrates there are complex and intersecting forces that may inhibit municipalities and utilities from taking advantage of its potential in this paper we followed systematic review procedures to select relevant published scholarship on urban water recycling to extract key drivers and barriers to this transformation there are three limits to this review first the relative influence or strength of the drivers and barriers of urban water reuse are not addressed second our review attended to scholarship published during the past decade so it may not be relevant for more historical perspectives finally we did not separate the different types of urban water reuse wastewater reclamation grey water reuse and stormwater reuse further analysis would be needed to consider the different types of water reuse we expect that this review provides a robust synthesis to support a relational perspective on water reuse one that considers how drivers and barriers operate across and through water systems we identified three relational dynamics governance technology and water source competition that may help map the pathways for researchers to more precisely identify key areas for future study and aid policy makers as they pursue strategies for transitioning their water systems to a more sustainable and water secure future credit authorship contribution statement kyungsun lee
