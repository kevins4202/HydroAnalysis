7445,snowmelt runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale this is especially true for hillslopes on the northern great plains of north america where long periods of snow covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation this study examines a 4 66 ha 46 600 m2 hillslope on the northern great plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes specifically we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content and thawed layer depth which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46 600 m2 hillslope affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity a key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain dominated and unfrozen soil domains the contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack consequently infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period instead nested filling of micro and meso depressions was followed by macro scale whole slope spilling this spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet these observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis interestingly while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen keywords hydrological connectivity snowmelt frozen ground runoff generation fill and spill 1 introduction understanding snowmelt runoff generation in snow dominated regions is critical for predicting water delivery and availability as the climate changes and these cold regions warm while point scale e g granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 and hillslope scale e g kane et al 1981 quinton and marsh 1999 carey and woo 2001 quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2005 melt and runoff processes have been well studied we still do not fully understand process controls on hillslope snowmelt runoff connectivity where here connectivity is conceptualised as the generation of continuous flow fields across a hillslope connecting point scale runoff generation elements across hillslopes and catchments is now seen as fundamental for assessing the nonlinearities in runoff relations several studies have now shown how key nonlinearities like thresholds and feedbacks can produce emergent behaviour that is not explainable by traditional point scale concepts grayson and bl√∂schl 2001 sivapalan 2005 bracken and croke 2007 james and roulet 2007 troch et al 2008 ali and roy 2009 bracken et al 2013 mcdonnell 2013 in rainfall runoff studies pattern based or spatially distributed measurements have enhanced our understanding of hydrological connectivity and associated thresholds as linked to surface or bedrock topography darboux et al 2002 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and soil moisture western et al 2001 penna et al 2011 spatially distributed approaches have supported the concept of fill and spill spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 as a potential underlying mechanism for emergent behaviour in runoff generation mcdonnell 2013 the fill and spill mechanism posits that storage capacities e g depressions in subsurface or surface topography must fill to a certain threshold e g the downslope sill of the depression before it can spill downslope fill and spill has been used to account for runoff from soil filled valleys in which valley physiography has created segments of varying storage conditions spence and woo 2003 subsurface stormflow at the soil bedrock interface on forested hillslopes tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 and subsurface stormflow above an argillic zone on low relief forested hillslopes du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 in peat dominated permafrost environments filling and spilling of spatially variable storage above a frost table has been shown to generate hillslope subsurface flow wright et al 2009 and surface runoff connectivity williams et al 2013 catchment scale overland flow generation analogous to fill and spill has been observed in lake dominated landscapes leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 surface overland flow studies at the hillslope scale have shown that runoff is modulated by micro topography and surface roughness darboux et al 2002 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2013 while not labelled sensu stricto as fill and spill they too are examples of overland flow being driven by the filling and spilling of depressions at a partitioning surface with loss along the flowpath and emergent runoff behaviour at the larger scale ameli et al 2015 the fill and spill mechanism fits within a storage excess framework of water delivery spence 2010 mcdonnell 2013 existing runoff concepts are limited in geographic relevance for example the variable source area theory hewlett and hibbert 1967 typically only explains runoff generation in humid vegetated sites while the partial area concept betson 1964 is restricted to arid or infiltration excess overland flow systems mcdonnell 2013 while fill and spill is not a theory per se mcdonnell 2013 suggested that it represents a framework that could describe the storages and connectivity relationships for a given site and lead to new theory linking the similarities of runoff processes one that is related to storage storage thresholds and connectivity spence 2010 although evidence now abounds linking storage exceedance and emergent runoff behaviour with the fill and spill mechanism relatively few studies have observed such a mechanism in frozen environments spence and woo 2003 wright et al 2009 williams et al 2013 no studies that we are aware of have examined whether or not such a mechanism operates over seasonally frozen ground on the well drained glacial deposits of the northern great plains of north america melt onto frozen ground is notoriously difficult to model gupta and sorooshian 1997 pomeroy et al 2007 on the northern great plains this is especially difficult due to minimal topographic slope and deep permeable soils upscaling point scale frozen ground runoff measurements e g granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 to the hillslope scale has been difficult for instance coles 2017 tested the widely used infiltration model of granger et al 1984 over 52 years of snowmelt runoff recorded at the swift current hillslopes in saskatchewan and found that the point scale model explained only 13 6 of the hillslope scale runoff ratio runoff in the melt season on the northern great plains is typically infiltration excess overland flow over frozen ground fang et al 2007 natural drainage systems at the landscape scale are poorly developed disconnected and sparse due to the aridity and exceptionally low angled topography fang et al 2007 during the snowmelt season a third of the annual precipitation melts within 1 2 weeks to generate c 80 of the annual runoff at the hillslope scale we might expect that these factors encourage sheet like overland flow across the soil surface at the same time shallow slopes and a poorly defined drainage system can lead to a large non contributing proportion of a hillslope this is observed at larger basin scales in these regions where large non contributing areas exist even under extremely wet conditions stichling and blackwell 1957 martin et al 1983 while undulations in the frozen soil surface could be enough for the occurrence of spatial flowpath organization and or non contributing areas these need to be mapped and addressed critically too the contrast between frozen ground infiltrability and snowmelt input rates dictate whether or not overland flow is generated these are rarely mapped or reported if the contrast is large enough it may enable widespread filling and spilling and whole hillslope connectivity if the contrast is too small less than 101 as noted by hopp and mcdonnell 2009 and james et al 2010 it would encourage infiltration loss along a flowpath and diminished or negated connectivity when frozen a soil s infiltrability is usually less than its unfrozen state granger et al 1984 but frozen infiltrabilities are varied and can sometimes still be considerable burt and williams 1976 especially in low soil moisture conditions for example spence and woo 2003 observed infiltration rates of 41 mm hr 1 on the subarctic canadian shield regardless of the frozen state of the unsaturated soil fang et al 2007 observed greater infiltration than runoff on frozen agricultural fields in southern saskatchewan due to dry soils from the previous year s cropping zheng et al 2001 found that cumulative infiltration into thawed soil 65 6 mm was only 19 1 greater than infiltration into shallow frozen soils 55 1 mm snowmelt rates too are highly variable spence and woo 2003 noted that melt input intensity averaged 0 11 mm hr 1 and melt water readily infiltrated their relatively high infiltrability frozen soils at the swift current hillslopes season averaged snowmelt rates over a 52 year period have varied between 0 39 and 4 63 mm hr 1 coles 2017 here we explore the factors controlling the patterns and mechanisms of hillslope meltwater runoff on seasonally frozen ground of the northern great plains specifically at the swift current hillslopes in southwest saskatchewan we build upon long term analysis at this site coles 2017 but focus on the 2014 melt season we measure the spatial patterns of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content thawed layer depth at the soil surface and surface topography to understand the primary controls and processes behind hillslope scale runoff activation we seek to understand the role of micro meso and macro topographic features in controlling the snowmelt runoff response and explore the similarities and differences in comparison to warmer and or more steeply sloping regions e g darboux et al 2002 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2013 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 we combine these hydrometric observations and mapping of spatial patterns with isotope analysis of snowmelt inputs and runoff outputs to mechanistically assess snowmelt runoff over frozen ground specifically we address the questions i how do hydrological and structural spatial patterns those of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content thawed layer depth and surface topography dictate connectivity and hillslope runoff generation over frozen ground ii are the controls on connectivity consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found elsewhere 2 study site the swift current hillslopes are three adjacent agricultural hillslopes located at south farm swift current 50 15 53 n 107 43 53 w in southern saskatchewan in the canadian prairie region of the northern great plains we focus our high resolution spatial analysis on hillslope 2 fig 1 with an area of 46 600 m2 a raised grassed berm around the perimeter of the hillslope prevents surface water entering from adjacent land and ensures that the only outlet for runoff is an instrumented h flume at the hillslope s northwest corner point 0 0 in fig 1 the hillslope is slightly concave in shape has gradients of 1 in the upper two thirds of the hillslope and 2 5 in the lower one third and slopes towards the northwest a digital elevation model dem obtained using a leica viva gs15 for the hillslope has a 2 m horizontal resolution and a 0 015 m vertical resolution at a finer scale than the 2 m horizontal resolution are micro topographic features ridges and furrows from seeding the hillslope if the ground is not tilled following harvest these features remain through the winter and into the spring this was the case in the spring of 2014 the season studied here the hillslope was ploughed and seeded in early summer 2013 in a north south direction with wheat planted in the raised ridges c 5 15 cm in elevation above the furrows and the cross section of one ridge and one furrow being approximately 30 50 cm wide the soil is a swinton silt loam and classified as an orthic brown chernozem cessna et al 2013 data from a one location soil profile investigation with measurements taken at 15 cm intervals from 0 to 180 cm below the soil surface were provided by agriculture and agri food canada silt content decreases with depth from 50 4 in the 0 15 cm surface layer to 27 9 at 150 165 cm clay content increases with depth from 18 2 to 30 9 and sand content fluctuates between 24 4 and 42 4 through the profile there is a clay layer 48 4 clay observed at a depth of 165 180 cm which presumably prevented deeper investigations the general soil type is silt loam for the upper 60 cm of the soil profile and clay loam beneath this bulk density increases with depth from 1 22 g cm 3 at 0 15 cm to 1 59 g cm 3 at 120 135 cm below which it decreases to 1 43 g cm 3 observations also show that saturated hydraulic conductivity increases with depth from 1 42 cm hr 1 at 0 15 cm to 5 76 cm hr 1 at 75 90 cm no data deeper than 90 cm we characterized the spatial variability of soil depth and surface infiltration capacity in july august 2013 soil probing with a dynamic cone penetrometer shanley et al 2003 at 17 random locations on the hillslope showed the mean soil depth to be 265 cm standard deviation 45 3 cm we used soil penetration resistance measured by the penetrometer as a proxy for soil permeability shanley et al 2003 where higher resistance indicated lower permeability permeability patterns were relatively uniform in space for the upper 200 cm of the soil profile but decreased with depth below 200 cm in most of the 17 profiles resistance increased and thus permeability decreased sharply at approximately 15 20 cm depth for a layer approximately 5 10 cm thick another layer of low permeability of varying thickness between 5 and 20 cm was observed in most profiles between approximately 60 100 cm below the soil surface a third thin c 5 10 cm thick layer of low permeability exists in some of the profiles between 120 and 200 cm below the soil surface which likely reflects the clay layer identified in the archived soil profile data infiltration capacity measurements were undertaken with a constant head sprinkler infiltrometer at 62 random locations on hillslope 2 seifert 2014 they show unfrozen infiltration capacities to range between 0 4 and 63 5 mm hr 1 with a mean of 13 9 mm hr 1 and standard deviation of 13 2 mm hr 1 seifert 2014 laboratory based tests indicate that frozen surface infiltration capacities at this site are much lower with a range between 0 09 and 2 57 mm hr 1 and a median of 0 33 mm hr 1 hillslope 2 typically is under an annual rotation of wheat triticum aestivum l and fallow but with some instances in the last 52 years of grass psathyrostachys juncea fisch nevski lentils lens culinaris l and peas pisum sativum l hillslope 2 has undergone both conventional tillage and zero tillage practices in 2013 the year prior to our field campaign in spring 2014 hillslope 2 was cropped with wheat and had been under zero tillage management as a result from september 2013 to may 2014 encompassing the snowmelt period studied here which had a duration of 12 days from 9th to 20th march 2014 hillslope 2 had standing wheat stubble residue with height of 30 50 cm precipitation data measured using a belfort weighing gauge for the period of study were available from a nearby c 700 m to the south southeast environment and climate change canada standard meteorological station 3 methods we used digital topographic analysis specifically the calculation of two metrics flow accumulation and downslope index to develop a theoretical map of fill and spill locations across hillslope 2 we then conducted high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of key hydrometric variables to explore changing spatial patterns of runoff production source areas we combined high frequency monitoring of runoff rates at the hillslope outlet with stable water isotope analysis of the runoff snowmelt and soil water and with the hydrometric spatial maps to understand the drivers of connectivity and water delivery during the snowmelt season we used the map of fill and spill locations to assess whether our field observations of the controls on connectivity were consistent with the fill and spill mechanism these steps are outlined in greater detail in the following subsections 3 1 digital topographic analysis following hopp and mcdonnell 2009 we calculated two metrics flow accumulation fa and downslope index di for each cell of the 2 m dem fa indicated the upslope contributing area of each cell calculated as the number of cells upslope that drained into each cell this was determined using the d8 flow algorithm a common tool to determine the weighting of flow from each cell into the eight adjacent cells jenson and domingue 1988 the fa also indicates local topographic highs ridges or sills which are assigned an fa of 0 di indicated the downslope drainage efficiency of each cell it was expressed as di v h where h is the horizontal distance that must be traversed in the steepest downslope direction to descend to a point at a pre defined vertical distance v from the elevation of the starting cell hjerdt et al 2004 while the di was initially used to capture near surface groundwater levels and backing up it is thought to be a useful tool in different terrains where topographic curvature controls local drainage regimes hjerdt et al 2004 we used a v of 15 cm selected because it is the maximum elevation change between a ridge and furrow this ensures that any sporadic instances of a ridge or furrow being picked up in the 2 m horizontal resolution dem are smoothed out from this topographic analysis a cell with a small di was caused by a long horizontal distance h and indicates that drainage from that cell was slow and inefficient tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 we used the combination of fa and di to indicate potential fill and spill locations across the hillslope hopp and mcdonnell 2009 locations with a large fa and small di shallow long slopes with a large upslope contributing area are typical of fill locations areas where water can be collected and retained meanwhile locations with a large fa and large di steep short slopes with a large upslope contributing area are typical of spill locations areas where water can accumulate and then be efficiently drained in order to map fill and spill locations across the hillslope we determined threshold values of fa and di to define large fa large di and small di first we examined the sensitivity of these threshold values and how they affected the spatial fill and spill results increasing the fa threshold value led to a reduction in the quantity of cells that were designated as fill or spill locations an increase in the quantity of nullified cells changes to the di threshold affected the pattern of fill or spill across the hillslope for example a high di threshold meant spill locations from which water is able to reach the hillslope outlet were restricted to the base of the hillslope while a lower di threshold created spill locations in all reaches of the hillslope we decided upon a fa threshold value of 10 m2 and a di threshold value of 0 015 the fa threshold value was decided upon following field observations during snowmelt of the percentage coverage of the hillslope that showed water at the soil surface approximately one third further described in section 3 2 this coverage was replicated with an fa threshold value of 10 m2 which caused 29 8 of the hillslope to be designated as either a fill location or a spill location the di threshold chosen 0 015 was relatively low so that the potential importance of the small scale micro and meso topographic relief could be captured a high di would be too coarse for these topographic nuances on low angled terrain fill locations were designated when cells had fa 10 m2 and di 0 015 spill locations were designated when cells had fa 10 m2 and di 0 015 3 2 hydrometric field measurements we measured volumetric soil water content at 0 6 cm depth on a 480 point grid a 10 10 m spatial resolution fig 1 during several daily field campaigns 19th july 2013 2nd august 2013 9th august 2013 3rd september 2013 23rd september 2013 24th october 2013 28th march 2014 7th april 2014 13th may 2014 and 19th june 2014 using a portable stevens hydraprobe pogo snow cover and frozen ground prevented these measurements being taken over winter therefore the last soil water content mapping prior to freeze up 24th october 2013 was used to capture the spatial variability in soil water content at the onset of frozen conditions mapping resumed on 28th march 2014 once there was no longer snow cover and the soil was thawed sufficiently for the probe to be inserted for each survey we made further soil water content measurements at smaller spatial resolution within random 10 10 m grid squares for geostatistical analysis variogram analysis following the first soil water content survey 19th july 2013 showed that the variance of the data stabilized at approximately 80 m giving us confidence that a 10 10 m spatial resolution adequately captured the variability and spatial patterns we measured volumetric soil water content and temperature at five depths sensing depth coverages of 0 6 6 9 21 24 43 5 46 5 and 73 5 76 5 cm with mid points at 3 7 5 22 5 45 and 75 cm respectively at four locations using stevens hydraprobes each location was representative of a key landscape unit upland area profile 1 two surface depressions profiles 2 and 3 and a slope profile 4 fig 1 these measurements were logged at 30 min intervals for a period of 12 months october 2013 to september 2014 only soil water content data for periods when the soil temperature was 0 c is useful here because the sensors determine soil water content via dielectric permittivity which is not applicable to water content quantification in frozen freezing or thawing soils without considerable uncertainty williamson 2016 we used data from 24th october 2013 and 24th april 2014 to assess the change in soil water content from pre freeze up to post melt respectively we measured snow depth and calculated density and snow water equivalent swe on a 225 point grid 10 20 m spatial resolution in the lower two thirds of the hillslope and 10 40 m spatial resolution in the upper third by manual snow surveys these snow surveys were conducted several times through the winter irregularly spaced and independent of snowfall occurrence and just prior to the onset of snowmelt timing depended on our expectation of when snowmelt would commence which was based upon local air temperature forecasts and observations of snowpack temperature and then daily every morning before any significant melt through the snowmelt period 9th march 20th march 2014 we applied the following equation to calculate daily ablation at each of the 225 measurement points 1 ablation day x swe day x swe day x 1 where ablation day x is the total snowpack ablation that occurred on a given day x it is calculated as the difference between the snow water equivalent swe of the snowpack determined at that point on the morning of day x and the equivalent determined at that point on the morning of the following day x 1 the hillslope average daily snowpack ablation is the mean of the daily ablation at the 225 points during the daily snow surveys we noted any observations of water at the soil surface visible only when a snow core was removed from the snowpack for measurement to understand approximately the areal coverage of water at the soil surface this coverage was used to define the fa threshold value we referred to this in section 3 1 we also measured snowmelt rate from the base of the snowpack manually using 18 snowmelt lysimeters at 11 locations 1 3 duplicates at some locations at irregular time intervals 10 120 min depending on melt rate fig 1 we measured surface thawed layer depth depth to the top of the frozen ground daily on a 60 point grid 20 40 m spatial resolution by manually knocking in a length of 11 mm diameter rebar until frozen ground resistance was detected this was always undertaken by the same researcher for consistency this was also carried out at 2 h intervals at three locations to capture sub daily changes in thawed layer depths seven time lapse standard image cameras wingscapes captured snow cover accumulation and ablation and were used with personal observations to chronicle the snow covered area and locations of flowpaths and ponded water on the hillslope finally runoff from the hillslope was logged at 15 min intervals through the snowmelt period using a pressure transducer hobo u20 water level data logger in the stilling well of an h flume at the outlet of the hillslope 3 3 isotope sample collection and analysis stable isotope analysis of water is one more tool that we employed to understand the mechanism of hillslope scale runoff generation during the melt season we used it to determine the ratio of new snowmelt water to displaced old soil water in the runoff during the 2014 snowmelt season we collected 1422 water soil and snow samples these samples consisted of 308 runoff samples from the flume at the outlet of hillslope 2 collected using an isco 3700 which automatically sampled water flowing through the flume at 30 min intervals 15 min intervals during peak flow 454 snowmelt samples from the base of the snowpack manually extracted from each of the 18 snowmelt lysimeters and taken at irregular intervals 10 120 min depending on melt rate i e the approximate length of time it took to obtain a full 25 ml sample vial of water 50 soil samples collected prior to snowmelt on 20th february 2014 from two depths 0 6 cm and 6 15 cm at 32 locations on hillslope 2 using a slide hammer corer these were taken to obtain pre event soil water which along with the snowmelt water is an important potential end member in the runoff signature 217 snow core and incremental snow samples collected during the snow survey melted down and bottled 63 ponded water on the soil surface or snow surface samples collected several times per day from any areas of ponded water all bottled water samples were sealed and stored in a non refrigerated cool and dry location the soil samples were double bagged and kept frozen until it was possible to extract their soil water we extracted the soil water by high pressure mechanical squeezing orlowski et al 2016 the isotopic compositions of the liquid water samples were then determined by analysis on a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research and reported in parts per thousand relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water a standard of known composition 3 4 spatial patterns mapping for all sets of data for each spatially measured variable surface soil water content depth of thawed layer and snow cover ablation we interpolated the data points using kriging sarma 2009 to provide gridded data for each variable at exactly the same points we used ordinary point kriging with a linear variogram model to weight the surrounding measured values to derive a predicted value for an unmeasured location only the data of the variable of interest were considered in the interpolation while other factors such as elevation and spatial heterogeneities of soil properties that might influence the spatial patterning of the data were not considered in the interpolation process this might affect the interpolation accuracy we employed cross validation using all measured values to determine the quality of the gridded data maps were generated from the kriged datasets 4 results 4 1 digital topographic analysis to understand the potential effects of topographic features fig 2 a on surface runoff from hillslope 2 we assessed the combination of the flow accumulation fa and downslope index di metrics as an indicator of potential fill and spill locations across the hillslope fa exhibits a power law distribution whereby a histogram of the data extends from 0 to 4000 m2 with the majority of the cells having a fa 20 m2 and a long tail of data from 20 to 4000 m2 we truncated the mapping of fa to 100 m2 the fa map fig 2b shows that individual flowpaths with higher fa are distributed across the whole hillslope there are five flowpath systems all draining in a northwest direction towards the hillslope outlet two drain the lower third 2 5 slope of the hillslope and three drain the upper two thirds 1 slope flowpath system 1 is connected to the outlet by a thin flowpath on the upper west left border of the hillslope however flowpath systems 2 3 4 and 5 do not appear to be connected directly to the outlet all four are separated from the outlet by cells of lower lighter flow accumulation and also by the flowpath systems downslope flowpath system 5 drains through 3 and then 1 while flowpath system 4 drains through 2 and then 1 any surface ponding or retention of water would occur at the mouths of these individual systems we calculated the area and volume of depressions on the hillslopes using the fill tool in arcmap 10 2 this highlighted five areas of ponding in line with the above analysis at the mouths of the individual drainage systems table 1 the raised grass berms also influenced water ponding at the mouths of flowpath systems 2 3 and 5 the raised grass border on the west side of the hillslope impedes water that is flowing towards the northwest from flowpath systems 3 and 5 causing it to pond between the raised border and a natural topographic sill on the hillslope downslope of the mouths of flowpath systems 3 and 5 the western raised grass border acts as a funnel for runoff down the western side similarly the northern raised grass border impedes flow in the northerly direction from flowpath system 2 and also acts as a conduit for flow towards the hillslope outlet along the hillslope s northern edge the di map fig 2c indicates that the majority of the hillslope especially the upper two thirds has a low di and therefore a low drainage efficiency an area of high di and therefore high drainage efficiency exists in the lower third of the hillslope and reflects the valley like surface topography fig 2a combining fa and di indicates the balance of fill and spill across the hillslope fig 2d 29 8 of the hillslope is designated as either a fill location or a spill location the majority 57 4 of the designated cells are fill locations with these concentrated in the upper two thirds of the hillslope the spill locations 42 6 are primarily in the lower third of the hillslope but there are a limited number of small spill locations in the upper third of the plot also fill locations appear to be relatively well connected to one another especially in the central third of the hillslope and are fed by spill locations further upslope the fill locations are set back from the hillslope outlet with a swath of spill locations in the intervening area this suggests that once the fill locations in the upper two thirds spill due to water input exceeding the surface detention storage capacity the released water can be efficiently routed through the spill locations over the lower third and to the hillslope outlet not captured by the dem or topographic analysis are the micro topographic ridges and furrows 4 2 hydrometric analysis 4 2 1 snowmelt snow cover and runoff the 2014 melt season had high total winter snowfall 77 5 mm swe between 1st october 2013 and 31st march 2014 a large snow cover 78 mm swe and a low medium runoff amount 25 mm the 78 mm swe of the snow cover melted over 12 days between 9th march 2014 and 20th march 2014 with peak snowmelt on 16th march fig 3 a runoff from the hillslope began on 12th march and finished on 20th march with peak runoff occurring in concert with peak snowmelt on 16th march fig 3a b peak runoff rate on 16th march was 11 6 times greater than the peak runoff rate on the previous day the instantaneous increase in runoff after hillslope wide connectivity was achieved at 15 00 on 16th march was 7 2 times greater than just before connectivity was achieved 13 45 on 16th march there were four evolving stages fig 3 of meltwater inputs to the soil surface and runoff outputs from the hillslope stage 1 9th 12th march initial snowmelt but no resulting hillslope runoff stage 2 13th 15th march continued snowmelt with moderate hillslope runoff stage 3 16th march high volumes of snowmelt and high runoff stage 4 17th 19th march low snowmelt and small amounts of runoff the spatial patterns of snow cover ablation fig 3c indicate that snowmelt occurred unevenly over the hillslope with concentrated patches of snowmelt that changed in location over time daily snow cover ablation ranged between 0 and 70 mm over the hillslope sub daily measurements at snowmelt lysimeters across the hillslope showed that at its peak on the afternoon of 16th march snowmelt occurred at 1 17 8 21 mm hr 1 we observed water ponding in the bottoms of the micro topographic furrows at the soil snow interface with flow along these features in the downslope direction maximum water movement was in the mid afternoons when some snowmelt lysimeters would become overwhelmed and subsequently abandoned by water flowing in from upslope from 11th to 16th march larger areas of ponded water gradually accumulated along the western edge of the hillslope fig 3d at the mouth of flowpath system 3 and 5 at the top of the valley like system at the mouth of flowpath system 4 and at the northern edge of the hillslope at the mouth of flowpath system 2 ponded water was at its maximum on 16th march and decreased in extent over the following days fig 4 shows the snow cover ablation and development of ponded water on the western edge of the hillslope snow covered area remained high over the hillslopes throughout most of the melt season falling gradually from 100 on 11th march to 90 7 on 15th march to 75 8 on 16th march the day of peak melt and runoff and then rapidly decreasing to 20 5 on 20th march after 20th march a small amount of snow remained on the hillslope at the northern edge of the hillslope which took a further 6 days to clear 4 2 2 thawed layer depth the ground was frozen to the soil surface homogenously across the hillslope in the initial melt days and during peak melt and runoff 16th march fig 5 a following peak runoff the thawed layer deepened rapidly and unevenly fig 5b on 18th march the ground had thawed to depths of 15 20 cm below the soil surface but only in isolated patches across the hillslope most notably on the upland at the south end of the hillslope and on a southwest facing slope in the valley like feature at the base of the hillslope the ground remained frozen to the soil surface where snow cover remained 4 2 3 soil water content the 2014 melt season was preceded by a dry autumn in 2013 on average the soil water content in the surface 0 6 cm layer was 0 15 from the 24th october 2013 survey we found that surface soil water content on 24th october 2013 fig 6 a showed relatively limited spatial variability typical of all soil water content surveys conducted fig 6b we can therefore assume that the soil water content at the onset of snowmelt was relatively spatially homogeneous further because of long soil moisture memory in this frozen dormant system coles 2017 the pre freeze up soil water content fig 6a is likely representative of soil water content at the onset of the 2014 snowmelt season soil water content generally increased following snowmelt under all four main landscape units profiles 1 4 table 2 the soil water content change was highly spatially variable the soil profile situated in the shallow sloping upland region of the hillslope profile 1 had the smallest increase in soil water content with a net increase of 8 67 mm added to the profile with gains close to the soil surface but losses at depth this profile location is representative of the majority of the hillslope by comparison soil profiles situated in the depressions profile 2 and 3 at the mouths of flowpath systems 5 and 4 respectively saw net increases of 80 3 mm and 121 mm respectively finally the soil profile on the slope fig 4 in the valley like topography saw a net increase of 148 mm of soil water weighting the soil profile s water content change by their representative area suggests a hillslope wide recharge of 0 90 cm soil water of 25 mm 4 3 isotope analysis stable water isotope analysis shows that the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of runoff water was largely temporally constant on average runoff water Œ¥18o was 21 7 0 742 and Œ¥2h was 169 4 56 but with gradual enrichment of both isotopes through the melt season fig 7 the isotope signatures of the snowmelt water on average snowmelt water Œ¥18o was 22 3 2 10 and Œ¥2h was 171 15 4 bounded the runoff water albeit with a high amount of variability by comparison the pre event soil water was much more enriched than the runoff water on average soil water Œ¥18o was 14 6 1 97 and Œ¥2h was 128 11 0 two component hydrograph separation using the mean Œ¥18o or mean Œ¥2h soil water values for the pre event end member and the mean Œ¥18o or mean Œ¥2h snowmelt values from each lysimeter for the event end member showed that the runoff water is primarily composed of new snowmelt water with very little mixing with the pre event old soil water regardless of the isotope Œ¥18o or Œ¥2h or lysimeter analyzed hydrograph separation showed that the runoff water was composed of 100 new snowmelt water in the initial stages of the snowmelt season on the day of peak runoff 16th march runoff water was composed of on average 93 9 event snowmelt water towards the end of the snowmelt and runoff season on 19th march this value had declined to on average 67 6 through the entire season runoff water was approximately 95 1 event snowmelt water and 4 9 pre event soil water 5 discussion our results suggest that a mechanism analogous to fill and spill processes observed elsewhere explains the generation of snowmelt runoff over frozen ground at our site our stable isotope analysis of meltwater confirmed that runoff water was event snowmelt water with limited mixing with pre event soil water unlike in steep terrain e g eriksson et al 2013 lateral flow through the snowpack at our site was unimportant the key factor generating fill and spill at our site is the large contrast between the low infiltration capacity of the uniformly and fully frozen soil surface and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt water delivery to the soil surface this was enough to generate ribbons and ponds of water beneath the snow at the soil surface that accumulated in micro and meso topographic depressions which then spilled downslope our observations of ponded water and flowpaths were consistent with mapped predictions of fill and spill activity from high resolution digital topographic analysis we enunciate these features in the following sections 5 1 micro meso and macro scale topographic controls on fill and spill thawed layer depth data across the slope showed uniformly frozen soil to the soil surface thawed layer depth 0 cm in the days leading up to and during peak runoff frozen ground infiltration capacities have been observed at this site to range between 0 09 and 2 57 mm hr 1 with a median of 0 33 mm hr 1 snowmelt rates during peak snowmelt in 2014 were 1 17 8 21 mm hr 1 the relatively high rates of snowmelt water delivery to the soil surface largely exceeded the infiltration capacity of the frozen soil by a magnitude greater than 101 the hypothetical minimum contrast between bedrock and soil permeabilities required to generate runoff via the fill and spill mechanism at the soil bedrock interface hopp and mcdonnell 2009 as such we had an impeding layer contrast that was sufficient for the accumulation of water on the soil surface this hints at the importance of soil temperature whether a frozen thawing or thawed state if peak snowmelt had occurred on ground that was thawing or had thawed connectivity and runoff likely would not have been triggered by the mechanism described here the concavity in the monitored hillslope is a macro topographic feature 10 000 m2 of the site the concavity affects the balance of fill and spill the relatively steeper 2 5 lower third of the hillslope was a dominant spill location the flatter 1 upper two thirds was a dominant fill location this pattern is a site specific feature variations in hillslope shape would show altogether different fill spill patterns for example a convex hillslope where the lower part of the hillslope is shallow and the upper part more steep would have a reverse fill spill pattern to that observed here our terrain analysis indicated a balanced fill spill regime with 57 4 of the hillslope characterized by fill locations and 42 6 by spill locations at finer scales the meso topographic features 100 10 000 m2 revealed five flowpath systems in the flow accumulation fa mapping flowpath systems 1 and 2 drained the lower third of the hillslope flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 drained the upper two thirds these latter flowpath systems terminated at their downslope edges by slight lips in the surface topography these lips were enough to create a backwater effect and to create a fill region we observed that the lips must be overcome for the upper region of the hillslope to connect to the lower spill region of the hillslope and thus the hillslope outlet the fa di and fill and spill maps fig 2 where these lips are visible are useful tools to interpret the mechanisms behind ponding storage exceedance and rapid delivery of water important though is that each cell of these maps is solely an indicator of the local topographic surface additional research could seek to incorporate a metric for the likelihood of flow pathways being disconnected by a fill location created by a sill possible approaches to this could be to experiment with increased values of v di v h which would then integrate topography further downslope from the starting point or to use a metric of flowpath distance to the hillslope outlet and the fill locations it must overcome nested within these macro and meso scale topographic systems the micro topographic features 100 m2 also exhibited a flow control during meltwater runoff these small undulations were observable within the 10 10 m measurement grid most notably these were ridges and furrows left behind from tractor based seeding in the previous summer while these micro scale features were not visible in the 2 m dem they were an important localized feature in the initial routing and retention of melt water melt water pooled in and was gradually routed downslope by the furrows within each of the five flowpath systems in flowpath systems 1 and 2 fill and spill occurred mainly within the furrows in flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 however the routing of water via these furrows and small undulations was overtopped by ponded water that developed and grew in volume upslope from the lips after which these barriers were overcome and water could spill over and coalesce at the hillslope outlet overall the hillslope exhibited nested filling and macro spilling our finding that topography dictates hillslope scale connectivity and snowmelt runoff generation over frozen ground is in contrast to devito et al 2005 they examined a boreal plain site with more surficial geology variation but importantly with similar low relief and deep glaciated substrate as the swift current hillslopes devito et al 2005 dismissed the importance of surface topography the key difference is that their evaluation was for a summer period when the ground was unfrozen and the deep high infiltrability mineral soils promoted vertical flow infiltration indeed an analysis of summer rainfall runoff events at our site would support the suggestion that topography is unimportant since all water infiltrates except in exceptional storms in only 28 years of the 52 year record have summer storms generated runoff coles 2017 but critically we see here that topography is episodically important during melt onto frozen ground topographic features acted as both a conduit for meltwater runoff that enabled flowpath formation and connectivity once threshold surface detention levels were exceeded and a loss mechanism that enabled ponded water to form and then heightened infiltration and soil water recharge under depressions when the ground started to thaw 5 2 fill and spill over shallow frozen hillslopes in relation to other environments the hydrologic response on hillslope 2 of the swift current hillslopes reflected the fill and spill mechanism already observed in many other environments spence and woo 2003 leibowitz and vining 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 appels et al 2011 du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 leibowitz et al 2016 the fill and spill mechanism was first introduced in a subarctic soil filled valley with spatially variable subsurface storage capacities due to varying soil depths to bedrock that had to fill up in order to enable surface runoff spence and woo 2003 the definition of the mechanism was further developed following analogous observations that showed depressions in subsurface or surface topography must fill up to a certain threshold the downslope sill of the depression before water can spill downslope e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 leibowitz et al 2016 these fill and spill observations fall within a storage excess framework of water delivery spence 2010 sayama et al 2011 mcdonnell 2013 the observations presented in this paper are fundamentally the same as those observations of fill and spill of depressions across an impeding layer and of a storage excess delivery of runoff the particular fill and spill mechanism described here is different to most previous observations primarily because it is snowmelt over a frozen soil surface this environment sees months of runoff inactivity with no whole hillslope connectivity and then 1 2 weeks where fill and spill over frozen ground delivers the large annual runoff pulse this short acute period of runoff occurs with the concurrent conditions of a frozen soil surface and high volumes of liquid water as also described in williams et al 2013 for intermittent surface runoff connectivity over frozen peatland this is unlike the humid temperate regions where bedrock fill and spill is primed and relatively frequently produces subsurface stormflow tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham and mcdonnell 2010 du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 the scale at which we have observed fill and spill is different to most previous studies observations of this mechanism have typically been at the plot or trenched hillslope scale e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 du et al 2016 at the small catchment scale spence and woo 2003 and at the landscape scale e g leibowitz et al 2016 the nested filling and spilling across scales at our hillslope site is essentially the next scale down from the wetland filling and spilling described for the prairie pothole region leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 the hillslopes of the northern great plains deliver water to these wetlands whose connectivity is in turn also dictated by fill and spill albeit a fill and spill mechanism that is influenced and mediated by additional factors such as groundwater surface water interactions brannen et al 2015 and storage memory shook and pomeroy 2011 our study site is a low gradient end member slope 1 2 5 in the fill and spill literature our analysis indicated a fairly balanced fill spill regime with 57 4 of the hillslope characterized by fill locations and 42 6 of the hillslope characterized by spill locations this is in contrast to previous studies with slightly steeper yet still relatively shallow slopes 7 2 slope in hopp and mcdonnell 2009 and 6 12 slopes in du et al 2016 that exhibited fill dominated regimes which was attributed to their flatness as slope angle decreases hillslopes appear to transition from a spill dominated on steep slopes to a fill spill balance on medium slopes and finally to a fill dominated system on shallow slopes hopp and mcdonnell 2009 reaney et al 2014 our fill spill balance is perhaps more typical of medium angled slopes we attribute the difference between our fill spill balance and these other low angle studies fill dominated regimes to the difference in overall hillslope form while these other studies hillslopes were largely planar ours is concave the downslope barriers at the edge of the concave cross section created the surface depressions that retained water and dictated upslope fill locations downslope of these barriers any runoff at a point was able to flow unimpeded to the outlet most prior fill and spill observations at the soil bedrock or soil argillic interface have reported connectivity as discrete flow networks almost channel like in their flow architecture tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 williams et al 2013 by contrast our fill and spill connectivity across this frozen hillslope occurred as a set of more amorphous locations of ponded water that intermittently and individually connected to the hillslope outlet analogous to wetland connectivity on the prairies leibowitz and vining 2003 these areas of ponded water exhibited heightened infiltration and soil water recharge beyond that exhibited by the general gently sloping hillslope area this is akin to enhanced groundwater recharge observed under bedrock depressions at the soil bedrock interface appels et al 2015 finally the four distinct stages in the evolution of meltwater inputs to the soil surface and runoff outputs from the hillslope can be explained by the pattern and rates of snowmelt where the pattern exhibits a high spatial variability and the rates exhibit a high temporal variability onto the frozen reduced infiltrability soil and the pattern and layout of the micro meso and macro topographic features during stage 1 9th 12th march snowmelt started to accumulate in the furrows with no resulting hillslope runoff in stage 2 13th 15th march snowmelt continued to accumulate in the furrows and to be routed through each of the five flowpath systems in flowpath systems 1 and 2 snowmelt water could then flow uninterrupted to the outlet which generated the first hillslope runoff and low hillslope runoff ratios meanwhile ponded water was accumulating behind the downslope barriers at the mouths of flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 in stage 3 16th march high volumes of snowmelt caused the water ponding at the mouths of flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 to reach surface storage capacity and spill over their downslope barriers this connected the upper region of the hillslope with the lower region creating continuous flowpaths that connected all five flowpath systems to the hillslope outlet with a resultant instantaneous increase in runoff and high runoff ratios melt rates were highest in the upper region of the hillslope which ensured the downslope depressions were continually fed the surface storage capacity exceeded and hillslope wide connectivity maintained for 3 4 h following this the ponded water fell below the downslope barriers and disconnected the upper two thirds of the hillslope from the outlet during stage 4 17th march onwards low runoff resulted from slower prolonged snowmelt routed via micro topography to the hillslope outlet from the remaining snow cover in the sheltered coulees over the lower third of the hillslope the ground rapidly began to thaw from 17th march enabling the remaining ponded water to readily infiltrate and contribute to soil water recharge overall these four stages exhibited a dynamic contributing area a feature of connectivity and fill and spill martin et al 1983 shaw et al 2012 the contributing area was largely restricted to the lower third of the hillslope but briefly extended to the entire hillslope on 16th march when widespread ponded water was connected to the hillslope outlet before it contracted back again to the lower region of the hillslope 5 3 soil moisture based metrics of connectivity perform poorly for frozen hillslopes soil water content is critically important for soil infiltrability and hillslope runoff in general e g horton 1933 over frozen ground on the prairies granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 and at this site in particular coles 2017 despite this because the soil water content showed very little spatial variability the spatial patterning of soil water content likely had little effect on the spatial variation in ponded water development and flowpath distribution the hillslope s observed mean autumn surface soil water content was 0 15 if the soil was on average much drier at the time of freezing we likely would have seen greater hillslope wide infiltration longer time for surface depressions to fill and then spill if at all and a delayed and damped increase in the delivery of water when connectivity was achieved the opposite would have been true for a much wetter hillslope there is some evidence of this at this site where long term runoff ratios were generally higher over wetter soils likely a result of reduced infiltration coles 2017 however this was mediated by the volume of surface depression storage such that runoff ratios were typically lower when there was a high surface depression storage even when the soils were wet coles 2017 metrics that use the spatial arrangement of hillslope or catchment soil moisture as indicators of connectivity because of the way stores of water fill up to generate hydrological connections tetzlaff et al 2011 bracken et al 2013 are likely not helpful for these frozen soils where there is little spatial variation over the hillslope further for what little measured variability there was in soil water content it was not related to topographic position this could be attributed to the relatively low relief and the influence of evapotranspiration in reducing the variability across the hillslope at a similar prairie site peterson 2016 also observed that soil water content was not correlated with topographic relief they also noted that soil water content variability was much higher under wetter conditions yet still not related to topographic position peterson 2016 soil water content might have an effect on ponded water and flowpath formation if a more undulating site froze soon after rainfall where side slopes might freeze dry and swales might freeze wet we have not observed such effects however analyses that use terrain to infer soil moisture and by extension flowpaths and connectivity e g beven and kirkby 1979 lane et al 2009 might reasonably accurately determine frozen ground flowpaths but likely only due to structural routing of the water rather than any topographically induced differences in soil moisture for example our testing of the topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 fig 8 unsurprisingly produced mapped results very similar to fa fig 2b the twi metric does not incorporate any metric for downslope impedance which the use of di here has shown to be an important component in the routing of flow and connectivity via fill and spill previous work at this site has shown that a lumped approach can indeed be fruitful for predicting the seasonal runoff response e g the decision tree model of coles 2017 we have shown here though that in order to understand and predict sub seasonal time scale daily hourly or weekly runoff responses then distributed topographic data distributed snowmelt data frozen soil infiltration capacity data and hillslope average soil water content data are needed having determined that the fill and spill mechanism dictates hillslope runoff response for snowmelt over frozen ground and given the underlying phenomenological similarities in fill and spill runoff generation processes at different partitioning surfaces mcdonnell 2013 ameli et al 2015 then we can also look to existing fill and spill modeling approaches just as ameli et al 2015 used an overland flow model to predict hillslope scale subsurface flow existing fill and spill like approaches could greatly improve predictions of wetland recharge flooding and water availability for the dominant runoff producing event of the year on the northern great plains appels et al 2011 and chu et al 2013 developed numerical models to explore the effects of spatial organization of meso and micro topographic features on flowpath convergence connectivity and runoff interestingly these plot and hillslope scale ponding and redistribution models are numerically very similar save for their treatments of infiltration to a physically based landscape scale model devised by shook et al 2013 to simulate surface storage dynamics in prairie wetlands that have been shown to connect and disconnect via the fill and spill mechanism leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 such approaches might therefore be adopted for the modeling of hillslope runoff response for snowmelt over frozen ground 6 conclusion we examined snowmelt runoff processes for the 2014 snowmelt season at a 46 600 m2 hillslope site on the northern great plains the fill and spill mechanism appears to explain the generation of snowmelt runoff over frozen ground our main evidence for fill and spill is 1 the contrast between the uniformly frozen soil s low infiltration capacity and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface that generated water beneath the snow at the soil surface and then accumulated in surface depressions 2 stable isotope analysis of water showed that runoff water was event snowmelt water with limited mixing with pre event soil water and 3 observations of ponded water and flowpaths that matched our predictions of fill and spill activity from digital topographic analyses that combined flow accumulation and downslope indices we observed nested filling at the micro and meso scale followed by macro scale spilling where large patches of ponded water coalesced to drive an instantaneous increase in hillslope runoff the identification of fill and spill as a mechanism to explain meltwater runoff from shallow frozen hillslopes supports similar findings from peat dominated permafrost sites in northern canada where the frost table acts as an impeding layer and has widespread implications for other areas of the

7445,snowmelt runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale this is especially true for hillslopes on the northern great plains of north america where long periods of snow covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation this study examines a 4 66 ha 46 600 m2 hillslope on the northern great plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes specifically we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content and thawed layer depth which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46 600 m2 hillslope affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity a key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain dominated and unfrozen soil domains the contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack consequently infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period instead nested filling of micro and meso depressions was followed by macro scale whole slope spilling this spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet these observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis interestingly while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen keywords hydrological connectivity snowmelt frozen ground runoff generation fill and spill 1 introduction understanding snowmelt runoff generation in snow dominated regions is critical for predicting water delivery and availability as the climate changes and these cold regions warm while point scale e g granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 and hillslope scale e g kane et al 1981 quinton and marsh 1999 carey and woo 2001 quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2005 melt and runoff processes have been well studied we still do not fully understand process controls on hillslope snowmelt runoff connectivity where here connectivity is conceptualised as the generation of continuous flow fields across a hillslope connecting point scale runoff generation elements across hillslopes and catchments is now seen as fundamental for assessing the nonlinearities in runoff relations several studies have now shown how key nonlinearities like thresholds and feedbacks can produce emergent behaviour that is not explainable by traditional point scale concepts grayson and bl√∂schl 2001 sivapalan 2005 bracken and croke 2007 james and roulet

spatially distributed approaches have supported the concept of fill and spill spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 as a potential underlying mechanism for emergent behaviour in runoff generation mcdonnell 2013 the fill and spill mechanism posits that storage capacities e g depressions in subsurface or surface topography must fill to a certain threshold e g the downslope sill of the depression before it can spill downslope fill and spill has been used to account for runoff from soil filled valleys in which valley physiography has created segments of varying storage

argillic zone on low relief forested hillslopes du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 in peat dominated permafrost environments filling and spilling of spatially variable storage above a frost table has been shown to generate hillslope subsurface flow wright et al 2009 and surface runoff connectivity williams et al 2013 catchment scale overland flow generation analogous to fill and spill has been observed in lake dominated landscapes leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 surface overland flow studies at the hillslope scale have shown that runoff is modulated by micro topography and surface roughness darboux et al 2002 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2013 while not labelled sensu stricto as fill and spill they too are examples of overland flow being driven by the filling and spilling of depressions at a partitioning surface with loss along the flowpath and emergent runoff behaviour at the larger scale ameli et al 2015 the fill and spill mechanism fits within a storage excess framework of water delivery spence 2010 mcdonnell 2013 existing runoff concepts are limited in geographic relevance for example the variable source area theory hewlett and hibbert 1967 typically only explains runoff generation in humid vegetated sites while the partial area concept betson 1964 is restricted to arid or infiltration excess overland flow systems mcdonnell 2013 while fill and spill is not a theory per se mcdonnell 2013 suggested that it represents a framework that could describe the storages and connectivity relationships for a given site and lead to new theory linking the similarities of runoff processes one that is related to storage storage thresholds and connectivity spence 2010 although evidence now abounds linking storage exceedance and emergent runoff behaviour with the fill and spill mechanism relatively few studies have observed such a mechanism in frozen environments spence and woo 2003 wright et al 2009 williams et al 2013 no studies that we are aware of have examined whether or not such a mechanism operates over seasonally frozen ground on the well drained glacial deposits of the northern great plains of north america melt onto frozen ground is notoriously difficult to model gupta and sorooshian 1997 pomeroy et al 2007 on the northern great plains this is especially difficult due to minimal topographic slope and deep permeable soils upscaling point scale frozen ground runoff measurements e g granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 to the hillslope scale has been difficult for instance coles 2017 tested the widely used infiltration model of granger et al 1984 over 52 years of snowmelt runoff recorded at the swift current hillslopes in saskatchewan and found that the point scale model explained only 13 6 of the hillslope scale runoff ratio runoff in the melt season on the northern great plains is typically infiltration excess overland flow over frozen ground fang et al 2007 natural drainage systems at the landscape scale are poorly developed disconnected and sparse due to the aridity and exceptionally low angled topography fang et al 2007 during the snowmelt season a third of the annual precipitation melts within 1 2 weeks to generate c 80 of the annual runoff at the hillslope scale we might expect that these factors encourage sheet like overland flow across the soil surface at the same time shallow slopes and a poorly defined drainage system can lead to a large non contributing proportion of a hillslope this is observed at larger basin scales in these regions where large non contributing areas exist even under extremely wet conditions stichling and blackwell 1957 martin et al 1983 while undulations in the frozen soil surface could be enough for the occurrence of spatial flowpath organization and or non contributing areas these need to be mapped and addressed critically too the contrast between frozen ground infiltrability and snowmelt input rates dictate whether or not overland flow is generated these are rarely mapped or reported if the contrast is large enough it may enable widespread filling and spilling and whole hillslope connectivity if the contrast is too small less than 101 as noted by hopp and mcdonnell 2009 and james et al 2010 it would encourage infiltration loss along a flowpath and diminished or negated connectivity when frozen a soil s infiltrability is usually less than its unfrozen state granger et al 1984 but frozen infiltrabilities are varied and can sometimes still be considerable burt and williams 1976 especially in low soil moisture conditions for example spence and woo 2003 observed infiltration rates of 41 mm hr 1 on the subarctic canadian shield regardless of the frozen state of the unsaturated soil fang et al 2007 observed greater infiltration than runoff on frozen agricultural fields in southern saskatchewan due to dry soils from the previous year s cropping zheng et al 2001 found that cumulative infiltration into thawed soil 65 6 mm was only 19 1 greater than infiltration into shallow frozen soils 55 1 mm snowmelt rates too are highly variable spence and woo 2003 noted that melt input intensity averaged 0 11 mm hr 1 and melt water readily infiltrated their relatively high infiltrability frozen soils at the swift current hillslopes season averaged snowmelt rates over a 52 year period have varied between 0 39 and 4 63 mm hr 1 coles 2017 here we explore the factors controlling the patterns and mechanisms of hillslope meltwater runoff on seasonally frozen ground of the northern great plains specifically at the swift current hillslopes in southwest saskatchewan we build upon long term analysis at this site coles 2017 but focus on the 2014 melt season we measure the spatial patterns of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content thawed layer depth at the soil surface and surface topography to understand the primary controls and processes behind hillslope scale runoff activation we seek to understand the role of micro meso and macro topographic features in controlling the snowmelt runoff response and explore the similarities and differences in comparison to warmer and or more steeply sloping regions e g darboux et al 2002 appels et al 2011 chu et al 2013 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 we combine these hydrometric observations and mapping of spatial patterns with isotope analysis of snowmelt inputs and runoff outputs to mechanistically assess snowmelt runoff over frozen ground specifically we address the questions i how do hydrological and structural spatial patterns those of snow cover snow water equivalent soil water content thawed layer depth and surface topography dictate connectivity and hillslope runoff generation over frozen ground ii are the controls on connectivity consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found elsewhere 2 study site the swift current hillslopes are three adjacent agricultural hillslopes located at south farm swift current 50 15

raised grassed berm around the perimeter of the hillslope prevents surface water entering from adjacent land and ensures that the only outlet for runoff is an instrumented h flume at the hillslope s

content decreases with depth from 50 4 in the 0 15 cm surface layer to 27 9 at 150 165 cm clay content increases with depth from 18 2 to 30 9 and sand content fluctuates between 24 4 and 42 4 through the profile there is a clay layer 48 4 clay observed at a depth of 165 180 cm which presumably prevented deeper investigations the general soil type is silt loam for the upper 60 cm of the soil profile and clay loam beneath this bulk density increases with depth from 1 22 g cm 3 at 0 15 cm to 1 59 g cm 3 at 120 135 cm below which it decreases to 1 43 g cm 3 observations also show that saturated hydraulic conductivity increases with depth from 1 42 cm hr 1 at 0 15 cm to 5 76 cm hr 1 at 75 90 cm no data deeper than 90 cm we characterized the spatial variability of soil depth and surface infiltration capacity in july august 2013 soil probing with a dynamic cone penetrometer shanley et al 2003 at 17 random locations on the hillslope showed the mean soil depth to be 265 cm standard deviation 45 3 cm we used soil penetration resistance measured by the penetrometer as a proxy for soil permeability shanley et al 2003 where higher resistance indicated lower permeability permeability patterns were relatively uniform in space for the upper 200 cm of the soil profile but decreased with depth below 200 cm in most of the 17 profiles resistance increased and thus permeability decreased sharply at approximately 15 20 cm depth for a layer approximately 5 10 cm thick another layer of low permeability of varying thickness between 5 and 20 cm was observed in most profiles between approximately 60 100 cm below the soil surface a third thin c 5 10 cm thick layer of low permeability exists in some of the profiles between 120 and 200 cm below the soil surface which likely reflects the clay layer identified in the archived soil profile data infiltration capacity measurements were undertaken with a constant head sprinkler infiltrometer at 62 random locations on hillslope 2 seifert 2014 they show unfrozen infiltration capacities to range between 0 4 and 63 5 mm hr 1 with a mean of 13 9 mm hr 1 and standard deviation of 13 2 mm hr 1 seifert 2014 laboratory based tests indicate that frozen surface infiltration capacities at this site are much lower with a range between 0 09 and 2 57 mm hr 1 and a median of 0 33 mm hr 1 hillslope 2 typically is under an annual rotation of wheat triticum aestivum l and fallow but with some instances in the last 52 years of grass psathyrostachys juncea fisch nevski lentils lens culinaris l and peas pisum sativum l hillslope 2 has undergone both conventional tillage and zero tillage practices in 2013 the year prior to our field campaign in spring 2014 hillslope 2 was cropped with wheat and had been under zero tillage management as a result from september 2013 to may 2014 encompassing the snowmelt period studied here which had a duration of 12 days from 9th to 20th march 2014 hillslope 2 had standing wheat stubble residue with height of 30 50 cm precipitation data measured using a belfort weighing gauge for the period of study were available from a nearby c 700 m to the south southeast environment and climate change canada standard meteorological station 3 methods we used digital topographic analysis specifically the calculation of two metrics flow accumulation and downslope index to develop a theoretical map of fill and spill locations across hillslope 2 we then conducted high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of key hydrometric variables to explore changing spatial patterns of runoff production source areas we combined high frequency monitoring of runoff rates at the hillslope outlet with stable water isotope analysis of the runoff snowmelt and soil water and with the hydrometric spatial maps to understand the drivers of connectivity and water delivery during the snowmelt season we used the map of fill and spill locations to assess whether our field observations of the controls on connectivity were consistent with the fill and spill mechanism these steps are outlined in greater detail in the following subsections 3 1 digital topographic analysis following hopp and mcdonnell 2009 we calculated two metrics flow accumulation fa and downslope index di for each cell of the 2 m dem fa indicated the upslope contributing area of each cell calculated as the number of cells upslope that drained into each cell this was determined using the d8 flow algorithm a common tool to determine the weighting of flow from each cell into the eight adjacent cells jenson and domingue 1988 the fa also indicates local topographic highs ridges or sills which are assigned an fa of 0 di indicated the downslope drainage efficiency of each cell it was expressed as di v h where h is the horizontal distance that must be traversed in the steepest downslope direction to descend to a point at a pre defined vertical distance v from the elevation of the starting cell hjerdt et al 2004 while the di was initially used to capture near surface groundwater levels and backing up it is thought to be a useful tool in different terrains where topographic curvature controls local drainage regimes hjerdt et al 2004 we used a v of 15 cm selected because it is the maximum elevation change between a ridge and furrow this ensures that any sporadic instances of a ridge or furrow being picked up in the 2 m horizontal resolution dem are smoothed out from this topographic analysis a cell with a small di was caused by a long horizontal distance h and indicates that drainage from that cell was slow and inefficient tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 we used the combination of fa and di to indicate potential fill and spill locations across the hillslope hopp and mcdonnell 2009 locations with a large fa and small di shallow long slopes with a large upslope contributing area are typical of fill locations areas where water can be collected and retained meanwhile locations with a large fa and large di steep short slopes with a large upslope contributing area are typical of spill locations areas where water can accumulate and then be efficiently drained in order to map fill and spill locations across the hillslope we determined threshold values of fa and di to define large fa large di and small di first we examined the sensitivity of these threshold values and how they affected the spatial fill and spill results increasing the fa threshold value led to a reduction in the quantity of cells that were designated as fill or spill locations an increase in the quantity of nullified cells changes to the di threshold affected the pattern of fill or spill across the hillslope for example a high di threshold meant spill locations from which water is able to reach the hillslope outlet were restricted to the base of the hillslope while a lower di threshold created spill locations in all reaches of the hillslope we decided upon a fa threshold value of 10 m2 and a di threshold value of 0 015 the fa threshold value was decided upon following field observations during snowmelt of the percentage coverage of the hillslope that showed water at the soil surface approximately one third further described in section 3 2 this coverage was replicated with an fa threshold value of 10 m2 which caused 29 8 of the hillslope to be designated as either a fill location or a spill location the di threshold chosen 0 015 was relatively low so that the potential importance of the small scale micro and meso topographic relief could be captured a high di would be too coarse for these topographic nuances on low angled terrain fill locations were designated when cells had fa 10 m2 and di 0 015 spill locations were designated when cells had fa 10 m2 and di 0 015 3 2 hydrometric field measurements we measured volumetric soil water content at 0 6 cm depth on a 480 point grid a 10 10 m spatial resolution fig 1 during several daily field campaigns 19th july 2013 2nd august 2013 9th august 2013 3rd september 2013 23rd september 2013 24th october 2013 28th march 2014 7th april 2014 13th may 2014 and 19th june 2014 using a portable stevens hydraprobe pogo snow cover and frozen ground prevented these measurements being taken over winter therefore the last soil water content mapping prior to freeze up 24th october 2013 was used to capture the spatial variability in soil water content at the onset of frozen conditions mapping resumed on 28th march 2014 once there was no longer snow cover and the soil was thawed sufficiently for the probe to be inserted for each survey we made further soil water content measurements at smaller spatial resolution within random 10 10 m grid squares for geostatistical analysis variogram analysis following the first soil water content survey 19th july 2013 showed that the variance of the data stabilized at approximately 80 m giving us confidence that a 10 10 m spatial resolution adequately captured the variability and spatial patterns we measured volumetric soil water content and temperature at five depths sensing depth coverages of 0 6 6 9 21 24 43 5 46 5 and 73 5 76 5 cm with mid points at 3 7 5 22 5 45 and 75 cm respectively at four locations using stevens hydraprobes each location was representative of a key landscape unit upland area profile 1 two surface depressions profiles 2 and 3 and a slope profile 4 fig 1 these measurements were logged at 30 min intervals for a period of 12 months october 2013 to september 2014 only soil water content data for periods when the soil temperature was 0 c is useful here because the sensors determine soil water content via dielectric permittivity which is not applicable to water content quantification in frozen freezing or thawing soils without considerable uncertainty williamson 2016 we used data from 24th october 2013 and 24th april 2014 to assess the change in soil water content from pre freeze up to post melt respectively we measured snow depth and calculated density and snow water equivalent swe on a 225 point grid 10 20 m spatial resolution in the lower two thirds of the hillslope and 10 40 m spatial resolution in the upper third by manual snow surveys these snow surveys were conducted several times through the winter irregularly spaced and independent of snowfall occurrence and just prior to the onset of snowmelt timing depended on our expectation of when snowmelt would commence which was based upon local air temperature forecasts and observations of snowpack temperature and then daily every morning before any significant melt through the snowmelt period 9th march 20th march 2014 we applied the following equation to calculate daily ablation at each of the 225 measurement points 1 ablation day x swe day x swe day x 1 where ablation day x is the total snowpack ablation that occurred on a given day x it is calculated as the difference between the snow water equivalent swe of the snowpack determined at that point on the morning of day x and the equivalent determined at that point on the morning of the following day x 1 the hillslope average daily snowpack ablation is the mean of the daily ablation at the 225 points during the daily snow surveys we noted any observations of water at the soil surface visible only when a snow core was removed from the snowpack for measurement to understand approximately the areal coverage of water at the soil surface this coverage was used to define the fa threshold value we referred to this in section 3 1 we also measured snowmelt rate from the base of the snowpack manually using 18 snowmelt lysimeters at 11 locations 1 3 duplicates at some locations at irregular time intervals 10 120 min depending on melt rate fig 1 we measured surface thawed layer depth depth to the top of the frozen ground daily on a 60 point grid 20 40 m spatial resolution by manually knocking in a length of 11 mm diameter rebar until frozen ground resistance was detected this was always undertaken by the same researcher for consistency this was also carried out at 2 h intervals at three locations to capture sub daily changes in thawed layer depths seven time lapse standard image cameras wingscapes captured snow cover accumulation and ablation and were used with personal observations to chronicle the snow covered area and locations of flowpaths and ponded water on the hillslope finally runoff from the hillslope was logged at 15 min intervals through the snowmelt period using a pressure transducer hobo u20 water level data logger in the stilling well of an h flume at the outlet of the hillslope 3 3 isotope sample collection and analysis stable isotope analysis of water is one more tool that we employed to understand the mechanism of hillslope scale runoff generation during the melt season we used it to determine the ratio of new snowmelt water to displaced old soil water in the runoff during the 2014 snowmelt season we collected 1422 water soil and snow samples these samples consisted of 308 runoff samples from the flume at the outlet of hillslope 2 collected using an isco 3700 which automatically sampled water flowing through the flume at 30 min intervals 15 min intervals during peak flow 454 snowmelt samples from the base of the snowpack manually extracted from each of the 18 snowmelt lysimeters and taken at irregular intervals 10 120 min depending on melt rate i e the approximate length of time it took to obtain a full 25 ml sample vial of water 50 soil samples collected prior to snowmelt on 20th february 2014 from two depths 0 6 cm and 6 15 cm at 32 locations on hillslope 2 using a slide hammer corer these were taken to obtain pre event soil water which along with the snowmelt water is an important potential end member in the runoff signature 217 snow core and incremental snow samples collected during the snow survey melted down and bottled 63 ponded water on the soil surface or snow surface samples collected several times per day from any areas of ponded water all bottled water samples were sealed and stored in a non refrigerated cool and dry location the soil samples were double bagged and kept frozen until it was possible to extract their soil water we extracted the soil water by high pressure mechanical squeezing orlowski et al 2016 the isotopic compositions of the liquid water samples were then determined by analysis on a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research and reported in parts per thousand relative to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water a standard of known composition 3 4 spatial patterns mapping for all sets of data for each spatially measured variable surface soil water content depth of thawed layer and snow cover ablation we interpolated the data points using kriging sarma 2009 to provide gridded data for each variable at exactly the same points we used ordinary point kriging with a linear variogram model to weight the surrounding measured values to derive a predicted value for an unmeasured location only the data of the variable of interest were considered in the interpolation while other factors such as elevation and spatial heterogeneities of soil properties that might influence the spatial patterning of the data were not considered in the interpolation process this might affect the interpolation accuracy we employed cross validation using all measured values to determine the quality of the gridded data maps were generated from the kriged datasets 4 results 4 1 digital topographic analysis to understand the potential effects of topographic features fig 2 a on surface runoff from hillslope 2 we assessed the combination of the flow accumulation fa and downslope index di metrics as an indicator of potential fill and spill locations across the hillslope fa exhibits a power law distribution whereby a histogram of the data extends from 0 to 4000 m2 with the majority of the cells having a fa 20 m2 and a long tail of data from 20 to 4000 m2 we truncated the mapping of fa to 100 m2 the fa map fig 2b shows that individual flowpaths with higher fa are distributed across the whole hillslope there are five flowpath systems all draining in a northwest direction towards the hillslope outlet two drain the lower third 2 5 slope of the hillslope and three drain the upper two thirds 1 slope flowpath system 1 is connected to the outlet by a thin flowpath on the upper west left border of the hillslope however flowpath systems 2 3 4 and 5 do not appear to be connected directly to the outlet all four are separated from the outlet by cells of lower lighter flow accumulation and also by the flowpath systems downslope flowpath system 5 drains through 3 and then 1 while flowpath system 4 drains through 2 and then 1 any surface ponding or retention of water would occur at the mouths of these individual systems we calculated the area and volume of depressions on the hillslopes using the fill tool in arcmap 10 2 this highlighted five areas of ponding in line with the above analysis at the mouths of the individual drainage systems table 1 the raised grass berms also influenced water ponding at the mouths of flowpath systems 2 3 and 5 the raised grass border on the west side of the hillslope impedes water that is flowing towards the northwest from flowpath systems 3 and 5 causing it to pond between the raised border and a natural topographic sill on the hillslope downslope of the mouths of flowpath systems 3 and 5 the western raised grass border acts as a funnel for runoff down the western side similarly the northern raised grass border impedes flow in the northerly direction from flowpath system 2 and also acts as a conduit for flow towards the hillslope outlet along the hillslope s northern edge the di map fig 2c indicates that the majority of the hillslope especially the upper two thirds has a low di and therefore a low drainage efficiency an area of high di and therefore high drainage efficiency exists in the lower third of the hillslope and reflects the valley like surface topography fig 2a combining fa and di indicates the balance of fill and spill across the hillslope fig 2d 29 8 of the hillslope is designated as either a fill location or a spill location the majority 57 4 of the designated cells are fill locations with these concentrated in the upper two thirds of the hillslope the spill locations 42 6 are primarily in the lower third of the hillslope but there are a limited number of small spill locations in the upper third of the plot also fill locations appear to be relatively well connected to one another especially in the central third of the hillslope and are fed by spill locations further upslope the fill locations are set back from the hillslope outlet with a swath of spill locations in the intervening area this suggests that once the fill locations in the upper two thirds spill due to water input exceeding the surface detention storage capacity the released water can be efficiently routed through the spill locations over the lower third and to the hillslope outlet not captured by the dem or topographic analysis are the micro topographic ridges and furrows 4 2 hydrometric analysis 4 2 1 snowmelt snow cover and runoff the 2014 melt season had high total winter snowfall 77 5 mm swe between 1st october 2013 and 31st march 2014 a large snow cover 78 mm swe and a low medium runoff amount 25 mm the 78 mm swe of the snow cover melted over 12 days between 9th march 2014 and 20th march 2014 with peak snowmelt on 16th march fig 3 a runoff from the hillslope began on 12th march and finished on 20th march with peak runoff occurring in concert with peak snowmelt on 16th march fig 3a b peak runoff rate on 16th march was 11 6 times greater than the peak runoff rate on the previous day the instantaneous increase in runoff after hillslope wide connectivity was achieved at 15 00 on 16th march was 7 2 times greater than just before connectivity was achieved 13 45 on 16th march there were four evolving stages fig 3 of meltwater inputs to the soil surface and runoff outputs from the hillslope stage 1 9th 12th march initial snowmelt but no resulting hillslope runoff stage 2 13th 15th march continued snowmelt with moderate hillslope runoff stage 3 16th march high volumes of snowmelt and high runoff stage 4 17th 19th march low snowmelt and small amounts of runoff the spatial patterns of snow cover ablation fig 3c indicate that snowmelt occurred unevenly over the hillslope with concentrated patches of snowmelt that changed in location over time daily snow cover ablation ranged between 0 and 70 mm over the hillslope sub daily measurements at snowmelt lysimeters across the hillslope showed that at its peak on the afternoon of 16th march snowmelt occurred at 1 17 8 21 mm hr 1 we observed water ponding in the bottoms of the micro topographic furrows at the soil snow interface with flow along these features in the downslope direction maximum water movement was in the mid afternoons when some snowmelt lysimeters would become overwhelmed and subsequently abandoned by water flowing in from upslope from 11th to 16th march larger areas of ponded water gradually accumulated along the western edge of the hillslope fig 3d at the mouth of flowpath system 3 and 5 at the top of the valley like system at the mouth of flowpath system 4 and at the northern edge of the hillslope at the mouth of flowpath system 2 ponded water was at its maximum on 16th march and decreased in extent over the following days fig 4 shows the snow cover ablation and development of ponded water on the western edge of the hillslope snow covered area remained high over the hillslopes throughout most of the melt season falling gradually from 100 on 11th march to 90 7 on 15th march to 75 8 on 16th march the day of peak melt and runoff and then rapidly decreasing to 20 5 on 20th march after 20th march a small amount of snow remained on the hillslope at the northern edge of the hillslope which took a further 6 days to clear 4 2 2 thawed layer depth the ground was frozen to the soil surface homogenously across the hillslope in the initial melt days and during peak melt and runoff 16th march fig 5 a following peak runoff the thawed layer deepened rapidly and unevenly fig 5b on 18th march the ground had thawed to depths of 15 20 cm below the soil surface but only in isolated patches across the hillslope most notably on the upland at the south end of the hillslope and on a southwest facing slope in the valley like feature at the base of the hillslope the ground remained frozen to the soil surface where snow cover remained 4 2 3 soil water content the 2014 melt season was preceded by a dry autumn in 2013 on average the soil water content in the surface 0 6 cm layer was 0 15 from the 24th october 2013 survey we found that surface soil water content on 24th october 2013 fig 6 a showed relatively limited spatial variability typical of all soil water content surveys conducted fig 6b we can therefore assume that the soil water content at the onset of snowmelt was relatively spatially homogeneous further because of long soil moisture memory in this frozen dormant system coles 2017 the pre freeze up soil water content fig 6a is likely representative of soil water content at the onset of the 2014 snowmelt season soil water content generally increased following snowmelt under all four main landscape units profiles 1 4 table 2 the soil water content change was highly spatially variable the soil profile situated in the shallow sloping upland region of the hillslope profile 1 had the smallest increase in soil water content with a net increase of 8 67 mm added to the profile with gains close to the soil surface but losses at depth this profile location is representative of the majority of the hillslope by comparison soil profiles situated in the depressions profile 2 and 3 at the mouths of flowpath systems 5 and 4 respectively saw net increases of 80 3 mm and 121 mm respectively finally the soil profile on the slope fig 4 in the valley like topography saw a net increase of 148 mm of soil water weighting the soil profile s water content change by their representative area suggests a hillslope wide recharge of 0 90 cm soil water of 25 mm 4 3 isotope analysis stable water isotope analysis shows that the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of runoff water was largely temporally constant on average runoff water Œ¥18o was 21 7 0 742 and Œ¥2h was 169 4 56 but with gradual enrichment of both isotopes through the melt season fig 7 the isotope signatures of the snowmelt water on average snowmelt water Œ¥18o was 22 3 2 10 and Œ¥2h was 171 15 4 bounded the runoff water albeit with a high amount of variability by comparison the pre event soil water was much more enriched than the runoff water on average soil water Œ¥18o was 14 6 1 97 and Œ¥2h was 128 11 0 two component hydrograph separation using the mean Œ¥18o or mean Œ¥2h soil water values for the pre event end member and the mean Œ¥18o or mean Œ¥2h snowmelt values from each lysimeter for the event end member showed that the runoff water is primarily composed of new snowmelt water with very little mixing with the pre event old soil water regardless of the isotope Œ¥18o or Œ¥2h or lysimeter analyzed hydrograph separation showed that the runoff water was composed of 100 new snowmelt water in the initial stages of the snowmelt season on the day of peak runoff 16th march runoff water was composed of on average 93 9 event snowmelt water towards the end of the snowmelt and runoff season on 19th march this value had declined to on average 67 6 through the entire season runoff water was approximately 95 1 event snowmelt water and 4 9 pre event soil water 5 discussion our results suggest that a mechanism analogous to fill and spill processes observed elsewhere explains the generation of snowmelt runoff over frozen ground at our site our stable isotope analysis of meltwater confirmed that runoff water was event snowmelt water with limited mixing with pre event soil water unlike in steep terrain e g eriksson et al 2013 lateral flow through the snowpack at our site was unimportant the key factor generating fill and spill at our site is the large contrast between the low infiltration capacity of the uniformly and fully frozen soil surface and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt water delivery to the soil surface this was enough to generate ribbons and ponds of water beneath the snow at the soil surface that accumulated in micro and meso topographic depressions which then spilled downslope our observations of ponded water and flowpaths were consistent with mapped predictions of fill and spill activity from high resolution digital topographic analysis we enunciate these features in the following sections 5 1 micro meso and macro scale topographic controls on fill and spill thawed layer depth data across the slope showed uniformly frozen soil to the soil surface thawed layer depth 0 cm in the days leading up to and during peak runoff frozen ground infiltration capacities have been observed at this site to range between 0 09 and 2 57 mm hr 1 with a median of 0 33 mm hr 1 snowmelt rates during peak snowmelt in 2014 were 1 17 8 21 mm hr 1 the relatively high rates of snowmelt water delivery to the soil surface largely exceeded the infiltration capacity of the frozen soil by a magnitude greater than 101 the hypothetical minimum contrast between bedrock and soil permeabilities required to generate runoff via the fill and spill mechanism at the soil bedrock interface hopp and mcdonnell 2009 as such we had an impeding layer contrast that was sufficient for the accumulation of water on the soil surface this hints at the importance of soil temperature whether a frozen thawing or thawed state if peak snowmelt had occurred on ground that was thawing or had thawed connectivity and runoff likely would not have been triggered by the mechanism described here the concavity in the monitored hillslope is a macro topographic feature 10 000 m2 of the site the concavity affects the balance of fill and spill the relatively steeper 2 5 lower third of the hillslope was a dominant spill location the flatter 1 upper two thirds was a dominant fill location this pattern is a site specific feature variations in hillslope shape would show altogether different fill spill patterns for example a convex hillslope where the lower part of the hillslope is shallow and the upper part more steep would have a reverse fill spill pattern to that observed here our terrain analysis indicated a balanced fill spill regime with 57 4 of the hillslope characterized by fill locations and 42 6 by spill locations at finer scales the meso topographic features 100 10 000 m2 revealed five flowpath systems in the flow accumulation fa mapping flowpath systems 1 and 2 drained the lower third of the hillslope flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 drained the upper two thirds these latter flowpath systems terminated at their downslope edges by slight lips in the surface topography these lips were enough to create a backwater effect and to create a fill region we observed that the lips must be overcome for the upper region of the hillslope to connect to the lower spill region of the hillslope and thus the hillslope outlet the fa di and fill and spill maps fig 2 where these lips are visible are useful tools to interpret the mechanisms behind ponding storage exceedance and rapid delivery of water important though is that each cell of these maps is solely an indicator of the local topographic surface additional research could seek to incorporate a metric for the likelihood of flow pathways being disconnected by a fill location created by a sill possible approaches to this could be to experiment with increased values of v di v h which would then integrate topography further downslope from the starting point or to use a metric of flowpath distance to the hillslope outlet and the fill locations it must overcome nested within these macro and meso scale topographic systems the micro topographic features 100 m2 also exhibited a flow control during meltwater runoff these small undulations were observable within the 10 10 m measurement grid most notably these were ridges and furrows left behind from tractor based seeding in the previous summer while these micro scale features were not visible in the 2 m dem they were an important localized feature in the initial routing and retention of melt water melt water pooled in and was gradually routed downslope by the furrows within each of the five flowpath systems in flowpath systems 1 and 2 fill and spill occurred mainly within the furrows in flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 however the routing of water via these furrows and small undulations was overtopped by ponded water that developed and grew in volume upslope from the lips after which these barriers were overcome and water could spill over and coalesce at the hillslope outlet overall the hillslope exhibited nested filling and macro spilling our finding that topography dictates hillslope scale connectivity and snowmelt runoff generation over frozen ground is in contrast to devito et al 2005 they examined a boreal plain site with more surficial geology variation but importantly with similar low relief and deep glaciated substrate as the swift current hillslopes devito et al 2005 dismissed the importance of surface topography the key difference is that their evaluation was for a summer period when the ground was unfrozen and the deep high infiltrability mineral soils promoted vertical flow infiltration indeed an analysis of summer rainfall runoff events at our site would support the suggestion that topography is unimportant since all water infiltrates except in exceptional storms in only 28 years of the 52 year record have summer storms generated runoff coles 2017 but critically we see here that topography is episodically important during melt onto frozen ground topographic features acted as both a conduit for meltwater runoff that enabled flowpath formation and connectivity once threshold surface detention levels were exceeded and a loss mechanism that enabled ponded water to form and then heightened infiltration and soil water recharge under depressions when the ground started to thaw 5 2 fill and spill over shallow frozen hillslopes in relation to other environments the hydrologic response on hillslope 2 of the swift current hillslopes reflected the fill and spill mechanism already observed in many other environments spence and woo 2003 leibowitz and vining 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 appels et al 2011 du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 leibowitz et al 2016 the fill and spill mechanism was first introduced in a subarctic soil filled valley with spatially variable subsurface storage capacities due to varying soil depths to bedrock that had to fill up in order to enable surface runoff spence and woo 2003 the definition of the mechanism was further developed following analogous observations that showed depressions in subsurface or surface topography must fill up to a certain threshold the downslope sill of the depression before water can spill downslope e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 leibowitz et al 2016 these fill and spill observations fall within a storage excess framework of water delivery spence 2010 sayama et al 2011 mcdonnell 2013 the observations presented in this paper are fundamentally the same as those observations of fill and spill of depressions across an impeding layer and of a storage excess delivery of runoff the particular fill and spill mechanism described here is different to most previous observations primarily because it is snowmelt over a frozen soil surface this environment sees months of runoff inactivity with no whole hillslope connectivity and then 1 2 weeks where fill and spill over frozen ground delivers the large annual runoff pulse this short acute period of runoff occurs with the concurrent conditions of a frozen soil surface and high volumes of liquid water as also described in williams et al 2013 for intermittent surface runoff connectivity over frozen peatland this is unlike the humid temperate regions where bedrock fill and spill is primed and relatively frequently produces subsurface stormflow tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham and mcdonnell 2010 du et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 the scale at which we have observed fill and spill is different to most previous studies observations of this mechanism have typically been at the plot or trenched hillslope scale e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 wright et al 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 du et al 2016 at the small catchment scale spence and woo 2003 and at the landscape scale e g leibowitz et al 2016 the nested filling and spilling across scales at our hillslope site is essentially the next scale down from the wetland filling and spilling described for the prairie pothole region leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 the hillslopes of the northern great plains deliver water to these wetlands whose connectivity is in turn also dictated by fill and spill albeit a fill and spill mechanism that is influenced and mediated by additional factors such as groundwater surface water interactions brannen et al 2015 and storage memory shook and pomeroy 2011 our study site is a low gradient end member slope 1 2 5 in the fill and spill literature our analysis indicated a fairly balanced fill spill regime with 57 4 of the hillslope characterized by fill locations and 42 6 of the hillslope characterized by spill locations this is in contrast to previous studies with slightly steeper yet still relatively shallow slopes 7 2 slope in hopp and mcdonnell 2009 and 6 12 slopes in du et al 2016 that exhibited fill dominated regimes which was attributed to their flatness as slope angle decreases hillslopes appear to transition from a spill dominated on steep slopes to a fill spill balance on medium slopes and finally to a fill dominated system on shallow slopes hopp and mcdonnell 2009 reaney et al 2014 our fill spill balance is perhaps more typical of medium angled slopes we attribute the difference between our fill spill balance and these other low angle studies fill dominated regimes to the difference in overall hillslope form while these other studies hillslopes were largely planar ours is concave the downslope barriers at the edge of the concave cross section created the surface depressions that retained water and dictated upslope fill locations downslope of these barriers any runoff at a point was able to flow unimpeded to the outlet most prior fill and spill observations at the soil bedrock or soil argillic interface have reported connectivity as discrete flow networks almost channel like in their flow architecture tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 hopp and mcdonnell 2009 graham and mcdonnell 2010 williams et al 2013 by contrast our fill and spill connectivity across this frozen hillslope occurred as a set of more amorphous locations of ponded water that intermittently and individually connected to the hillslope outlet analogous to wetland connectivity on the prairies leibowitz and vining 2003 these areas of ponded water exhibited heightened infiltration and soil water recharge beyond that exhibited by the general gently sloping hillslope area this is akin to enhanced groundwater recharge observed under bedrock depressions at the soil bedrock interface appels et al 2015 finally the four distinct stages in the evolution of meltwater inputs to the soil surface and runoff outputs from the hillslope can be explained by the pattern and rates of snowmelt where the pattern exhibits a high spatial variability and the rates exhibit a high temporal variability onto the frozen reduced infiltrability soil and the pattern and layout of the micro meso and macro topographic features during stage 1 9th 12th march snowmelt started to accumulate in the furrows with no resulting hillslope runoff in stage 2 13th 15th march snowmelt continued to accumulate in the furrows and to be routed through each of the five flowpath systems in flowpath systems 1 and 2 snowmelt water could then flow uninterrupted to the outlet which generated the first hillslope runoff and low hillslope runoff ratios meanwhile ponded water was accumulating behind the downslope barriers at the mouths of flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 in stage 3 16th march high volumes of snowmelt caused the water ponding at the mouths of flowpath systems 3 4 and 5 to reach surface storage capacity and spill over their downslope barriers this connected the upper region of the hillslope with the lower region creating continuous flowpaths that connected all five flowpath systems to the hillslope outlet with a resultant instantaneous increase in runoff and high runoff ratios melt rates were highest in the upper region of the hillslope which ensured the downslope depressions were continually fed the surface storage capacity exceeded and hillslope wide connectivity maintained for 3 4 h following this the ponded water fell below the downslope barriers and disconnected the upper two thirds of the hillslope from the outlet during stage 4 17th march onwards low runoff resulted from slower prolonged snowmelt routed via micro topography to the hillslope outlet from the remaining snow cover in the sheltered coulees over the lower third of the hillslope the ground rapidly began to thaw from 17th march enabling the remaining ponded water to readily infiltrate and contribute to soil water recharge overall these four stages exhibited a dynamic contributing area a feature of connectivity and fill and spill martin et al 1983 shaw et al 2012 the contributing area was largely restricted to the lower third of the hillslope but briefly extended to the entire hillslope on 16th march when widespread ponded water was connected to the hillslope outlet before it contracted back again to the lower region of the hillslope 5 3 soil moisture based metrics of connectivity perform poorly for frozen hillslopes soil water content is critically important for soil infiltrability and hillslope runoff in general e g horton 1933 over frozen ground on the prairies granger et al 1984 zhao and gray 1999 and at this site in particular coles 2017 despite this because the soil water content showed very little spatial variability the spatial patterning of soil water content likely had little effect on the spatial variation in ponded water development and flowpath distribution the hillslope s observed mean autumn surface soil water content was 0 15 if the soil was on average much drier at the time of freezing we likely would have seen greater hillslope wide infiltration longer time for surface depressions to fill and then spill if at all and a delayed and damped increase in the delivery of water when connectivity was achieved the opposite would have been true for a much wetter hillslope there is some evidence of this at this site where long term runoff ratios were generally higher over wetter soils likely a result of reduced infiltration coles 2017 however this was mediated by the volume of surface depression storage such that runoff ratios were typically lower when there was a high surface depression storage even when the soils were wet coles 2017 metrics that use the spatial arrangement of hillslope or catchment soil moisture as indicators of connectivity because of the way stores of water fill up to generate hydrological connections tetzlaff et al 2011 bracken et al 2013 are likely not helpful for these frozen soils where there is little spatial variation over the hillslope further for what little measured variability there was in soil water content it was not related to topographic position this could be attributed to the relatively low relief and the influence of evapotranspiration in reducing the variability across the hillslope at a similar prairie site peterson 2016 also observed that soil water content was not correlated with topographic relief they also noted that soil water content variability was much higher under wetter conditions yet still not related to topographic position peterson 2016 soil water content might have an effect on ponded water and flowpath formation if a more undulating site froze soon after rainfall where side slopes might freeze dry and swales might freeze wet we have not observed such effects however analyses that use terrain to infer soil moisture and by extension flowpaths and connectivity e g beven and kirkby 1979 lane et al 2009 might reasonably accurately determine frozen ground flowpaths but likely only due to structural routing of the water rather than any topographically induced differences in soil moisture for example our testing of the topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 fig 8 unsurprisingly produced mapped results very similar to fa fig 2b the twi metric does not incorporate any metric for downslope impedance which the use of di here has shown to be an important component in the routing of flow and connectivity via fill and spill previous work at this site has shown that a lumped approach can indeed be fruitful for predicting the seasonal runoff response e g the decision tree model of coles 2017 we have shown here though that in order to understand and predict sub seasonal time scale daily hourly or weekly runoff responses then distributed topographic data distributed snowmelt data frozen soil infiltration capacity data and hillslope average soil water content data are needed having determined that the fill and spill mechanism dictates hillslope runoff response for snowmelt over frozen ground and given the underlying phenomenological similarities in fill and spill runoff generation processes at different partitioning surfaces mcdonnell 2013 ameli et al 2015 then we can also look to existing fill and spill modeling approaches just as ameli et al 2015 used an overland flow model to predict hillslope scale subsurface flow existing fill and spill like approaches could greatly improve predictions of wetland recharge flooding and water availability for the dominant runoff producing event of the year on the northern great plains appels et al 2011 and chu et al 2013 developed numerical models to explore the effects of spatial organization of meso and micro topographic features on flowpath convergence connectivity and runoff interestingly these plot and hillslope scale ponding and redistribution models are numerically very similar save for their treatments of infiltration to a physically based landscape scale model devised by shook et al 2013 to simulate surface storage dynamics in prairie wetlands that have been shown to connect and disconnect via the fill and spill mechanism leibowitz and vining 2003 shaw et al 2012 leibowitz et al 2016 such approaches might therefore be adopted for the modeling of hillslope runoff response for snowmelt over frozen ground 6 conclusion we examined snowmelt runoff processes for the 2014 snowmelt season at a 46 600 m2 hillslope site on the northern great plains the fill and spill mechanism appears to explain the generation of snowmelt runoff over frozen ground our main evidence for fill and spill is 1 the contrast between the uniformly frozen soil s low infiltration capacity and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface that generated water beneath the snow at the soil surface and then accumulated in surface depressions 2 stable isotope analysis of water showed that runoff water was event snowmelt water with limited mixing with pre event soil water and 3 observations of ponded water and flowpaths that matched our predictions of fill and spill activity from digital topographic analyses that combined flow accumulation and downslope indices we observed nested filling at the micro and meso scale followed by macro scale spilling where large patches of ponded water coalesced to drive an instantaneous increase in hillslope runoff the identification of fill and spill as a mechanism to explain meltwater runoff from shallow frozen hillslopes supports similar findings from peat dominated permafrost sites in northern canada where the frost table acts as an impeding layer and has widespread implications for other areas of the

7446,gis based multi criteria decision analysis mcda is increasingly used to support flood risk assessment however conventional gis mcda methods fail to adequately represent spatial variability and are accompanied with considerable uncertainty it is thus important to incorporate spatial variability and uncertainty into gis based decision analysis procedures this research develops a spatially explicit probabilistic gis mcda approach for the delineation of potentially flood susceptible areas the approach integrates the probabilistic and the local ordered weighted averaging owa methods via monte carlo simulation to take into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst the approach is applied to a pilot study for the gucheng county central china heavily affected by the hazardous 2012 flood a gis database of six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors for the evaluation of susceptibility was created moreover uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the robustness of the model the results indicate that the ensemble method improves the robustness of the model outcomes with respect to variation in criteria weights and identifies which criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes therefore the proposed approach is an improvement over the conventional deterministic method and can provides a more rational objective and unbiased tool for flood susceptibility evaluation keywords flood multi criteria decision analysis gis monte carlo analytic hierarchy process local ordered weighted averaging uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 1 introduction floods are the most frequently occurring natural disasters between 1995 and 2015 affecting nearly 2 3 billion people and accounting for 47 of all weather related disasters cred and unisdr 2015 in response to the danger of flooding vulnerability assessment which is an essential step within risk management has been and is being performed to produce crucial information that is relevant to decision makers for identifying feasible and effective options for mitigation measures and management strategies vulnerability is a complex concept to be defined and it is often described using a variety of terms including predisposition susceptibility fragility weakness deficiency or lack of capacity adger 2006 ipcc 2012 the polysemic nature of the concept of vulnerability suggests that susceptibility can be viewed as being one dimension of overall vulnerability because of its contribution and should be contained in a vulnerability assessment tang et al 2017 however it is still seen as an independent notion susceptibility is defined as the likelihood of a dangerous event to occur in an area on the basis of local terrain conditions santangelo et al 2011 it does not consider the temporal probability of the event e g when or how frequently the dangerous events may occur santangelo et al 2011 flood susceptibility analysis generally takes into account the territory intrinsic characteristics such as slope river network land use soil type and elevation dottori et al 2016 jacinto et al 2015 the main objective of this research is to propose an approach to assess the susceptibility conditions to flood events flood risk management can benefit from the use of the integration of geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda is a broad term used to describe a set of methods that can be applied to support the decision making process by taking into account multiple and often conflicting criteria through a structured framework de brito and evers 2016 the efforts to integrate mcda into gis has been instrumental for developing the paradigm of spatial decision support in which the geographic information technology is made available directly to decision makers for policy or scenario development malczewski 2006 therefore the gis based mcda gis mcda technique as a powerful tool for flood risk management has become increasingly popular kazakis et al 2015 levy 2005 meyer et al 2008 papaioannou et al 2014 tkach and simonovic 1997 wang et al 2011 the gis mcda methods can be divided into two groups conventional spatially implicit and spatially explicit mcda methods malczewski and rinner 2015 the conventional mcda methods are known as the global model and are implicitly assumed to be spatial homogenous in that its parameters do not vary as a function of geographical space malczewski 2011 for example kazakis et al 2015 introduced a gis based multi criteria index to assess flood hazard areas in the rhodope evros region in northern greece and papaioannou et al 2014 developed a gis mcda framework of mapping potential flood prone areas this assumption is often unrealistic in real world situations as it fails to adequately handle spatial variability malczewski 2011 therefore considerable progress has been made toward developing spatially explicit mcda methods which overcome the limitations of the conventional methods feick and hall 2004 makropoulos and butler 2006 malczewski and liu 2014 malczewski and liu 2014 introduced the theoretical model of local ordered weighted averaging owa yager 1988 by using the range sensitive principle fischer 1995 malczewski 2011 as a core concept this approach advances the global owa by accounting for the spatial homogeneity of the real world in an explicit manner in this research local owa was utilized to explore the spatial heterogeneity of flood susceptibility by incorporating the spatial dependence under different risk attitudes of the analyst the uncertainties associated with gis mcda techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty feizizadeh et al 2014 it is thus important to incorporate the uncertainty into the decision making framework ahmadisharaf et al 2016 uncertainty in decision making is related to a number of sources such as original data data processing criteria selection and criteria weights but criteria weights usually make the largest contribution to uncertainty chen et al 2013 one way to deal with uncertainty is to incorporate probabilistic or stochastic methods to expand gis mcda to a probabilistic framework by means of monte carlo simulation benke and pelizaro 2010 chen et al 2011 tenerelli and carver 2012 specifically the stochastic gis mcda framework identifies probability distributions using a simulation method to generate values from the distributions and then uses these simulated values as inputs to a gis mcda model durbach and stewart 2012 in this study we applied monte carlo analytic hierarchy process ahp approach to address uncertainty in criteria weights estimation hsu and pan 2009 rosenbloom 1997 furthermore uncertainty and sensitivity analysis form a complementary two stage procedure for quantifying the uncertainty of the model uncertainty analysis aims to quantify the uncertainty associated with the model response as a result of uncertainties in the model input crosetto et al 2000 crosetto and tarantola 2001 sensitivity analysis focuses on how the uncertainty in the model output is affected by the uncertainty in the model input factors crosetto et al 2000 crosetto and tarantola 2001 therefore in this study uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of model output and increase the level of confidence in the decision in the current study we developed an integrated flood susceptibility assessment framework combining stochastic methods and spatial explicit mcda methods in the integration process to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach the assessment based on local owa is compared to the use of global owa as a reference the remaining of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the study area and data section 3 provides a detailed description of the methodology and the rationale the results are presented and discussed in section 4 before presenting some conclusions in section 5 2 study area the proposed methodology was applied to gucheng county located in china s northwestern hubei province the region ranges from 111 7 e to 111 52 e longitude and from 31 52 n to 32 30 n latitude covering a total area of 2553 km2 fig 1 the mountains and hills dominate the south and west parts of the county covering nearly two thirds of the total surface area of gucheng the remaining area is dominated by plains which elevations are generally less than 230 m above sea level the whole area experiences a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 932 mm and an annual average temperature of about 15 16 c heavy monsoon rainfall on the 4th to 6th august 2012 caused destructive flooding in gucheng county a total of 118 flood locations were observed by xiangyang hydrology and water resources survey bureau of hubei province after reviewing extensive literature provided by previous research bui et al 2016 kazakis et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2014 tehrany et al 2014 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 six conditioning factors were selected for flood susceptibility mapping digital elevation model dem slope sl distance from the river dr maximum three day precipitation m3dp topographic wetness index twi soil conservation service curve number scs cn fig 2 topography plays a fundamental role in the modeling of flood process elevation and slope are two commonly used topographic factors in flood studies kazakis et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2014 tehrany et al 2013 areas at low elevations are more susceptible to flooding than areas at high elevations because water flows downhill steep slopes tend to retard infiltration as well as accentuate runoff thus causing an increased risk of flooding in general the greater the precipitation intensity the greater the resultant overland flow and waterflow and the greater the resultant flooding m3dp is obtained from the daily precipitation records of all 25 hydro meteorological stations from august 4th to 6th 2012 then kriging interpolation method is used to convert these point values into a raster surface twi aims to quantify the influence of topography on hydrological processes high index values will tend to saturate first and will therefore indicate potential subsurface or high surface runoff areas it was extracted from dem and is defined as twi ln Œ± tan Œ≤ where Œ± is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length and Œ≤ is the topographic gradient in degrees s√∏rensen et al 2006 dr has significant impact on the spread and magnitude of flooding in the study area tehrany et al 2014 the areas close to the river are inundated when channel capacity is exceeded and therefore more susceptible dr can be calculated by imposing buffer zones around the river network scs cn indicates the runoff potential from rainfall of an area accounting for soil type land use hydrologic condition and antecedent moisture condition papaioannou et al 2014 the higher the scs cn value the lower infiltration rate the more potential for generating runoff and thus a flood input data for each factor was partitioned into raster cells in a gis environment with the resolution of 30 m resulting in 2 810 669 cells 2359 columns 2291 rows 3 methodology 3 1 monte carlo analytic hierarchy process approach the ahp introduced by saaty 1980 is widely used to derive the relative weights of criteria through pairwise comparisons in spite of its popularity this method is often criticized for its inability to adequately handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision associated with the mapping of the decision maker s perception to exact numbers monte carlo ahp approach is one of the solutions for this problem unlike ahp monte carlo ahp suggests that pairwise comparison elements can be viewed as random variables rather than crisp values rosenbloom 1997 the approach can be described by the following steps step 1 a pairwise comparison matrix a with regards to the n th decision criterion is created 1 a a ij i j 1 2 3 n in monte carlo ahp a ij is modeled as a random variable to obtain the probability information for a ij in the case of one decision maker the judgment made with respect to each paired uncertainty can be modeled as a continuous random variable in the situation of multiple decision makers we assume that the probability of evaluations made by all experts regarding a ij are equal this will result in each a ij being a discrete random variable hsu and pan 2009 rosenbloom 1997 step 2 calculate and check the consistency ratio cr of the matrix a if matrix a fails the consistency test then go back to step 1 and generate another realization for that matrix a step 3 calculate and record the relative weights of the decision criteria for a realization step 4 by repeating steps 1 3 until n criteria weight samples are produced 3 2 local ordered weighted averaging the ordered weighted averaging owa is a family of multi criteria aggregation technique developed by yager 1988 it provides a general class of parameterized aggregation operators between the minimum and maximum in the owa two sets of weights are applied criteria weights w 1 w 2 w n 0 w k 1 and k 1 n w k 1 k 1 2 n which indicate the relative importance of evaluation criteria order weights Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 0 Œª k 1 and k 1 n Œª k 1 k 1 2 n which determine the degree of tradeoff between andness and orness given the reality of spatial heterogeneity malczewski and liu 2014 introduced the local owa decision rule based on the range sensitivity principle fischer 1995 the local owa procedure is given in fig 3 the principle suggests that the criterion weights should be adjusted so that they are proportional to the ranges of the alternatives for that criterion small ranges should yield correspondingly small weights and vice versa in the local owa model the overall study area can be subdivided into a number of neighborhoods enabling a focus on local spatial variations in attribute space in gis raster data the most widely used approach to define neighborhoods is the moving window fotheringham et al 2003 lloyd 2010 hence for given the set of attribute values a i 1 a i 2 a in at the i th location i 1 2 n the local owa is defined as malczewski and liu 2014 2 owa i q k 1 n Œª k u k q z ik q k 1 n Œª k u k q where owa i q is the overall value of the i th alternative within the q th neighborhood Œª k is the order weight associated with the k th criterion z i 1 q z i 2 q z ik q is the sequence obtained by reordering of the standardized attribute values measured by means of the local value function v a ik q and u k q is the local criterion weight w k q reordered according to the attribute value z ik q the score range procedure is the most popular approach for standardizing evaluation criteria in gis mcda the local standardized criteria values of the k th attribute associated with the i th location in the q th neighborhood are calculated as follows malczewski and liu 2014 3 v a ik q a ik q min iq a ik q r k q for the k th criterion to be maximized max iq a ik q a ik q r k q for the k th criterion to be minimized where max iq a ik q and min iq a ik q denote the maximum and minimum values of the k th criterion in the q th subset of locations neighborhoods respectively r k q max iq a ik q min iq a ik q is the local criterion value range within each neighborhood of the k th criterion likewise the local criterion weight is determined as follows malczewski and liu 2014 4 w k q w k r k q r k l 1 n w k r k q r k 0 w k q 1 and k 1 n w k q 1 a critical issue when dealing with the owa operator is the determination of the order weights in order to measure the weighting vector of the owa operator yager 1988 suggested the degree of orness and the entropy of dispersion the degree of orness is defined as yager 1988 5 Œ± k 1 n n k n 1 Œª k 0 orness 1 the Œ± parameter characterizes the degree to which the aggregation is similar to the logical or operation Œ± 0 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 1 0 0 0 similarly Œ± 1 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 0 0 0 1 further Œ± 0 5 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n that is all weights are assigned equal weights arithmetic average and owa yields a result that is identical to the weighted linear combination wlc method the entropy of dispersion is an extension of the shannon s entropy when dealing with owa operators it is expressed as yager 1988 6 disp w k 1 n Œª k ln Œª k o hagan 1988 proposed an algorithm to determine a special class of owa operators having maximum entropy of the owa weights for a predefined degree of orness this approach is based on the solution of the following constrained nonlinear optimization problem o hagan 1988 7 maximize œï k 1 n Œª k ln Œª k ln n subject to k 1 n n k n 1 Œª k Œ± k 1 n Œª k 1 0 Œª k 1 for k 1 2 n in the local owa method there are different ways of defining neighborhoods in the case study of this research the neighborhood is defined using the concept of moving window based on a specified threshold distance given the distance dij between two locations si and sj and some threshold distance d the neighborhood window q is defined as follows j q if dij d and j q otherwise moreover the local owa requires that the threshold distance is large enough to ensure the local range r k q is greater than zero see eqs 2 and 4 this study uses three different threshold distances 2000 m 3000 m and 4000 m to examine how they influence the spatial pattern of overall scores 3 3 uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in this study multiple realizations of the flood susceptibility map are obtained from criteria weight samples based on these susceptibility maps an average avg susceptibility surface and an associated standard deviation std surface representing uncertainty are calculated for uncertainty analysis the variance based global sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty associated with criteria weights propagated through mcda analysis the objective of the variance based global sensitivity analysis is to quantify both the first order sensitivity index s i and the total effect sensitivity index s ti saltelli et al 2008 for a given model y f x 1 x 2 x k the total variance v of the model output y is apportioned to all the input factors x i as 8 v v y i 1 k v i i j i v ij v 12 k where v i is part of the variance or the main effect of x i on y and v ij is the joint effect of x i and x j on the total variance minus their first order effects the first order index represents the main effect contribution of each input factor x i to the variance of the output saltelli et al 2008 it is defined as 9 s i v i v the total effect index accounts for the total contribution to the output variation due to input factor x i i e its first order effect plus all higher order effects due to interactions saltelli et al 2008 for example in a three factor model the three total effect indices are s t 1 s 1 s 12 s 13 s 123 10 s t 2 s 2 s 12 s 23 s 123 s t 3 s 3 s 13 s 23 s 123 where s 12 v 12 v s 123 v 123 v and so on the advantages of the variance based methods are that it ensures that the entire model input space is explored and it is a model free sensitivity measure which is independent of assumptions about the model structure lilburne and tarantola 2009 there are many methods to carry out variance decomposition such as sobol method the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and the extended fast methods song et al 2015 among these the original fast method only computes first order sensitivity index s i the extended fast method and the sobol method are capable of estimating the total effect sensitivity index s ti g√≥mez delgado and tarantola 2006 in this study we chose to use the extended fast method as it seems to be computationally more efficient than the method of sobol g√≥mez delgado and tarantola 2006 saltelli et al 1999 3 4 simulation setup the whole simulation procedure involves three main steps first monte carlo ahp approach is executed to produce criteria weight samples second the uncertainty analysis is performed multiple realizations of the susceptibility assessment are computed from criteria weight samples these assessment results are summarized with average avg susceptibility map and its standard deviation std maps third sensitivity analysis is performed the variability of susceptibility maps is apportioned to each criterion weight via one first order s i and one total effect s ti sensitivity index maps a key step of monte carlo ahp method is the sampling of input parameters the elements of the pairwise comparisons matrix in this paper 2500 samples were generated as input to monte carlo ahp method and n 274 samples passed the consistency check therefore the global and local owa method were run n times the python language version 2 7 was used to implement this application within esri s arcgis 10 2 platform 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of standardized criterion values and criterion weight to illustrate the nature of the local model let us take the dem criterion as an example fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of standardized criterion values and local criterion weight for the dem criterion comparing the standardized criterion maps for global and local owa methods see fig 4a b the spatial patterns are remarkably different the local model are more localized and regionalized than the global model tang et al 2017 for the global model fig 4a shows high values in the northeastern part of the study area and low values in the southwestern part while for the local model fig 4b high and low values are dispersed rather evenly across the whole study area this is because the local model emphasizes the relatively high and low values at the neighborhood scale the global criterion weight is assumed to be homogeneous across the whole study area that is all locations within the study area are assigned the same value for global criterion weight however the local criterion weight reflects spatial heterogeneity of preferences regarding the evaluation criteria see fig 4c for a given criterion the local criterion weight depends upon the local range which varies from one location to another see eq 4 therefore local criterion weight takes spatial heterogeneity into consideration and assigns a unique value to each location for instance when the global criterion weight for the dem criterion w 1 0 2722 from one of the n 274 samples the corresponding local criterion weights w 1 q range from 0 02 to 0 389 see fig 4c 4 2 effects of the Œ± parameter and threshold distance one can generate a wide range of decision strategies under different risk attitudes by specifying the Œ± parameter and associated set of the order weights see section 3 2 the Œ± parameter indicates the position of owa on a continuum between the and and or operators the greater the Œ± value the more optimistic the analyst is in this study to investigate the effect of the analyst s risk attitude on the susceptibility conditions five different risk attitudes are considered including pessimistic moderately pessimistic neutral moderately optimistic and optimistic with Œ± 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 respectively a set of maps of flood susceptibility assessment with respect to these scenarios based on one of the n 274 samples are shown in fig 5 moreover we assumed the minimum average score for high susceptibility equal 65 the number of pixels for high susceptible areas in fig 5 are given in table 1 fig 5 and table 1 show that along with the increasing Œ± value the analyst becomes more optimistic the areas that could be dangerous for flooding get larger and larger this reveals that flood susceptible conditions strongly depends on the risk attitude of the analyst and even a small change of the risk attitude have a large impact on the susceptibility conditions to explore the effect of threshold distance on flood susceptibility the owa operator with Œ± 0 5 was selected as an example of the comparisons between the two methods fig 6 demonstrates the results of flood susceptibility assessment based on one of the n 274 samples flood susceptible areas were split into five classes using quantile classification for ease of visual comparison the spatial pattern of global owa fig 6a indicates that northeastern gucheng has a higher susceptibility than the western and southern part of the county the local patterns fig 6b c d show that the locations with high susceptibility are distributed more evenly across the whole study area this indicates the locations with the relatively high susceptibility in the low susceptibility neighborhoods hence the global owa method only enables characterisation of large scale global trends while local owa can indicate relative differences over small local scales furthermore as the spatial variation observed in local model increases the reliability of the global model as representative of local conditions decreases the results at the three different threshold distances fig 6b c d suggest that the local owa method can be linked to a spatial microscope in that it allows us to explore flood susceptibility at different spatial scales when the threshold distance is large global trends are visible while for small threshold distance local features are apparent as the threshold distance gets smaller more microscopic details in the pattern will be revealed conversely the spatial pattern of the local owa method tend to be more similar to the one generated by global owa along with the increase of the size of threshold distance when the threshold distance is sufficiently large to ensure that the neighborhoods of each location covers the overall study area there actually is no difference between the two methods therefore the global owa can be viewed as an extreme case of the local owa 4 3 validation of results the validation process was carried out by comparing the existing flood locations with the acquired flood susceptibility map fig 6 table 2 shows the prediction accuracy of the results for global owa local owa based on d 4000 m local owa based on d 3000 m and local owa based on d 2000 m the prediction accuracy was 84 7 83 9 83 9 and 83 1 of the flood locations respectively the results show very similar prediction accuracies however it is obvious to observe from table 2 that the prediction accuracy of very high susceptibility of the local owa is higher than global owa but on the contrary the prediction accuracy of high susceptibility of the local owa is lower than global owa the reason is that local model captures spatial variation in the mountains and hills which dominate the south and west parts of the study area therefore the local model provides a robust means of exploring spatial variations in flood process and helps to expand our understanding of the nature of the flood 4 4 uncertainty analysis the outputs of monte carlo simulations for global and local owa are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 obviously the global and local models reveal different spatial patterns a relatively large standard deviation indicates relatively high uncertainty on the contrary small standard deviation values mean high confidence and indicate the flood susceptibility scores are reliable and trustworthy to further investigate the flood susceptibility and its uncertainty we divided the overall area into four regions according to table 3 fig 9 fig 9 shows one obvious trend for susceptible areas that hl regions with high confidence strikingly increases with an increase in the Œ± parameter this trend indicates that the risk attitude can heavily influence the confidence level of the decision alternatives the reason for this trend is a pessimistic attitude focuses on the negative aspects and exaggerates its significance while an optimistic outlook observes mainly the positive aspects of a given situation in general regions of low uncertainty hl and ll regions are robust flood susceptible areas while regions of high uncertainty hh and lh regions are sensitive to the variability of criteria weights and should be further evaluated 4 5 sensitivity analysis similarly the local owa operator with Œ± 0 5 and d 2000 m was discussed as an example of global sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the differences between the two forms of owa the spatial patterns of the s i and s ti sensitivity indices for criteria weights in global and local owa are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively in addition fig 10 and fig 11 show that the s i maps and s ti maps for the flood susceptibility criteria share a very similar spatial pattern to further investigate the criteria weights and their effects the s i maps and s ti maps were overlaid to produce the weight dominance map where a particular criterion has the maximum sensitivity value since the spatial patterns of s i maps and s ti maps are very similar we focused only on the weight dominance map based on the s i maps fig 12 fig 12 shows that for the global owa the weight of twi criterion is the most influential in affecting the uncertainty of susceptibility scores because it dominates most areas however for the local owa the sl criterion is proved to be the most influential this difference in the weight dominance map between the two models indicates that the local variation of criteria weights contributes to the uncertainty in the model output 4 6 limitations and future work in recent years several researchers have adopted gis based monte carlo ahp method to address the uncertainty of the criteria weights in gis mcda feizizadeh et al 2014 proposed a gis based spatially explicit uncertainty analysis method to generate landslide susceptibility maps dahri and abida 2017 integrated gis based monte carlo ahp method and weighted linear combination for flood susceptibility mapping they all utilized gis based monte carlo ahp method to reduce the uncertainty in the criteria weights results in improving the accuracy of the susceptibility map compared with their studies and our previous work tang et al 2017 our current research not only deals with the uncertainty in the criteria weights but also investigates the impact of spatial heterogeneous the effect of the analyst s risk attitude risk averse risk neutral risk prone on the susceptibility conditions and identifies which inputs criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes at each location however the current research and the aforementioned research dahri and abida 2017 feizizadeh et al 2014 tang et al 2017 are inevitably subject to a number of limitations that need to be considered by future research first it is possible that the evaluation criteria set is neither comprehensive nor complete and contains redundancies according to malczewski 1999 the evaluation criteria in gis mcda should have the following qualities comprehensive measurable complete operational decomposable non redundant and minimal the set of evaluation criteria for a particular decision problem can be determined through an examination of relevant literature an analytical method and eliciting expert opinion using the delphi technique malczewski 1999 therefore the determination of the evaluation criteria can be improved by using methods such as factor analysis and the delphi technique second only the uncertainty associated with criteria weights was taken into account there are numerous sources of uncertainty in gis mcda such as criteria values and value functions hence the accuracy of susceptibility map can be further improved by covering more types of uncertainty third the stochastic methods based monte carlo simulation have a high demand on computational resources more optimal sampling strategies can be used to reach the desired accuracy with a minimal number of simulation runs in addition most flood risk assessment studies are performed under the assumption of spatial homogeneity because it facilitates the parameter estimation within this context it may be necessary to re examine the results published previously in a spatially heterogeneous environment and the selection of neighborhood scheme is an important step in the implementation of the proposed approach defining an optimal neighborhood scheme is difficult therefore future research should also focus on developing a procedure to determine the optimal neighborhood scheme 5 conclusions this paper describes and tests a spatially explicit probabilistic gis mcda approach for flood susceptibility assessment the proposed method simultaneously takes into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the analyst s risk attitude in a quantitative way we chose the gucheng county in central china s hubei province as the pilot area and the evaluation process was based on six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors affecting floods the results demonstrate that the advantage of the proposed approach consists in several points 1 this method uses probability distributions instead of crisp values for criteria weights provides more information on areas susceptible to flooding including associated error bounds and confidence level and improves the robustness of flood susceptibility evaluation 2 by using different threshold distances this method explicitly captures spatial variation in environment factors at the scale of interest and provides detailed information about neighborhoods local authorities could use these information to target the priority areas more effectively 3 this method incorporates the analyst s attitude toward risk into the decision analysis procedure and the susceptibility situations under different risk preference scenarios was analyzed 4 this method offers the possibility of performing sensitivity analysis to identify which inputs criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes at each location acknowledgment this work was supported by the national key

7446,gis based multi criteria decision analysis mcda is increasingly used to support flood risk assessment however conventional gis mcda methods fail to adequately represent spatial variability and are accompanied with considerable uncertainty it is thus important to incorporate spatial variability and uncertainty into gis based decision analysis procedures this research develops a spatially explicit probabilistic gis mcda approach for the delineation of potentially flood susceptible areas the approach integrates the probabilistic and the local ordered weighted averaging owa methods via monte carlo simulation to take into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst the approach is applied to a pilot study for the gucheng county central china heavily affected by the hazardous 2012 flood a gis database of six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors for the evaluation of susceptibility was created moreover uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the robustness of the model the results indicate that the ensemble method improves the robustness of the model outcomes with respect to variation in criteria weights and identifies which criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes therefore the proposed approach is an improvement over the conventional deterministic method and can provides a more rational objective and unbiased tool for flood susceptibility evaluation keywords flood multi criteria decision analysis gis monte carlo analytic hierarchy process local ordered weighted averaging uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 1 introduction floods are the most frequently occurring natural disasters between 1995 and 2015 affecting nearly 2 3 billion people and accounting for 47 of all weather related disasters cred and unisdr 2015 in response to the danger of flooding vulnerability assessment which is an essential step within risk management has been and is being performed to produce crucial information that is relevant to decision makers for identifying feasible and effective options for mitigation measures and management strategies vulnerability is a complex concept to be defined and it is often described using a variety of terms including predisposition susceptibility fragility weakness deficiency or lack of capacity adger 2006 ipcc 2012 the polysemic nature of the concept of vulnerability suggests that susceptibility can be viewed as being one dimension of overall vulnerability because of its contribution and should be contained in a vulnerability assessment tang et al 2017 however it is still seen as an independent notion susceptibility is defined as the likelihood of a dangerous event to occur in an area on the basis of local terrain conditions santangelo et al 2011 it does not consider the temporal probability of the event e g when or how frequently the dangerous events may occur santangelo et al 2011 flood susceptibility analysis generally takes into account the territory intrinsic characteristics such as slope river network land use soil type and elevation dottori et al 2016 jacinto et al 2015 the main objective of this research is to propose an approach to assess the susceptibility conditions to flood events flood risk management can benefit from the use of the integration of geographic information system gis and multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda is a broad term used to describe a set of methods that can be applied to support the decision making process by taking into account multiple and often conflicting criteria through a structured framework de brito and evers 2016 the efforts to integrate mcda into gis has been instrumental for developing the paradigm of spatial decision support in which the geographic information technology is made available directly to decision makers for policy or scenario development malczewski 2006 therefore the gis based mcda gis mcda technique as a powerful tool for flood risk management has become increasingly popular kazakis et al 2015 levy 2005 meyer et al 2008 papaioannou et al 2014 tkach and simonovic 1997 wang et al 2011 the gis mcda methods can be divided into two groups conventional spatially implicit and spatially explicit mcda methods malczewski and rinner 2015 the conventional mcda methods are known as the global model and are implicitly assumed to be spatial homogenous in that its parameters do not vary as a function of geographical space malczewski 2011 for example kazakis et al 2015 introduced a gis based multi criteria index to assess flood hazard areas in the rhodope evros region in northern greece and papaioannou et al 2014 developed a gis mcda framework of mapping potential flood prone areas this assumption is often unrealistic in real world situations as it fails to adequately handle spatial variability malczewski 2011 therefore considerable progress has been made toward developing spatially explicit mcda methods which overcome the limitations of the conventional methods feick and hall 2004 makropoulos and butler 2006 malczewski and liu 2014 malczewski and liu 2014 introduced the theoretical model of local ordered weighted averaging owa yager 1988 by using the range sensitive principle fischer 1995 malczewski 2011 as a core concept this approach advances the global owa by accounting for the spatial homogeneity of the real world in an explicit manner in this research local owa was utilized to explore the spatial heterogeneity of flood susceptibility by incorporating the spatial dependence under different risk attitudes of the analyst the uncertainties associated with gis mcda techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty feizizadeh et al 2014 it is thus important to incorporate the uncertainty into the decision making framework ahmadisharaf et al 2016 uncertainty in decision making is related to a number of sources such as original data data processing criteria selection and criteria weights but criteria weights usually make the largest contribution to uncertainty chen et al 2013 one way to deal with uncertainty is to incorporate probabilistic or stochastic methods to expand gis mcda to a probabilistic framework by means of monte carlo simulation benke and pelizaro 2010 chen et al 2011 tenerelli and carver 2012 specifically the stochastic gis mcda framework identifies probability distributions using a simulation method to generate values from the distributions and then uses these simulated values as inputs to a gis mcda model durbach and stewart 2012 in this study we applied monte carlo analytic hierarchy process ahp approach to address uncertainty in criteria weights estimation hsu and pan 2009 rosenbloom 1997 furthermore uncertainty and sensitivity analysis form a complementary two stage procedure for quantifying the uncertainty of the model uncertainty analysis aims to quantify the uncertainty associated with the model response as a result of uncertainties in the model input crosetto et al 2000 crosetto and tarantola 2001 sensitivity analysis focuses on how the uncertainty in the model output is affected by the uncertainty in the model input factors crosetto et al 2000 crosetto and tarantola 2001 therefore in this study uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of model output and increase the level of confidence in the decision in the current study we developed an integrated flood susceptibility assessment framework combining stochastic methods and spatial explicit mcda methods in the integration process to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach the assessment based on local owa is compared to the use of global owa as a reference the remaining of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the study area and data section 3 provides a detailed description of the methodology and the rationale the results are presented and discussed in section 4 before presenting some conclusions in section 5 2 study area the proposed methodology was applied to gucheng county located in china s northwestern hubei province the region ranges from 111 7 e to 111 52 e longitude and from 31 52 n to 32 30 n latitude covering a total area of 2553 km2 fig 1 the mountains and hills dominate the south and west parts of the county covering nearly two thirds of the total surface area of gucheng the remaining area is dominated by plains which elevations are generally less than 230 m above sea level the whole area experiences a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 932 mm and an annual average temperature of about 15 16 c heavy monsoon rainfall on the 4th to 6th august 2012 caused destructive flooding in gucheng county a total of 118 flood locations were observed by xiangyang hydrology and water resources survey bureau of hubei province after reviewing extensive literature provided by previous research bui et al 2016 kazakis et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2014 tehrany et al 2014 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 six conditioning factors were selected for flood susceptibility mapping digital elevation model dem slope sl distance from the river dr maximum three day precipitation m3dp topographic wetness index twi soil conservation service curve number scs cn fig 2 topography plays a fundamental role in the modeling of flood process elevation and slope are two commonly used topographic factors in flood studies kazakis et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2014 tehrany et al 2013 areas at low elevations are more susceptible to flooding than areas at high elevations because water flows downhill steep slopes tend to retard infiltration as well as accentuate runoff thus causing an increased risk of flooding in general the greater the precipitation intensity the greater the resultant overland flow and waterflow and the greater the resultant flooding m3dp is obtained from the daily precipitation records of all 25 hydro meteorological stations from august 4th to 6th 2012 then kriging interpolation method is used to convert these point values into a raster surface twi aims to quantify the influence of topography on hydrological processes high index values will tend to saturate first and will therefore indicate potential subsurface or high surface runoff areas it was extracted from dem and is defined as twi ln Œ± tan Œ≤ where Œ± is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length and Œ≤ is the topographic gradient in degrees s√∏rensen et al 2006 dr has significant impact on the spread and magnitude of flooding in the study area tehrany et al 2014 the areas close to the river are inundated when channel capacity is exceeded and therefore more susceptible dr can be calculated by imposing buffer zones around the river network scs cn indicates the runoff potential from rainfall of an area accounting for soil type land use hydrologic condition and antecedent moisture condition papaioannou et al 2014 the higher the scs cn value the lower infiltration rate the more potential for generating runoff and thus a flood input data for each factor was partitioned into raster cells in a gis environment with the resolution of 30 m resulting in 2 810 669 cells 2359 columns 2291 rows 3 methodology 3 1 monte carlo analytic hierarchy process approach the ahp introduced by saaty 1980 is widely used to derive the relative weights of criteria through pairwise comparisons in spite of its popularity this method is often criticized for its inability to adequately handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision associated with the mapping of the decision maker s perception to exact numbers monte carlo ahp approach is one of the solutions for this problem unlike ahp monte carlo ahp suggests that pairwise comparison elements can be viewed as random variables rather than crisp values rosenbloom 1997 the approach can be described by the following steps step 1 a pairwise comparison matrix a with regards to the n th decision criterion is created 1 a a ij i j 1 2 3 n in monte carlo ahp a ij is modeled as a random variable to obtain the probability information for a ij in the case of one decision maker the judgment made with respect to each paired uncertainty can be modeled as a continuous random variable in the situation of multiple decision makers we assume that the probability of evaluations made by all experts regarding a ij are equal this will result in each a ij being a discrete random variable hsu and pan 2009 rosenbloom 1997 step 2 calculate and check the consistency ratio cr of the matrix a if matrix a fails the consistency test then go back to step 1 and generate another realization for that matrix a step 3 calculate and record the relative weights of the decision criteria for a realization step 4 by repeating steps 1 3 until n criteria weight samples are produced 3 2 local ordered weighted averaging the ordered weighted averaging owa is a family of multi criteria aggregation technique developed by yager 1988 it provides a general class of parameterized aggregation operators between the minimum and maximum in the owa two sets of weights are applied criteria weights w 1 w 2 w n 0 w k 1 and k 1 n w k 1 k 1 2 n which indicate the relative importance of evaluation criteria order weights Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 0 Œª k 1 and k 1 n Œª k 1 k 1 2 n which determine the degree of tradeoff between andness and orness given the reality of spatial heterogeneity malczewski and liu 2014 introduced the local owa decision rule based on the range sensitivity principle fischer 1995 the local owa procedure is given in fig 3 the principle suggests that the criterion weights should be adjusted so that they are proportional to the ranges of the alternatives for that criterion small ranges should yield correspondingly small weights and vice versa in the local owa model the overall study area can be subdivided into a number of neighborhoods enabling a focus on local spatial variations in attribute space in gis raster data the most widely used approach to define neighborhoods is the moving window fotheringham et al 2003 lloyd 2010 hence for given the set of attribute values a i 1 a i 2 a in at the i th location i 1 2 n the local owa is defined as malczewski and liu 2014 2 owa i q k 1 n Œª k u k q z ik q k 1 n Œª k u k q where owa i q is the overall value of the i th alternative within the q th neighborhood Œª k is the order weight associated with the k th criterion z i 1 q z i 2 q z ik q is the sequence obtained by reordering of the standardized attribute values measured by means of the local value function v a ik q and u k q is the local criterion weight w k q reordered according to the attribute value z ik q the score range procedure is the most popular approach for standardizing evaluation criteria in gis mcda the local standardized criteria values of the k th attribute associated with the i th location in the q th neighborhood are calculated as follows malczewski and liu 2014 3 v a ik q a ik q min iq a ik q r k q for the k th criterion to be maximized max iq a ik q a ik q r k q for the k th criterion to be minimized where max iq a ik q and min iq a ik q denote the maximum and minimum values of the k th criterion in the q th subset of locations neighborhoods respectively r k q max iq a ik q min iq a ik q is the local criterion value range within each neighborhood of the k th criterion likewise the local criterion weight is determined as follows malczewski and liu 2014 4 w k q w k r k q r k l 1 n w k r k q r k 0 w k q 1 and k 1 n w k q 1 a critical issue when dealing with the owa operator is the determination of the order weights in order to measure the weighting vector of the owa operator yager 1988 suggested the degree of orness and the entropy of dispersion the degree of orness is defined as yager 1988 5 Œ± k 1 n n k n 1 Œª k 0 orness 1 the Œ± parameter characterizes the degree to which the aggregation is similar to the logical or operation Œ± 0 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 1 0 0 0 similarly Œ± 1 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 0 0 0 1 further Œ± 0 5 corresponds to a scenario where Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n that is all weights are assigned equal weights arithmetic average and owa yields a result that is identical to the weighted linear combination wlc method the entropy of dispersion is an extension of the shannon s entropy when dealing with owa operators it is expressed as yager 1988 6 disp w k 1 n Œª k ln Œª k o hagan 1988 proposed an algorithm to determine a special class of owa operators having maximum entropy of the owa weights for a predefined degree of orness this approach is based on the solution of the following constrained nonlinear optimization problem o hagan 1988 7 maximize œï k 1 n Œª k ln Œª k ln n subject to k 1 n n k n 1 Œª k Œ± k 1 n Œª k 1 0 Œª k 1 for k 1 2 n in the local owa method there are different ways of defining neighborhoods in the case study of this research the neighborhood is defined using the concept of moving window based on a specified threshold distance given the distance dij between two locations si and sj and some threshold distance d the neighborhood window q is defined as follows j q if dij d and j q otherwise moreover the local owa requires that the threshold distance is large enough to ensure the local range r k q is greater than zero see eqs 2 and 4 this study uses three different threshold distances 2000 m 3000 m and 4000 m to examine how they influence the spatial pattern of overall scores 3 3 uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in this study multiple realizations of the flood susceptibility map are obtained from criteria weight samples based on these susceptibility maps an average avg susceptibility surface and an associated standard deviation std surface representing uncertainty are calculated for uncertainty analysis the variance based global sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty associated with criteria weights propagated through mcda analysis the objective of the variance based global sensitivity analysis is to quantify both the first order sensitivity index s i and the total effect sensitivity index s ti saltelli et al 2008 for a given model y f x 1 x 2 x k the total variance v of the model output y is apportioned to all the input factors x i as 8 v v y i 1 k v i i j i v ij v 12 k where v i is part of the variance or the main effect of x i on y and v ij is the joint effect of x i and x j on the total variance minus their first order effects the first order index represents the main effect contribution of each input factor x i to the variance of the output saltelli et al 2008 it is defined as 9 s i v i v the total effect index accounts for the total contribution to the output variation due to input factor x i i e its first order effect plus all higher order effects due to interactions saltelli et al 2008 for example in a three factor model the three total effect indices are s t 1 s 1 s 12 s 13 s 123 10 s t 2 s 2 s 12 s 23 s 123 s t 3 s 3 s 13 s 23 s 123 where s 12 v 12 v s 123 v 123 v and so on the advantages of the variance based methods are that it ensures that the entire model input space is explored and it is a model free sensitivity measure which is independent of assumptions about the model structure lilburne and tarantola 2009 there are many methods to carry out variance decomposition such as sobol method the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and the extended fast methods song et al 2015 among these the original fast method only computes first order sensitivity index s i the extended fast method and the sobol method are capable of estimating the total effect sensitivity index s ti g√≥mez delgado and tarantola 2006 in this study we chose to use the extended fast method as it seems to be computationally more efficient than the method of sobol g√≥mez delgado and tarantola 2006 saltelli et al 1999 3 4 simulation setup the whole simulation procedure involves three main steps first monte carlo ahp approach is executed to produce criteria weight samples second the uncertainty analysis is performed multiple realizations of the susceptibility assessment are computed from criteria weight samples these assessment results are summarized with average avg susceptibility map and its standard deviation std maps third sensitivity analysis is performed the variability of susceptibility maps is apportioned to each criterion weight via one first order s i and one total effect s ti sensitivity index maps a key step of monte carlo ahp method is the sampling of input parameters the elements of the pairwise comparisons matrix in this paper 2500 samples were generated as input to monte carlo ahp method and n 274 samples passed the consistency check therefore the global and local owa method were run n times the python language version 2 7 was used to implement this application within esri s arcgis 10 2 platform 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of standardized criterion values and criterion weight to illustrate the nature of the local model let us take the dem criterion as an example fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of standardized criterion values and local criterion weight for the dem criterion comparing the standardized criterion maps for global and local owa methods see fig 4a b the spatial patterns are remarkably different the local model are more localized and regionalized than the global model tang et al 2017 for the global model fig 4a shows high values in the northeastern part of the study area and low values in the southwestern part while for the local model fig 4b high and low values are dispersed rather evenly across the whole study area this is because the local model emphasizes the relatively high and low values at the neighborhood scale the global criterion weight is assumed to be homogeneous across the whole study area that is all locations within the study area are assigned the same value for global criterion weight however the local criterion weight reflects spatial heterogeneity of preferences regarding the evaluation criteria see fig 4c for a given criterion the local criterion weight depends upon the local range which varies from one location to another see eq 4 therefore local criterion weight takes spatial heterogeneity into consideration and assigns a unique value to each location for instance when the global criterion weight for the dem criterion w 1 0 2722 from one of the n 274 samples the corresponding local criterion weights w 1 q range from 0 02 to 0 389 see fig 4c 4 2 effects of the Œ± parameter and threshold distance one can generate a wide range of decision strategies under different risk attitudes by specifying the Œ± parameter and associated set of the order weights see section 3 2 the Œ± parameter indicates the position of owa on a continuum between the and and or operators the greater the Œ± value the more optimistic the analyst is in this study to investigate the effect of the analyst s risk attitude on the susceptibility conditions five different risk attitudes are considered including pessimistic moderately pessimistic neutral moderately optimistic and optimistic with Œ± 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 respectively a set of maps of flood susceptibility assessment with respect to these scenarios based on one of the n 274 samples are shown in fig 5 moreover we assumed the minimum average score for high susceptibility equal 65 the number of pixels for high susceptible areas in fig 5 are given in table 1 fig 5 and table 1 show that along with the increasing Œ± value the analyst becomes more optimistic the areas that could be dangerous for flooding get larger and larger this reveals that flood susceptible conditions strongly depends on the risk attitude of the analyst and even a small change of the risk attitude have a large impact on the susceptibility conditions to explore the effect of threshold distance on flood susceptibility the owa operator with Œ± 0 5 was selected as an example of the comparisons between the two methods fig 6 demonstrates the results of flood susceptibility assessment based on one of the n 274 samples flood susceptible areas were split into five classes using quantile classification for ease of visual comparison the spatial pattern of global owa fig 6a indicates that northeastern gucheng has a higher susceptibility than the western and southern part of the county the local patterns fig 6b c d show that the locations with high susceptibility are distributed more evenly across the whole study area this indicates the locations with the relatively high susceptibility in the low susceptibility neighborhoods hence the global owa method only enables characterisation of large scale global trends while local owa can indicate relative differences over small local scales furthermore as the spatial variation observed in local model increases the reliability of the global model as representative of local conditions decreases the results at the three different threshold distances fig 6b c d suggest that the local owa method can be linked to a spatial microscope in that it allows us to explore flood susceptibility at different spatial scales when the threshold distance is large global trends are visible while for small threshold distance local features are apparent as the threshold distance gets smaller more microscopic details in the pattern will be revealed conversely the spatial pattern of the local owa method tend to be more similar to the one generated by global owa along with the increase of the size of threshold distance when the threshold distance is sufficiently large to ensure that the neighborhoods of each location covers the overall study area there actually is no difference between the two methods therefore the global owa can be viewed as an extreme case of the local owa 4 3 validation of results the validation process was carried out by comparing the existing flood locations with the acquired flood susceptibility map fig 6 table 2 shows the prediction accuracy of the results for global owa local owa based on d 4000 m local owa based on d 3000 m and local owa based on d 2000 m the prediction accuracy was 84 7 83 9 83 9 and 83 1 of the flood locations respectively the results show very similar prediction accuracies however it is obvious to observe from table 2 that the prediction accuracy of very high susceptibility of the local owa is higher than global owa but on the contrary the prediction accuracy of high susceptibility of the local owa is lower than global owa the reason is that local model captures spatial variation in the mountains and hills which dominate the south and west parts of the study area therefore the local model provides a robust means of exploring spatial variations in flood process and helps to expand our understanding of the nature of the flood 4 4 uncertainty analysis the outputs of monte carlo simulations for global and local owa are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 obviously the global and local models reveal different spatial patterns a relatively large standard deviation indicates relatively high uncertainty on the contrary small standard deviation values mean high confidence and indicate the flood susceptibility scores are reliable and trustworthy to further investigate the flood susceptibility and its uncertainty we divided the overall area into four regions according to table 3 fig 9 fig 9 shows one obvious trend for susceptible areas that hl regions with high confidence strikingly increases with an increase in the Œ± parameter this trend indicates that the risk attitude can heavily influence the confidence level of the decision alternatives the reason for this trend is a pessimistic attitude focuses on the negative aspects and exaggerates its significance while an optimistic outlook observes mainly the positive aspects of a given situation in general regions of low uncertainty hl and ll regions are robust flood susceptible areas while regions of high uncertainty hh and lh regions are sensitive to the variability of criteria weights and should be further evaluated 4 5 sensitivity analysis similarly the local owa operator with Œ± 0 5 and d 2000 m was discussed as an example of global sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the differences between the two forms of owa the spatial patterns of the s i and s ti sensitivity indices for criteria weights in global and local owa are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively in addition fig 10 and fig 11 show that the s i maps and s ti maps for the flood susceptibility criteria share a very similar spatial pattern to further investigate the criteria weights and their effects the s i maps and s ti maps were overlaid to produce the weight dominance map where a particular criterion has the maximum sensitivity value since the spatial patterns of s i maps and s ti maps are very similar we focused only on the weight dominance map based on the s i maps fig 12 fig 12 shows that for the global owa the weight of twi criterion is the most influential in affecting the uncertainty of susceptibility scores because it dominates most areas however for the local owa the sl criterion is proved to be the most influential this difference in the weight dominance map between the two models indicates that the local variation of criteria weights contributes to the uncertainty in the model output 4 6 limitations and future work in recent years several researchers have adopted gis based monte carlo ahp method to address the uncertainty of the criteria weights in gis mcda feizizadeh et al 2014 proposed a gis based spatially explicit uncertainty analysis method to generate landslide susceptibility maps dahri and abida 2017 integrated gis based monte carlo ahp method and weighted linear combination for flood susceptibility mapping they all utilized gis based monte carlo ahp method to reduce the uncertainty in the criteria weights results in improving the accuracy of the susceptibility map compared with their studies and our previous work tang et al 2017 our current research not only deals with the uncertainty in the criteria weights but also investigates the impact of spatial heterogeneous the effect of the analyst s risk attitude risk averse risk neutral risk prone on the susceptibility conditions and identifies which inputs criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes at each location however the current research and the aforementioned research dahri and abida 2017 feizizadeh et al 2014 tang et al 2017 are inevitably subject to a number of limitations that need to be considered by future research first it is possible that the evaluation criteria set is neither comprehensive nor complete and contains redundancies according to malczewski 1999 the evaluation criteria in gis mcda should have the following qualities comprehensive measurable complete operational decomposable non redundant and minimal the set of evaluation criteria for a particular decision problem can be determined through an examination of relevant literature an analytical method and eliciting expert opinion using the delphi technique malczewski 1999 therefore the determination of the evaluation criteria can be improved by using methods such as factor analysis and the delphi technique second only the uncertainty associated with criteria weights was taken into account there are numerous sources of uncertainty in gis mcda such as criteria values and value functions hence the accuracy of susceptibility map can be further improved by covering more types of uncertainty third the stochastic methods based monte carlo simulation have a high demand on computational resources more optimal sampling strategies can be used to reach the desired accuracy with a minimal number of simulation runs in addition most flood risk assessment studies are performed under the assumption of spatial homogeneity because it facilitates the parameter estimation within this context it may be necessary to re examine the results published previously in a spatially heterogeneous environment and the selection of neighborhood scheme is an important step in the implementation of the proposed approach defining an optimal neighborhood scheme is difficult therefore future research should also focus on developing a procedure to determine the optimal neighborhood scheme 5 conclusions this paper describes and tests a spatially explicit probabilistic gis mcda approach for flood susceptibility assessment the proposed method simultaneously takes into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the analyst s risk attitude in a quantitative way we chose the gucheng county in central china s hubei province as the pilot area and the evaluation process was based on six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors affecting floods the results demonstrate that the advantage of the proposed approach consists in several points 1 this method uses probability distributions instead of crisp values for criteria weights provides more information on areas susceptible to flooding including associated error bounds and confidence level and improves the robustness of flood susceptibility evaluation 2 by using different threshold distances this method explicitly captures spatial variation in environment factors at the scale of interest and provides detailed information about neighborhoods local authorities could use these information to target the priority areas more effectively 3 this method incorporates the analyst s attitude toward risk into the decision analysis procedure and the susceptibility situations under different risk preference scenarios was analyzed 4 this method offers the possibility of performing sensitivity analysis to identify which inputs criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes at each location acknowledgment this work was supported by the national key

7447,this study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones tcs for probabilistic risk analysis due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high fidelity advanced circulation adcirc hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall runoff a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind and pressure field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models this builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from tcs the utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic tc flood risk products which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account tc associated rainfall runoff results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge as compared to the federal emergency management association s femas current practices keywords tropical cyclones joint flooding flood risk machine learning 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs can cause tremendous damage due to the storm surge and heavy rainfall they produce while significant research has focused on the risk associated with tc storm surge as a result of the destructive 2005 hurricane season few studies have evaluated flood risk due to the joint occurrence of tc storm surge and rainfall runoff or joint flooding which routinely occurs during tc events such research is crucial given that post storm damage assessments rappaport 2014 indicate that roughly 27 of human losses due to tc s are caused by rainfall flooding two critical areas lacking information regarding joint tc flooding include probabilistic flood forecasts and flood risk analysis the objective of this paper is to develop a methodology for representing probabilistic joint flood risk levels that can easily be applied to any watershed along the u s gulf and atlantic coast current coastal risk or return period products such as that provided by the federal emergency management association fema 2017b do not represent the joint occurrence of tc storm surge and rainfall runoff recent research on joint flood risk has been limited to a few point locations with long observational records of both stage and rainfall runoff i e wahl et al 2015 zhong et al 2013 such analyses even for areas with long observational records will be highly sensitive to a small sample of all possible tc s for a given area these limitations have required that tc risk assessments utilize additional sources of information that allow for a continuous spatial representation of flood levels from synthetic storms based on a given regions historical or possible tc characteristics myers 1975 ho and myers 1975 in the joint probability method jpm distributions of a regions possible tc characteristics are developed from which storms are sampled and subsequently simulated in a hydrodynamic model for risk analysis storms can be sampled using a monte carlo approach which requires the use of less accurate but faster hydrodynamic models i e slosh lin et al 2010 or by employing optimal sampling techniques resio et al 2009 niedoroda et al 2010 toro et al 2010 that reduce the number of simulations required for surge risk analysis with high fidelity hydrodynamic models in order to allow for high fidelity representations of probabilistic storm surge forecasts or risk levels researchers have recently investigated the use of surge response functions srfs and other surrogate modeling approaches based on supervised machine learning techniques surrogate models are defined as computationally efficient models that are trained to represent the input output relationship that is typically determined from high fidelity physics based numerical models for tc storm surge analysis these surrogate models can rapidly estimate the peak surge expected from a tc based on its landfall characteristics srfs were first proposed as a method to allow for the estimation of storm surge levels of a given tcs characteristics in order to aid in fema flood risk analysis resio et al 2009 and later adapted for flood forecasting purposes irish et al 2011 however srfs are limited to estimates at point locations and have resulted in low levels of accuracy for complex environments such as bays taylor et al 2015 recently supervised machine learning methods including artificial neural networks anns hsieh and ratcliff 2013 kim et al 2015 and kriging jia and taflanidis 2013 jia et al 2016 have been proposed as alternatives to srfs for forecasting purposes in these ann and kriging studies adcirc was coupled with the steady state spectral wave model stwave to provide surge predictions throughout the new orleans area these supervised machine learning studies resulted in high predictive accuracy owing to their ability to develop complex functions that map the relationship between a tc s landfall characteristics and its peak surge response simulated with high fidelity hydrodynamic and wave models such techniques allow for rapid and accurate predictions of a tc s peak surge however to date joint flooding in coastal watersheds due to rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge have not been incorporated into predictive models capable of rapid simulations for probabilistic analysis in this study a surrogate or predictive model is developed based on high fidelity simulations of storm surge and waves adcirc swan coupled with inland hydrologic and hydraulic models that represent tc rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge by employing a supervised machine learning approach based on coupled hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling results this study provides the first method capable of providing rapid probabilistic estimates of joint flooding from tcs at the watershed scale this surrogate model is then utilized to provide rapid estimates of joint flooding for probabilistic flood risk analysis which is currently limited to probabilistic representations of only storm surge the study is performed for coastal watersheds located in southeast se houston tx but the proposed methodology can be applied to other coastal watersheds due to its use of open source models and data that are available for the majority of the u s gulf and atlantic coast section 2 discusses the modeling approach and methodology used to represent joint flooding from tcs section 3 discusses results from applying the joint flood model for risk analysis section 4 discusses limitations and suggestions for future work and section 5 ends with conclusions from this study 2 methodology in this study several models were loosely coupled fig 1 to represent joint flooding of the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the se houston study area fig 2 this study area includes a population of roughly 300 000 people and because of its connection to galveston bay is exposed to storm surge that can be introduced via the gulf of mexico the study area s shallow slope loamy to clay soils and 67 development exacerbate rainfall runoff and storm surge flooding the 223 synthetic wind and pressure fields developed for femas north texas flood insurance study fema and usace 2011 were used as a forcing for the coupled modeling framework these tcs have a 2 km resolution across the majority of the gulf of mexico and corresponding inland areas and represent the full range of tc storm characteristics that could develop and impact the north texas coast which includes the se houston study area fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the minimum pressure of the storms range from 994 to 900 mb which corresponds to maximum wind speeds ranging from 29 8 m s 66 6 mph to 71 6 m s 160 mph at landfall the open source models utilized in this study including adcirc swan the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and river analysis system hec ras were chosen in order to allow for the application of this study s methodology to the majority of the coastal u s gulf and atlantic where fema and u s army corps of engineers usace flood insurance studies have led to the development of such models for inland riverine and coastal storm surge flood risk analysis details on each of the numerical models and how they were loosely coupled to represent peak inundation levels from the 223 synthetic storms is discussed in section 2 1 input tc characteristics and their corresponding peak inundation levels obtained from the coupled numerical models were stored as input output training features to develop a surrogate model based on ann and kriging supervised machine learning approaches discussed in section 2 2 in addition to joint flooding a surrogate model of only storm surge was developed for comparison against previous studies and to demonstrate increases in flooding due to rainfall runoff since the surrogate models are trained on the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the study area they could be used to allow for predictions of peak inundation levels given any new set of tc characteristics however while the suite of storms encompass the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the study area they do not include weak tropical storms with winds 29 8 m s which can take on winding paths such as tropical storm allison 2001 or tropical storm harvey 2017 2 1 loosely coupled models to represent rainfall runoff interactions with storm surge the high fidelity 2d hydrodynamic adcirc swan model was loosely coupled with a lumped hydrologic model and 1d hydraulic model representative of several watersheds in se houston clear creek armand bayou and horsepen bayou adcirc swan has been validated in capturing the regional surge and wave response of various historical tcs such as katrina and rita in 2005 and gustav and ike in 2008 rego and li 2009 dietrich et al 2010 2011 hope et al 2013 in this study the primary surge forcing mechanisms including direct wind stress wave radiation stress and barotropic water level adjustments were accounted for and the garret wind drag law was utilized rainfall runoff was not directly applied in adcirc swan given the requirement that runoff conditions must be defined at the edge of an adcirc mesh which typically occurs tens to hundreds of kilometers inland this may be appropriate for high order riverine systems such as the mississippi but can lead to a poor representation of distributed runoff that occurs in many coastal environments an overall increase in the initial steric water level of 0 5628 m was applied to represent the average offset between mean high water mhw and navd88 0 3738 m in addition to an increase in water levels due to thermal expansion 0 189 m fema and usace 2011 a semi implicit numerical scheme with a 1 s time step was used in the model setup the same wind and pressure fields from the suite of 223 storms simulated in adcirc swan were additionally utilized to obtain the expected rainfall associated with each tc the physics based asymmetric modified smith for rainfall msr algorithm developed by langousis and veneziano 2009a was employed to determine rainfall intensity across the study area this rainfall algorithm was chosen as compared to other statistics based algorithms such as r cliper lonfat et al 2004 or r phram lonfat et al 2007 due to the physics basis of the algorithm its ability to represent variations in rainfall due to variations in storm intensity and size throughout a storms entire wind field and because of its promising validation against historical storms compared to r cliper langousis and veneziano 2009a msr determines the vertical flux of moisture and resulting surface rainfall rates based on basic thermodynamics that account for the depth averaged temperature and saturation ratio inside a tc boundary layer and a numerical model for calculating vertical winds in the lower troposphere due to tangential wind convergence at the 10 m height of the tc windfields however while able to account for large scale rainfall patterns msr like r cliper does not account for stochastic small scale variations due to local convection intense rainfall associated within the core of a tc and any rainfall due to downdraft winds or mesoscale features such as spiral bands due to the limitations discussed in the previous paragraph the msr algorithm may not be suitable for estimating flood levels for a single deterministic event but given that flood risk is evaluated over a large suite of probabilistic events the authors expect that errors in rainfall estimates will average out across the suite of storms evaluated for risk analysis in this study in other words msr may result in estimated rainfall amounts that are slightly lower or higher for a single deterministic event but for a large suite of events these errors should average out if msr does not have a high or low bias this limitation could be better addressed via stochastic rainfall representations for each tc i e langousis and veneziano 2009b however given the coupled modeling framework such analysis was not computationally feasible parameters for the msr model suggested by langousis and veneziano 2009a were used in this study including a reference altitude of 3 km a depth averaged temperature of 22 c and a saturation ratio of 80 rainfall intensities were obtained at 15 min intervals based on the same 2 km resolution 15 min time step windfields used as a forcing for adcirc swan while msr does not account for topographic impacts on rainfall intensity such impacts are minor given the study areas elevation near mean sea level ranges from 0 to 18 m and shallow slope 0 00045 km 1 km empirically based rainfall models such as r cliper and r phram tuleya et al 2007 lonfat et al 2007 were not utilized based on their grouping of storm rainfall intensities according to category 1 2 and category 3 5 storms which can result in a low bias for risk analysis and their limited ability to account for spatial variations in storm size and intensity rainfall obtained from msr was used as input for the hydrologic model hec hms and subsequently routed to obtain inundation levels in the 1d unsteady hydraulic model hec ras the hec hms and hec ras models used in this study were developed as a part of the post tropical storm allison recovery project in which hydrologic hec hms and hydraulic hec ras models were developed for all of harris county and completed in 2007 hcfcd 2007 the hydrologic model includes 131 subbasins making up a 666 km2 drainage area with an average subbasin area of 5 km2 the watershed consists of loamy to clay soils and is inhabited by roughly 300 000 people with 67 development for current conditions infiltration losses were solved with the green and ampt method subbasin routing was determined using the clark unit hydrograph tc r method and channel routing was determined from the corresponding hydraulic model s hec ras rating curves finally the 1d unsteady hydraulic model hec ras was used to solve for overall inundation levels due to rainfall runoff and storm surge along riverine floodplains several hydraulic models developed by hcfcd 2007 were combined to represent the se houston study area and the model s cross section geometry was updated from its original 2001 lidar with 2008 lidar 1 1 m obtained from the houston galveston area council hgac 2008 the hec ras model includes 682 cross sections with an average spacing of 150 m 54 bridges and a rule operated flood gate at the downstream end of the watershed hydrographs from hec hms were matched to corresponding cross sections in hec ras and specified as subbasin runoff or tributary inflows and a downstream boundary condition at the outlet of the study area which connects to galveston bay was defined by the stage hydrograph determined from the 2d adcirc swan simulations for each storm with the streamflow and stage boundary conditions from hec hms and 2d adcirc swan respectively unsteady 1d hec ras was finally used to determine peak inundation levels due to storm surge and rainfall runoff along riverine floodplains for each of the 223 tcs simulated as stated previously fig 1 provides a schematic demonstrating how the different numerical models are connected to represent joint flooding the peak inundation is defined as the peak inundation throughout an entire storms simulation since 1d hec ras represents inundation along riverine channels and their overbank floodplains peak inundation levels in locations beyond the riverine floodplain were additionally obtained from 2d adcirc swan simulations while the majority of inundation is captured along riverine floodplains with 1d hec ras the additional representation of overland storm surge from 2d adcirc swan captures inundation that can occur along the perimeter of the study area due to storm surge that can flow into the study area from surrounding drainage areas during extreme tcs such surge does not overlap with the study area s riverine floodplain prior to simulating the suite of 223 storms through the loosely coupled models adcirc swan msr hec hms hec ras the hydrologic hec hms and hydraulic models hec ras were calibrated to achieve the best possible accuracy in time variable streamflow and stage conditions for 3 recent rainfall runoff dominated events which are listed in table 1 the optimal parameters obtained for the hydrologic and hydraulic models in the calibration process were then utilized for validation against tropical storm allison 2001 and hurricane ike 2008 ref table 1 given the coastal environment calibration was specifically performed for the rainfall runoff dominated events since storm surge events can result in upstream flow across observed streamflow gauges hence rendering such gauges effectively useless for comparison against hydrologic modeling results data used for calibration and validation against historical storms included gridded hourly observed rainfall intensities with a 4 km spatial resolution from stage iv nexrad that was calibrated by local rain gauges also known as multisensor precipitation estimator lin 2011 modeled versus observed comparisons for peak streamflow and stage are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively coefficients of determination r2 of 0 981 and 0 995 were obtained for modeled peak streamflow and stage comparisons against observed gauge data fig 5 demonstrates modeled versus observed results for hurricane ike for the entire suite of coupled models utilized in this study while msr has accurately been validated against hurricane frances 2004 and katrina 2005 langousis and veneziano 2009a b the validation against hurricane ike results in roughly 70 of the actually observed cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area 17 2 cm from msr versus 24 3 cm observed since hurricane ike moved directly over the study area the estimates from msr are low due to the models limited ability to represent intense eyewall convection for reference r cliper s estimate of hurricane ike rainfall is additionally shown which is lower than msr because of its treatment of hurricane ike as a storm that results in similar rainfall to a category 1 2 storm despite it being only 0 447 m s 1 mph from a category 3 storm as shown in fig 5 msr s initial rainfall estimate translates into lower estimates of streamflow and stage as compared to observed for areas influenced by rainfall runoff i e gauges 6 and 8 nonetheless given the accuracy of the hydrologic and hydraulic models when evaluated against events with observed rainfall and stage data the high fidelity and validation of the hydrodynamic model performed in previous studies and the expected averaging out of the msr rainfall estimates for a large set of storms the suite of 223 synthetic storm wind and pressure fields were subsequently simulated in the loosely coupled numerical models to serve as training data for a surrogate model to summarize the hazards associated with the suite of storms the maximum 12 h cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area and the peak storm surge at the outlet for each storm which were determined from msr and adcirc swan respectively are shown in fig 6 as expected a correlation between these two sources of tc flooding is shown which simply indicates that for the study area similar storm characteristics that result in increases in storm surge generally result in increases in rainfall 2 2 supervised machine learning as discussed previously to represent peak inundation expected from a given tc several numerical models were utilized in this study including a high fidelity hydrodynamic model that requires more than an hour simulation per storm event even with parallel processing on 1000 s of computer cores to allow for rapid estimations of peak inundation levels which is necessary for probabilistic flood forecasting and risk analysis a surrogate model was developed based on numerical model results via supervised machine learning methods since both kriging and artificial neural networks anns can learn complex non linear functions and have been applied with varying success in previous studies for storm surge predictions both of these machine learning methods were evaluated to develop a surrogate model despite added complexity and possible increases in non linearity due to the addition of rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge the authors anticipated that a well performing surrogate model could still be developed since the physical mechanisms that influence tc rainfall intensity are based on many of the same characteristics that determine storm surge levels including storm intensity size forward speed angle and landfall location similar tc characteristics utilized in previous studies i e jia and taflanidis 2013 were employed as baseline characteristics for training separate surrogate models for predicting peak storm surge and peak joint flood levels these training characteristics include the following parameters at landfall minimum central pressure cp radius to maximum winds rmax 6 h forward speed vf angle of approach from due north and landfall location represented by longitude x in addition to evaluating these baseline characteristics alternative storm descriptors were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the surrogate model to more descriptive training features however negligible increases in accuracy were observed with these alternative storm descriptors i e radius to tropical storm and hurricane winds integrated kinetic energy factor and thus only results for the baseline characteristics are included as discussed previously peak inundation levels were obtained for each storm using the coupled modeling framework shown in fig 1 and interpolated results were projected onto a grid of 76 610 points with a 75 75 m resolution making up a 414 km2 area these points represent where the surrogate model was trained in order to allow for rapid predictions the grid of points as compared to direct output along cross sections from hec ras or nodes from adcirc swan was utilized to develop a common set of prediction points for joint flooding and to allow for direct comparisons of joint flooding against storm surge the 75 75 m resolution was chosen to capture spatial variations in flooding with a resolution comparable to hec ras cross section spacing ranges from 30 to 300 m with an overall average of 125 m and adcirc swan resolution varies from 40 m to 225 m in study area with an average of 150 m the extent of the prediction points as shown in fig 7 was based on points that experienced inundation for at least one of the storms in the suite of 223 storms simulated an additional surrogate model with a total number of 49 326 points was trained for storm surge only based on the adcirc swan results the storm surge surrogate model was developed for comparison purposes against previous studies and to allow for comparisons against joint flooding for both the ann and kriging model approaches a single surrogate model was developed with multiple outputs based on latent variables determined using principal components analysis pca pca allows for a significant reduction in the output dimensions that have to be trained on from the original 73 610 point locations to a given number of latent variables which can then be re projected back to the original high dimensional output space this study also employed the dry point technique which was applied by jia and taflanidis 2013 to allow for surrogate models to train on latent output variables such as those determined using pca kriging contains two components i a linear or quadratic polynomial regression that includes weights that are globally fit to the training data and ii a non parametric portion that assumes that the true function y x is a realization of a stochastic process z x 1 y x f x a t z x where f x includes linear or quadratic polynomial basis functions with a being the vector of learned weights the second component z x provides a localized deviation from the basis function prediction based on the correlation or similarity between the input training features of hurricane characteristics and their respective output quadratic and linear basis functions for f x were evaluated and the correlation function for z x was optimized for an order between 0 5 and 2 hence allowing for the evaluation of exponential as well as gaussian correlation functions thus the hyperparameters optimized for kriging in this study include quadratic versus linear basis functions for the training features the order associated with the correlation function and the amount of variance or latent variables included in pca further discussion regarding the kriging algorithm used in this study can be found in jia and taflanidis 2013 traditional anns are made up of an input layer corresponding to the original input data features tc storm characteristics a number of hidden layers with a corresponding number of neurons in each hidden layer and an output layer where predictions are made peak surge or joint flood levels as the number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer increase more weights are introduced and more complex functions can be learned by an ann however training time will increase and the model may begin to overfit the training data leading to poorer predictions on unseen data sets ann s typically utilize a form of the backpropagation algorithm that adjusts weights throughout the ann by distributing the final error from a given iteration throughout the network hence model weights are iteratively tuned by making a prediction and then adjusting model weights based on a distribution throughout the network of the final error between predictions and true results this study utilizes the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm due to its ability to additionally optimize the amount of regularization implemented to prevent overfitting using the bayesian methods described in foresee and hagan 1997 the hyperparameters optimized for the anns include the number of hidden layers number of neurons in each hidden layer and the amount of variance or latent variables included in pca additional information regarding anns can be obtained from a variety of resources including johnson and karpathy 2017 which explains the theory and optimization of anns and solomatine et al 2008 for an overview of example applications in hydrology ten fold cross validation ron kohavi 1995 was utilized to evaluate the performance of each surrogate models error metrics which were computed at each of the 76 610 prediction points for joint flooding 49 326 for surge only to obtain an average coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and absolute mean error ame 3 results 3 1 surrogate model table 2 outlines the best performing ann employed with the bayesian regularization algorithm and kriging models that were developed in this study for predicting storm surge and joint flooding this table includes a reference to the best prediction accuracy reported for storm surge in previous studies that were performed in new orleans however comparisons for joint flooding are not included since such analysis has not been performed before the kriging model provides similar prediction accuracy compared to previous studies while the ann provides a significant improvement compared to the best performing ann in previous studies after ensuring surrogate models could successfully be developed for storm surge with comparable accuracy to previous studies a surrogate model for joint flooding was developed as compared to the trained models for storm surge both the ann and kriging model for joint flood predictions have a lower r2 and slightly higher rmse although there is a strong correlation between the tc characteristics used as training features and a tcs expected rainfall the surrogate model s decrease in performance can be attributed to an increase in complexity from the introduction of additional models to represent rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge and the greater variation in the overall flood response from storm to storm overfitting issues particularly for joint flooding resulted in anns performing less accurately than kriging this is demonstrated in fig 8 which shows that although the training accuracy of anns exceeded kriging as the model complexity of anns increased the highest validation accuracy of anns for storm surge and joint flood predictions were lower simply stated an ann s attempt to learn spatial information from input output data is limited compared to kriging s estimates of flood levels which directly takes into account the spatial structure of each storm s floodplain by considering the covariance of input training features and their flood response the better performance of kriging is not surprising since a floodplain is a continuous surface containing spatial information that kriging directly takes into account and agrees with previous studies that have evaluated other continuous surfaces i e matias et al 2004 nonetheless this study confirms that kriging performs better for not only storm surge but also joint flood predictions at the watershed scale as compared to anns finally the rmse for each storm based on the validation process during training for each surrogate model is shown for the best kriging models determined for storm surge and joint flooding in fig 9 a as demonstrated in fig 9a the surrogate model for joint flooding generally has slightly higher errors than the surrogate model for storm surge however there are a few exceptions in which the surrogate model may have greater difficulty in predicting storm surge as compared to joint flooding the characteristics of these storms were evaluated and decreases in minimum central pressure cp which corresponds to more intense storms is the only characteristic that showed a trend with decreasing accuracy for the storm surge predictions fig 9b as discussed in section 2 1 and demonstrated in fig 4 the kriging supervised machine learning model for joint flooding henceforth will be referred to as the surrogate model may not be appropriate for hindcast analysis or deterministic forecasting given limitations of the rainfall model however the surrogate model s accurate representation of the numerical models employed suggests it can be used for probabilistic flood risk analysis where several thousand storms are evaluated assuming there isn t an overall positive or negative bias of the rainfall model and based on the accurate validation of the other numerical models utilized in this study for a single synthetic storm fig 10 demonstrates negligible differences between predicted tc flood levels based on an unseen storm s landfall characteristics and the same storm s simulated flood levels determined using the loosely coupled numerical models the surrogate model returns inundation levels for a single storm within a few seconds as compared to the roughly 1 2 h required with the coupled msr adcirc swan hec hms and hec ras models that were used to train the surrogate model the following section demonstrates the surrogate models use for probabilistic flood risk analysis 3 2 risk analysis as discussed in section 1 current fema flood insurance practices account for storm surge in coastal areas but do not account for tc rainfall runoff in order to address this issue while allowing for a relatively straightforward application to other coastal areas along the u s coast this study coupled open source models that are currently used by fema hec hms hec ras adcirc swan and built off of the jpm approach used for femas surge risk analysis in this study a monte carlo sampling approach is employed with the joint probability method since the surrogate model can rapidly represent a storms expected flood levels to perform risk analysis parameters of probability distributions of tc characteristics were obtained from a recent usace study evaluating surge mitigation strategies along the upper tx coast gccprd 2016 these probability distributions were defined at 12 5 km intervals along the tx coastline from 27 7265 97 1164 approximately 275 km southwest of study area to 29 5640 94 3478 65 km northeast of study area and fit to data from 1938 to 2013 collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national hurricane centers data 2 archive however the historical maxima and variances of the tc parameters are based on the entire 1851 2013 data record available from hurdat2 table 3 outlines the conditional probability distributions used to fit historical storm parameters and appendix a includes detailed information regarding the parameters associated with each distribution defined along the upper texas coastline to approximate the joint flood risk synthetic storms were constructed by random selection of 100 000 storms from the joint probability distributions of storm characteristics resulting in the histograms of storm parameters shown in fig 3 then flood risk levels were analytically fit by ranking the simulated water level responses from largest to smallest and corresponding return periods were determined using the weibull formula which provides an unbiased estimate of the recurrence interval 2 t Œª n 1 m where t is the return period Œª is the average time between storm events 9 667 years n is the total number of storm samples 100 000 and m is the magnitude or rank of each simulated water level this monte carlo method has widely been used for extreme flood risk analysis with large observational or numerically simulated data sets and as shown in fig 11 provides a satisfactory comparison against femas surge return period levels at the outlet of the study area flood risk analysis was performed using the separate kriging surrogate models of joint flooding and storm surge only to demonstrate the source apportionment of flood risk levels throughout the entire study area water levels based on the suite of 100 000 storm samples of the regions joint probability distributions were obtained at each of the 76 610 prediction points from which annual exceedance probabilities aep or return period flood levels were determined for each point location fig 12 demonstrates the resulting tc return period floodplain for a 100 yr or 1 event the joint tc flood risk levels were subsequently compared against current fema flood risk practices following femas methodology for inland watersheds design rainfall events were simulated in the study area using the same hec hms and hec ras models discussed in section 2 1 except hec ras was simulated in steady state per standard fema practices the design rainfall events utilized for the region include 24 h rainfall with scs type iii distributions of 19 81 cm for the 10 yr 29 46 cm for the 50 yr 34 29 cm for the 100 yr and 49 02 cm for the 500 yr return period hcfcd 2009 to determine surge risk levels the storm surge surrogate model was utilized using the same jpm approach applied for determining joint flood risk levels the maximum inundation levels between the inland design rainfall runoff analysis and coastal surge risk analysis were then compared to joint flood risk levels that account for probabilistic tc rainfall runoff storm surge and their interactions fig 13 a demonstrates the floodplain extent for different return periods due to storm surge joint flooding and femas current practices which includes flooding from storm surge and a design rainfall runoff event as shown in fig 13a increases in the extent of flooding throughout the study area due to joint flooding were not observed compared to femas current flood risk practices this is due to more severe rainfall from the design rainfall events compared to the synthetic rainfall events in addition to the spatially uniform and thus conservative representation of design rainfall compared to the spatially heterogeneous rainfall from tcs however increases in the depth of inundation were observed throughout the study area as shown for increases of at least 0 1 m in inundation in fig 13b increases in flood depth were primarily observed for 500 yr flood levels and as demonstrated in fig 13c are concentrated along the upstream end of the study area and a middle portion of the study area s main channel increases in inundation levels for the upstream end may be related to a combination of storm direction relative to the study area with tc s typically moving from the downstream to upstream end of the study area as well as possible backwater effects due to extreme storm surge conditions that may cause a decrease in drainage in the upstream end of the study area the increases in inundation observed along the middle portion of the study area s main channel are due to interactions between rainfall runoff and storm surge that fema does not account for in its steady state analysis these interactions occur in a transition zone that is located between the upstream portion of the study area that is dominated by rainfall runoff and downstream portion that is dominated by storm surge this transition zone can roughly be represented for a given return period by the location where the representation of joint flood levels overlaps with storm surge levels i e such as that shown for 100 yr flood levels in fig 12b the analysis performed in this study provides a useful description of flood risks associated with tcs that currently does not exist a coastal resident interested in their tc flood risk can access storm surge return period floodplains i e fema 2017a and their exposure to inland rainfall flooding from separate fema map products fema 2017b however such information is limited and potentially misleading since flooding due to tc rainfall runoff is not included by probabilistically accounting for rainfall runoff in addition to storm surge this study provides a map product capable of representing joint tc flood risk levels and their source apportionment 4 limitations and future work the main contribution of this study is the development of a new methodology for representing joint flooding at the watershed scale which includes rainfall runoff storm surge and their interactions the methodology is made up of two components a coupled numerical modeling framework and a surrogate model that is trained based on the results of the coupled numerical models this section discusses potential improvements that could be made to the coupled numerical models to increase the accuracy of the joint flood risk analysis performed and to expand the applicability of the surrogate modeling approach into a probabilistic forecasting environment of all the numerical models utilized in this study the rainfall model had the greatest uncertainty based on its validation against hurricane ike while the msr model may be able to capture broad scale tc rainfall and its asymmetric redistribution it cannot represent several additional rainfall processes including convection within the eyewall of a tc or mesoscale rainfall bands while the most appropriate tc rainfall model was chosen at the time of the study a subsequent study should provide a review of existing statistical and physics based rainfall models against historical observations to determine the accuracy and biases of each rainfall model such analysis will require a fairly extensive effort including the collection of tc characteristics and windfields required for each rainfall model implementing the algorithms associated with each model and finally comparing results to spatial statistics of observed tc rainfall events based on such analysis the most reliable rainfall model should then be used within the methodology proposed in this study in addition this study utilized fema models for representing tc rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge these models were utilized to allow for a more direct comparison of joint flood risk levels against femas current flood insurance practices that do not consider joint flood hazards however future work may consider using a fully distributed hydrologic model rather than a lumped hydrologic model as well as a hydraulic model that represents 2d conditions across floodplain areas rather than the 1d hydraulic model utilized in this study such modifications would likely allow for a more accurate representation of flow direction and resulting inundation levels finally this study evaluated joint flood risk from tc s for wind speeds greater than 29 8 m s 66 6 mph in addition to tcs joint flood risk analysis should incorporate slow moving and winding tropical storms that can result in significant rainfall such as tropical storm s allison 2001 and harvey 2017 such analysis may highlight that tropical storms can drive low probability severe rainfall events that were not represented in this study s analysis of tcs in addition to improving the representation of joint flood risk levels the incorporation of tropical storms and the aforementioned numerical modeling modifications would result in a more reliable surrogate model for probabilistic flood forecasting while the surrogate model developed in this study can be applied for probabilistic flood forecast guidance or as a supplement to deterministic simulations of inundation sourcing rainfall from numerical weather models and surge from a high fidelity hydrodynamic model the authors suggest incorporating the previous recommendations prior to launching a surrogate model for real time probabilistic forecasts of joint flooding finally future work should evaluate several study areas with a range of watershed and climate characteristics to highlight what conditions lead to increased vulnerability to increases in flooding due to the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge in addition future work should evaluate tc rainfall runoff versus storm surge flooding at a regional scale and their resulting damages to provide insight regarding the relative severity of these two sources of flooding such analysis will require analyzing the decomposed contributions from rainfall runoff versus storm surge as well their combined flood interactions finally given increasing ocean and atmospheric temperatures which can exacerbate the storm surge and rainfall response of tcs analysis of joint flooding will only continue to become more important to evaluate under future conditions 5 conclusions in this study a surrogate model was developed that is capable of rapidly representing peak inundation due to the joint occurrence and interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge from tcs the surrogate model was used to expand upon the joint probability method jpm by representing joint tc flood risk levels which is not currently represented in flood insurance studies performed by fema the surrogate model requires basic landfall tc characteristics to approximate peak joint flood levels from a tc given the high fidelity representation of storm surge which requires a 1 2 h run time on 1000 s of computer cores for a single storm and the coupling of the storm surge response with additional numerical models to represent distributed rainfall runoff conditions this surrogate modeling approach provides a rapid methodology for performing joint flood risk analysis at the watershed scale while the study area evaluated experiences extreme rainfall events that are not associated with tcs other climates where extreme rainfall events are primarily driven by tc rainfall may experience greater increases in flood risk levels under a probabilistic joint flood risk analysis such as that performed in this study although this study was performed for coastal watersheds in se houston tx the models and data required for this analysis intentionally built upon open source resources fema utilizes for its inland and coastal flood risk analysis this allows for the methodology utilized in this study to easily be applied to other coastal areas in the u s that are interested in their joint tc flood risk rather than solely storm surge the methodology utilized in this study can additionally be applied to any coastal area in the world albeit may require additional data collection and model development such analysis is highly recommended for densely urbanized coastal watersheds vulnerable to tc flooding like the study area evaluated acknowledgments this research was supported by the houston

7447,this study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones tcs for probabilistic risk analysis due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high fidelity advanced circulation adcirc hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall runoff a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind and pressure field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models this builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from tcs the utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic tc flood risk products which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account tc associated rainfall runoff results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge as compared to the federal emergency management association s femas current practices keywords tropical cyclones joint flooding flood risk machine learning 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs can cause tremendous damage due to the storm surge and heavy rainfall they produce while significant research has focused on the risk associated with tc storm surge as a result of the destructive 2005 hurricane season few studies have evaluated flood risk due to the joint occurrence of tc storm surge and rainfall runoff or joint flooding which routinely occurs during tc events such research is crucial given that post storm damage assessments rappaport 2014 indicate that roughly 27 of human losses due to tc s are caused by rainfall flooding two critical areas lacking information regarding joint tc flooding include probabilistic flood forecasts and flood risk analysis the objective of this paper is to develop a methodology for representing probabilistic joint flood risk levels that can easily be applied to any watershed along the u s gulf and atlantic coast current coastal risk or return period products such as that provided by the federal emergency management association fema 2017b do not represent the joint occurrence of tc storm surge and rainfall runoff recent research on joint flood risk has been limited to a few point locations with long observational records of both stage and rainfall runoff i e wahl et al 2015 zhong et al 2013 such analyses even for areas with long observational records will be highly sensitive to a small sample of all possible tc s for a given area these limitations have required that tc risk assessments utilize additional sources of information that allow for a continuous spatial representation of flood levels from synthetic storms based on a given regions historical or possible tc characteristics myers 1975 ho and myers 1975 in the joint probability method jpm distributions of a regions possible tc characteristics are developed from which storms are sampled and subsequently simulated in a hydrodynamic model for risk analysis storms can be sampled using a monte carlo approach which requires the use of less accurate but faster hydrodynamic models i e slosh lin et al 2010 or by employing optimal sampling techniques resio et al 2009 niedoroda et al 2010 toro et al 2010 that reduce the number of simulations required for surge risk analysis with high fidelity hydrodynamic models in order to allow for high fidelity representations of probabilistic storm surge forecasts or risk levels researchers have recently investigated the use of surge response functions srfs and other surrogate modeling approaches based on supervised machine learning techniques surrogate models are defined as computationally efficient models that are trained to represent the input output relationship that is typically determined from high fidelity physics based numerical models for tc storm surge analysis these surrogate models can rapidly estimate the peak surge expected from a tc based on its landfall characteristics srfs were first proposed as a method to allow for the estimation of storm surge levels of a given tcs characteristics in order to aid in fema flood risk analysis resio et al 2009 and later adapted for flood forecasting purposes irish et al 2011 however srfs are limited to estimates at point locations and have resulted in low levels of accuracy for complex environments such as bays taylor et al 2015 recently supervised machine learning methods including artificial neural networks anns hsieh and ratcliff 2013 kim et al 2015 and kriging jia and taflanidis 2013 jia et al 2016 have been proposed as alternatives to srfs for forecasting purposes in these ann and kriging studies adcirc was coupled with the steady state spectral wave model stwave to provide surge predictions throughout the new orleans area these supervised machine learning studies resulted in high predictive accuracy owing to their ability to develop complex functions that map the relationship between a tc s landfall characteristics and its peak surge response simulated with high fidelity hydrodynamic and wave models such techniques allow for rapid and accurate predictions of a tc s peak surge however to date joint flooding in coastal watersheds due to rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge have not been incorporated into predictive models capable of rapid simulations for probabilistic analysis in this study a surrogate or predictive model is developed based on high fidelity simulations of storm surge and waves adcirc swan coupled with inland hydrologic and hydraulic models that represent tc rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge by employing a supervised machine learning approach based on coupled hydrodynamic and hydrologic modeling results this study provides the first method capable of providing rapid probabilistic estimates of joint flooding from tcs at the watershed scale this surrogate model is then utilized to provide rapid estimates of joint flooding for probabilistic flood risk analysis which is currently limited to probabilistic representations of only storm surge the study is performed for coastal watersheds located in southeast se houston tx but the proposed methodology can be applied to other coastal watersheds due to its use of open source models and data that are available for the majority of the u s gulf and atlantic coast section 2 discusses the modeling approach and methodology used to represent joint flooding from tcs section 3 discusses results from applying the joint flood model for risk analysis section 4 discusses limitations and suggestions for future work and section 5 ends with conclusions from this study 2 methodology in this study several models were loosely coupled fig 1 to represent joint flooding of the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the se houston study area fig 2 this study area includes a population of roughly 300 000 people and because of its connection to galveston bay is exposed to storm surge that can be introduced via the gulf of mexico the study area s shallow slope loamy to clay soils and 67 development exacerbate rainfall runoff and storm surge flooding the 223 synthetic wind and pressure fields developed for femas north texas flood insurance study fema and usace 2011 were used as a forcing for the coupled modeling framework these tcs have a 2 km resolution across the majority of the gulf of mexico and corresponding inland areas and represent the full range of tc storm characteristics that could develop and impact the north texas coast which includes the se houston study area fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the minimum pressure of the storms range from 994 to 900 mb which corresponds to maximum wind speeds ranging from 29 8 m s 66 6 mph to 71 6 m s 160 mph at landfall the open source models utilized in this study including adcirc swan the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and river analysis system hec ras were chosen in order to allow for the application of this study s methodology to the majority of the coastal u s gulf and atlantic where fema and u s army corps of engineers usace flood insurance studies have led to the development of such models for inland riverine and coastal storm surge flood risk analysis details on each of the numerical models and how they were loosely coupled to represent peak inundation levels from the 223 synthetic storms is discussed in section 2 1 input tc characteristics and their corresponding peak inundation levels obtained from the coupled numerical models were stored as input output training features to develop a surrogate model based on ann and kriging supervised machine learning approaches discussed in section 2 2 in addition to joint flooding a surrogate model of only storm surge was developed for comparison against previous studies and to demonstrate increases in flooding due to rainfall runoff since the surrogate models are trained on the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the study area they could be used to allow for predictions of peak inundation levels given any new set of tc characteristics however while the suite of storms encompass the full range of tc characteristics that could impact the study area they do not include weak tropical storms with winds 29 8 m s which can take on winding paths such as tropical storm allison 2001 or tropical storm harvey 2017 2 1 loosely coupled models to represent rainfall runoff interactions with storm surge the high fidelity 2d hydrodynamic adcirc swan model was loosely coupled with a lumped hydrologic model and 1d hydraulic model representative of several watersheds in se houston clear creek armand bayou and horsepen bayou adcirc swan has been validated in capturing the regional surge and wave response of various historical tcs such as katrina and rita in 2005 and gustav and ike in 2008 rego and li 2009 dietrich et al 2010 2011 hope et al 2013 in this study the primary surge forcing mechanisms including direct wind stress wave radiation stress and barotropic water level adjustments were accounted for and the garret wind drag law was utilized rainfall runoff was not directly applied in adcirc swan given the requirement that runoff conditions must be defined at the edge of an adcirc mesh which typically occurs tens to hundreds of kilometers inland this may be appropriate for high order riverine systems such as the mississippi but can lead to a poor representation of distributed runoff that occurs in many coastal environments an overall increase in the initial steric water level of 0 5628 m was applied to represent the average offset between mean high water mhw and navd88 0 3738 m in addition to an increase in water levels due to thermal expansion 0 189 m fema and usace 2011 a semi implicit numerical scheme with a 1 s time step was used in the model setup the same wind and pressure fields from the suite of 223 storms simulated in adcirc swan were additionally utilized to obtain the expected rainfall associated with each tc the physics based asymmetric modified smith for rainfall msr algorithm developed by langousis and veneziano 2009a was employed to determine rainfall intensity across the study area this rainfall algorithm was chosen as compared to other statistics based algorithms such as r cliper lonfat et al 2004 or r phram lonfat et al 2007 due to the physics basis of the algorithm its ability to represent variations in rainfall due to variations in storm intensity and size throughout a storms entire wind field and because of its promising validation against historical storms compared to r cliper langousis and veneziano 2009a msr determines the vertical flux of moisture and resulting surface rainfall rates based on basic thermodynamics that account for the depth averaged temperature and saturation ratio inside a tc boundary layer and a numerical model for calculating vertical winds in the lower troposphere due to tangential wind convergence at the 10 m height of the tc windfields however while able to account for large scale rainfall patterns msr like r cliper does not account for stochastic small scale variations due to local convection intense rainfall associated within the core of a tc and any rainfall due to downdraft winds or mesoscale features such as spiral bands due to the limitations discussed in the previous paragraph the msr algorithm may not be suitable for estimating flood levels for a single deterministic event but given that flood risk is evaluated over a large suite of probabilistic events the authors expect that errors in rainfall estimates will average out across the suite of storms evaluated for risk analysis in this study in other words msr may result in estimated rainfall amounts that are slightly lower or higher for a single deterministic event but for a large suite of events these errors should average out if msr does not have a high or low bias this limitation could be better addressed via stochastic rainfall representations for each tc i e langousis and veneziano 2009b however given the coupled modeling framework such analysis was not computationally feasible parameters for the msr model suggested by langousis and veneziano 2009a were used in this study including a reference altitude of 3 km a depth averaged temperature of 22 c and a saturation ratio of 80 rainfall intensities were obtained at 15 min intervals based on the same 2 km resolution 15 min time step windfields used as a forcing for adcirc swan while msr does not account for topographic impacts on rainfall intensity such impacts are minor given the study areas elevation near mean sea level ranges from 0 to 18 m and shallow slope 0 00045 km 1 km empirically based rainfall models such as r cliper and r phram tuleya et al 2007 lonfat et al 2007 were not utilized based on their grouping of storm rainfall intensities according to category 1 2 and category 3 5 storms which can result in a low bias for risk analysis and their limited ability to account for spatial variations in storm size and intensity rainfall obtained from msr was used as input for the hydrologic model hec hms and subsequently routed to obtain inundation levels in the 1d unsteady hydraulic model hec ras the hec hms and hec ras models used in this study were developed as a part of the post tropical storm allison recovery project in which hydrologic hec hms and hydraulic hec ras models were developed for all of harris county and completed in 2007 hcfcd 2007 the hydrologic model includes 131 subbasins making up a 666 km2 drainage area with an average subbasin area of 5 km2 the watershed consists of loamy to clay soils and is inhabited by roughly 300 000 people with 67 development for current conditions infiltration losses were solved with the green and ampt method subbasin routing was determined using the clark unit hydrograph tc r method and channel routing was determined from the corresponding hydraulic model s hec ras rating curves finally the 1d unsteady hydraulic model hec ras was used to solve for overall inundation levels due to rainfall runoff and storm surge along riverine floodplains several hydraulic models developed by hcfcd 2007 were combined to represent the se houston study area and the model s cross section geometry was updated from its original 2001 lidar with 2008 lidar 1 1 m obtained from the houston galveston area council hgac 2008 the hec ras model includes 682 cross sections with an average spacing of 150 m 54 bridges and a rule operated flood gate at the downstream end of the watershed hydrographs from hec hms were matched to corresponding cross sections in hec ras and specified as subbasin runoff or tributary inflows and a downstream boundary condition at the outlet of the study area which connects to galveston bay was defined by the stage hydrograph determined from the 2d adcirc swan simulations for each storm with the streamflow and stage boundary conditions from hec hms and 2d adcirc swan respectively unsteady 1d hec ras was finally used to determine peak inundation levels due to storm surge and rainfall runoff along riverine floodplains for each of the 223 tcs simulated as stated previously fig 1 provides a schematic demonstrating how the different numerical models are connected to represent joint flooding the peak inundation is defined as the peak inundation throughout an entire storms simulation since 1d hec ras represents inundation along riverine channels and their overbank floodplains peak inundation levels in locations beyond the riverine floodplain were additionally obtained from 2d adcirc swan simulations while the majority of inundation is captured along riverine floodplains with 1d hec ras the additional representation of overland storm surge from 2d adcirc swan captures inundation that can occur along the perimeter of the study area due to storm surge that can flow into the study area from surrounding drainage areas during extreme tcs such surge does not overlap with the study area s riverine floodplain prior to simulating the suite of 223 storms through the loosely coupled models adcirc swan msr hec hms hec ras the hydrologic hec hms and hydraulic models hec ras were calibrated to achieve the best possible accuracy in time variable streamflow and stage conditions for 3 recent rainfall runoff dominated events which are listed in table 1 the optimal parameters obtained for the hydrologic and hydraulic models in the calibration process were then utilized for validation against tropical storm allison 2001 and hurricane ike 2008 ref table 1 given the coastal environment calibration was specifically performed for the rainfall runoff dominated events since storm surge events can result in upstream flow across observed streamflow gauges hence rendering such gauges effectively useless for comparison against hydrologic modeling results data used for calibration and validation against historical storms included gridded hourly observed rainfall intensities with a 4 km spatial resolution from stage iv nexrad that was calibrated by local rain gauges also known as multisensor precipitation estimator lin 2011 modeled versus observed comparisons for peak streamflow and stage are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively coefficients of determination r2 of 0 981 and 0 995 were obtained for modeled peak streamflow and stage comparisons against observed gauge data fig 5 demonstrates modeled versus observed results for hurricane ike for the entire suite of coupled models utilized in this study while msr has accurately been validated against hurricane frances 2004 and katrina 2005 langousis and veneziano 2009a b the validation against hurricane ike results in roughly 70 of the actually observed cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area 17 2 cm from msr versus 24 3 cm observed since hurricane ike moved directly over the study area the estimates from msr are low due to the models limited ability to represent intense eyewall convection for reference r cliper s estimate of hurricane ike rainfall is additionally shown which is lower than msr because of its treatment of hurricane ike as a storm that results in similar rainfall to a category 1 2 storm despite it being only 0 447 m s 1 mph from a category 3 storm as shown in fig 5 msr s initial rainfall estimate translates into lower estimates of streamflow and stage as compared to observed for areas influenced by rainfall runoff i e gauges 6 and 8 nonetheless given the accuracy of the hydrologic and hydraulic models when evaluated against events with observed rainfall and stage data the high fidelity and validation of the hydrodynamic model performed in previous studies and the expected averaging out of the msr rainfall estimates for a large set of storms the suite of 223 synthetic storm wind and pressure fields were subsequently simulated in the loosely coupled numerical models to serve as training data for a surrogate model to summarize the hazards associated with the suite of storms the maximum 12 h cumulative rainfall averaged across the study area and the peak storm surge at the outlet for each storm which were determined from msr and adcirc swan respectively are shown in fig 6 as expected a correlation between these two sources of tc flooding is shown which simply indicates that for the study area similar storm characteristics that result in increases in storm surge generally result in increases in rainfall 2 2 supervised machine learning as discussed previously to represent peak inundation expected from a given tc several numerical models were utilized in this study including a high fidelity hydrodynamic model that requires more than an hour simulation per storm event even with parallel processing on 1000 s of computer cores to allow for rapid estimations of peak inundation levels which is necessary for probabilistic flood forecasting and risk analysis a surrogate model was developed based on numerical model results via supervised machine learning methods since both kriging and artificial neural networks anns can learn complex non linear functions and have been applied with varying success in previous studies for storm surge predictions both of these machine learning methods were evaluated to develop a surrogate model despite added complexity and possible increases in non linearity due to the addition of rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge the authors anticipated that a well performing surrogate model could still be developed since the physical mechanisms that influence tc rainfall intensity are based on many of the same characteristics that determine storm surge levels including storm intensity size forward speed angle and landfall location similar tc characteristics utilized in previous studies i e jia and taflanidis 2013 were employed as baseline characteristics for training separate surrogate models for predicting peak storm surge and peak joint flood levels these training characteristics include the following parameters at landfall minimum central pressure cp radius to maximum winds rmax 6 h forward speed vf angle of approach from due north and landfall location represented by longitude x in addition to evaluating these baseline characteristics alternative storm descriptors were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the surrogate model to more descriptive training features however negligible increases in accuracy were observed with these alternative storm descriptors i e radius to tropical storm and hurricane winds integrated kinetic energy factor and thus only results for the baseline characteristics are included as discussed previously peak inundation levels were obtained for each storm using the coupled modeling framework shown in fig 1 and interpolated results were projected onto a grid of 76 610 points with a 75 75 m resolution making up a 414 km2 area these points represent where the surrogate model was trained in order to allow for rapid predictions the grid of points as compared to direct output along cross sections from hec ras or nodes from adcirc swan was utilized to develop a common set of prediction points for joint flooding and to allow for direct comparisons of joint flooding against storm surge the 75 75 m resolution was chosen to capture spatial variations in flooding with a resolution comparable to hec ras cross section spacing ranges from 30 to 300 m with an overall average of 125 m and adcirc swan resolution varies from 40 m to 225 m in study area with an average of 150 m the extent of the prediction points as shown in fig 7 was based on points that experienced inundation for at least one of the storms in the suite of 223 storms simulated an additional surrogate model with a total number of 49 326 points was trained for storm surge only based on the adcirc swan results the storm surge surrogate model was developed for comparison purposes against previous studies and to allow for comparisons against joint flooding for both the ann and kriging model approaches a single surrogate model was developed with multiple outputs based on latent variables determined using principal components analysis pca pca allows for a significant reduction in the output dimensions that have to be trained on from the original 73 610 point locations to a given number of latent variables which can then be re projected back to the original high dimensional output space this study also employed the dry point technique which was applied by jia and taflanidis 2013 to allow for surrogate models to train on latent output variables such as those determined using pca kriging contains two components i a linear or quadratic polynomial regression that includes weights that are globally fit to the training data and ii a non parametric portion that assumes that the true function y x is a realization of a stochastic process z x 1 y x f x a t z x where f x includes linear or quadratic polynomial basis functions with a being the vector of learned weights the second component z x provides a localized deviation from the basis function prediction based on the correlation or similarity between the input training features of hurricane characteristics and their respective output quadratic and linear basis functions for f x were evaluated and the correlation function for z x was optimized for an order between 0 5 and 2 hence allowing for the evaluation of exponential as well as gaussian correlation functions thus the hyperparameters optimized for kriging in this study include quadratic versus linear basis functions for the training features the order associated with the correlation function and the amount of variance or latent variables included in pca further discussion regarding the kriging algorithm used in this study can be found in jia and taflanidis 2013 traditional anns are made up of an input layer corresponding to the original input data features tc storm characteristics a number of hidden layers with a corresponding number of neurons in each hidden layer and an output layer where predictions are made peak surge or joint flood levels as the number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer increase more weights are introduced and more complex functions can be learned by an ann however training time will increase and the model may begin to overfit the training data leading to poorer predictions on unseen data sets ann s typically utilize a form of the backpropagation algorithm that adjusts weights throughout the ann by distributing the final error from a given iteration throughout the network hence model weights are iteratively tuned by making a prediction and then adjusting model weights based on a distribution throughout the network of the final error between predictions and true results this study utilizes the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm due to its ability to additionally optimize the amount of regularization implemented to prevent overfitting using the bayesian methods described in foresee and hagan 1997 the hyperparameters optimized for the anns include the number of hidden layers number of neurons in each hidden layer and the amount of variance or latent variables included in pca additional information regarding anns can be obtained from a variety of resources including johnson and karpathy 2017 which explains the theory and optimization of anns and solomatine et al 2008 for an overview of example applications in hydrology ten fold cross validation ron kohavi 1995 was utilized to evaluate the performance of each surrogate models error metrics which were computed at each of the 76 610 prediction points for joint flooding 49 326 for surge only to obtain an average coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and absolute mean error ame 3 results 3 1 surrogate model table 2 outlines the best performing ann employed with the bayesian regularization algorithm and kriging models that were developed in this study for predicting storm surge and joint flooding this table includes a reference to the best prediction accuracy reported for storm surge in previous studies that were performed in new orleans however comparisons for joint flooding are not included since such analysis has not been performed before the kriging model provides similar prediction accuracy compared to previous studies while the ann provides a significant improvement compared to the best performing ann in previous studies after ensuring surrogate models could successfully be developed for storm surge with comparable accuracy to previous studies a surrogate model for joint flooding was developed as compared to the trained models for storm surge both the ann and kriging model for joint flood predictions have a lower r2 and slightly higher rmse although there is a strong correlation between the tc characteristics used as training features and a tcs expected rainfall the surrogate model s decrease in performance can be attributed to an increase in complexity from the introduction of additional models to represent rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge and the greater variation in the overall flood response from storm to storm overfitting issues particularly for joint flooding resulted in anns performing less accurately than kriging this is demonstrated in fig 8 which shows that although the training accuracy of anns exceeded kriging as the model complexity of anns increased the highest validation accuracy of anns for storm surge and joint flood predictions were lower simply stated an ann s attempt to learn spatial information from input output data is limited compared to kriging s estimates of flood levels which directly takes into account the spatial structure of each storm s floodplain by considering the covariance of input training features and their flood response the better performance of kriging is not surprising since a floodplain is a continuous surface containing spatial information that kriging directly takes into account and agrees with previous studies that have evaluated other continuous surfaces i e matias et al 2004 nonetheless this study confirms that kriging performs better for not only storm surge but also joint flood predictions at the watershed scale as compared to anns finally the rmse for each storm based on the validation process during training for each surrogate model is shown for the best kriging models determined for storm surge and joint flooding in fig 9 a as demonstrated in fig 9a the surrogate model for joint flooding generally has slightly higher errors than the surrogate model for storm surge however there are a few exceptions in which the surrogate model may have greater difficulty in predicting storm surge as compared to joint flooding the characteristics of these storms were evaluated and decreases in minimum central pressure cp which corresponds to more intense storms is the only characteristic that showed a trend with decreasing accuracy for the storm surge predictions fig 9b as discussed in section 2 1 and demonstrated in fig 4 the kriging supervised machine learning model for joint flooding henceforth will be referred to as the surrogate model may not be appropriate for hindcast analysis or deterministic forecasting given limitations of the rainfall model however the surrogate model s accurate representation of the numerical models employed suggests it can be used for probabilistic flood risk analysis where several thousand storms are evaluated assuming there isn t an overall positive or negative bias of the rainfall model and based on the accurate validation of the other numerical models utilized in this study for a single synthetic storm fig 10 demonstrates negligible differences between predicted tc flood levels based on an unseen storm s landfall characteristics and the same storm s simulated flood levels determined using the loosely coupled numerical models the surrogate model returns inundation levels for a single storm within a few seconds as compared to the roughly 1 2 h required with the coupled msr adcirc swan hec hms and hec ras models that were used to train the surrogate model the following section demonstrates the surrogate models use for probabilistic flood risk analysis 3 2 risk analysis as discussed in section 1 current fema flood insurance practices account for storm surge in coastal areas but do not account for tc rainfall runoff in order to address this issue while allowing for a relatively straightforward application to other coastal areas along the u s coast this study coupled open source models that are currently used by fema hec hms hec ras adcirc swan and built off of the jpm approach used for femas surge risk analysis in this study a monte carlo sampling approach is employed with the joint probability method since the surrogate model can rapidly represent a storms expected flood levels to perform risk analysis parameters of probability distributions of tc characteristics were obtained from a recent usace study evaluating surge mitigation strategies along the upper tx coast gccprd 2016 these probability distributions were defined at 12 5 km intervals along the tx coastline from 27 7265 97 1164 approximately 275 km southwest of study area to 29 5640 94 3478 65 km northeast of study area and fit to data from 1938 to 2013 collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national hurricane centers data 2 archive however the historical maxima and variances of the tc parameters are based on the entire 1851 2013 data record available from hurdat2 table 3 outlines the conditional probability distributions used to fit historical storm parameters and appendix a includes detailed information regarding the parameters associated with each distribution defined along the upper texas coastline to approximate the joint flood risk synthetic storms were constructed by random selection of 100 000 storms from the joint probability distributions of storm characteristics resulting in the histograms of storm parameters shown in fig 3 then flood risk levels were analytically fit by ranking the simulated water level responses from largest to smallest and corresponding return periods were determined using the weibull formula which provides an unbiased estimate of the recurrence interval 2 t Œª n 1 m where t is the return period Œª is the average time between storm events 9 667 years n is the total number of storm samples 100 000 and m is the magnitude or rank of each simulated water level this monte carlo method has widely been used for extreme flood risk analysis with large observational or numerically simulated data sets and as shown in fig 11 provides a satisfactory comparison against femas surge return period levels at the outlet of the study area flood risk analysis was performed using the separate kriging surrogate models of joint flooding and storm surge only to demonstrate the source apportionment of flood risk levels throughout the entire study area water levels based on the suite of 100 000 storm samples of the regions joint probability distributions were obtained at each of the 76 610 prediction points from which annual exceedance probabilities aep or return period flood levels were determined for each point location fig 12 demonstrates the resulting tc return period floodplain for a 100 yr or 1 event the joint tc flood risk levels were subsequently compared against current fema flood risk practices following femas methodology for inland watersheds design rainfall events were simulated in the study area using the same hec hms and hec ras models discussed in section 2 1 except hec ras was simulated in steady state per standard fema practices the design rainfall events utilized for the region include 24 h rainfall with scs type iii distributions of 19 81 cm for the 10 yr 29 46 cm for the 50 yr 34 29 cm for the 100 yr and 49 02 cm for the 500 yr return period hcfcd 2009 to determine surge risk levels the storm surge surrogate model was utilized using the same jpm approach applied for determining joint flood risk levels the maximum inundation levels between the inland design rainfall runoff analysis and coastal surge risk analysis were then compared to joint flood risk levels that account for probabilistic tc rainfall runoff storm surge and their interactions fig 13 a demonstrates the floodplain extent for different return periods due to storm surge joint flooding and femas current practices which includes flooding from storm surge and a design rainfall runoff event as shown in fig 13a increases in the extent of flooding throughout the study area due to joint flooding were not observed compared to femas current flood risk practices this is due to more severe rainfall from the design rainfall events compared to the synthetic rainfall events in addition to the spatially uniform and thus conservative representation of design rainfall compared to the spatially heterogeneous rainfall from tcs however increases in the depth of inundation were observed throughout the study area as shown for increases of at least 0 1 m in inundation in fig 13b increases in flood depth were primarily observed for 500 yr flood levels and as demonstrated in fig 13c are concentrated along the upstream end of the study area and a middle portion of the study area s main channel increases in inundation levels for the upstream end may be related to a combination of storm direction relative to the study area with tc s typically moving from the downstream to upstream end of the study area as well as possible backwater effects due to extreme storm surge conditions that may cause a decrease in drainage in the upstream end of the study area the increases in inundation observed along the middle portion of the study area s main channel are due to interactions between rainfall runoff and storm surge that fema does not account for in its steady state analysis these interactions occur in a transition zone that is located between the upstream portion of the study area that is dominated by rainfall runoff and downstream portion that is dominated by storm surge this transition zone can roughly be represented for a given return period by the location where the representation of joint flood levels overlaps with storm surge levels i e such as that shown for 100 yr flood levels in fig 12b the analysis performed in this study provides a useful description of flood risks associated with tcs that currently does not exist a coastal resident interested in their tc flood risk can access storm surge return period floodplains i e fema 2017a and their exposure to inland rainfall flooding from separate fema map products fema 2017b however such information is limited and potentially misleading since flooding due to tc rainfall runoff is not included by probabilistically accounting for rainfall runoff in addition to storm surge this study provides a map product capable of representing joint tc flood risk levels and their source apportionment 4 limitations and future work the main contribution of this study is the development of a new methodology for representing joint flooding at the watershed scale which includes rainfall runoff storm surge and their interactions the methodology is made up of two components a coupled numerical modeling framework and a surrogate model that is trained based on the results of the coupled numerical models this section discusses potential improvements that could be made to the coupled numerical models to increase the accuracy of the joint flood risk analysis performed and to expand the applicability of the surrogate modeling approach into a probabilistic forecasting environment of all the numerical models utilized in this study the rainfall model had the greatest uncertainty based on its validation against hurricane ike while the msr model may be able to capture broad scale tc rainfall and its asymmetric redistribution it cannot represent several additional rainfall processes including convection within the eyewall of a tc or mesoscale rainfall bands while the most appropriate tc rainfall model was chosen at the time of the study a subsequent study should provide a review of existing statistical and physics based rainfall models against historical observations to determine the accuracy and biases of each rainfall model such analysis will require a fairly extensive effort including the collection of tc characteristics and windfields required for each rainfall model implementing the algorithms associated with each model and finally comparing results to spatial statistics of observed tc rainfall events based on such analysis the most reliable rainfall model should then be used within the methodology proposed in this study in addition this study utilized fema models for representing tc rainfall runoff and its interactions with storm surge these models were utilized to allow for a more direct comparison of joint flood risk levels against femas current flood insurance practices that do not consider joint flood hazards however future work may consider using a fully distributed hydrologic model rather than a lumped hydrologic model as well as a hydraulic model that represents 2d conditions across floodplain areas rather than the 1d hydraulic model utilized in this study such modifications would likely allow for a more accurate representation of flow direction and resulting inundation levels finally this study evaluated joint flood risk from tc s for wind speeds greater than 29 8 m s 66 6 mph in addition to tcs joint flood risk analysis should incorporate slow moving and winding tropical storms that can result in significant rainfall such as tropical storm s allison 2001 and harvey 2017 such analysis may highlight that tropical storms can drive low probability severe rainfall events that were not represented in this study s analysis of tcs in addition to improving the representation of joint flood risk levels the incorporation of tropical storms and the aforementioned numerical modeling modifications would result in a more reliable surrogate model for probabilistic flood forecasting while the surrogate model developed in this study can be applied for probabilistic flood forecast guidance or as a supplement to deterministic simulations of inundation sourcing rainfall from numerical weather models and surge from a high fidelity hydrodynamic model the authors suggest incorporating the previous recommendations prior to launching a surrogate model for real time probabilistic forecasts of joint flooding finally future work should evaluate several study areas with a range of watershed and climate characteristics to highlight what conditions lead to increased vulnerability to increases in flooding due to the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge in addition future work should evaluate tc rainfall runoff versus storm surge flooding at a regional scale and their resulting damages to provide insight regarding the relative severity of these two sources of flooding such analysis will require analyzing the decomposed contributions from rainfall runoff versus storm surge as well their combined flood interactions finally given increasing ocean and atmospheric temperatures which can exacerbate the storm surge and rainfall response of tcs analysis of joint flooding will only continue to become more important to evaluate under future conditions 5 conclusions in this study a surrogate model was developed that is capable of rapidly representing peak inundation due to the joint occurrence and interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge from tcs the surrogate model was used to expand upon the joint probability method jpm by representing joint tc flood risk levels which is not currently represented in flood insurance studies performed by fema the surrogate model requires basic landfall tc characteristics to approximate peak joint flood levels from a tc given the high fidelity representation of storm surge which requires a 1 2 h run time on 1000 s of computer cores for a single storm and the coupling of the storm surge response with additional numerical models to represent distributed rainfall runoff conditions this surrogate modeling approach provides a rapid methodology for performing joint flood risk analysis at the watershed scale while the study area evaluated experiences extreme rainfall events that are not associated with tcs other climates where extreme rainfall events are primarily driven by tc rainfall may experience greater increases in flood risk levels under a probabilistic joint flood risk analysis such as that performed in this study although this study was performed for coastal watersheds in se houston tx the models and data required for this analysis intentionally built upon open source resources fema utilizes for its inland and coastal flood risk analysis this allows for the methodology utilized in this study to easily be applied to other coastal areas in the u s that are interested in their joint tc flood risk rather than solely storm surge the methodology utilized in this study can additionally be applied to any coastal area in the world albeit may require additional data collection and model development such analysis is highly recommended for densely urbanized coastal watersheds vulnerable to tc flooding like the study area evaluated acknowledgments this research was supported by the houston endowment under the severe storm prediction education and evacuation from disasters sspeed center authors also acknowledge the support of clint dawson at the university of texas at austin united

characteristics the following parameters of the probability distributions of tc characteristics were obtained from a recent usace study evaluating surge mitigation strategies along the upper tx coast

assistance of jiin shuh jean associate editor graphical abstract quantifying rainfall derived inflow and infiltration rdii in a sanitary sewer is difficult when rdii and overflow occur simultaneously this study proposes a novel conductivity based method for estimating rdii the method separately decomposes rainfall derived inflow rdi and rainfall induced infiltration rii on the basis of conductivity data fast fourier transform was adopted to analyze variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather nonlinear curve fitting based on the least squares algorithm was used to optimize parameters in the proposed rdii model the method was successfully applied to real life case studies in which inflow and infiltration were successfully estimated for three typical rainfall events with total rainfall volumes of 6 25 mm light 28 15 mm medium and 178 mm heavy uncertainties of model parameters were estimated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method and were found to be acceptable compared with traditional flow based methods the proposed approach exhibits distinct advantages in estimating rdii and overflow particularly when the two processes happen simultaneously keywords conductivity inflow infiltration sanitary sewer overflow sewer system 1 introduction sewer systems transport municipal wastewater from cities to treatment facilities rainfall derived inflow and infiltration rdii can cause serious operational problems in sanitary sewer systems and downstream wastewater treatment plants these processes amplify pumping costs increase the wastewater load and dilute the wastewater additionally rdii increases the probability of sanitary sewer overflows ssos and risk of drainage pipe collapse vallabhaneni et al 2008 the inflow and infiltration volumes can reach more than 100 of the ordinary wastewater quantity and this characteristic directly decreases the pollutant removal efficiency ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 these phenomena seriously threaten infrastructure security and wastewater treatment plant wwtp operations thus monitoring and assessing the inflow and infiltration processes are crucial to solve the problems associated with the operation and management of sewer systems flow information can be readily used to assess inflow and infiltration into a sewerage system these processes are commonly analyzed based on the principle of balancing annual or daily flow rates for example the triangle method ranks all flow values daily mean values in ascending order to estimate inflow and infiltration weiss et al 2002 mingkai et al 2017 minimum nightly flow was also used to determine infiltration franz 2006 moreover several reformative methods have used filters to extract time series of total flow and determine the quantity of inflow and infiltration vaes et al 2005 these flow based methods do not accurately quantify when sewer overflow occurs as a result of rdii additionally water quality monitoring has been adopted to assess inflow and infiltration coupled with flow data traditional pollutant index such as chemical oxygen demand cod kracht and gujer 2005 bare≈° et al 2009 total nitrogen tn shelton et al 2011 and total phosphorus tp mattsson et al 2016 were used to assess inflow and infiltration tn and tp were found to be more reliable water quality parameters several stable intrinsic tracers have also been applied to assess rdii as alternative to normal water quality indicators naturally occurring stable isotopes of water 18o 16o kracht et al 2007 de b√©n√©dittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 houhou et al 2010 was successfully used to determine the source and the amount of rainwater or groundwater entering an drainage system these methods can provide accurate information regarding inflow and infiltration but they require intensive measurements online collection of such water quality data is difficult especially in large sewer systems complex models based on hydrological and hydraulic mechanisms have also been applied to simulate inflow and infiltration distributed hydrological models are generally used to describe surrounding hydrogeological processes and their interactions with the sewer network sewer flow is commonly assumed to be composed of sewage inflow and infiltration inflow and infiltration can be further separated into three different components as follows i groundwater infiltration gwi ii rain induced infiltration rii and iii direct storm water inflow which is also called rain derived inflow rdi bennett 1999 staufer et al 2012 hydrological models are commonly used to illustrate the transformation of precipitation into runoff at the subcatchment scale belhadj et al 1995 proposed a simple multiparameter conceptual model to simulate rii in a sewer system using hourly measurements of rainfall and flow rates gustafsson et al 1999 developed the mousenam model in which the fast runoff component from impervious surfaces and the slow runoff component caused by infiltration into the sewer system from the surrounding soil were both considered the run off routing rorb model is a similar model based on several tanks in series that can be used to distinguish various flow components laurenson et al 1990 karpf and krebs 2011 presented a method for quantifying inflow and infiltration based on a multimodel approach in the stormwater management model swmm and the sanitary sewer overflow analysis and planning toolbox rdii can be presented using the so called rtk method based on a synthetic unit hydrograph this method assumes that rdii occurs in a sewer in response to a specific precipitation volume over a given period based on the sewershed characteristics lai 2008 boukhemacha et al 2015 studied urban groundwater flow using a mathematical model with geospatial analysis mao et al 2016 proposed an approximate point source method for measuring soil infiltration and verified the method using three soil types in laboratory experiments however similar to flow based methods these hydrologic hydraulic methods are not suitable for flow situations where overflow and or backflow occur furthermore several statistical and probabilistic methods have been introduced to study the relationship between rdii and rainfall volume zhang 2005 proposed an autoregressive regression framework in which flow and rainfall data were considered to realize reliable estimation of rdii pate and rahman 2010 investigated the applicability of monte carlo simulation with the rorb model mikalson 2011 developed two conceptualizations to estimate rdii using a derived probability distribution theory however these complex statistical and probabilistic models require large computational runtimes and are difficult to implement in real time simulations based on online monitoring this study is performed to develop a simple and cost effective method to estimate inflow infiltration and sewer overflow in a sanitary sewer system based on conductivity data which are simple and easy to monitor the method facilitates the estimation of rdii as rii and rdi separately not only in normal flow conditions but also when rdii occurs simultaneously with overflow or backflow the proposed approach enables the quantification of overflow by regenerating flow data based on the estimated rdii 2 methods and materials 2 1 field trial and data preparation online wastewater flow and quality data were collected in a sewer system in wuxi city china fig s1 the catchment area of the monitoring site was approximately 0 8 km2 this network was mainly a separate sanitary sewer system with hidden cross connections the pipe diameter at the monitoring site was 600 mm and the dry weather flow varied between 40 m3 h and 120 m3 h the flow meter used in the system was a hach fl900av flow meter the depth was measured using a submerged pressure transducer in the flowmeter rainfall event was recorded by a sigma rain gauge tipping bucket with a hach fl900 series flow logger conductivity was measured using a water quality instrument product model ploc100 independent development that monitors the conductivity temperature oxidation reduction potential orp and ph data collection lasted for approximately one year all data flow water level conductivity and rainfall were collected at 10 min intervals the quality of the monitoring data was assessed using local regression smoothing hastie and loader 1993 to remove disturbances and outliers when rdii exceeded the conveyance capacity of the system the water level in the system increased and caused backwater or even overflow rainfall events could be grouped into three categories namely light medium or heavy light rainfall events were events that raised water level in the sewer system without backwater formation medium rainfall events were events that raised the water level and caused backwater to form i e the flow decreased but was still positive these phenomena indicated that the inflow and infiltration exceeded the capacity of the sewer and ssos occurred heavy rainfall events were events that raised the water level and caused backflow i e the flow at the monitoring site become negative three representative rainfall events are shown in table 1 2 2 variation in flow and conductivity in dry weather dry weather flow and its conductivity can be characterized using spectral analysis and fast fourier transform fft into components of sine functions as follows 1 y i 1 n a i sin 2 œÄ f i t œï i c where y is the flow rate or conductivity at the monitoring point and ai fi and œïi represent the amplitude frequency and phase of the ith sine function respectively c is the average value of the diurnal variation in the flow rate or conductivity the major frequencies f i were determined based on the high amplitudes a i generated by the fft 2 3 model of inflow and infiltration with instantaneous unit hydrograph in wet weather flow inflow and infiltration can be simulated as the final outflow of a series of cascaded linear reservoirs as derived in the supplementary information eqs s1 and s2 the outflow from the cascaded linear reservoirs is as follows nash 1957 2 u 0 t 1 k Œ≥ n t k n 1 e t k where u 0 t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph which represents the rdii flow as the result of unit instantaneous rainfall n is the number of linear reservoirs Œ≥ n is the gamma function of n and k is the storage coefficient of the linear reservoir supplementary information rainfall is always continuous rather than instantaneous thus the instantaneous unit hydrograph should be converted to a temporal unit hydrograph which is used to describe the rdii process produced by per unit rainfall in the record time span Œ¥ t which is 10 min in our study as follows 3 u Œ¥ t t 1 Œ¥ t 0 t u 0 œÑ d œÑ Œ¥ t t u 0 œÑ Œ¥ t d œÑ where Œ¥ t is the record time interval of rainfall u Œ¥ t t represents the outflow as the result of unit rainfall during the period of Œ¥ t parameter r was used to represent the fractions of rainfall volume that enter the sewer system as rdii the whole monitoring time can be divided into n parts by the record time interval and i is the ordinal number from 1 to n pi is the rainfall depth per unit time rainfall record time interval and the net rainfall entering into the sanitary sewer system could be presented as the product of r and pi in each unit time f is the sub catchment area upstream of the monitoring site by summing the u Œ¥ t t produced by each net rainfall the discharge of rdii can be expressed as follows 4 q t f i 1 n r p i u i Œ¥ t t rdi and rii were described using the same principle of cascading linear reservoirs to reduce the computational complexity for the inflow process rrdi krdi and nrdi were used to substitute for r k and n in eqs 2 and 4 moreover u Œ¥ t t in eq 3 and q t in eq 4 would be substituted by u rdi Œ¥ t t and qrdi t respectively similarly substituting rrii krii and nrii for r k and n u Œ¥ t t will be become u rii Œ¥ t t and q t will be qrii t rrdi and rrii represent the ratio of rainfall that enters the sewer system as rdi and rii respectively while krdi and krii represent the storage coefficients of rdi and rii respectively while nrdi and nrii represent the number of linear reservoirs of rdi and rii respectively then the wet weather flow qwwf t is the sum of the dry weather flow qdwf t from eq 1 rdi flow qrdi t and rii flow qrii t as shown by eq 5 as follows 5 q wwf t q dwf t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rdi i Œ¥ t t f i 1 n r rii p i u rii i Œ¥ t t 2 4 pollutant balance model in wet weather flow conductivity was chosen as the pollutant indicator in the model rdi and rii normally decrease the conductivity of domestic sewage as expressed in the material balance equation the components of wet weather conductivity can be combined as eq 6 as follows 6 c wwf t c dwf t q dwf t c rdi t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rdi i Œ¥ t t c rii t f i 1 n r rii p i u

flow rdi and rii respectively the conductivity of rdi and rii were monitored in a catch basin nearby 2 5 data analysis to determine rdii qdwf and cdwf can be described by eq 1 the parameters related to dry weather would be determined first by the dry weather flow and conductivity then six parameters rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi and nrii related to the wet weather were used in the model these six parameters were calibrated either by fitting the observed wet weather flow eq 5 or by fitting the wet weather conductivity eq 6 which will produce two parameter sets to be compared to crosscheck the model applicability in different rainfall scenarios moreover the parameter set calibrated by eq 6 can be substituted into eq 5 to calculate wet weather flow and vice versa the goodness of fit was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency coefficient eq s3 the above data analysis methodology is summarized in fig 1 nonlinear fitting method based on iterative reweighted least squares algorithm holland and welsch 1977 dumouchel and o brien 1991 was performed to optimize the parameters in the model the weights of each iteration were recalculated based on the residual of the observed data of the previous iteration this recalculation mitigated the influence of outliers iterations continued until the weights converged given that rdi represents the direct inflow of runoff rii represents infiltration in which rainwater enters into the system through soil inflow and infiltration can be separated because they have different flow rates in physics during fitting the constraints of parameters were determined as rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi nrii to guarantee the flow rate difference the uncertainty of the model and 90 confidence interval of parameters were evaluated with generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 glue adopts the concept of equifinality of models parameters and variables this methodology consists of three steps jensen 2003 first the prior distribution which is typically discrete or continuous uniform distribution of the parameters was determined second is the stochastic simulation based on the parameters defined previously with monte carlo method to evaluate a random sample of the parameter sets third the simulation and the corresponding parameter sets were rated according to which they fit the observed data for every single simulation if the simulated results were close to the observed values the simulation and this parameter set were accepted as having a given likelihood ns value in our case otherwise this simulation and parameter set would be rejected these three steps were repeated until iterations reached the set point 5000 iterations in our case the cumulative distribution function cdf was calculated for all accepted parameters and the value corresponding to 5 and 95 of the cdf will be the 90 confidence interval of the parameters the model uncertainty was revealed through the cdf of the accepted simulation results 3 results 3 1 flow and conductivity variations during dry weather time series of dry weather flow rate and conductivity profiles were analyzed using spectral analysis and fft the dry weather data before the large rainfall event were analyzed as an example spectral analysis was used for all seven days of the dry weather flow to obtain an overall fitting two major frequencies were extracted from the flow and conductivity monitoring data fig 2 a d frequencies of 1 day and 2 day reflected periods of 1 day and 0 5 days and these values correspond to water usage habits with morning and evening peaks as shown by butler et al 1995 and gernaey et al 2011 the flow amplitude at a frequency of 1 day was 62 80 m3 h while the amplitude at 2 day was 37 69 m3 h fig 2 a and b table s1 thus the diurnal period was more notable than the semidiurnal period conductivity also exhibited similar periodic characteristics fig 2 c and d increasing the number of fourier series yielded higher ns values for example the ns values were 0 67 0 86 and 0 93 using second order fifth order and tenth order fourier series respectively the fifth order fourier series were adopted in our study because it can meet the requirement to regenerate the dry weather flow and conductivity tables s1 and s2 fig 2 a and c shows the fitting results of the flow and conductivity data respectively 3 2 rdii determination during a light rainfall event a small rainfall event was used to calibrate the model and estimate rdi and rii in fig 3 a the mean dry weather flow before the rainfall event was 44 m3 h while the maximum wet weather flow reached 131 4 m3 h during the rainfall event the model parameters were determined based on the observed flow data using eq 5 table 2 the results indicate that the fraction of rainfall volume converted to inflow was 22 7 rrdi and the fraction of rainfall volume converted to infiltration was 13 2 rrii therefore approximately 35 9 of the rainfall volume entered the sanitary sewerage pipes as rdii during inflow 6 8 cascade reservoirs were used and each had a storage coefficient of 5 2 during infiltration the soil was divided into 9 6 vertical cascade reservoirs and each reservoir had a storage coefficient of 6 8 the large value of n resulted in slower infiltration than the inflow process as expected the total rdi total rii and total rdii volumes were 1135 2 m3 660 7 m3 and 1795 9 m3 respectively table 3 conductivity simulation based on eq 6 is shown in fig 3 b and the parameter values are listed in table 2 the parameters calculated based on the conductivity and flow data were similar table 2 fig 3 c and d shows the rdi and rii flows determined based on flow and conductivity respectively the rdi and rii flows calculated based on the conductivity data exhibited good agreement with the result based on flow data figs 3 e and 2 f confirming the suitability of conductivity as a water quality parameter for determination of rdi and rii flows using the parameters determined by conductivity to predict rdii of other two light rainfall events the validation results are shown in fig s2 conductivity of the other two events were good fitted indicating the parameter set can be applied to assess rdii of small rainfall events 3 3 rdii determination during a medium rainfall event a medium rainfall event created ssos in this sanitary sewer system due to high water levels fig 4 a shows that the flow increased on the second day and decreased on the third day after this event however the water level remained high until the third day these phenomena indicated that some of the water was discharged as ssos in the sewer system model parameters were determined based on the flow data for the medium rainfall event to test the adaptability of flow based model the model parameters and 90 confidence interval are listed in table 2 the ns efficiency coefficient between the observed and simulated flow data was only 0 029 table 2 suggesting that the flow data were difficult to fit fig 4 b shows that the simulated flow was lower than the observed flow thus the flow based model does not produce a good prediction for the observed flow data in this scenario because of backwater moreover the calculated rdi and rii flows shown in fig 4 c are not reliable estimates of the true inflow and infiltration flows substituting the calculated rdi and rii flows into eq 6 shows the modeled conductivity profile fig 4 d the flow based model underestimated rdii but overestimated the conductivity the results indicate that the model based on the flow data cannot effectively estimate the inflow and infiltration process for this medium rainfall event when the conductivity data was used to estimate the rdi and rii flows for the medium rainfall event the observed and simulated conductivity data fig 4 e fit well with an ns efficiency coefficient of 0 54 table 2 the fractions of the rainfall volume entering into the sewer system as inflow and infiltration are 10 1 rrdi and 8 2 rrii respectively table 2 rrdi and rrii were less than those associated with the light rainfall event probably because rdii exceeded the capacity of the system the inflow and infiltration profiles are shown in fig 4 f infiltration is considerably slower than inflow rate the total rdii volume was approximately 4172 4 m3 with an rdi and rii volumes of 2302 8 m3 and 1869 6 m3 respectively the actual total wastewater flow was estimated based on the rdii flows and the dwf pattern fig 4 g significant difference was found between the simulated and observed flows mainly during the period with higher water levels fig 4 h the flow difference was likely caused by storage in upstream sewerage pipes and overflow discharged from sewerage pipes upstream of the monitoring location the amounts of overflow can be calculated by integrating the difference between the simulated and observed flows which produced a value of 1207 9 m3 for this event as a result of ssos table 3 the result indicates that the conductivity based model can identify inflow and infiltration flows during medium rainfall events with ssos the validation results when the parameters of medium rainfall event were used to model conductivity and rdii of other medium rainfall events are shown in fig s3 the good fitting results show that the model and parameter set were applicable to predict rdii of medium rainfall events 3 4 rdii determination during a heavy rainfall event the proposed conductivity based model was also implemented during a heavy rainfall event this case demonstrated an extreme scenario when flow rate decreased abnormally after the rainfall fig 5 a this scenario was more complex fig s4 than the previous two scenarios the model simulation results based on the dynamic variations of conductivity are shown in fig 5 b the ns value between the observed and simulated conductivities was 0 59 table s1 indicating a good fit the ratio of rainfall entering into the sanitary system as rdi rrdi was 8 1 while the ratio of rainfall transferring into rii rrii was 3 5 the estimated rdi and rii flows are shown in fig 5 c the total volumes of rdi and rii were 11534 4 m3 and 4984 0 m3 giving a total rdii volume of 16518 4 m3 during the heavy rainfall event the integration of the difference between the observed and simulated flow data fig 5 d yielded an estimated sso volume of 39732 2 m3 during the rainfall event table 3 the results indicate that the conductivity model is suitable for estimating inflow and infiltration during extreme and abnormal flow scenarios associated with heavy rainfall events by contrast the flow based model is obviously not suitable the validation of large rainfall events are shown in fig s5 in addition the method was applied to larger scales from pump station to wwtp and acceptable results were obtained fig s6 in larger scale the method was still applicable according to the variation mode of conductivity 4 discussion 4 1 choice of timespan for determining dry weather flow and conductivity patterns for the proposed approach determining a proper time scale is important to represent the characteristics of dry weather flow and conductivity profiles normally the quantity and quality of domestic wastewater have two peaks in the morning and evening respectively with late night and mid day minima butler et al 1995 gernaey et al 2011 however distinct variations in quality and quantity are found in different sewer system catchments and significant seasonal variations are observed simple periodic functions with periodicities of one day such as low order fourier series have been proposed in previous studies to describe the diurnal variations in dry weather flows and pollutant concentrations rodr√≠guez et al 2013 generally dry weather period for the studied sewer normally lasts for 1 weeks between two rainfall events fig s7 the influence of the different time scales of dry weather flow should be evaluated the parameter distribution of dry weather eq 1 was conducted based on different timescales namely 1 2 3 and 7 days based on spectral analysis fig s8 the amplitudes initial phases and mean values of flow and conductivity at frequencies of 1 day to 4 day are shown in fig s9 the results indicate that variations in the given parameters decrease as the timescale increases moreover the predictions of dry weather flow and conductivity based on 7 days were more accurate than those based only on individual days 4 2 parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of a model is associated with three different sources namely the measured data uncertainty parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty saltelli et al 2008 the assumption of cascading linear reservoirs for inflow and infiltration processes will introduce uncertainty into the model the criteria for assessing simulation results should be determined based on the uncertainty analysis parameter sensitivity and uncertainty were analyzed using glue beven and binley 1992 the parameters were divided into accepted and rejected categories according to ns values higher or lower than a threshold value in this case the ns threshold was chosen as 0 5 for conductivity and 0 3 for flow to obtain a better fitted result the lower and upper bounds of the output range were obtained by resampling the parameters in the accepted sets the medium rainfall event was chosen to evaluate the model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity fig 6 shows the 90 confidence regions of the simulated conductivity and calculated rdii with the distribution of the six parameters in the wet weather model shown in fig s10 parameters rrdi and rrii exhibited approximately normal distributions nrdi and nrii exhibited skewed distributions and krdi and krii exhibited approximately uniform distributions two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test wang et al 2003 was used for the accepted and rejected parameter sets to evaluate the sensitivities of the parameters the test results are shown in table s3 global sensitivity can be sorted according to the s value of ks test results the findings show that nrdi and nrii had the highest sensitivity while krdi and krii showed the lowest sensitivity these characteristics indicate that nrdi and nrii should be paid more attention such as giving more reasonable prior distribution according to its physical meaning when calibrating parameters more intensive online monitoring data and higher data quality can also reduce the uncertainty and increase the sensitivity of the parameters 4 3 implication of the proposed method understanding inflow and infiltration is important for sewer operations inflow and infiltration can be used as potential indicators to evaluate sewer conditions such as possible cross connections and pipe leakage failures several infiltration models such as horton s method horton 1933 1945 green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 and the curve number method rossman 2015 embedded in swmm can be used to determine the total volume of rainwater that infiltrate into groundwater karpf and krebs 2011 assumed that the infiltration rate is a ratio of the difference between the groundwater level and the water level in pipes based on darcy s law and swmm adopted an unsaturated upper zone and a saturated lower zone to describe the amount of groundwater entering a sewer system however these methods are difficult to apply to our monitoring area because of the lack of detailed infrastructure data by contrast the model proposed in this study first successfully decomposes the dynamic profile of rdii separately based on the conductivity monitoring compared with these methods the proposed method use conductivity to evaluate the rdii process based on the instantaneous unit pollutograph this process is advantageous especially when backwater exists and the water level in the sewer system is high moreover conductivity monitoring is simpler and easier than measuring cod nh4 n or po4 3 p in the sewer system zhang et al 2018 5 conclusions a method for estimating inflow and infiltration flows in sewers was proposed and demonstrated using real life applications the method was based on conductivity data and an instantaneous unit pollutograph model the proposed method was successfully implemented to identify the dynamic inflow and infiltration flows associated with rainfall entering a sewer system the proposed method has distinct advantages over traditional flow based methods for estimating inflow and infiltration especially when the events produce backwater overflow and abnormal flow data in sewer systems the method uses very simple conductivity sensors thus the proposed approach can be

advanced wastewater management centre awmc the university of queensland st lucia queensland 4072 australia corresponding author this manuscript was handled by l charlet editor in chief with the assistance of jiin shuh jean associate editor graphical abstract quantifying rainfall derived inflow and infiltration rdii in a sanitary sewer is difficult when rdii and overflow occur simultaneously this study proposes a novel conductivity based method for estimating rdii the method separately decomposes rainfall derived inflow rdi and rainfall induced infiltration rii on the basis of conductivity data fast fourier transform was adopted to analyze variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather nonlinear curve fitting based on the least squares algorithm was used to optimize parameters in the proposed rdii model the method was successfully applied to real life case studies in which inflow and infiltration were successfully estimated for three typical rainfall events with total rainfall volumes of 6 25 mm light 28 15 mm medium and 178 mm heavy uncertainties of model parameters were estimated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method and were found to be acceptable compared with traditional flow based methods the proposed approach exhibits distinct advantages in estimating rdii and overflow particularly when the two processes happen simultaneously keywords conductivity inflow infiltration sanitary sewer overflow sewer system 1 introduction sewer systems transport municipal wastewater from cities to treatment facilities rainfall derived inflow and infiltration rdii can cause serious operational problems in sanitary sewer systems and downstream wastewater treatment plants these processes amplify pumping costs increase the wastewater load and dilute the wastewater additionally rdii increases the probability of sanitary sewer overflows ssos and risk of drainage pipe collapse vallabhaneni et al 2008 the inflow and infiltration volumes can reach more than 100 of the ordinary wastewater quantity and this characteristic directly decreases the pollutant removal efficiency ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 these phenomena seriously threaten infrastructure security and wastewater treatment plant wwtp operations thus monitoring and assessing the inflow and infiltration processes are crucial to solve the problems associated with the operation and management of sewer systems flow information can be readily used to assess inflow and infiltration into a sewerage system these processes are commonly analyzed based on the principle of balancing annual or daily flow rates for example the triangle method ranks all flow values daily mean values in ascending order to estimate inflow and infiltration weiss et al 2002 mingkai et al 2017 minimum nightly flow was also used to determine infiltration franz 2006 moreover several reformative methods have used filters to extract time series of total flow and determine the quantity of inflow and infiltration vaes et al 2005 these flow based methods do not accurately quantify when sewer overflow occurs as a result of rdii additionally water quality monitoring has been adopted to assess inflow and infiltration coupled with flow data traditional pollutant index such as chemical oxygen demand cod kracht and gujer 2005 bare≈° et al 2009 total nitrogen tn shelton et al 2011 and total phosphorus tp mattsson et al 2016 were used to assess inflow and infiltration tn and tp were found to be more reliable water quality parameters several stable intrinsic tracers have also been applied to assess rdii as alternative to normal water quality indicators naturally occurring stable isotopes of water 18o 16o kracht et al 2007 de b√©n√©dittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 houhou et al 2010 was successfully used to determine the source and the amount of rainwater or groundwater entering an drainage system these methods can provide accurate information regarding inflow and infiltration but they require intensive measurements online collection of such water quality data is difficult especially in large sewer systems complex models based on hydrological and hydraulic mechanisms have also been applied to simulate inflow and infiltration distributed hydrological models are generally used to describe surrounding hydrogeological processes and their interactions with the sewer network sewer flow is commonly assumed to be composed of sewage inflow and infiltration inflow and infiltration can be further separated into three different components as follows i groundwater infiltration gwi ii rain induced infiltration rii and iii direct storm water inflow which is also called rain derived inflow rdi bennett 1999 staufer et al 2012 hydrological models are commonly used to illustrate the transformation of precipitation into runoff at the subcatchment scale belhadj et al 1995 proposed a simple multiparameter conceptual model to simulate rii in a sewer system using hourly measurements of rainfall and flow rates gustafsson et al 1999 developed the mousenam model in which the fast runoff component from impervious surfaces and the slow runoff component caused by infiltration into the sewer system from the surrounding soil were both considered the run off routing rorb model is a similar model based on several tanks in series that can be used to distinguish various flow components laurenson et al 1990 karpf and krebs 2011 presented a method for quantifying inflow and infiltration based on a multimodel approach in the stormwater management model swmm and the sanitary sewer overflow analysis and planning toolbox rdii can be presented using the so called rtk method based on a synthetic unit hydrograph this method assumes that rdii occurs in a sewer in response to a specific precipitation volume over a given period based on the sewershed characteristics lai 2008 boukhemacha et al 2015 studied urban groundwater flow using a mathematical model with geospatial analysis mao et al 2016 proposed an approximate point source method for measuring soil infiltration and verified the method using three soil types in laboratory experiments however similar to flow based methods these hydrologic hydraulic methods are not suitable for flow situations where overflow and or backflow occur furthermore several statistical and probabilistic methods have been introduced to study the relationship between rdii and rainfall volume zhang 2005 proposed an autoregressive regression framework in which flow and rainfall data were considered to realize reliable estimation of rdii pate and rahman 2010 investigated the applicability of monte carlo simulation with the rorb model mikalson 2011 developed two conceptualizations to estimate rdii using a derived probability distribution theory however these complex statistical and probabilistic models require large computational runtimes and are difficult to implement in real time simulations based on online monitoring this study is performed to develop a simple and cost effective method to estimate inflow infiltration and sewer overflow in a sanitary sewer system based on conductivity data which are simple and easy to monitor the method facilitates the estimation of rdii as rii and rdi separately not only in normal flow conditions but also when rdii occurs simultaneously with overflow or backflow the proposed approach enables the quantification of overflow by regenerating flow data based on the estimated rdii 2 methods and materials 2 1 field trial and data preparation online wastewater flow and quality data were collected in a sewer system in wuxi city china fig s1 the catchment area of the monitoring site was approximately 0 8 km2 this network was mainly a separate sanitary sewer system with hidden cross connections the pipe diameter at the monitoring site was 600 mm and the dry weather flow varied between 40 m3 h and 120 m3 h the flow meter used in the system was a hach fl900av flow meter the depth was measured using a submerged pressure transducer in the flowmeter rainfall event was recorded by a sigma rain gauge tipping bucket with a hach fl900 series flow logger conductivity was measured using a water quality instrument product model ploc100 independent development that monitors the conductivity temperature oxidation reduction potential orp and ph data collection lasted for approximately one year all data flow water level conductivity and rainfall were collected at 10 min intervals the quality of the monitoring data was assessed using local regression smoothing hastie and loader 1993 to remove disturbances and outliers when rdii exceeded the conveyance capacity of the system the water level in the system increased and caused backwater or even overflow rainfall events could be grouped into three categories namely light medium or heavy light rainfall events were events that raised water level in the sewer system without backwater formation medium rainfall events were events that raised the water level and caused backwater to form i e the flow decreased but was still positive these phenomena indicated that the inflow and infiltration exceeded the capacity of the sewer and ssos occurred heavy rainfall events were events that raised the water level and caused backflow i e the flow at the monitoring site become negative three representative rainfall events are shown in table 1 2 2 variation in flow and conductivity in dry weather dry weather flow and its conductivity can be characterized using spectral analysis and fast fourier transform fft into components of sine functions as follows 1 y i 1 n a i sin 2 œÄ f i t œï i c where y is the flow rate or conductivity at the monitoring point and ai fi and œïi represent the amplitude frequency and phase of the ith sine function respectively c is the average value of the diurnal variation in the flow rate or conductivity the major frequencies f i were determined based on the high amplitudes a i generated by the fft 2 3 model of inflow and infiltration with instantaneous unit hydrograph in wet weather flow inflow and infiltration can be simulated as the final outflow of a series of cascaded linear reservoirs as derived in the supplementary information eqs s1 and s2 the outflow from the cascaded linear reservoirs is as follows nash 1957 2 u 0 t 1 k Œ≥ n t k n 1 e t k where u 0 t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph which represents the rdii flow as the result of unit instantaneous rainfall n is the number of linear reservoirs Œ≥ n is the gamma function of n and k is the storage coefficient of the linear reservoir supplementary information rainfall is always continuous rather than instantaneous thus the instantaneous unit hydrograph should be converted to a temporal unit hydrograph which is used to describe the rdii process produced by per unit rainfall in the record time span Œ¥ t which is 10 min in our study as follows 3 u Œ¥ t t 1 Œ¥ t 0 t u 0 œÑ d œÑ Œ¥ t t u 0 œÑ Œ¥ t d œÑ where Œ¥ t is the record time interval of rainfall u Œ¥ t t represents the outflow as the result of unit rainfall during the period of Œ¥ t parameter r was used to represent the fractions of rainfall volume that enter the sewer system as rdii the whole monitoring time can be divided into n parts by the record time interval and i is the ordinal number from 1 to n pi is the rainfall depth per unit time rainfall record time interval and the net rainfall entering into the sanitary sewer system could be presented as the product of r and pi in each unit time f is the sub catchment area upstream of the monitoring site by summing the u Œ¥ t t produced by each net rainfall the discharge of rdii can be expressed as follows 4 q t f i 1 n r p i u i Œ¥ t t rdi and rii were described using the same principle of cascading linear reservoirs to reduce the computational complexity for the inflow process rrdi krdi and nrdi were used to substitute for r k and n in eqs 2 and 4 moreover u Œ¥ t t in eq 3 and q t in eq 4 would be substituted by u rdi Œ¥ t t and qrdi t respectively similarly substituting rrii krii and nrii for r k and n u Œ¥ t t will be become u rii Œ¥ t t and q t will be qrii t rrdi and rrii represent the ratio of rainfall that enters the sewer system as rdi and rii respectively while krdi and krii represent the storage coefficients of rdi and rii respectively while nrdi and nrii represent the number of linear reservoirs of rdi and rii respectively then the wet weather flow qwwf t is the sum of the dry weather flow qdwf t from eq 1 rdi flow qrdi t and rii flow qrii t as shown by eq 5 as follows 5 q wwf t q dwf t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rdi i Œ¥ t t f i 1 n r rii p i u rii i Œ¥ t t 2 4 pollutant balance model in wet weather flow conductivity was chosen as the pollutant indicator in the model rdi and rii normally decrease the conductivity of domestic sewage as expressed in the material balance equation the components of wet weather conductivity can be combined as eq 6 as follows 6 c wwf t c dwf t q dwf t c rdi t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rdi i Œ¥ t t c rii t f i 1 n r rii p i u rii i Œ¥ t t q dwf t f i 1 n r rdi p i u rdi i Œ¥ t t f i 1 n r rii p i u rii i Œ¥ t t c wwf is the conductivity of the wet weather flow c dwf c rdi and c rii are the conductivities of dry weather flow rdi and rii respectively the conductivity of rdi and rii were monitored in a catch basin nearby 2 5 data analysis to determine rdii qdwf and cdwf can be described by eq 1 the parameters related to dry weather would be determined first by the dry weather flow and conductivity then six parameters rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi and nrii related to the wet weather were used in the model these six parameters were calibrated either by fitting the observed wet weather flow eq 5 or by fitting the wet weather conductivity eq 6 which will produce two parameter sets to be compared to crosscheck the model applicability in different rainfall scenarios moreover the parameter set calibrated by eq 6 can be substituted into eq 5 to calculate wet weather flow and vice versa the goodness of fit was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency coefficient eq s3 the above data analysis methodology is summarized in fig 1 nonlinear fitting method based on iterative reweighted least squares algorithm holland and welsch 1977 dumouchel and o brien 1991 was performed to optimize the parameters in the model the weights of each iteration were recalculated based on the residual of the observed data of the previous iteration this recalculation mitigated the influence of outliers iterations continued until the weights converged given that rdi represents the direct inflow of runoff rii represents infiltration in which rainwater enters into the system through soil inflow and infiltration can be separated because they have different flow rates in physics during fitting the constraints of parameters were determined as rrdi rrii krdi krii nrdi nrii to guarantee the flow rate difference the uncertainty of the model and 90 confidence interval of parameters were evaluated with generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 glue adopts the concept of equifinality of models parameters and variables this methodology consists of three steps jensen 2003 first the prior distribution which is typically discrete or continuous uniform distribution of the parameters was determined second is the stochastic simulation based on the parameters defined previously with monte carlo method to evaluate a random sample of the parameter sets third the simulation and the corresponding parameter sets were rated according to which they fit the observed data for every single simulation if the simulated results were close to the observed values the simulation and this parameter set were accepted as having a given likelihood ns value in our case otherwise this simulation and parameter set would be rejected these three steps were repeated until iterations reached the set point 5000 iterations in our case the cumulative distribution function cdf was calculated for all accepted parameters and the value corresponding to 5 and 95 of the cdf will be the 90 confidence interval of the parameters the model uncertainty was revealed through the cdf of the accepted simulation results 3 results 3 1 flow and conductivity variations during dry weather time series of dry weather flow rate and conductivity profiles were analyzed using spectral analysis and fft the dry weather data before the large rainfall event were analyzed as an example spectral analysis was used for all seven days of the dry weather flow to obtain an overall fitting two major frequencies were extracted from the flow and conductivity monitoring data fig 2 a d frequencies of 1 day and 2 day reflected periods of 1 day and 0 5 days and these values correspond to water usage habits with morning and evening peaks as shown by butler et al 1995 and gernaey et al 2011 the flow amplitude at a frequency of 1 day was 62 80 m3 h while the amplitude at 2 day was 37 69 m3 h fig 2 a and b table s1 thus the diurnal period was more notable than the semidiurnal period conductivity also exhibited similar periodic characteristics fig 2 c and d increasing the number of fourier series yielded higher ns values for example the ns values were 0 67 0 86 and 0 93 using second order fifth order and tenth order fourier series respectively the fifth order fourier series were adopted in our study because it can meet the requirement to regenerate the dry weather flow and conductivity tables s1 and s2 fig 2 a and c shows the fitting results of the flow and conductivity data respectively 3 2 rdii determination during a light rainfall event a small rainfall event was used to calibrate the model and estimate rdi and rii in fig 3 a the mean dry weather flow before the rainfall event was 44 m3 h while the maximum wet weather flow reached 131 4 m3 h during the rainfall event the model parameters were determined based on the observed flow data using eq 5 table 2 the results indicate that the fraction of rainfall volume converted to inflow was 22 7 rrdi and the fraction of rainfall volume converted to infiltration was 13 2 rrii therefore approximately 35 9 of the rainfall volume entered the sanitary sewerage pipes as rdii during inflow 6 8 cascade reservoirs were used and each had a storage coefficient of 5 2 during infiltration the soil was divided into 9 6 vertical cascade reservoirs and each reservoir had a storage coefficient of 6 8 the large value of n resulted in slower infiltration than the inflow process as expected the total rdi total rii and total rdii volumes were 1135 2 m3 660 7 m3 and 1795 9 m3 respectively table 3 conductivity simulation based on eq 6 is shown in fig 3 b and the parameter values are listed in table 2 the parameters calculated based on the conductivity and flow data were similar table 2 fig 3 c and d shows the rdi and rii flows determined based on flow and conductivity respectively the rdi and rii flows calculated based on the conductivity data exhibited good agreement with the result based on flow data figs 3 e and 2 f confirming the suitability of conductivity as a water quality parameter for determination of rdi and rii flows using the parameters determined by conductivity to predict rdii of other two light rainfall events the validation results are shown in fig s2 conductivity of the other two events were good fitted indicating the parameter set can be applied to assess rdii of small rainfall events 3 3 rdii determination during a medium rainfall event a medium rainfall event created ssos in this sanitary sewer system due to high water levels fig 4 a shows that the flow increased on the second day and decreased on the third day after this event however the water level remained high until the third day these phenomena indicated that some of the water was discharged as ssos in the sewer system model parameters were determined based on the flow data for the medium rainfall event to test the adaptability of flow based model the model parameters and 90 confidence interval are listed in table 2 the ns efficiency coefficient between the observed and simulated flow data was only 0 029 table 2 suggesting that the flow data were difficult to fit fig 4 b shows that the simulated flow was lower than the observed flow thus the flow based model does not produce a good prediction for the observed flow data in this scenario because of backwater moreover the calculated rdi and rii flows shown in fig 4 c are not reliable estimates of the true inflow and infiltration flows substituting the calculated rdi and rii flows into eq 6 shows the modeled conductivity profile fig 4 d the flow based model underestimated rdii but overestimated the conductivity the results indicate that the model based on the flow data cannot effectively estimate the inflow and infiltration process for this medium rainfall event when the conductivity data was used to estimate the rdi and rii flows for the medium rainfall event the observed and simulated conductivity data fig 4 e fit well with an ns efficiency coefficient of 0 54 table 2 the fractions of the rainfall volume entering into the sewer system as inflow and infiltration are 10 1 rrdi and 8 2 rrii respectively table 2 rrdi and rrii were less than those associated with the light rainfall event probably because rdii exceeded the capacity of the system the inflow and infiltration profiles are shown in fig 4 f infiltration is considerably slower than inflow rate the total rdii volume was approximately 4172 4 m3 with an rdi and rii volumes of 2302 8 m3 and 1869 6 m3 respectively the actual total wastewater flow was estimated based on the rdii flows and the dwf pattern fig 4 g significant difference was found between the simulated and observed flows mainly during the period with higher water levels fig 4 h the flow difference was likely caused by storage in upstream sewerage pipes and overflow discharged from sewerage pipes upstream of the monitoring location the amounts of overflow can be calculated by integrating the difference between the simulated and observed flows which produced a value of 1207 9 m3 for this event as a result of ssos table 3 the result indicates that the conductivity based model can identify inflow and infiltration flows during medium rainfall events with ssos the validation results when the parameters of medium rainfall event were used to model conductivity and rdii of other medium rainfall events are shown in fig s3 the good fitting results show that the model and parameter set were applicable to predict rdii of medium rainfall events 3 4 rdii determination during a heavy rainfall event the proposed conductivity based model was also implemented during a heavy rainfall event this case demonstrated an extreme scenario when flow rate decreased abnormally after the rainfall fig 5 a this scenario was more complex fig s4 than the previous two scenarios the model simulation results based on the dynamic variations of conductivity are shown in fig 5 b the ns value between the observed and simulated conductivities was 0 59 table s1 indicating a good fit the ratio of rainfall entering into the sanitary system as rdi rrdi was 8 1 while the ratio of rainfall transferring into rii rrii was 3 5 the estimated rdi and rii flows are shown in fig 5 c the total volumes of rdi and rii were 11534 4 m3 and 4984 0 m3 giving a total rdii volume of 16518 4 m3 during the heavy rainfall event the integration of the difference between the observed and simulated flow data fig 5 d yielded an estimated sso volume of 39732 2 m3 during the rainfall event table 3 the results indicate that the conductivity model is suitable for estimating inflow and infiltration during extreme and abnormal flow scenarios associated with heavy rainfall events by contrast the flow based model is obviously not suitable the validation of large rainfall events are shown in fig s5 in addition the method was applied to larger scales from pump station to wwtp and acceptable results were obtained fig s6 in larger scale the method was still applicable according to the variation mode of conductivity 4 discussion 4 1 choice of timespan for determining dry weather flow and conductivity patterns for the proposed approach determining a proper time scale is important to represent the characteristics of dry weather flow and conductivity profiles normally the quantity and quality of domestic wastewater have two peaks in the morning and evening respectively with late night and mid day minima butler et al 1995 gernaey et al 2011 however distinct variations in quality and quantity are found in different sewer system catchments and significant seasonal variations are observed simple periodic functions with periodicities of one day such as low order fourier series have been proposed in previous studies to describe the diurnal variations in dry weather flows and pollutant concentrations rodr√≠guez et al 2013 generally dry weather period for the studied sewer normally lasts for 1 weeks between two rainfall events fig s7 the influence of the different time scales of dry weather flow should be evaluated the parameter distribution of dry weather eq 1 was conducted based on different timescales namely 1 2 3 and 7 days based on spectral analysis fig s8 the amplitudes initial phases and mean values of flow and conductivity at frequencies of 1 day to 4 day are shown in fig s9 the results indicate that variations in the given parameters decrease as the timescale increases moreover the predictions of dry weather flow and conductivity based on 7 days were more accurate than those based only on individual days 4 2 parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty analysis the uncertainty of a model is associated with three different sources namely the measured data uncertainty parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty saltelli et al 2008 the assumption of cascading linear reservoirs for inflow and infiltration processes will introduce uncertainty into the model the criteria for assessing simulation results should be determined based on the uncertainty analysis parameter sensitivity and uncertainty were analyzed using glue beven and binley 1992 the parameters were divided into accepted and rejected categories according to ns values higher or lower than a threshold value in this case the ns threshold was chosen as 0 5 for conductivity and 0 3 for flow to obtain a better fitted result the lower and upper bounds of the output range were obtained by resampling the parameters in the accepted sets the medium rainfall event was chosen to evaluate the model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity fig 6 shows the 90 confidence regions of the simulated conductivity and calculated rdii with the distribution of the six parameters in the wet weather model shown in fig s10 parameters rrdi and rrii exhibited approximately normal distributions nrdi and nrii exhibited skewed distributions and krdi and krii exhibited approximately uniform distributions two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test wang et al 2003 was used for the accepted and rejected parameter sets to evaluate the sensitivities of the parameters the test results are shown in table s3 global sensitivity can be sorted according to the s value of ks test results the findings show that nrdi and nrii had the highest sensitivity while krdi and krii showed the lowest sensitivity these characteristics indicate that nrdi and nrii should be paid more attention such as giving more reasonable prior distribution according to its physical meaning when calibrating parameters more intensive online monitoring data and higher data quality can also reduce the uncertainty and increase the sensitivity of the parameters 4 3 implication of the proposed method understanding inflow and infiltration is important for sewer operations inflow and infiltration can be used as potential indicators to evaluate sewer conditions such as possible cross connections and pipe leakage failures several infiltration models such as horton s method horton 1933 1945 green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 and the curve number method rossman 2015 embedded in swmm can be used to determine the total volume of rainwater that infiltrate into groundwater karpf and krebs 2011 assumed that the infiltration rate is a ratio of the difference between the groundwater level and the water level in pipes based on darcy s law and swmm adopted an unsaturated upper zone and a saturated lower zone

7449,the yangtze river is one of the largest and most important rivers in the world over the past several decades the natural sediment regime of the yangtze river has been altered by the construction of dams this paper uses multi scale entropy analysis to ascertain the impacts of large dams on the complexity of high frequency suspended sediment dynamics in the yangtze river system especially after impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd in this study the complexity of sediment dynamics is quantified by framing it within the context of entropy analysis of time series data on daily sediment loads for four stations located in the mainstem are analyzed for the past 60 years the results indicate that dam construction has reduced the complexity of short term 1 30 days variation in sediment dynamics near the structures but that complexity has actually increased farther downstream this spatial pattern seems to reflect a filtering effect of the dams on the on the temporal pattern of sediment loads as well as decreased longitudinal connectivity of sediment transfer through the river system resulting in downstream enhancement of the influence of local sediment inputs by tributaries on sediment dynamics the tgd has had a substantial impact on the complexity of sediment series in the mainstem of the yangtze river especially after it became fully operational this enhanced impact is attributed to the high trapping efficiency of this dam and its associated large reservoir the sediment dynamics signal becomes more spatially variable after dam construction this study demonstrates the spatial influence of dams on the high frequency temporal complexity of sediment regimes and provides valuable information that can be used to guide environmental conservation of the yangtze river keywords sediment dynamics complexity property three gorges dam yangtze river 1 introduction rivers play a vital role in human society by providing water to support agriculture municipal needs power generation navigation and recreation to help meet human demands many rivers in the world are now regulated by dams the negative environmental effects of dams and reservoirs on river systems have been well documented these structures disrupt river continuity by altering flow regimes sediment fluxes and thermal characteristics yang et al 2002 nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 graf 2006 wang et al 2007 li et al 2011 yang et al 2014 2015 the impact on sediment fluxes can be especially pronounced because large dams impede the movement of transported material which becomes deposited in reservoirs in china the annual sediment loads of large dammed rivers such as the yangtze river and the yellow river have declined markedly due to human activities li et al 2011 walling 2006 wang et al 2007 altered sediment regimes induced by dam construction often result in changes in the geomorphology physical habitat and biodiversity of river channels downstream from dams rossi et al 2009 wang et al 2011 2012 the yangtze changjiang is the longest river in asia and one of the largest in the world a large number of dams have been built in the yangtze river basin in the last few decades most major and medium size dams have been constructed on the mainstem and tributaries in the upstream portion of the basin the largest dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd is located in the upper reaches of yangtze river since impoundment of water began in 2003 the three gorges dam and its associated reservoir which has a storage capacity 3 93 1010 m3 have dramatically altered sediment fluxes in the middle and lower reaches of the river dai and liu 2013 ten years after the dam became operational the sediment flux declined dramatically but now appears to be stabilizing at a new long term average dai and liu 2013 considerable attention has been focused on how reductions in sediment load have affected the sedimentology and geomorphology of the river channel and floodplain chen et al 2010 the stability of sediment rating curves hu et al 2011 and patterns of sedimentation and erosion within the river yuan et al 2012 2014 constructions of dams along with soil conservation measures and bank protection have reduced the flux of sediment from the yangtze river to the east china sea dai et al 2016 many studies have examined the consequences of dam construction along the yangtze river on seasonal or annual variations in sediment loads yang et al 2006a zhang et al 2009 2012 li et al 2011 luo et al 2012 dai and lu 2014 yang and yang 2015 yang et al 2007 2015 but no investigation to date has examined how dams have influenced high frequency suspended sediment dynamics over time scales of days to weeks rivers can be viewed as complex nonlinear dynamic systems the nonlinear dynamics of these systems result in deterministic uncertainty of characteristics of river hydrology including temporal variations in flow or sediment concentration sediment dynamics refers to the temporal variability in the transport of sediment within river systems entropy provides a measure of the complexity of dynamical systems where complexity is associated with the degree of uncertainty i e disorderliness randomness or irregularity of temporal signals generated by system dynamics a highly irregular signal like white noise will have high entropy whereas a highly regular signal like a sine wave will have low entropy li and zhang 2008 sang et al 2015 traditional entropy theory has been widely used in hydrological analysis mays et al 2002 maruyama et al 2005 ozkul et al 2000 wang et al 2004 liu et al 2016 traditional methods yield entropy measures at a single time scale rather than characterizing the underlying dynamics of the system over multiple time scales multi scale entropy analysis of biological phenomena costa et al 2002 has been used to evaluate system complexity at multiple scales subsequently hydrologists have used multi scale methods to examine the complexity of time series of discharge including the influence of dam construction on hydrological complexity li and zhang 2008 zhou et al 2012 these developments suggest that multi scale entropy analysis is a useful tool for examining the complexity of sediment dynamics in river systems particularly systems that have been altered by the construction of dams such as the yangtze river system this study uses multi scale entropy analysis to examine how the construction of dams within the yangtze river basin has affected the complexity of sediment dynamics of this river system the objectives of the paper are 1 to determine the multi scale entropy of daily sediment load time series prior to and after the construction of dams and 2 to assess how dams influence the complexity of sediment along the river especially after the tgd started impounding water changes in multi scale entropy provide insight into how dam construction has altered the complexity and therefore uncertainty of fluvial sediment dynamics 2 conceptual and methodological framework 2 1 conceptual framework sediment dynamics refers to the temporal variability in the transport of sediment load within river systems temporal variation in sediment loads over time provides information on sediment dynamics the complexity of sediment dynamics within a river system is determined by interaction among sediment availability hydrological variability and other factors such as human modification of watershed processes that influence temporal variation in sediment transport the problem of human impact on high frequency components of temporal variation in sediment load through the construction of large dams the focus of this study can be conceptualized as a filtering process fig 1 large dams by trapping and storing sediment transported by the river nilsson et al 2005 should fundamentally alter the sediment signal not only by reducing the amount of sediment but also by changing temporal variation in the signal in particular the trapping and storage effect of dams should act like a low pass filter that smooths the signal thereby reducing the irregularity or complexity of high frequency components of the signal compared to conditions prior to dam construction large scale seasonal or interannual variations of the signal associated with watershed scale changes in sediment delivery remain distinct but short term daily to weekly variations become muted this filtering effect should be most pronounced immediately downstream of the dams farther downstream as distance from the dam increases local relative contributions of sediment to the main stem from tributaries will increase thereby progressively increasing the high frequency complexity of the sediment signal relative to the characteristics of the signal immediately downstream of the dam therefore complexity should increase with increasing distance from a dam the extent to which complexity increases depends on the nature of sediment contributions from tributaries downstream of the dam if the high frequency complexity of these contributions exceeds that of upstream contributions that are now filtered by the dam irregularity of the sediment signal following dam construction at river locations far from the dam may actually be greater than the irregularity of this signal prior to dam construction the result would be an increase in signal complexity relative to predam conditions 2 2 methodological framework entropy theory and analysis entropy theory and analysis provides a tool for exploring the impact of dams on the high frequency complexity of sediment dynamics in river systems measures of entropy characterize the complexity of a signal or time series with large entropy values corresponding to high degrees of complexity complexity consists of deterministic and stochastic components associated with the idea of meaningful structural richness whereby highly irregular signals actually consist of nonrandom fluctuations that represent the outcomes of multifarious interacting processes within the system of interest costa et al 2005 by contrast random signals white noise have high measures of entropy but do not contain meaningful structural richness produced by underlying mechanisms governing the dynamics of the system given that random signals and intricate nonrandom signals can both exhibit substantial complexity the relation between entropy measures and complexity in the sense of meaningful structural richness is not always straightforward costa et al 2005 complexity is also associated with irregularity highly irregular signals generally are less predictable than highly regular signals the existence of regular repetitive patterns of data values in a time series renders it more predicable than a time series that does not consist of such patterns approximate entropy apen pincus 1991 provides a set of measures of system complexity for nonlinear time series however apen is heavily dependent on the record length and lacks relative consistency that is if apen of a data set is higher than that of another it should but may not remain higher if record length is changed to overcome the shortcomings of approximate entropy metrics richman and moorman 2000 developed a new family of statistics for measuring complexity called sample entropy sampen sampen can be calculated in several steps li et al 2006 huang et al 2011 richman and moorman 2000 1 for a time series of n points u j 1 j n forms the n m 1 vectors x m i for i 1 i n m 1 where x m i u i k 1 k m 1 is the vector of m data points from u i to u i m 1 the distance between two such vectors is defined as 1 d x i x j max u i k u j k 0 k m 1 2 take n i m as the number of sequences in the time series that match without self matching the template or run of compared data with the length m within the tolerance criterion r based on this value the functions c i m r and c m r are defined as 2 c i m r n i m n m 1 3 c m r i 1 n m 1 c i m r n m 1 where i 1 2 n m 1 3 change the dimension of the vector x i to m 1 and repeat steps 1 3 to yield c m 1 r the sampen is defined as 4 sampen m r n ln c m 1 r c m r sampen m r n estimates the entropy of a time series dataset consisting of n data points by computing the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that a given short sequence of data or template is repeated during the time series tochigi et al 2012 it is a conditional probability measure that quantifies the likelihood that sequences of m consecutive data points of the same length that match one another within a tolerance of r remain similar when the length of the sequences is increased by one sample sequences of length m 1 humeau heurtier 2015 although sampen can be used to analyze complexity for a single timescale it does not yield information on complexity over multiple timescales costa et al 2002 introduced a multi scale entropy analysis derived from approximate entropy and sample entropy to address this limitation multi scale entropy used in the present paper to analyze complexity of suspended sediment time series is computed as follows 1 construct a coarse grained times series q œÑ determined by the scale factor œÑ from the original times series as 5 q j œÑ 1 œÑ i j 1 œÑ 1 j œÑ q i 1 j n œÑ where œÑ is the scale factor i e the number of time intervals for œÑ 1 the coarse grained time series q j œÑ is identical to the original time series for œÑ 1 each coarse grained time series contains n œÑ elements i e the length of the original time series divided by the scale factor 2 compute the sampen for all scale factors œÑ according to costa et al 2002 2005 the optimal value of m is 2 the parameter r is set at a certain percentages usually 15 of the original time series sd and remains constant for all scales in sampen algorithm costa et al 2002 2005 hence in this study values for the template length m and the matching criterion r for the sampen analyses are set at 2 and 0 15 respectively 2 3 range index a range index quantitatively evaluates the degree to which the complexity of the sediment time series has changed between two different time intervals in this case intervals before and after dam construction the change in entropy expressed as a percentage is 6 sampen post sampen pre sampen pre 100 where sampenpre is the sampen value during the pre dam period sampenpost is the sampen value during the post dam period a positive deviation indicates that complexity has increased as a result of dam construction whereas a negative value indicates that complexity has decreased 3 study site and data the yangtze river is 6 300 km long and has a drainage area of 1 808 500 km2 accounting for nearly 20 of the total area of china it is the largest and longest river in china and the third largest in annual runoff and the fourth largest in sediment load in the world li et al 2011 eisma 1998 according to incomplete statistics small reservoirs are not considered 47 842 dams and reservoirs have been built in the yangtze river basin for flood control navigation and hydropower generation jiang 2011 this study focuses on the impacts of large dams with storage capacity 108 m3 table 1 fig 2 all of these dams have been constructed since 1974 and the vast majority have been built since 1980 table 1 of the nineteen large dams on tributaries of the yangtze river upstream of the tgd the oldest was built in 1977 and sixteen dams have become operational since 1981 table 1 fig 2 the tgd was first put into use in 2003 and became fully operational in 2009 the gezhouba dam gd a run of river structure downstream of the tgd with a reservoir storage capacity of 1 58 109 m3 began to impound water in 1981 the daily time series of flow discharge m3 s and suspended sediment concentration kg m3 from 1954 to 2013 at cuntan data of 1969 missing yichang hankou and datong hydrological stations were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc china sediment loads are calculated from measured discharge and sediment concentrations at these stations fig 3 the analysis methods for suspended sediment at the station

measuring from water surface the homogeneity and reliability of these data have been strictly checked by cwrc cuntan station is the inflow control point of the upper yangtze river into the tgd and was selected as a reference station to investigate the impacts of the tgd on the sediment regime of the middle and lower reaches li et al 2011 yichang station is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river about 38 km downstream from the tgd hankou station is located on the middle reach of the yangtze river between dongting and poyang lakes and datong station is located on the lower reach of the yangtze river between poyang lake and the east china sea fig 2 to evaluate the influence of dam construction on the scaling and complexity properties of the sediment load time series data for these stations the data series were divided into four intervals according to construction of dams table 2 fig 3 changes in daily sediment loads along the yangtze river over time provide the context for the analysis of the impact of dams on high frequency sediment dynamics using multi scale entropy of sediment time series analysis focuses on four time periods 1954 to 1978 the period prior to the construction of most large dams with the yangtze river basin period 1 1979 to 2002 the period of major dam construction within the basin period 2 2003 to 2009 the period when the tgd became partially operational period 3 and 2009 2013 the period after the tgd was fully operational period 4 4 results 4 1 changes in sediment load in the yangtze river time series of sediment loads for the four stations along the yangtze river show that these loads declined somewhat at all four locations over the first two periods table 3 and fig 3 the mean sediment load at cuntan yichang hankou and datong decreased by 8 7 11 8 15 1 and 19 4 respectively the data indicate that major dam construction on tributaries and the construction of the gezhouba dam reduced sediment loads on yangtze river with the most pronounced influence at locations farthest downstream the most dramatic change in mean daily sediment loads at all stations occurred from period 2 to period 3 when the tgd began partial operation at cuntan sediment loads decreased by about 55 compared to pre dam conditions this large change cannot be attributed to the tgd which is located downstream but instead reflects the trapping of sediment by dams constructed on tributaries in the headwaters this construction initiated a progressive decline in sediment load throughout period 2 that fluctuated around a new low level during period 3 immediately downstream of the three gorges and gezhouba dams yichang load declined by 88 compared to predam levels indicating that these mainstem structures exacerbated the effect of tributary dams upstream farther downstream loads decreased by 71 at hankou and 67 at datong after tgd became fully operational during period 4 the mean daily sediment load at cuntan decreased by an additional 18 compared to period 3 probably due to the completion of five dams in the upstream tributaries after 2003 further declines in mean daily sediment load occurred between periods 3 and 4 at all three stations downstream of the tgd overall loads have decreased by 94 yichang 77 hankou and 73 datong relative to the predam period period 1 the annual sediment loads at cuntan yichang hankou and datong stations exhibit similar patterns of variation over time fig 4 increases in load upstream are mirrored by increases in load downstream thus at annual timescales dynamics of variation in sediment load remain synchronized at the basin scale despite the construction of dams whereas prior to dam construction period 1 annual loads at cuntan generally were less than loads at yichang and often less than or similar to loads at hankou and datong loads at cuntan are now consistently higher than those at stations downstream of the tgd fig 4 the annual sediment loads at all four stations show a noticeable decrease around the year 2000 confirming that reductions in sediment load downstream of the tgd at least in part reflect reductions in sediment load upstream of this dam 4 2 entropy analysis of the sediment series for period 1 multi scale entropy analysis for the period prior to the construction of large dams indicates that values of the sample entropy and therefore the degree of complexity of the sediment series at cuntan station are less than value of sample entropy at yichang station hankou station and datong station over all time scales 1 to 30 days fig 5 a cuntan and yichang stations exhibit the same rate of increase in complexity over time scale but yichang entropy values are consistently greater than those for cuntan indicating that the sediment signal for yichang is more irregular than the signal for cuntan over all time scales hankou and datong exhibit nearly identical entropy values over all timescales and these values are much greater than those for cuntan and yichang values of sample entropy at hankou and datong also increase at a faster rate with increasing timescale compared to entropy values for the other two stations thus signal complexity is not only greater for hankou and datong than for cuntan and yichang but the complexity also increases over timescale to a greater extent at hankou and datong than at cuntan and yichang the hankou station is located a little over one kilometer downstream of the confluence of the yangtze river and hanjiang river fig 2 the hanjiang river the largest tributary of the yangtze river drains a large mountainous watershed and has a steep slope the introduction of variable amounts of sediment from this tributary to the yangtze river may contribute to the increase in complexity of the sediment time series at the two stations hankou and datong downstream from the confluence 4 3 changes in entropy for period 2 the initiation of dam construction throughout the yangtze basin during period 2 does not greatly alter the complexity of the sediment series at cuntan station figs 5b 6 and 7 the mean percentage change in sample entropy between periods 1 and 2 is only 2 table 4 on the other hand values of sampen systematically decrease over time scales of 1 to 30 days for the sediment series at yichang station figs 5b 6 b and 7 the average percentage decrease in sampen over all time scales is 18 9 table 4 the lack of major change in complexity at cuntan combined with the decrease in complexity at yichang suggests that the construction of the gezhouba dam on the yangtze river was largely responsible for the change in complexity at yichang the results indicate that the sediment time series after dam construction became substantially less complex immediately downstream from the gezhouba dam presumably because this dam and its associated reservoir acted as a filter to reduce irregularities in the sediment series signal downstream at the hankou and datong stations sample entropy is still much greater than at the two upstream stations but the separation between values of sampen for hankou and datong have increased compared to period 1 values of sampen at datong now are greater than those at hankou especially for large timescales œÑ 10 overall sampen increases downstream over all timescales during this period the average value of sampen for all timescales at hankou decreased between periods 1 and 2 by 14 4 table 4 this decrease may indicate that construction of the gezhouba dam reduced the complexity of sediment dynamics in the middle reaches of the yangtze river but to a lesser extent than the change at yichang apparently the filtering effect of the gezouhba dam diminished over distance downstream at datong the average value of sampen actually increases slightly 10 0 between periods 1 and 2 suggesting that no filtering effect of the dam on the dynamics of sediment occurred in the lower yangtze river 4 4 changes in entropy in periods 3 and 4 between periods 2 and 3 the entropy of the sediment load time series at cuntan station changes only slightly despite the large decrease in total sediment load during this period table 3 the mean percentage decrease in sample entropy is 7 0 indicating a slight reduction in complexity but overall the dynamics of the sediment system at this location do not appear to be fundamentally altered between periods 3 and 4 the sample entropy at cuntan actually increases by an average of 16 compared to the predam period this change combined with the lack of change at this station in the previous two periods seems to indicate that sediment dynamics within the part of the watershed influenced only by tributary dams act largely independently of these dams even though the overall amount of sediment within the river system has dramatically decreased at the yichang station the sample entropy of the sediment load time series decreased substantially over different timescales following construction of the tgd figs 5c 6b and 8 values of sampen in period 3 are about 2 3 times less than those for the pre dam period the magnitude of reduction increases with increasing time scale percentage changes in sampen range from 23 9 to 69 1 with an average of 42 6 table 4 after tgd was put into full operation in 2009 at the beginning of period 4 the decrease in entropy is sustained with an average of reduction of sample entropy of 51 0 table 4 assuming that most of this effect is the result of the tgd and not of other dams constructed upstream in periods 3 and 4 an assumption supported by the lack of dramatic change in sediment dynamics at cuntan station these results indicate that the construction of the tgd greatly simplified the sediment dynamics at yichang station in particular it enhanced the effect initiated by the construction of the gezhouba dam during period 2 somewhat surprisingly the tgd which is much larger than the gd and has a reservoir with much greater storage capacity than the reservoir of the gd only produced changes in complexity of the sediment time series period 2 4 commensurate with that of the gd constructed upstream between periods 1 and 2 nevertheless it is clear that the two dams together have strongly filtered the high frequency components of the sediment signal at yichang by reducing the irregularity of these components the large reduction of sampen at this location results in a change in the downstream pattern of complexity of the sediment load signal along the yangtze river with values of sampen below the dam becoming lowest immediately below the dams on the mainstem yiachang and higher values of sampen occurring above the dams cuntan and far downstream below the dams hankou and datong fig 5c and d comparing periods 2 and 3 the sediment load data for hankou station exhibit both increases and decreases in complexity at different timescales with an average percentage change in complexity of 5 2 figs 5d 6c 8 and table 4 by comparison the datong station exhibits consistent increases in entropy across the entire range of timescales with a mean percentage increase in sample entropy of 35 figs 5d and 8 table 4 between periods 3 and 4 when the tgd became fully operational complexity of the sediment signals at the two stations increases greatly figs 5c and d 6c and d and fig 9 with an average percentage of entropy increase compared to predam conditions of 64 4 at hankou and 68 1 at datong table 4 5 discussion the results of this study show that the sediment load at the cuntan station of the yangtze river decreased as large dams were constructed in tributaries to the river upstream from this location water and soil conservation strategies have been introduced throughout the yangtze river basin since the 1990 s after a major flood in 1998 these strategies were implemented on a large scale especially in headwater tributary basins leading to a decrease in the total area of eroded soils from 0 62 million km2 in the 1980s to 0 53 million km2 in 2008 dai et al 2016 these actions also contribute to reductions in sediment load at cuntan despite reductions in load sample entropy values have not changed dramatically at this location fig 6a the lack of change in sediment dynamics probably reflects the fact that all large dams upstream of cuntan were constructed in tributaries far removed from the sampling location along the main river thus these structures do not strongly influence the dynamics of the sediment regime the recent increase in sample entropy values may reflect the effects of conservation practices which may be increasing the complexity of sediment dynamics the degree of alteration in the sample entropy of the sediment load signals for the yichang hankou and datong stations indicates that dam construction has had varying influences on the complexity of sediment dynamics of the yangtze river over space and over time clearly the trapping of sediment within the reservoir of the large dams especially the three gorges dam have altered the sediment dynamics of the yangtze river resulting in changes in the complexity of the time series of sediment loads over a range of timescales the effect has been greatest at the yichang station only 6 km downstream of the gezhouba dam 24 in fig 1 and table 1 where complexity has decreased dramatically this decrease in complexity is consistent with the conceptual model fig 1 postulating that the gezhouba dam and three gorges dam have acted as filters that through sediment storage effects reduce the irregularity of the sediment load signal immediately downstream of these structures complexity has diminished in the sense that values of sediment load are now more uniform over timescales of 1 30 days than these values were prior to dam construction at hankou station in the middle reach of the yangtze river the effects have been mixed with the effects varying with different time periods and over different timescales between time periods overall however full operation of the tgd appears to have resulted in a marked increase in the complexity of the sediment time series at hankou at the datong station on the lower reaches of the river the effect of upstream dam construction is clear since the construction of the gezhouba and three gorges dams the complexity of the sediment signal has increased substantially with the greatest increase in complexity occurring after the construction of the tgd these findings show that the effect of dam construction along the yangtze river on sediment dynamics has been spatially variable above the tgd and gd the rather remote large tributary dams have had a relatively minor effect on the dynamics of sediment in the river even though these structures have contributed to reduced sediment loads in other words these dams do not act as strong filters on the sediment signals immediately downstream of the tgd and gd the strong regulation of sediment fluxes by the dams has increased the regularity of sediment loads over time while substantially decreasing the total amount of sediment within the river farther downstream however the effect of the dams on sediment dynamics has been to increase the complexity of these dynamics differences in the locations of large dams the trapping efficiency of these dams and the intervening drainage areas between sediment measurement stations provide a possible explanation for spatial patterns of complexity of sediment dynamics along the yangtze river this study and previous work zhang et al 2006 2009 2012 li et al 2011 has shown that the tgd has altered sediment loads on the yangtze river to a much greater extent than the gd by trapping large amounts of sediment in its reservoir moreover the difference in drainage area between yichang and hankou is 482 000 km2 including the hanjiang river and dongting lake table 1 whereas the difference in drainage area between hankou and datong is 217 000 km2 including poyang lake since the construction of the tgd other factors such as local contributions of sediment by tributaries and the influence of lakes are apparently playing a more important role in sediment dynamics than occurred prior to the construction of this dam leading to increases in the complexity of sediment dynamics at the hankou and datong stations after 2003 this increase in complexity seems to indicate that the tgd has made the sediment signal more sensitive to these other factors by reducing the influence of upstream to downstream transport within the mainstem of the river on sediment dynamics especially after the tgd was put into full operation this decrease in longitudinal continuity of sediment transport along with an increase in the relative importance of local factors on sediment transport may account for the increase in complexity of sediment dynamics within the middle and downstream portions of the yangtze river following the construction of the tgd thus in relation to the conceptual model fig 1 the construction of large dams may result in increased complexity of sediment load signals by disrupting downstream movement of sediment and by accentuating the influence on sediment dynamics of local tributary sources of sediment downstream of the dams this study has also shown that multi scale entropy analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the alteration of sediment dynamics by dam construction in river systems entropy analysis clearly revealed that regulation of the yangtze river has decreased the complexity of sediment dynamics near large dams on the mainstem but has increased complexity of these dynamics far from the dams few if any other studies have used multi scale entropy analysis to examine sediment dynamics in river systems the findings in the present study contrast somewhat with those of zhou et al 2012 who used multiscale entropy analysis to show that the construction of water reservoirs generally increased the complexity of discharge time series of rivers in china with the effect of the dams on complexity diminishing as distance from the structures increases compared to dam construction multi scale entropy analysis has shown that changes in land use and soil conservation practices since the 1940s have led to a loss of complexity in river flow within the mississippi river li and zhang 2008 results presented here for the cuntan station suggest that soil conservation practice may contribute to increased complexity of sediment dynamics given that river systems globally have been intensively influenced by human activities multiscale entropy analysis provides a useful tool for assessing how such activities have changed the dynamic complexity of these systems it is well known that dams reduce sediment loads but the impact of dams on the variability of sediment systems is poorly understood this study provides insight into how dams have influenced the sediment dynamics in yangtze river and provides a quantitative method for evaluating human influence on sediment dynamics in other rivers a number of large dams e g xiluodu dam with a reservoir storage capacity of 6 46 109 m3 baihetan dam with a reservoir storage capacity of 2 06 1010 m3 are planned or under construction in the upper portion of the yangtze river basin above the tgd the combined influences of these dams could change sediment dynamics not only in the upper river but enhance variation of sediment dynamics downstream effects of these big dams need to be assessed when investigating sediment load alterations in the watershed scale in future research 6 conclusions large dams along the yangtze river have decreased the complexity of the high frequency component of sediment dynamics immediately downstream of the dams thus the dams appear to act as a low pass filter on downstream transport of sediment thereby enhancing the uniformity of the sediment signal at high frequencies the three gorges dam which is capable of trapping far more sediment than the other dams completely disrupted transport along the river resulting not only in major decreased in sediment load but a spatially variable effect downstream discontinuity of upstream to downstream sediment transport along the river along with the enhanced influence of local factors such as additions of sediment by tributaries and the effects of river connected lakes on sediment movement probably account for the increase in complexity of sediment dynamics far from the dams on the middle and lower yangtze river the construction of large dams on major tributaries appears to have less influence on the complexity of sediment dynamics on the mainstem than does the construction of large dams along the river itself acknowledgements this project was supported by the national natural

7449,the yangtze river is one of the largest and most important rivers in the world over the past several decades the natural sediment regime of the yangtze river has been altered by the construction of dams this paper uses multi scale entropy analysis to ascertain the impacts of large dams on the complexity of high frequency suspended sediment dynamics in the yangtze river system especially after impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd in this study the complexity of sediment dynamics is quantified by framing it within the context of entropy analysis of time series data on daily sediment loads for four stations located in the mainstem are analyzed for the past 60 years the results indicate that dam construction has reduced the complexity of short term 1 30 days variation in sediment dynamics near the structures but that complexity has actually increased farther downstream this spatial pattern seems to reflect a filtering effect of the dams on the on the temporal pattern of sediment loads as well as decreased longitudinal connectivity of sediment transfer through the river system resulting in downstream enhancement of the influence of local sediment inputs by tributaries on sediment dynamics the tgd has had a substantial impact on the complexity of sediment series in the mainstem of the yangtze river especially after it became fully operational this enhanced impact is attributed to the high trapping efficiency of this dam and its associated large reservoir the sediment dynamics signal becomes more spatially variable after dam construction this study demonstrates the spatial influence of dams on the high frequency temporal complexity of sediment regimes and provides valuable information that can be used to guide environmental conservation of the yangtze river keywords sediment dynamics complexity property three gorges dam yangtze river 1 introduction rivers play a vital role in human society by providing water to support agriculture municipal needs power generation navigation and recreation to help meet human demands many rivers in the world are now regulated by dams the negative environmental effects of dams and reservoirs on river systems have been well documented these structures disrupt river continuity by altering flow regimes sediment fluxes and thermal characteristics yang et al 2002 nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 graf 2006 wang et al 2007 li et al 2011 yang et al 2014 2015 the impact on sediment fluxes can be especially pronounced because large dams impede the movement of transported material which becomes deposited in reservoirs in china the annual sediment loads of large dammed rivers such as the yangtze river and the yellow river have declined markedly due to human activities li et al 2011 walling 2006 wang et al 2007 altered sediment regimes induced by dam construction often result in changes in the geomorphology physical habitat and biodiversity of river channels downstream from dams rossi et al 2009 wang et al 2011 2012 the yangtze changjiang is the longest river in asia and one of the largest in the world a large number of dams have been built in the yangtze river basin in the last few decades most major and medium size dams have been constructed on the mainstem and tributaries in the upstream portion of the basin the largest dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd is located in the upper reaches of yangtze river since impoundment of water began in 2003 the three gorges dam and its associated reservoir which has a storage capacity 3 93 1010 m3 have dramatically altered sediment fluxes in the middle and lower reaches of the river dai and liu 2013 ten years after the dam became operational the sediment flux declined dramatically but now appears to be stabilizing at a new long term average dai and liu 2013 considerable attention has been focused on how reductions in sediment load have affected the sedimentology and geomorphology of the river channel and floodplain chen et al 2010 the stability of sediment rating curves hu et al 2011 and patterns of sedimentation and erosion within the river yuan et al 2012 2014 constructions of dams along with soil conservation measures and bank protection have reduced the flux of sediment from the yangtze river to the east china sea dai et al 2016 many studies have examined the consequences of dam construction along the yangtze river on seasonal or annual variations in sediment loads yang et al 2006a zhang et al 2009 2012 li et al 2011 luo et al 2012 dai and lu 2014 yang and yang 2015 yang et al 2007 2015 but no investigation to date has examined how dams have influenced high frequency suspended sediment dynamics over time scales of days to weeks rivers can be viewed as complex nonlinear dynamic systems the nonlinear dynamics of these systems result in deterministic uncertainty of characteristics of river hydrology including temporal variations in flow or sediment concentration sediment dynamics refers to the temporal variability in the transport of sediment within river systems entropy provides a measure of the complexity of dynamical systems where complexity is associated with the degree of uncertainty i e disorderliness randomness or irregularity of temporal signals generated by system dynamics a highly irregular signal like white noise will have high entropy whereas a highly regular signal like a sine wave will have low entropy li and zhang 2008 sang et al 2015 traditional entropy theory has been widely used in hydrological analysis mays et al 2002 maruyama et al 2005 ozkul et al 2000 wang et al 2004 liu et al 2016 traditional methods yield entropy measures at a single time scale rather than characterizing the underlying dynamics of the system over multiple time scales multi scale entropy analysis of biological phenomena costa et al 2002 has been used to evaluate system complexity at multiple scales subsequently hydrologists have used multi scale methods to examine the complexity of time series of discharge including the influence of dam construction on hydrological complexity li and zhang 2008 zhou et al 2012 these developments suggest that multi scale entropy analysis is a useful tool for examining the complexity of sediment dynamics in river systems particularly systems that have been altered by the construction of dams such as the yangtze river system this study uses multi scale entropy analysis to examine how the construction of dams within the yangtze river basin has affected the complexity of sediment dynamics of this river system the objectives of the paper are 1 to determine the multi scale entropy of daily sediment load time series prior to and after the construction of dams and 2 to assess how dams influence the complexity of sediment along the river especially after the tgd started impounding water changes in multi scale entropy provide insight into how dam construction has altered the complexity and therefore uncertainty of fluvial sediment dynamics 2 conceptual and methodological framework 2 1 conceptual framework sediment dynamics refers to the temporal variability in the transport of sediment load within river systems temporal variation in sediment loads over time provides information on sediment dynamics the complexity of sediment dynamics within a river system is determined by interaction among sediment availability hydrological variability and other factors such as human modification of watershed processes that influence temporal variation in sediment transport the problem of human impact on high frequency components of temporal variation in sediment load through the construction of large dams the focus of this study can be conceptualized as a filtering process fig 1 large dams by trapping and storing sediment transported by the river nilsson et al 2005 should fundamentally alter the sediment signal not only by reducing the amount of sediment but also by changing temporal variation in the signal in particular the trapping and storage effect of dams should act like a low pass filter that smooths the signal thereby reducing the irregularity or complexity of high frequency components of the signal compared to conditions prior to dam construction large scale seasonal or interannual variations of the signal associated with watershed scale changes in sediment delivery remain distinct but short term daily to weekly variations become muted this filtering effect should be most pronounced immediately downstream of the dams farther downstream as distance from the dam increases local relative contributions of sediment to the main stem from tributaries will increase thereby progressively increasing the high frequency complexity of the sediment signal relative to the characteristics of the signal immediately downstream of the dam therefore complexity should increase with increasing distance from a dam the extent to which complexity increases depends on the nature of sediment contributions from tributaries downstream of the dam if the high frequency complexity of these contributions exceeds that of upstream contributions that are now filtered by the dam irregularity of the sediment signal following dam construction at river locations far from the dam may actually be greater than the irregularity of this signal prior to dam construction the result would be an increase in signal complexity relative to predam conditions 2 2 methodological framework entropy theory and analysis entropy theory and analysis provides a tool for exploring the impact of dams on the high frequency complexity of sediment dynamics in river systems measures of entropy characterize the complexity of a signal or time series with large entropy values corresponding to high degrees of complexity complexity consists of deterministic and stochastic components associated with the idea of meaningful structural richness whereby highly irregular signals actually consist of nonrandom fluctuations that represent the outcomes of multifarious interacting processes within the system of interest costa et al 2005 by contrast random signals white noise have high measures of entropy but do not contain meaningful structural richness produced by underlying mechanisms governing the dynamics of the system given that random signals and intricate nonrandom signals can both exhibit substantial complexity the relation between entropy measures and complexity in the sense of meaningful structural richness is not always straightforward costa et al 2005 complexity is also associated with irregularity highly irregular signals generally are less predictable than highly regular signals the existence of regular repetitive patterns of data values in a time series renders it more predicable than a time series that does not consist of such patterns approximate entropy apen pincus 1991 provides a set of measures of system complexity for nonlinear time series however apen is heavily dependent on the record length and lacks relative consistency that is if apen of a data set is higher than that of another it should but may not remain higher if record length is changed to overcome the shortcomings of approximate entropy metrics richman and moorman 2000 developed a new family of statistics for measuring complexity called sample entropy sampen sampen can be calculated in several steps li et al 2006 huang et al 2011 richman and moorman 2000 1 for a time series of n points u j 1 j n forms the n m 1 vectors x m i for i 1 i n m 1 where x m i u i k 1 k m 1 is the vector of m data points from u i to u i m 1 the distance between two such vectors is defined as 1 d x i x j max u i k u j k 0 k m 1 2 take n i m as the number of sequences in the time series that match without self matching the template or run of compared data with the length m within the tolerance criterion r based on this value the functions c i m r and c m r are defined as 2 c i m r n i m n m 1 3 c m r i 1 n m 1 c i m r n m 1 where i 1 2 n m 1 3 change the dimension of the vector x i to m 1 and repeat steps 1 3 to yield c m 1 r the sampen is defined as 4 sampen m r n ln c m 1 r c m r sampen m r n estimates the entropy of a time series dataset consisting of n data points by computing the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that a given short sequence of data or template is repeated during the time series tochigi et al 2012 it is a conditional probability measure that quantifies the likelihood that sequences of m consecutive data points of the same length that match one another within a tolerance of r remain similar when the length of the sequences is increased by one sample sequences of length m 1 humeau heurtier 2015 although sampen can be used to analyze complexity for a single timescale it does not yield information on complexity over multiple timescales costa et al 2002 introduced a multi scale entropy analysis derived from approximate entropy and sample entropy to address this limitation multi scale entropy used in the present paper to analyze complexity of suspended sediment time series is computed as follows 1 construct a coarse grained times series q œÑ determined by the scale factor œÑ from the original times series as 5 q j œÑ 1 œÑ i j 1 œÑ 1 j œÑ q i 1 j n œÑ where œÑ is the scale factor i e the number of time intervals for œÑ 1 the coarse grained time series q j œÑ is identical to the original time series for œÑ 1 each coarse grained time series contains n œÑ elements i e the length of the original time series divided by the scale factor 2 compute the sampen for all scale factors œÑ according to costa et al 2002 2005 the optimal value of m is 2 the parameter r is set at a certain percentages usually 15 of the original time series sd and remains constant for all scales in sampen algorithm costa et al 2002 2005 hence in this study values for the template length m and the matching criterion r for the sampen analyses are set at 2 and 0 15 respectively 2 3 range index a range index quantitatively evaluates the degree to which the complexity of the sediment time series has changed between two different time intervals in this case intervals before and after dam construction the change in entropy expressed as a percentage is 6 sampen post sampen pre sampen pre 100 where sampenpre is the sampen value during the pre dam period sampenpost is the sampen value during the post dam period a positive deviation indicates that complexity has increased as a result of dam construction whereas a negative value indicates that complexity has decreased 3 study site and data the yangtze river is 6 300 km long and has a drainage area of 1 808 500 km2 accounting for nearly 20 of the total area of china it is the largest and longest river in china and the third largest in annual runoff and the fourth largest in sediment load in the world li et al 2011 eisma 1998 according to incomplete statistics small reservoirs are not considered 47 842 dams and reservoirs have been built in the yangtze river basin for flood control navigation and hydropower generation jiang 2011 this study focuses on the impacts of large dams with storage capacity 108 m3 table 1 fig 2 all of these dams have been constructed since 1974 and the vast majority have been built since 1980 table 1 of the nineteen large dams on tributaries of the yangtze river upstream of the tgd the oldest was built in 1977 and sixteen dams have become operational since 1981 table 1 fig 2 the tgd was first put into use in 2003 and became fully operational in 2009 the gezhouba dam gd a run of river structure downstream of the tgd with a reservoir storage capacity of 1 58 109 m3 began to impound water in 1981 the daily time series of

measuring from water surface the homogeneity and reliability of these data have been strictly checked by cwrc cuntan station is the inflow control point of the upper yangtze river into the tgd and was selected as a reference station to investigate the impacts of the tgd on the sediment regime of the middle and lower reaches li et al 2011 yichang station is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river about 38 km downstream from the tgd hankou station is located on the middle reach of the yangtze river between dongting and poyang lakes and datong station is located on the lower reach of the yangtze river between poyang lake and the east china sea fig 2 to evaluate the influence of dam construction on the scaling and complexity properties of the sediment load time series data for these stations the data series were divided into four intervals according to construction of dams table 2 fig 3 changes in daily sediment loads along the yangtze river over time provide the context for the analysis of the impact of dams on high frequency sediment dynamics using multi scale entropy of sediment time series analysis focuses on four time periods 1954 to 1978 the period prior to the construction of most large dams with the yangtze river basin period 1 1979 to 2002 the period of major dam construction within the basin period 2 2003 to 2009 the period when the tgd became partially operational period 3 and 2009 2013 the period after the tgd was fully operational period 4 4 results 4 1 changes in sediment load in the yangtze river time series of sediment loads for the four stations along the yangtze river show that these loads declined somewhat at all four locations over the first two periods table 3 and fig 3 the mean sediment load at cuntan yichang hankou and datong decreased by 8 7 11 8 15 1 and 19 4 respectively the data indicate that major dam construction on tributaries and the construction of the gezhouba dam reduced sediment loads on yangtze river with the most pronounced influence at locations farthest downstream the most dramatic change in mean daily sediment loads at all stations occurred from period 2 to period 3 when the tgd began partial operation at cuntan sediment loads decreased by about 55 compared to pre dam conditions this large change cannot be attributed to the tgd which is located downstream but instead reflects the trapping of sediment by dams constructed on tributaries in the headwaters this construction initiated a progressive decline in sediment load throughout period 2 that fluctuated around a new low level during period 3 immediately downstream of the three gorges and gezhouba dams yichang load declined by 88 compared to predam levels indicating that these mainstem structures exacerbated the effect of tributary dams upstream farther downstream loads decreased by 71 at hankou and 67 at datong after tgd became fully operational during period 4 the mean daily sediment load at cuntan decreased by an additional 18 compared to period 3 probably due to the completion of five dams in the upstream tributaries after 2003 further declines in mean daily sediment load occurred between periods 3 and 4 at all three stations downstream of the tgd overall loads have decreased by 94 yichang 77 hankou and 73 datong relative to the predam period period 1 the annual sediment loads at cuntan yichang hankou and datong stations exhibit similar patterns of variation over time fig 4 increases in load upstream are mirrored by increases in load downstream thus at annual timescales dynamics of variation in sediment load remain synchronized at the basin scale despite the construction of dams whereas prior to dam construction period 1 annual loads at cuntan generally were less than loads at yichang and often less than or similar to loads at hankou and datong loads at cuntan are now consistently higher than those at stations downstream of the tgd fig 4 the annual sediment loads at all four stations show a noticeable decrease around the year 2000 confirming that reductions in sediment load downstream of the tgd at least in part reflect reductions in sediment load upstream of this dam 4 2 entropy analysis of the sediment series for period 1 multi scale entropy analysis for the period prior to the construction of large dams indicates that values of the sample entropy and therefore the degree of complexity of the sediment series at cuntan station are less than value of sample entropy at yichang station hankou station and datong station over all time scales 1 to 30 days fig 5 a cuntan and yichang stations exhibit the same rate of increase in complexity over time scale but yichang entropy values are consistently greater than those for cuntan indicating that the sediment signal for yichang is more irregular than the signal for cuntan over all time scales hankou and datong exhibit nearly identical entropy values over all timescales and these values are much greater than those for cuntan and yichang values of sample entropy at hankou and datong also increase at a faster rate with increasing timescale compared to entropy values for the other two stations thus signal complexity is not only greater for hankou and datong than for cuntan and yichang but the complexity also increases over timescale to a greater extent at hankou and datong than at cuntan and yichang the hankou station is located a little over one kilometer downstream of the confluence of the yangtze river and hanjiang river fig 2 the hanjiang river the largest tributary of the yangtze river drains a large mountainous watershed and has a steep slope the introduction of variable amounts of sediment from this tributary to the yangtze river may contribute to the increase in complexity of the sediment time series at the two stations hankou and datong downstream from the confluence 4 3 changes in entropy for period 2 the initiation of dam construction throughout the yangtze basin during period 2 does not greatly alter the complexity of the sediment series at cuntan station figs 5b 6 and 7 the mean percentage change in sample entropy between periods 1 and 2 is only 2 table 4 on the other hand values of sampen systematically decrease over time scales of 1 to 30 days for the sediment series at yichang station figs 5b 6 b and 7 the average percentage decrease in sampen over all time scales is 18 9 table 4 the lack of major change in complexity at cuntan combined with the decrease in complexity at yichang suggests that the construction of the gezhouba dam on the yangtze river was largely responsible for the change in complexity at yichang the results indicate that the sediment time series after dam construction became substantially less complex immediately downstream from the gezhouba dam presumably because this dam and its associated reservoir acted as a filter to reduce irregularities in the sediment series signal downstream at the hankou and datong stations sample entropy is still much greater than at the two upstream stations but the separation between values of sampen for hankou and datong have increased compared to period 1 values of sampen at datong now are greater than those at hankou especially for large timescales œÑ 10 overall sampen increases downstream over all timescales during this period the average value of sampen for all timescales at hankou decreased between periods 1 and 2 by 14 4 table 4 this decrease may indicate that construction of the gezhouba dam reduced the complexity of sediment dynamics in the middle reaches of the yangtze river but to a lesser extent than the change at yichang apparently the filtering effect of the gezouhba dam diminished over distance downstream at datong the average value of sampen actually increases slightly 10 0 between periods 1 and 2 suggesting that no filtering effect of the dam on the dynamics of sediment occurred in the lower yangtze river 4 4 changes in entropy in periods 3 and 4 between periods 2 and 3 the entropy of the sediment load time series at cuntan station changes only slightly despite the large decrease in total sediment load during this period table 3 the mean percentage decrease in sample entropy is 7 0 indicating a slight reduction in complexity but overall the dynamics of the sediment system at this location do not appear to be fundamentally altered between periods 3 and 4 the sample entropy at cuntan actually increases by an average of 16 compared to the predam period this change combined with the lack of change at this station in the previous two periods seems to indicate that sediment dynamics within the part of the watershed influenced only by tributary dams act largely independently of these dams even though the overall amount of sediment within the river system has dramatically decreased at the yichang station the sample entropy of the sediment load time series decreased substantially over different timescales following construction of the tgd figs 5c 6b and 8 values of sampen in period 3 are about 2 3 times less than those for the pre dam period the magnitude of reduction increases with increasing time scale percentage changes in sampen range from 23 9 to 69 1 with an average of 42 6 table 4 after tgd was put into full operation in 2009 at the beginning of period 4 the decrease in entropy is sustained with an average of reduction of sample entropy of 51 0 table 4 assuming that most of this effect is the result of the tgd and not of other dams constructed upstream in periods 3 and 4 an assumption supported by the lack of dramatic change in sediment dynamics at cuntan station these results indicate that the construction of the tgd greatly simplified the sediment dynamics at yichang station in particular it enhanced the effect initiated by the construction of the gezhouba dam during period 2 somewhat surprisingly the tgd which is much larger than the gd and has a reservoir with much greater storage capacity than the reservoir of the gd only produced changes in complexity of the sediment time series period 2 4 commensurate with that of the gd constructed upstream between periods 1 and 2 nevertheless it is clear that the two dams together have strongly filtered the high frequency components of the sediment signal at yichang by reducing the irregularity of these components the large reduction of sampen at this location results in a change in the downstream pattern of complexity of the sediment load signal along the yangtze river with values of sampen below the dam becoming lowest immediately below the dams on the mainstem yiachang and higher values of sampen occurring above the dams cuntan and far downstream below the dams hankou and datong fig 5c and d comparing periods 2 and 3 the sediment load data for hankou station exhibit both increases and decreases in complexity at different timescales with an average percentage change in complexity of 5 2 figs 5d 6c 8 and table 4 by comparison the datong station exhibits consistent increases in entropy across the entire range of timescales with a mean percentage increase in sample entropy of 35 figs 5d and 8 table 4 between periods 3 and 4 when the tgd became fully operational complexity of the sediment signals at the two stations increases greatly figs 5c and d 6c and d and fig 9 with an average percentage of entropy increase compared to predam conditions of 64 4 at hankou and 68 1 at datong table 4 5 discussion the results of this study show that the sediment load at the cuntan station of the yangtze river decreased as large dams were constructed in tributaries to the river upstream from this location water and soil conservation strategies have been introduced throughout the yangtze river basin since the 1990 s after a major flood in 1998 these strategies were implemented on a large scale especially in headwater tributary basins leading to a decrease in the total area of eroded soils from 0 62 million km2 in the 1980s to 0 53 million km2 in 2008 dai et al 2016 these actions also contribute to reductions in sediment load at cuntan despite reductions in load sample entropy values have not changed dramatically at this location fig 6a the lack of change in sediment dynamics probably reflects the fact that all large dams upstream of cuntan were constructed in tributaries far removed from the sampling location along the main river thus these structures do not strongly influence the dynamics of the sediment regime the recent increase in sample entropy values may reflect the effects of conservation practices which may be increasing the complexity of sediment dynamics the degree of alteration in the sample entropy of the sediment load signals for the yichang hankou and datong stations indicates that dam construction has had varying influences on the complexity of sediment dynamics of the yangtze river over space and over time clearly the trapping of sediment within the reservoir of the large dams especially the three gorges dam have altered the sediment dynamics of the yangtze river resulting in changes in the complexity of the time series of sediment loads over a range of timescales the effect has been greatest at the yichang station only 6 km downstream of the gezhouba dam 24 in fig 1 and table 1 where complexity has decreased dramatically this decrease in complexity is consistent with the conceptual model fig 1 postulating that the gezhouba dam and three gorges dam have acted as filters that through sediment storage effects reduce the irregularity of the sediment load signal immediately downstream of these structures complexity has diminished in the sense that values of sediment load are now more uniform over timescales of 1 30 days than these values were prior to dam construction at hankou station in the middle reach of the yangtze river the effects have been mixed with the effects varying with different time periods and over different timescales between time periods overall however full operation of the tgd appears to have resulted in a marked increase in the complexity of the sediment time series at hankou at the datong station on the lower reaches of the river the effect of upstream dam construction is clear since the construction of the gezhouba and three gorges dams the complexity of the sediment signal has increased substantially with the greatest increase in complexity occurring after the construction of the tgd these findings show that the effect of dam construction along the yangtze river on sediment dynamics has been spatially variable above the tgd and gd the rather remote large tributary dams have had a relatively minor effect on the dynamics of sediment in the river even though these structures have contributed to reduced sediment loads in other words these dams do not act as strong filters on the sediment signals immediately downstream of the tgd and gd the strong regulation of sediment fluxes by the dams has increased the regularity of sediment loads over time while substantially decreasing the total amount of sediment within the river farther downstream however the effect of the dams on sediment dynamics has been to increase the complexity of these dynamics differences in the locations of large dams the trapping efficiency of these dams and the intervening drainage areas between sediment measurement stations provide a possible explanation for spatial patterns of complexity of sediment dynamics along the yangtze river this study and previous work zhang et al 2006 2009 2012 li et al 2011 has shown that the tgd has altered sediment loads on the yangtze river to a much greater extent than the gd by trapping large amounts of sediment in its reservoir moreover the difference in drainage area between yichang and hankou is 482 000 km2 including the hanjiang river and dongting lake table 1 whereas the difference in drainage area between hankou and datong is 217 000 km2 including poyang lake since the construction of the tgd other factors such as local contributions of sediment by tributaries and the influence of lakes are apparently playing a more important role in sediment dynamics than occurred prior to the construction of this dam leading to increases in the complexity of sediment dynamics at the hankou and datong stations after 2003 this increase in complexity seems to indicate that the tgd has made the sediment signal more sensitive to these other factors by reducing the influence of upstream to downstream transport within the mainstem of the river on sediment dynamics especially after the tgd was put into full operation this decrease in longitudinal continuity of sediment transport along with an increase in the relative importance of local factors on sediment transport may account for the increase in complexity of sediment dynamics within the middle and downstream portions of the yangtze river following the construction of the tgd thus in relation to the conceptual model fig 1 the construction of large dams may result in increased complexity of sediment load signals by disrupting downstream movement of sediment and by accentuating the influence on sediment dynamics of local tributary sources of sediment downstream of the dams this study has also shown that multi scale entropy analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the alteration of sediment dynamics by dam construction in river systems entropy analysis clearly revealed that regulation of the yangtze river has decreased the complexity of sediment dynamics near large dams on the mainstem but has increased complexity of these dynamics far from the dams few if any other studies have used multi scale entropy analysis to examine sediment dynamics in river systems the findings in the present study contrast somewhat with those of zhou et al 2012 who used multiscale entropy analysis to show that the construction of water reservoirs generally increased the complexity of discharge time series of rivers in china with the effect of the dams on complexity diminishing as distance from the structures increases compared to dam construction multi scale entropy analysis has shown that changes in land use and soil conservation practices since the 1940s have led to a loss of complexity in river flow within the mississippi river li and zhang 2008 results presented here for the cuntan station suggest that soil conservation practice may contribute to increased complexity of sediment dynamics given that river systems globally have been intensively influenced by human activities multiscale entropy analysis provides a useful tool for assessing how such activities have changed the dynamic complexity of these systems it is well known that dams reduce sediment loads but the impact of dams on the variability of sediment systems is poorly understood this study provides insight into how dams have influenced the sediment dynamics in yangtze river and provides a quantitative method for evaluating human influence on sediment dynamics in other rivers a number of large dams e g xiluodu dam with a reservoir storage capacity of 6 46 109 m3 baihetan dam with a reservoir storage capacity of 2 06 1010 m3 are planned or under construction in the upper portion of the yangtze river basin above the tgd the combined influences of these dams could change sediment dynamics not only in the upper river but enhance variation of sediment dynamics downstream effects of these big dams need to be assessed when investigating sediment load alterations in the watershed scale in future research 6 conclusions large dams along the yangtze river have decreased the complexity of the high frequency component of sediment dynamics immediately downstream of the dams thus the dams appear to act as a low pass filter on downstream transport of sediment thereby enhancing the uniformity of the sediment signal at high frequencies the three gorges dam which is capable of trapping far more sediment than the other dams completely disrupted transport along the river resulting not only in major decreased in sediment load but a spatially variable effect downstream discontinuity of upstream to downstream sediment transport along the river along with the enhanced influence of local factors such as additions of sediment by tributaries and the effects of river connected lakes on sediment movement probably account for the increase in complexity of sediment dynamics far from the dams on the middle and lower yangtze river the construction of large dams on major tributaries appears to have less influence on the complexity of sediment dynamics on the mainstem than does the construction of large dams along the river itself acknowledgements this project was supported by the national natural
