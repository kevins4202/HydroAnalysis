20750,the hydrodynamic interaction between ships or between the ship and the bank was studied by numerical methods a number of new numerical results were obtained for both ship ship interaction and ship bank interaction cases by applying the double body potential flow code hydinter earlier developed at instituto superior técnico university of lisbon portugal a comparative numerical study was made between these results and those obtained earlier for the same ship forms at ghent university belgium with a different potential code ropes with a computational fluid dynamics cfd code isis cfd and with experimental fluid dynamics efd data obtained in the shallow water towing tank at flanders hydraulics research belgium a panel method is in comparison with cfd relatively fast and can often be used in real time simulations because of this substantial benefit the research focuses on identifying the limitations of applicability of this alternative computation method which neglects viscous effects and free surface deformation in this research on the one hand good predictions are obtained for ship ship interaction between encountering ships on the other hand the results for ship bank interactions fail to predict the experimental trends the errors increase at very close distances to the bank or another ship the same holds true for the cases characterised by very large drift angles

to or repulsion from a bank or an encountering overtaking ship to avoid jeopardizing the navigational safety it is therefore desirable to be able to predict the behaviour of a ship when sailing close to a bank or another ship of course it can be believed that the computational fluid dynamics cfd software is capable to predict interaction forces and moments fairly accurately however due to the long computation time cfd methods are not suitable for application to numerical ship handling simulators where real time prediction of interaction effects is required at the same time potential flow codes based on the double body approximation neglecting any viscous and wave making effects are sufficiently fast to be run in real time on common present day computers unfortunately any attempt to account for the free surface effects even using the simplest linear wave making models increases the computation time dramatically and application of such model in ship handling simulators is still highly problematic the assumption that the near field potential interaction without free surface effects is sufficient for adequate estimation of the interaction loads is called the havelock hypothesis and in many cases this assumption is justified sutulo et al 2012 however there are also cases when predictions based on the havelock hypothesis result in substantial errors in particular this happens when the lateral distance between the ships is very small of the order of one metre in full scale or in the case of large drift angles attempts to assess the significance of the factors neglected in the double body potential flow model were undertaken in fonfach et al 2011 and wnęk et al 2018 where commercial cfd codes were used and it was established with reasonable certainty that the free surface effects are more important than those of viscosity however the value of these conclusions is somewhat limited as the comparisons were performed for a rather specific case of a tug operating near a large tanker the velocities of both ships were equal and only two positions of the tug along the tanker were considered zou and larsson 2013 calculated with cfd the interaction forces and the wave

during a replenishment at sea and validated the calculations with the same set of open data again a good correlation was found a similar comparison was executed in wong et al 2019 for the validation of rans cfd computations with a flng and a lng in a steady current where the influence of the lateral and longitudinal proximity of the vessels was studied both zou and larsson 2013 and jin et al 2016 assume a double body approach where the influence of free surface deformation is neglected while wong et al 2019 do include the free surface deformation in their computations the present study also focuses on comparative predictions of interaction forces obtained with the following different techniques 1 the potential code hydinter was developed at the instituto superior técnico university of lisbon sutulo and guedes soares 2008 this code was based on the classic panel method developed by hess and smith 1964 1967 and is capable of predicting within the limits of the havelock hypothesis interaction forces and moments for arbitrary number of interacting bodies moving in an arbitrary way the first version of the code sutulo and guedes soares 2008 did only handle the infinite fluid depth case later the code was extended to the case of flat seabed using the mirror image method in sutulo et al 2012 the code was validated against experimental tank data provided by force technology and it was also demonstrated that the interaction loads may be significantly affected by the sway and yaw relative motion of the interacting ships this fact is neglected by practically all prediction methods based on empiric data as such experiments are extremely difficult to carry out and most experimental data refer to parallel motion validation of the code hydinter against towing tank data published in vantorre et al 2002 showed uncertain results falter 2010 sometimes the agreement was found perfect but it was much worse in other cases as the experimental data presented in vantorre et al 2002 were obtained with scaled models equipped with propellers possible influence of the latter was investigated in sutulo and guedes soares 2012 where the propellers were modelled by disks of sinks it turned out however that if the propeller slipstream does not hit a body the influence of the propeller is negligible in all practically meaningful cases one branch of the extension of the code hydinter was aimed at accounting for an arbitrary non horizontal and non flat seabed by using the so called moving patch method presuming dynamic distribution of additional source panels on the seabed zhou et al 2010 2012 2014 2015 2016b a xu et al 2019 finally an attempt was made to improve the accuracy of the panel method by using non planar dihedral panels and by satisfying the non

with anti parallel velocity vectors for the tanker computations were also performed for its motion parallel to the vertical bank the section containing the numerical results and their analysis is preceded by a section outlining theoretical background of the methods applied in the study and is followed by conclusions drawn on the basis of the comparative analysis 2 main specifics of methods subject to comparison 2 1 frames of reference and main definitions the global right handed earth fixed cartesian frame o ξ η ζ is used to describe position and orientation of all interacting objects the direction of the horizontal ξ axis lying on the free surface is chosen from convenience considerations the ζ axis is directed vertically downwards and the η axis is horizontal and perpendicular to the remaining axes a body frame c x y z is fixed to any of interacting ships with the origin c lying in the intersection of the centre plane midship plane and water plane the x axis is directed to the bow and the y axis to starboard the motion of each vessel is described by the velocity vector v c which has the projections u surge velocity and v sway velocity on the axes x and y respectively and by the angular velocity of yaw r the instantaneous position of each ship at the time moment t is described by the global coordinates ξ c t and η c t and by the heading angle ψ t in all cases of the present study however only rectilinear motion with v r 0 with η c const will be considered the heading angle is always supposed to be zero or when the encounter motion is considered equal to π the speed of a vessel is defined as v c v c 2 2 theoretical basis of potential flow codes the potential codes hydinter and ropes used in the present study both presume solution of the integral equation with respect to the unknown surface source density σ p where p x y z is the source point on the surface s which is conjunction of the doubled wetted boundaries of all interacting bodies 1 2 π σ m s g m p n m σ p d s p v c m n m where m x y z s is the point at which the non penetration condition is specified g m p is the green function accounting for the boundary condition on the free surface and on the seabed 2 g m p i k k 1 r i 1 r i in the formula above k is the number of reflections and 3 r i x x y y z z 2 i h r i x x y y z z 2 i h h being the depth of the fluid once the source density σ p is determined it is possible to determine the induced velocity v i and the induced potential φ 4 v i m s σ p m g m p d s p 5 φ m s σ p g m p d s p the fluid pressure p is then calculated using the following form of the bernoulli pressure equation lamb 1968 6 p ρ φ t 1 2 v c 2 v i v c 2 where ρ is the fluid density the inertial hydrodynamic force f x e x y e y z e z and moment m k e x m e y n e z are obtained through pressure integration 7 f s p n d s m s p r n d s where the integration is performed over the surface of the body for which the force must be determined in the general case the force and moment computed with the formulae above will also contain the proper loads not caused by interaction however these proper loads will be absent in the particular case when each body is symmetric with respect to the centre plane and is performing uniform rectilinear motion with zero drift angle as in the present study only this particular case is considered the formulae above will only give interaction loads and can be used in their standard form 2 3 numerical schemes of panel methods although eq 1 which is the fredholm equation of the second kind permits iterative solution the alternative collocation method proved to be more practical and flexible and is used in practically all hydrodynamic applications including the codes hydinter and ropes the main principle behind the collocation method consists in subdividing the surface s in eq 1 into n non intersecting pieces s j each representing a curvilinear quadrilateral or triangle then each s j is approximated with a panel s j of simpler geometry the source panel on each panel is approximated and parameterized and a small number of collocation points with normals are chosen in most cases the overall number of collocation points is made equal to the total number of parameters defining the source distribution and the integral equation 1 is then reduced to a set of linear algebraic equations if the panelling is performed appropriately this set is well conditioned and diagonal dominant which guarantees its easy solution with well known direct or iterative numerical methods one of the earliest but still the most popular variant of the collocation method developed by hess and smith 1964 1967 is used in both hydinter and ropes codes in this method each panel s j is a flat rectangle with a unique collocation point at its centroid and with a constant density single layer distributed over its surface a specific uncertainty associated with the hess and smith scheme is that each of the flat panels is intersecting the primary body surface as it is displaced according to a special procedure a number of attempts to improve the original hess and smith method have been undertaken most modifications were based on application of curvilinear parameterized panels with non constant source density on each of them examples of such higher order methods are the methods developed by kough and ho 1996 and ni et al 2005 in the latter a spline approximation of the body surface is performed without explicit creation of panels higher order methods may become significantly superior in some cases of smooth isolated bodies but are in general less robust and hardly optimal in interaction problems another alternative was recently proposed by sutulo and guedes soares 2016 in the form of the so called dihedral method where each panel remains quadrilateral with the constant source density distribution but is no longer flat consisting of two flat triangles besides that the non penetration condition is satisfied in the integral sense presuming integration of the normal velocity over each triangular subpanel this integration is carried out using the gauss formulae of the order 1 2 3 or 5 which corresponds to 1 3 4 7 nodes respectively the dihedral method is implemented as an option in the code hydinter and it did demonstrate better accuracy with the same number of panels sutulo and guedes soares 2016 however this increased accuracy comes at a price due to the necessity to calculate induction from the doubled number of subpanels at each gauss node the method becomes substantially slower than the original hess and smith method and should be recommended primarily for offline benchmark computations 2 4 modelling of screw propeller in panel code some of the experimental results used for comparisons were obtained in tests with models equipped with propellers working at model scale self propulsion point this fact justifies the desire to incorporate a model of the propeller into the panel code this was realized in the code hydinter sutulo and guedes soares 2012 as in the situation of parallel motion of interacting ships the situation when the slipstream of a ship hits the other hull any interaction can only be caused by the fluid suction to the propeller so in the cited study each propeller was represented by a disk of uniformly distributed sinks the density of this distribution is determined from the propeller thrust with the help of the actuator disk theory it must be emphasized that one of the results obtained in sutulo and guedes soares 2012 was that such influence is insignificant in most cases more or less tangible influence was only observed in the situation when at low speed of ships the propeller on the overtaking vessel is abruptly set into full ahead which results in the thrust value close to that obtained in the bollard pull regime i e much superior to the thrust available at all equilibrium propulsion points however some of the computations with the code hydinter in the present study were performed with the propeller model activated 3 numerical study 3 1 ship forms under study three hull forms were used for computations in the current investigation 1 the kvlcc2 benchmark ship quadvlieg et al 2018 2 a container ship referred to as container 3 a tanker ship referred to as tanker the kvlcc2 form was used for studying the ship bank interaction van hoydonck et al 2019 while the last two forms were used in numerical studies of the ship to ship interaction described in van hoydonck et al 2016 the main particulars of all ships are presented in table 2 and more detailed information on the hull forms can be found in the cited sources as the code hydinter requires a specific input format ascii files for the hull offsets a matlab script was developed to convert the available description of the ship geometries into hull approximations with various mesh sizes inside hydinter the primary offsets are transformed into approximating sets of quadrilateral flat or dihedral panels the resulting meshes are presented in figs 1 and 2 and their characteristics in table 3 3 2 description of interaction scenarios and computation settings the choice of scenarios was pre determined by the availability of independent experimental and numerical data for the same ship hulls the two ship ship encounter scenarios had been realized with the container and tanker models in the both cases the water depth corresponded to 18 63m and the distance between the centre planes to 83 7m in full scale in the first scenario designated as enc1 the speed of tanker corresponded to 8kn and that of container to 4kn in full scale while in the second scenario enc2 the full scale speed was 12kn for both ships the ship bank interaction had been only studied with the kvlcc2 hull and the main scenarios are outlined in table 1 where y is the lateral ship position in the model scale according to fig 3 h is the water depth and u k c stands for the relative under keel clearance the speed of the model was 0 355m s corresponding to 6kn at full scale each case was realized in two variants a with a propeller working at free run propulsion point and b without propeller 3 3 preliminary numerical studies the code hydinter permits variation of certain computation parameters whose values affect the achieved precision and computation time the comparative test calculations for the encounter scenarios were carried out varying the following parameters 1 the type of panels flat or dihedral in the latter case with application of 1 3 or 5 order gauss schemes 2 mesh resolution coarse medium fine 3 time step 0 5 1 2 and 3 s and 4 the number of mirror image reflections accounting for the finite fluid depth 3 6 9 27 and 81 different combinations of parameters result in different values of the time needed for simulation of the same scenario fig 4 shows the diagram exposing relative computation time for a number of variants and where the variant labelled as original corresponds to the flat panels 3 mirror reflections and for the 2s time step when the elapsed cpu time was 140s the preliminary study lead to the following main conclusions 1 the mirror image convergence was reached at 6 reflections for the sway force and the yaw moment and at 9 reflections for the surge force and these values were assumed for the main block of computations 2 the relative difference in the sway force values obtained with the coarse and fine meshes did not exceed 2 5 and the coarse mesh was used in most further computations 3 the time step was assumed 1s for the enc1 scenario and 2s for enc2 obviously this parameter is not significant in all bank scenarios when the flow is steady it was also discovered that the approximation of the shape of the bow influenced substantially the value of the surge force fig 5 and that bow 3 in fig 5 definitely provides the best results as the surge interaction force must vanish at large longitudinal distances in fig 5 ξ is defined as the longitudinal distance between both ships midship section divided by the average of both l p p increasing with time during a manoeuvre somewhat different variants were considered in the ship bank interaction problem here the reference variant presumed only 2 mirror reflections and alternative numbers of reflections were 4 8 10 and 256 the ropes data obtained with 2431 hull panels were assumed to serve as reference data and values of the relative deviation from these data obtained with various configurations of hydinter were considered as a measure of accuracy the absolute and relative values of deviations are shown in figs 6 and 9 for the bare hull the connecting lines in these and some further figures do not have interpolating function but are only shown to facilitate the analysis it can be seen that the dihedral method with higher gauss order provides results which are closer to those by ropes except for the surge force when flat panels worked better this can be only explained by possible error cancellation effects as the surge force is especially sensitive to approximation of the fore body which remained rather rough in the present study in not one case full agreement between hydinter and ropes was reached which can be explained by different accuracy in the representation of the hull form and by different handling of the bottom see figs 7 and 8 3 4 results for ship to ship interactions all computations related to the ship to ship interaction scenarios were performed with the code hydinter using flat panels the coarse mesh and 9 mirror reflections the time step was 1s for the scenario enc1 and 0 5s for enc2 results for the interaction forces and moments are presented in figs 10 and 11 together with plotted results obtained with the code ropes and experimental data in addition the cfd data are shown for the scenario enc2 fig 11 the following conclusions can be drawn from inspection of the plotted responses 1 in all cases a quite good qualitative agreement between the experimental data and all numerical methods is observed 2 the quantitative agreement is in general satisfactory although some peaks are present and the surge force being somewhat underpredicted 3 divergences between various numerical methods are substantially inferior to disagreement with the experimental data except for the scenario enc1 where they can even be viewed as insignificant 4 the cfd results in fig 11 show in general better agreement with the experimental data than any of the panel methods 3 5 results for ship bank interaction numerical and tank results for the interaction forces and moments estimated for the kvlcc2 hull form are shown in figs 12 and 13 the hydinter computations whose results are presented there were performed with the fine mesh 648 panels and 8 mirror reflections a mirror image of the ship hull was used to model the presence of the vertical bank the sloped bank was neglected in the hydinter computations computations with ropes were carried out using 2438 panels analysis of the plots in figs 12 and 13 lead to the following conclusions 1 discrepancies between the results obtained with various methods are much superior to those observed in the encounter manoeuvre apparently this is caused by a relatively small contribution of the hydrodynamic inertial forces in the steady motion this also explains a relatively poor performance of panel methods in this case 2 the surge force is heavily underpredicted by both panel methods however theoretically in the unbounded perfect fluid this force must be exactly zero and a non zero though small value provided by hydinter is an indicator of the numerical error of the method a higher absolute error produced by ropes apparently can be explained by specifics of accounting for boundaries with a finite number of additional panels for the scenarios bank1 2 3 fig 12 ropes demonstrated the best results for the surge force in the sense that they are closest to the theoretical zero value as can be seen in fig 13 ropes shows worse results at the under keel clearance of 10 which probably is caused by presence of panels with diameters being too large for the given bottom gap 3 the surge force is predicted fairly well by the cfd code which indicates that viscous and or wave making effects are important here 4 both panel methods predict more or less satisfactorily the sway force except for the case of the smallest under keel clearance but fail to predict the yaw moment even giving often wrong signs 5 as the under keel clearance becomes smaller the absolute value of the sway force and yaw moment predicted by the panel method increase by absolute value at small underkeel clearances remaining positive although the growth of the absolute value of the moment is confirmed by cfd and experimental data the sign of the yaw moment may be the opposite 6 at the smallest under keel clearance only the cfd field method is capable to predict satisfactorily the interaction loads 7 the dihedral option of the hydinter code did not demonstrate tangible advantages over the classic hess and smith version in all explored scenarios 8 while the influence of the propeller working at the self propulsion point is predicted as negligible by hydinter which agrees with the conclusion drawn earlier by sutulo and guedes soares 2012 it looks more significant when the experimental and cfd data are considered reasons for such differences still are not quite clear snapshots of the pressure distribution obtained with hydinter and the cfd code are presented in fig 14 in both cases only the dynamic pressure is considered without atmospheric and hydrostatic contributions for the frontal half of the hull the pressure distributions predicted by both methods look very similar qualitatively the correspondence at the aft half of the hull is not as good though as there the boundary layer that is present in the cfd results will reduce the pressure recovery as opposed to the hydinter results where a higher pressure area is present at the bank side of the stern the same conclusions were drawn by van hoydonck et al 2019 for a comparison of the pressure distributions predicted by ropes and the cfd package refresco in the scenario bank1b 4 conclusions two independently developed double body panel codes were used for estimating interaction hydrodynamic loads for two encountering ships in anti parallel motion and for a ship sailing near a vertical bank in a shallow canal the predictions were compared with the data obtained in the tank tests and with the rans cfd code isis the results of these comparisons turned out somewhat contradictory and can be summarized as follows 1 the both perfect fluid double body panel codes provided quite fair and even good predictions of hydrodynamic interaction loads in the case of two encountering ships which can be explained by the highly non steady character of the flow which makes the near field inertial hydrodynamic forces dominating and the havelock hypothesis doubtlessly justified the observed discrepancies with the tank data should be treated as quite acceptable and the potential flow methods are in this situation quite suitable for real time manoeuvring simulation systems 2 however in the case of a ship advancing parallel to the vertical canal bank the results are rather discouraging while the both panel codes showed good agreement between themselves they failed to agree with more reliable data provided by cfd and efd this can be explained by relatively lower contribution of the near field inertial forces in this situation the role of wave making and less likely viscous effects increases a similar situation occurs in the overtaking manoeuvre when the speed difference is very small 3 comparison of responses in the ship to bank interaction with and without the propeller indicates that the model based on the disk of sinks and implemented in the code hydinter does not explain satisfactorily the influence of the propeller the study whose results are presented in the present article has not resolved all uncertainties related to the interaction problem and further investigations are necessary in particular it is highly desirable to reveal influence of the various factors near field potential interaction wave making viscosity for the scenarios considered in the spirit of wnęk et al 2018 also physics of the effect of propellers should be subject to detailed studies with a cfd code with emphasis to visualization of the flow in the vicinity of simulated propellers at the same time in future applications of panel methods better meshing at extremities of the hull should be achieved as some imperfections allowed in the present study are responsible for some fraction of the observed discrepancies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

only give interaction loads and can be used in their standard form 2 3 numerical schemes of panel methods although eq 1 which is the fredholm equation of the second kind permits iterative solution the alternative collocation method proved to be more practical and flexible and is used in practically all hydrodynamic applications including the codes hydinter and ropes the main principle behind the collocation method consists in subdividing the surface s in eq 1 into n non intersecting pieces s j each representing a curvilinear quadrilateral or triangle then each s j is approximated with a panel s j of simpler geometry the source panel on each panel is approximated and parameterized and a small number of collocation points with normals are chosen in most cases the overall number of collocation points is made equal to the total number of parameters defining the source distribution and the integral equation 1 is then reduced to a set of linear algebraic equations if the panelling is performed appropriately this set is well conditioned and diagonal dominant which guarantees its easy solution with well known direct or iterative numerical methods one of the earliest but still the most popular variant of the collocation method developed by hess and smith 1964 1967 is used in both hydinter and ropes codes in this method each panel s j is a flat rectangle with a unique collocation point at its centroid and with a constant density single layer distributed over its surface a specific uncertainty associated with the hess and smith scheme is that each of the flat panels is intersecting the primary body surface as it is displaced according to a special procedure a number of attempts to improve the original hess and smith method have been undertaken most modifications were based on application of curvilinear parameterized panels with non constant source density on each of them examples of such higher order methods are the methods developed by kough and ho 1996 and ni et al 2005 in the latter a spline approximation of the body surface is performed without explicit creation of panels higher order methods may become significantly superior in some cases of smooth isolated bodies but are in general less robust and hardly optimal in interaction problems another alternative was recently proposed by sutulo and guedes soares 2016 in the form of the so called dihedral method where each panel remains quadrilateral with the constant source density distribution but is no longer flat consisting of two flat triangles besides that the non penetration condition is satisfied in the integral sense presuming integration of the normal velocity over each triangular subpanel this integration is carried out using the gauss formulae of the order 1 2 3 or 5 which corresponds to 1 3 4 7 nodes respectively the dihedral method is implemented as an option in the code hydinter and it did demonstrate better accuracy with the same number of panels sutulo and guedes soares 2016 however this increased accuracy comes at a price due to the necessity to calculate induction from the doubled number of subpanels at each gauss node the method becomes substantially slower than the original hess and smith method and should be recommended primarily for offline benchmark computations 2 4 modelling of screw propeller in panel code some of the experimental results used for comparisons were obtained in tests with models equipped with propellers working at model scale self propulsion point this fact justifies the desire to incorporate a model of the propeller into the panel code this was realized in the code hydinter sutulo and guedes soares 2012 as in the situation of parallel motion of interacting ships the situation when the slipstream of a ship hits the other hull any interaction can only be caused by the fluid suction to the propeller so in the cited study each propeller was represented by a disk of uniformly distributed sinks the density of this distribution is determined from the propeller thrust with the help of the actuator disk theory it must be emphasized that one of the results obtained in sutulo and guedes soares 2012 was that such influence is insignificant in most cases more or less tangible influence was only observed in the situation when at low speed of ships the propeller on the overtaking vessel is abruptly set into full ahead which results in the thrust value close to that obtained in the bollard pull regime i e much superior to the thrust available at all equilibrium propulsion points however some of the computations with the code hydinter in the present study were performed with the propeller model activated 3 numerical study 3 1 ship forms under study three hull forms were used for computations in the current investigation 1 the kvlcc2 benchmark ship quadvlieg et al 2018 2 a container ship referred to as container 3 a tanker ship referred to as tanker the kvlcc2 form was used for studying the ship bank interaction van hoydonck et al 2019 while the last two forms were used in numerical studies of the ship to ship interaction described in van hoydonck et al 2016 the main particulars of all ships are presented in table 2 and more detailed information on the hull forms can be found in the cited sources as the code hydinter requires a specific input format ascii files for the hull offsets a matlab script was developed to convert the available description of the ship geometries into hull approximations with various mesh sizes inside hydinter the primary offsets are transformed into approximating sets of quadrilateral flat or dihedral panels the resulting meshes are presented in figs 1 and 2 and their characteristics in table 3 3 2 description of interaction scenarios and computation settings the choice of scenarios was pre determined by the availability of independent experimental and numerical data for the same ship hulls the two ship ship encounter scenarios had been realized with the container and tanker models in the both cases the water depth corresponded to 18 63m and the distance between the centre planes to 83 7m in full scale in the first scenario designated as enc1 the speed of tanker corresponded to 8kn and that of container to 4kn in full scale while in the second scenario enc2 the full scale speed was 12kn for both ships the ship bank interaction had been only studied with the kvlcc2 hull and the main scenarios are outlined in table 1 where y is the lateral ship position in the model scale according to fig 3 h is the water depth and u k c stands for the relative under keel clearance the speed of the model was 0 355m s corresponding to 6kn at full scale each case was realized in two variants a with a propeller working at free run propulsion point and b without propeller 3 3 preliminary numerical studies the code hydinter permits variation of certain computation parameters whose values affect the achieved precision and computation time the comparative test calculations for the encounter scenarios were carried out varying the following parameters 1 the type of panels flat or dihedral in the latter case with application of 1 3 or 5 order gauss schemes 2 mesh resolution coarse medium fine 3 time step 0 5 1 2 and 3 s and 4 the number of mirror image reflections accounting for the finite fluid depth 3 6 9 27 and 81 different combinations of parameters result in different values of the time needed for simulation of the same scenario fig 4 shows the diagram exposing relative computation time for a number of variants and where the variant labelled as original corresponds to the flat panels 3 mirror reflections and for the 2s time step when the elapsed cpu time was 140s the preliminary study lead to the following main conclusions 1 the mirror image convergence was reached at 6 reflections for the sway force and the yaw moment and at 9 reflections for the surge force and these values were assumed for the main block of computations 2 the relative difference in the sway force values obtained with the coarse and fine meshes did not exceed 2 5 and the coarse mesh was used in most further computations 3 the time step was assumed 1s for the enc1 scenario and 2s for enc2 obviously this parameter is not significant in all bank scenarios when the flow is steady it was also discovered that the approximation of the shape of the bow influenced substantially the value of the surge force fig 5 and that bow 3 in fig 5 definitely provides the best results as the surge interaction force must vanish at large longitudinal distances in fig 5 ξ is defined as the longitudinal distance between both ships midship section divided by the average of both l p p increasing with time during a manoeuvre somewhat different variants were considered in the ship bank interaction problem here the reference variant presumed only 2 mirror reflections and alternative numbers of reflections were 4 8 10 and 256 the ropes data obtained with 2431 hull panels were assumed to serve as reference data and values of the relative deviation from these data obtained with various configurations of hydinter were considered as a measure of accuracy the absolute and relative values of deviations are shown in figs 6 and 9 for the bare hull the connecting lines in these and some further figures do not have interpolating function but are only shown to facilitate the analysis it can be seen that the dihedral method with higher gauss order provides results which are closer to those by ropes except for the surge force when flat panels worked better this can be only explained by possible error cancellation effects as the surge force is especially sensitive to approximation of the fore body which remained rather rough in the present study in not one case full agreement between hydinter and ropes was reached which can be explained by different accuracy in the representation of the hull form and by different handling of the bottom see figs 7 and 8 3 4 results for ship to ship interactions all computations related to the ship to ship interaction scenarios were performed with the code hydinter using flat panels the coarse mesh and 9 mirror reflections the time step was 1s for the scenario enc1 and 0 5s for enc2 results for the interaction forces and moments are presented in figs 10 and 11 together with plotted results obtained with the code ropes and experimental data in addition the cfd data are shown for the scenario enc2 fig 11 the following conclusions can be drawn from inspection of the plotted responses 1 in all cases a quite good qualitative agreement between the experimental data and all numerical methods is observed 2 the quantitative agreement is in general satisfactory although some peaks are present and the surge force being somewhat underpredicted 3 divergences between various numerical methods are substantially inferior to disagreement with the experimental data except for the scenario enc1 where they can even be viewed as insignificant 4 the cfd results in fig 11 show in general better agreement with the experimental data than any of the panel methods 3 5 results for ship bank interaction numerical and tank results for the interaction forces and moments estimated for the kvlcc2 hull form are shown in figs 12 and 13 the hydinter computations whose results are presented there were performed with the fine mesh 648 panels and 8 mirror reflections a mirror image of the ship hull was used to model the presence of the vertical bank the sloped bank was neglected in the hydinter computations computations with ropes were carried out using 2438 panels analysis of the plots in figs 12 and 13 lead to the following conclusions 1 discrepancies between the results obtained with various methods are much superior to those observed in the encounter manoeuvre apparently this is caused by a relatively small contribution of the hydrodynamic inertial forces in the steady motion this also explains a relatively poor performance of panel methods in this case 2 the surge force is heavily underpredicted by both panel methods however theoretically in the unbounded perfect fluid this force must be exactly zero and a non zero though small value provided by hydinter is an indicator of the numerical error of the method a higher absolute error produced by ropes apparently can be explained by specifics of accounting for boundaries with a finite number of additional panels for the scenarios bank1 2 3 fig 12 ropes demonstrated the best results for the surge force in the sense that they are closest to the theoretical zero value as can be seen in fig 13 ropes shows worse results at the under keel clearance of 10 which probably is caused by presence of panels with diameters being too large for the given bottom gap 3 the surge force is predicted fairly well by the cfd code which indicates that viscous and or wave making effects are important here 4 both panel methods predict more or less satisfactorily the sway force except for the case of the smallest under keel clearance but fail to predict the yaw moment even giving often wrong signs 5 as the under keel clearance becomes smaller the absolute value of the sway force and yaw moment predicted by the panel method increase by absolute value at small underkeel clearances remaining positive although the growth of the absolute value of the moment is confirmed by cfd and experimental data the sign of the yaw moment may be the opposite 6 at the smallest under keel clearance only the cfd field method is capable to predict satisfactorily the interaction loads 7 the dihedral option of the hydinter code did not demonstrate tangible advantages over the classic hess and smith version in all explored scenarios 8 while the influence of the propeller working at the self propulsion point is predicted as negligible by hydinter which agrees with the conclusion drawn earlier by sutulo and guedes soares 2012 it looks more significant when the experimental and cfd data are considered reasons for such differences still are not quite clear snapshots of the pressure distribution obtained with hydinter and the cfd code are presented in fig 14 in both cases only the dynamic pressure is considered without atmospheric and hydrostatic contributions for the frontal half of the hull the pressure distributions predicted by both methods look very similar qualitatively the correspondence at the aft half of the hull is not as good though as there the boundary layer that is present in the cfd results will reduce the pressure recovery as opposed to the hydinter results where a higher pressure area is present at the bank side of the stern the same conclusions were drawn by van hoydonck et al 2019 for a comparison of the pressure distributions predicted by ropes and the cfd package refresco in the scenario bank1b 4 conclusions two independently developed double body panel codes were used for estimating interaction hydrodynamic loads for two encountering ships in anti parallel motion and for a ship sailing near a vertical bank in a shallow canal the predictions were compared with the data obtained in the tank tests and with the rans cfd code isis the results of these comparisons turned out somewhat contradictory and can be summarized as follows 1 the both perfect fluid double body panel codes provided quite fair and even good predictions of hydrodynamic interaction loads in the case of two encountering ships which can be explained by the highly non steady character of the flow which makes the near field inertial hydrodynamic forces dominating and the havelock hypothesis doubtlessly justified the observed discrepancies with the tank data should be treated as quite acceptable and the potential flow methods are in this situation quite suitable for real time manoeuvring simulation systems 2 however in the case of a ship advancing parallel to the vertical canal bank the results are rather discouraging while the both panel codes showed good agreement between themselves they failed to agree with more reliable data provided by cfd and efd this can be explained by relatively lower contribution of the near field inertial forces in this situation the role of wave making and less likely viscous effects increases a similar situation occurs in the overtaking manoeuvre when the speed difference is very small 3 comparison of responses in the ship to bank interaction with and without the propeller indicates that the model based on the disk of sinks and implemented in the code hydinter does not explain satisfactorily the influence of the propeller the study whose results are presented in the present article has not resolved all uncertainties related to the interaction problem and further investigations are necessary in particular it is highly desirable to reveal influence of the various factors near field potential interaction wave making viscosity for the scenarios considered in the spirit of wnęk et al 2018 also physics of the effect of propellers should be subject to detailed studies with a cfd code with emphasis to visualization of the flow in the vicinity of simulated propellers at the same time in future applications of panel methods better meshing at extremities of the hull should be achieved as some imperfections allowed in the present study are responsible for some fraction of the observed discrepancies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20751,for an improved estimation of marine structural reliability a consideration of random variable dependency is essential with a limited study on dependence modelling of marine structures this study proposes a framework for reliability assessment of ocean structural systems with multidimensional variables this framework captures possible nonlinearity and tail dependence in the variables

second order reliability method sorm involves the determination of the reliability index β h l in the standard normal space and consequently the probability of failure p f of a structure with the common assumption that the random input variables are independent practically there exists dependency among variables which may affect the reliability estimation of the structural system from the literature on the variable dependency of marine structures nataf and rosenblatt s transformation are essential methods for dealing with the challenges of dependence between input variables melchers and beck 2018 rare consideration is given to rosenblatt transformation since it requires the determination of the joint probability density function pdf of the variables for analysis and which is difficult to obtain also nataf transformation has been widely used in dealing with correlated non normal variables der kiureghian and liu 1986 developed an empirical derivation of pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p for the conversion of correlated non normal variables to standard normal variables li et al 2012 applied nataf transformation in the reliability analysis of complex correlated variables ditlevsen 2002 used the nataf transformation for dynamic analysis of correlated wind and wave effects on offshore structures chang et al 1995 combined nataf transformation and monte carlo simulation mcs to analyze complex systems lebrun and dutfoy 2009 research revealed that nataf transformation results were the same as using a gaussian copula function although nataf transformation can convert correlated non normal variables to independent standard normal variables for reliability analysis its major limitation is the inability to capture tail dependence between variables recently bivariate copula functions have gained useful application in dependency and reliability studies goda 2010 studied the relationship between peak and residual displacement in the reliability of structures subject to seismic loads also in a risk based design shao et al 2019 developed a data driven approach for risk assessment of concrete dams using copula functions in the field

lu and zhu 2018 applied the copula concept and the moment matching principles in structural system reliability analysis tang et al 2013a b studied the effect of bivariate copula on systems reliability

truncated variables xiao et al 2017 tang et al 2013a b developed a framework for dependence analysis of structures using bivariate copulas the ocean environment is complex the need to study the interaction effect among ocean parameters such as wave wind current and geotechnical conditions is critical for a realistic description of marine structural design and operations in recent times research has considered the dependence modelling of ocean variables antão and guedes soares 2014 developed a model considering the dependence of wave steepness and wave height in the ocean environment zhang et al 2018 modelled the significant wave height dependency with average wave period and wind speed using asymmetric copulas michele et al 2007 considered the dependence modelling of storm conditions significant wave height duration direction and interarrival time using copulas masina et al 2015 studied the dependence between sea levels and waves using copulas gupta and bhaskaran 2017 studied the interdependency between ocean parameters wind and waves in the indian ocean basin for about two decades the correlation between sea state loads on fixed offshore structures has been successfully studies using archimedean copulas zhai et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 studied the joint probability distribution of wave load and wind speed at bohai bay using clayton and gumbel copulas montes iturrizega and heredia zavoni 2016 demonstrated copulas use to model the wave height and peak period of offshore mooring lines from the preceding literature it is evident that more research has focused on the use of copula functions for component or system reliability assessment with mainly bivariate input variables regarding the determination of dependency for more than two input random variables multidimensional bedford cooke 2002 introduced the concept of vine copula to decompose the joint pdf into a cascade of bivariate copulas and the marginal distribution of the variables considering the central problem of flexibility faced by traditional copulas in handling higher dimensional variables the vine copula offers simplicity in its application and flexibility in combining different bivariate copulas for dependence modelling this set of copulas can capture complex dependency amongst input variables compared with traditional multivariate copulas although its early application has been in financial mathematics the vine copula has gained useful engineering applications in recent times vine copulas can deal with dependency and can capture nonlinearity and tail dependence between variables more specifically modelling of variables using the vine copula has been an area of research interest in geotechnics hydrology and power systems engineering in the field of geotechnics the research focus has been mainly on the characterization of soil properties wang and li 2019 studied the dependence of soil properties modelled by the random field method using a vine copula based approach tang et al 2020 applied the concept of vine copulas in soil slope reliability assessment considering various soil properties such as friction angle soil cohesion and unit weight of the soil lü et al 2020 investigated the dependency of structured clay s multiple soil parameters using the vine copula method the research of wang and li 2017 demonstrates the importance of copulas in stability reliability studies of tunnel excavation using a stochastic surrogate model through a comparative study in hydrology wang et al 2018 developed a framework to study monthly river flow in the dry season using vine copula jiang et al 2019 modelled the dependence for multivariate hydrological designs with vine copula tu pham et al 2018 applied a vine copula based approach to generate evapotranspiration precipitation and temperature time series required for discharge in a rainfall model also tosunoglu et al 2020 applied the vine copula concept to model dependence between flood characteristics which are peak volume and discharge in the field of power based systems qiu et al 2019 have applied the concept of vine copula in modelling the dependence of the output of multiple wind power generation systems khuntia et al 2019 focused on the spatial relationship between wind power plants and electrical load using vine copula the integration of copulas with bayesian networks has seen applications in mechanical and process systems sun et al 2021 utilized the copula bayesian network concept cbn in the reliability assessment of a mechanical gantry system given its components prior probability hashemi et al 2016 applied the idea of cbn in process facility safety analysis similarly guo et al 2019 used the cbn concept to model safety accidents fundamentally cbn has a conditional independence assumption in its dependence structure and this may not be a preferred option for dependence modelling in structural reliability analysis conversely vine copula considers conditional dependence among its dependence structure variables making it a useful tool for practical structural reliability problems the cbn approach is effective in dealing with high dimensional variables however it does not pose a significant advantage since one primary concern in the context of structural reliability is the curse of dimensionality where the computational cost of structural reliability analysis grows exponentially with an increased number of input variables hurtado 2004 consequently the primary focus is on reducing the variable dimension as much as possible considering the most critical variables that affect the quantity of interest this approach allows for improved computational efficiency in dealing with reliability analysis given the limit state function lsf from the existing literature it is evident that dependence modelling and reliability assessment of marine structures have focused on pearson correlation copulas for the bivariate structural system or variables have been assumed statistically independent for simplicity of analysis consequently using correlation only captures linear dependence at best between variables marine structures are subject to extreme ocean conditions where tail dependency and nonlinearity between the variables might be critical for such systems the results obtained using the correlation method pearson may present some bias and inaccuracy in modelling the association between its environmental variables from the literature copula utilization in the context of marine structural reliability is limited to two variables at a time with the apparent advantage of vine copula for dependence modelling of multivariate systems and with limited attention to its use in modelling dependency of marine structures this study 1 proposes a framework through a flexible approach vine copula to model variable dependence for complex marine structural systems 2 evaluates the effect of considering nonlinearity and tail dependence of variables as captured by the vine copula approach on the reliability assessment of marine structures under given limit state conditions the organization of the remaining part of this paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the preliminaries on copula functions section 3 outlines the methodology of the proposed vine copula framework with an illustrative example section 4 considers the application of the framework to an offshore structure section 5 gives a summary of the entire paper 2 preliminaries on copulas and structural reliability this section gives a general overview of the concept of structural reliability copula functions and measure of dependence between variables 2 1 structural reliability the lsf divides the standard normal plane for random variables into the safe and failure region in reliability analysis if the lsf is given by g x 0 where x represents the random variables of the function then the failure region is the domain of g x 0 and the safe area is the domain of g x 0 the p f of a structure over the domain of failure can be represented by the expression in eq 1 1 p f g x 0 f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 d x n where f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is the joint pdf of n random variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the difficulty in determining the joint pdf has led to approximate methods like form and sorm to obtain the standard normal plane design point and consequently the system reliability simulation type methods such as mcs importance sampling is and subset simulation are other commonly used methods for evaluating the p f these methods use large simulation cycles and provides greater accuracy but are computationally expensive and cumbersome melchers and beck 2018 this paper utilizes the approximate method sorm and simulation techniques in the structural reliability evaluation of the lsf the is approach eq 2 which relies on the convergence speed of form and the robustness of mcs is used as a benchmark for the results obtained 2 p f 1 n i 1 n i g x i f x x i f i x i for eq 2 n is the number of simulations i g an indicator function f i x i is the sampling density function and x i are realizations of random variables for the i t h simulation in reliability assessment copulas are an important linking function between marginal distributions to enhance the estimation of the p f of a system 2 2 copula functions copulas are multivariate probability distribution with uniform marginals which allows for dependence modelling under uncertainty and are useful and flexible linking tools for random input variables the 1959 sklar s theorem serves as a foundation for the concept of copulas it explains the decomposition of multivariate distribution into univariate marginals and copulas which allows for the expression of dependency between variables nelsen 2006 equation 3 eq 4 and eq 5 show important expressions of sklar s theorem 3 f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n 4 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n i 1 n f i x i 5 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n p x 1 f 1 1 u 1 x 1 f n 1 u n where c is the unique copula distribution function which is the dependence structure f i x i is the continuous marginal distribution function for the i t h variable with n dimension random vector f is the joint distribution function with x i realization of the random variable x i the effect of copula creates simplicity in analysing the joint pdf f x 1 x 2 x n where c is the copula density function and u i the uniform marginal of the copula from sklar s theorem it becomes possible to create an approximate joint pdf from copulas and marginals of random variables among the commonly used copula functions are the elliptical copulas gaussian student t copula and the archimedean copulas clayton frank gumbel table a 1 of appendix a shows various copulas and their properties this study will limit optimal copula selection to those mentioned in this section the vine copula is a simple and efficient way of dealing with conditional dependence between variables nonlinear correlation and tail dependence it comprises a graphical object of nodes and edges with connected trees it uses bivariate copulas to construct an approximate joint pdf for multivariate distributions vine copulas have found wide applications in the financial insurance genetics and health sectors it is an evolving area in various engineering sectors for determining dependency between system variables chang and joe 2019 among the class of vine copulas used for linking marginals and dealing with the variables are the drawable vine d vine and the canonical vine c vine with the pdf relating its n dimensional variables as shown in eq 6 and eq 7 respectively aas et al 2009 6 f x 1 x n k 1 n f x k j 1 n 1 i 1 n j c i i j i 1 i j 1 f x i x i 1 x i

indicates the edges within each tree of the vine copula when a leading variable drives interaction between the data set a c vine copula is adopted aas et al 2009 in the absence of such variables the d vine copula provides a more direct approach in modelling dependency between variables this study adopts the d vine approach since the problems presented have no leading variable governing random variables interaction statistical independence test is essential in ascertaining a relationship linear or nonlinear between random variables especially in the first tree of a d vine structure the non parametric kendall s test which is simple to implement interpret and depends on the empirical kendall s tau τ k is applied in this study to test for independence between variables before copula type determination equation 8 shows an expression for kendall s test statistic where n represents the number of variable observations and t the test statistic value a null hypothesis of independence is accepted when t 1 96 at a 5 significance level genset and favre 2007 8 t 9 n n 1 2 2 n 5 τ k for copula selection this study adopts the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach in copula parameter θ determination and the akaike information criteria aic in the optimal selection of copulas for the d vine structure the aic value captures the information loss in determining θ while fitting various copula in the vine tree a minimum value of aic indicates less information loss the selection of the most suitable copula model for the vine is dependent on the copula with the minimum aic value zhai et al 2017 the aic creates a trade off between the goodness of fit of the copula and its simplicity the expression for the logarithm likelihood function aic and determination of θ are shown in eqs 9

essential in modelling with copulas in reliability study ρ p is the most common measure of dependence due to its simplicity in implementation this is not without its shortcomings of capturing only linear relationships between variables also ρ p is with the assumption of normality and homoscedasticity between the variables other measures of dependence are spearman s correlation ρ r h o which considers the correlation of ranks and τ k which represents the likelihood of concordance over discordance of data these other dependence measures are non parametric and independent of the marginal distribution joe 2014 3 framework for reliability assessment using vine copulas this section describes a five step approach for the reliability assessment of marine structures considering dependency

fig 3 is determined using kendall s test as obtained in eq 8 from the results table 3 since t 1 96 the null hypothesis of independence between variables is rejected at a 5 confidence level consequent to kendall s test outcome independence between variables are not considered in the analysis of tree 1 of the d vine structure step 4 optimal copula selection between random variables an optimal choice of copula between the random variables is made among known elliptical and archimedean copulas this paper limits selection to the six 6 commonly used copulas independent gaussian student t clayton gumbel and frank copulas furthermore the minimum aic is used as criteria for optimal copula selection among the random variables and determination of θ table 4 shows the selected copula types in the d vine trees based on the aic criteria the copula rotation θ r and θ for the selected copula as shown in table 4 are essential elements for the drilling cantilever beam s reliability assessment for the beam s random variables fig 4 shows the scatter plot the visual relationship between realizations of random variables step 5 reliability analysis reliability analysis is carried out using sorm to determine the p f of the structure considering the effect of dependency using selected copulas and lsf of the cantilever beam the results are benchmarked with results from n 10 5 simulation cycle using is fig 5 to check the result s efficiency from d vine coupled random variables a comparative reliability analysis is carried for statistically independent gaussian coupled and d vine coupled cantilever variables the comparison ascertains the accuracy of reliability results compared with benchmark values obtained from is as shown in table 5 also fig 6 shows the effect of a change in θ on p f for selected copulas in the first tree of the d vine structure 4 application of framework to an offshore structure in this section the framework discussed in section 3 is demonstrated on a proposed 97m jacket support structure with four legs the structure is subjected to extreme sea state conditions at jeanned arc basin on canada s east coast this basin is a significant source for oil and gas exploration in canada and is located offshore newfoundland and labrador jacket structures are tubular steel structures fig 7 that can support drilling and production operations in shallow and intermediate water depths 4 1 statistical parameters and probability distribution the random loads considered on the structure include wave effects significant wave height h current at mean sea level v s and current at mudline v m with a major part of the jacket support structure submerged in water the wind speed on the structure for a 100 year return period is considered deterministic with an average magnitude and direction of 32 7 m s sw 235 o the wind is assumed to approach the jacket approximately 10m above the mean sea level the structure s response required to develop the lsf under extreme load conditions is the base shear force bsf the jacket support structure fig 7 is modelled and structural response obtained under ultimate limit state uls condition using structural analysis computer software sacs which is efficient for computer modelling of jackets and tubular structures the structure is assumed to be located at a water depth of 90m in the basin for modelling purposes information on prevailing and extreme environmental conditions in the offshore basin is obtained from site specific met ocean data and reports c core 2017 the essential statistical data summary used in this study is shown in table 6 also the observation data of random variables h v s v m obtained from the block maxima approach are fitted to extreme value distribution evd using the mle minimum aic method this is to determine the appropriate evd to fit the random variables related to environmental load on the jacket support structure as shown in table 7 this study assumes sea state data of a given random variable as independent and identically distributed and limits the selection to commonly used evd for ocean data weibull and gumbel as shown in table 7 p p and q q plots of appendix b fig b 1 b 2 and b 3 the random variables fit the weibull distribution this is used in the reliability assessment of the jacket support structure 4 2 dependence modelling using d vine copula for the support structure the dependence measure between random variables h v s and v m as shown in table 8 is obtained from the met ocean data considering the dependency between the variables h v s v m a d vine structure of order h v s v m is developed as shown in fig 8 kendall s test eq 8 helps ascertain the possibility of independence in the d vine tree as shown in table 9 the study reject the null hypothesis t 1 96 of the possible existence of independence between the variables the optimal selection of copulas is made from the elliptical gaussian student t and archimedean clayton gumbel frank copula families using the mle approach table 10 the result from copula selection table 11 using the mle method is essential in characterizing the dependency between variables for the jacket reliability assessment the scatter plots of the random variables h v s v m suggest evidence of tail dependence between variables fig 9 4 3 metamodel and reliability assessment of the structure the lsf of most complex marine structures is implicit in form to reduce the computational burden of large runs using finite element method for reliability assessment a metamodel describing the jacket uls condition is developed using experimental design points and corresponding responses the experimental design is constructed using the infill sampling technique called latin hypercube sampling lhs and 150 sampling points are obtained from met ocean statistical summary data as shown in table 6 bsf responses of the jacket for the sampling points are determined using sacs at different environmental load angles the polynomial chaos kriging pck technique is used to develop metamodel for reliability analysis pck eq 13 combines the advantages of the polynomial chaos expansion pce and kriging metamodel as it captures both the global behaviour and local variability of the model 13 m p c k x α ε a y α ϕ α x σ 2 z x ω m p c k x is the approximated pck response σ 2 is the variance of the gaussian process z x ω represents the stationary gaussian process and ϕ α x represents the orthonormal polynomial with the corresponding coefficient y α the pck model substitutes the trend function of kriging with orthonormal polynomials schobi et al 2015 with sampling points copula functions and responses the pck approach is used to develop the metamodel required for reliability analysis the metamodel is validated with 50 environmental load data and their corresponding bsf responses which showed minimal deviation from the actual structural responses see table c 1 appendix c in this case g h v s v m m p c k x represents the lsf of the jacket structure next we determine the jacket s reliability from the constructed metamodel at various environmental load angles for reliability analysis this study focuses on the uls condition with its violation resulting in an eventual collapse of the jacket structure also it considers the dependency between environmental variables affecting the jacket support structure using a d vine copula current and wave loads are assumed to approach the jacket from the same direction and at a step of 45 o the metamodel is constructed at various approach angles to the structure considering dependency appendix c fig c 1 shows the convergence plot at various approach angles of the jacket structure s environmental load the contribution of the variables fig 10 to the reliability assessment using d vine copula is also determined to ascertain the essential and leading variables that affect the structure s reliability the is simulation approach 10 5 simulation cycles is used as a reference to compare results obtained from reliability assessment using d vine copula gaussian copula and statistically independent variables as shown in table 12 this comparison further emphasizes the effectiveness of the d vine copula approach in obtaining p f results close to that for the actual structure 4 4 discussion on results from the cantilever beam example in section 3 and the case study presented in this section it is evident that the introduction of d vine copula to model dependency between random variables provides a better approximation of the p f of complex marine structures compared to the use of gaussian copula or when variables are assumed statistically independent in the case of the cantilever beam p f result for the d vine copula approach was found to be relatively closer to the is benchmark result p f deviation 1 9 x 10 4 as shown in table 5 similarly p f results for all approach angles of the environmental loads to the jacket support structure table 12 shows the comparative superiority of d vine copulas in the reliability assessment to the benchmark values d vine copula provides robustness in its ability to capture nonlinearity tail dependence between variables as seen in the selection of clayton and gumbel copulas in the presented example and case study the d vine copula overcomes the gaussian copula s limitation which uses correlation values and can only capture linear dependence between variables although vine copulas are flexible for dependence modelling the results from the copula sensitivity plot for tree 1 of the cantilever beam fig 6 reveals that the clayton and gumbel copulas are highly sensitive to a change in copula parameter in contrast the frank copula is the least susceptible to parameter change the results suggest the need for optimal copula selection and accurate determination of copula parameters during dependence modelling of structures to obtain reliable results with a higher confidence level in this study the optimal copula s choice is made considering the copula type with the lowest aic value between random variables as illustrated in table 10 of the jacket support structure from the reliability analysis results table 12 of the support structure using the d vine copula gumbel and independent the highest p f 7 06 x 10 5 is observed at an approach angle of 225 o of wave and current to the jacket structure consequently this value indicates how the structure meets target reliability values and gives insight into critical environmental load direction required in the site specific structural reliability design and reassessment under uls conditions as shown in fig 10 the random variable h m provides approximately 70 of the contribution to the lsf and is the most significant variable in the reliability assessment of the jacket structure with the least contribution from v m m s in all directions the contribution of random variables to the lsf can help design engineers in variable screening and determine the essential variables during limit state design of marine structures although there exists a wide range of bivariate copulas this study is limited to a few known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel independent and frank however this can be expanded to consider more copulas families to determine the best fit copula for modelling dependency of marine structures under specific conditions the selection of probability distribution for random variables is limited to the known extreme weibull and gumbel and continuous distributions more distribution types can be considered especially in a data driven case to ascertain the d vine copula s efficacy in the reliability study of marine structures the case study jacket considered three dimensional input random ocean variables due to limited data with data available for different ocean parameters such as ice earthquakes and tidal effects the framework can be further investigated to determine its robustness 5 conclusion this paper develops a framework to model the dependency between variables of marine structures using a d vine copula the method overcomes the challenge of capturing the nonlinearity and tail dependence among variables that may affect its reliability evaluation and cannot be accounted for by the pearson correlation the authors applied the framework to on an offshore structure with results showing the efficiency of the d vine copula in providing a more accurate estimate of the p f compared to the gaussian copula or when variables were assumed statistically independent the bias in results using gaussian copula or statistically independent variables was evident in the jacket structure and cantilever beam problem presented in this paper d vine copula proved to be a powerful and flexible tool for modelling dependency between marine structural variables and ensuring an improved quality of reliability based assessment the framework presented in this study can be applied to different marine structures with higher dimension variables implicit lsf as well as low p f under various limit state conditions with the limitation of this study to commonly used copulas research into the use of other families of copulas can be investigated an optimal selection among various copulas can improve the quality of dependence modelling for

20751,for an improved estimation of marine structural reliability a consideration of random variable dependency is essential with a limited study on dependence modelling of marine structures this study proposes a framework for reliability assessment of ocean structural systems with multidimensional variables this framework captures possible nonlinearity and tail dependence in the variables using vine copula the proposed method develops a graphical structure of random variables consisting of nodes edges and trees using the drawable vine d vine approach this study demonstrates the developed framework on a jacket support structure subjected to the extreme environmental load conditions at jeanne d arc basin on canada s east coast the structure s reliability is evaluated with optimally selected copulas in the d vine trees and associated marginal distributions a comparison between the reliability result using the d vine copula method gaussian coupling assumption and statistical independence between variables proved its superiority in modelling variable dependence of complex marine systems the probability of failure p f using d vine copula was closer to the

second order reliability method sorm involves the determination of the reliability index β h l in the standard normal space and consequently the probability of failure p f of a structure with the common assumption that the random input variables are independent practically there exists dependency among variables which may affect the reliability estimation of the structural system from the literature on the variable dependency of marine structures nataf and rosenblatt s transformation are essential methods for dealing with the challenges of dependence between input variables melchers and beck 2018 rare consideration is given to rosenblatt transformation since it requires the determination of the joint probability density function pdf of the variables for analysis and which is difficult to obtain also nataf transformation has been widely used in dealing with correlated non normal variables der kiureghian and liu 1986 developed an empirical derivation of pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p for the conversion of correlated non normal variables to standard normal variables li et al 2012 applied nataf transformation in the reliability analysis of complex correlated variables ditlevsen 2002 used the nataf transformation for dynamic analysis of correlated wind and wave effects on offshore structures chang et al 1995 combined nataf transformation and monte carlo simulation mcs to analyze complex systems lebrun and dutfoy 2009 research revealed that nataf transformation results were the same as using a gaussian copula function although nataf transformation can convert correlated non normal variables to independent standard normal variables for reliability analysis its major limitation is the inability to capture tail dependence between variables recently bivariate copula functions have gained useful application in dependency and reliability studies goda 2010 studied the relationship between peak and residual displacement in the reliability of structures subject to seismic loads also in a risk based design shao et al 2019 developed a data driven approach for risk assessment of concrete dams using copula functions in the field of uncertainty quantification uzielli and mayne 2012 research focused on load displacement uncertainty in soil geotechnics for shallow footing structures using copula functions in system reliability lu and zhu 2018 applied the copula concept and the moment matching principles in structural system reliability analysis tang et al 2013a b studied the effect of bivariate copula on systems reliability in parallel liu fan 2016 applied a mixed copula to analyze a series parallel system s structure another research area considers copulas effect in the sensitivity analysis of a structural system with truncated variables xiao et al 2017 tang et al 2013a b developed a framework for dependence analysis of structures using bivariate copulas the ocean environment is complex the need to study the interaction effect among ocean parameters such as wave wind current and geotechnical conditions is critical for a realistic description of marine structural design and operations in recent times research has considered the dependence modelling of ocean variables antão and guedes soares 2014 developed a model considering the dependence of wave steepness and wave height in the ocean environment zhang et al 2018 modelled the significant wave height dependency with average wave period and wind speed using asymmetric copulas michele et al 2007 considered the dependence modelling of storm conditions significant wave height duration direction and interarrival time using copulas masina et al 2015 studied the dependence between sea levels and waves using copulas gupta and bhaskaran 2017 studied the interdependency between ocean parameters wind and waves in the indian ocean basin for about two decades the correlation between sea state loads on fixed offshore structures has been successfully studies using archimedean copulas zhai et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 studied the joint probability distribution of wave load and wind speed at bohai bay using clayton and gumbel copulas montes iturrizega and heredia zavoni 2016 demonstrated copulas use to model the wave height and peak period of offshore mooring lines from the preceding literature it is evident that more research has focused on the use of copula functions for component or system reliability assessment with mainly bivariate input variables regarding the determination of dependency for more than two input random variables multidimensional bedford cooke 2002 introduced the concept of vine copula to decompose the joint pdf into a cascade of bivariate copulas and the marginal distribution of the variables considering the central problem of flexibility faced by traditional copulas in handling higher dimensional variables the vine copula offers simplicity in its application and flexibility in combining different bivariate copulas for dependence modelling this set of copulas can capture complex dependency amongst input variables compared with traditional multivariate copulas although its early application has been in financial mathematics the vine copula has gained useful engineering applications in recent times vine copulas can deal with dependency and can capture nonlinearity and tail dependence between variables more specifically modelling of variables using the vine copula has been an area of research interest in geotechnics hydrology and power systems engineering in the field of geotechnics the research focus has been mainly on the characterization of soil properties wang and li 2019 studied the dependence of soil properties modelled by the random field method using a vine copula based approach tang et al 2020 applied the concept of vine copulas in soil slope reliability assessment considering various soil properties such as friction angle soil cohesion and unit weight of the soil lü et al 2020 investigated the dependency of structured clay s multiple soil parameters using the vine copula method the research of wang and li 2017 demonstrates the importance of copulas in stability reliability studies of tunnel excavation using a stochastic surrogate model through a comparative study in hydrology wang et al 2018 developed a framework to study monthly river flow in the dry season using vine copula jiang et al 2019 modelled the dependence for multivariate hydrological designs with vine copula tu pham et al 2018 applied a vine copula based approach to generate evapotranspiration precipitation and temperature time series required for discharge in a rainfall model also tosunoglu et al 2020 applied the vine copula concept to model dependence between flood characteristics which are peak volume and discharge in the field of power based systems qiu et al 2019 have applied the concept of vine copula in modelling the dependence of the output of multiple wind power generation systems khuntia et al 2019 focused on the spatial relationship between wind power plants and electrical load using vine copula the integration of copulas with bayesian networks has seen applications in mechanical and process systems sun et al 2021 utilized the copula bayesian network concept cbn in the reliability assessment of a mechanical gantry system given its components prior probability hashemi et al 2016 applied the idea of cbn in process facility safety analysis similarly guo et al 2019 used the cbn concept to model safety accidents fundamentally cbn has a conditional independence assumption in its dependence structure and this may not be a preferred option for dependence modelling in structural reliability analysis conversely vine copula considers conditional dependence among its dependence structure variables making it a useful tool for practical structural reliability problems the cbn approach is effective in dealing with high dimensional variables however it does not pose a significant advantage since one primary concern in the context of structural reliability is the curse of dimensionality where the computational cost of structural reliability analysis grows exponentially with an increased number of input variables hurtado 2004 consequently the primary focus is on reducing the variable dimension as much as possible considering the most critical variables that affect the quantity of interest this approach allows for improved computational efficiency in dealing with reliability analysis given the limit state function lsf from the existing literature it is evident that dependence modelling and reliability assessment of marine structures have focused on pearson correlation copulas for the bivariate structural system or variables have been assumed statistically independent for simplicity of analysis consequently using correlation only captures linear dependence at best between variables marine structures are subject to extreme ocean conditions where tail dependency and nonlinearity between the variables might be critical for such systems the results obtained using the correlation method pearson may present some bias and inaccuracy in modelling the association between its environmental variables from the literature copula utilization in the context of marine structural reliability is limited to two variables at a time with the apparent advantage of vine copula for dependence modelling of multivariate systems and with limited attention to its use in modelling dependency of marine structures this study 1 proposes a framework through a flexible approach vine copula to model variable dependence for complex marine structural systems 2 evaluates the effect of considering nonlinearity and tail dependence of variables as captured by the vine copula approach on the reliability assessment of marine structures under given limit state conditions the organization of the remaining part of this paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the preliminaries on copula functions section 3 outlines the methodology of the proposed vine copula framework with an illustrative example section 4 considers the application of the framework to an offshore structure section 5 gives a summary of the entire paper 2 preliminaries on copulas and structural reliability this section gives a general overview of the concept of structural reliability copula functions and measure of dependence between variables 2 1 structural reliability the lsf divides the standard normal plane for random variables into the safe and failure region in reliability analysis if the lsf is given by g x 0 where x represents the random variables of the function then the failure region is the domain of g x 0 and the safe area is the domain of g x 0 the p f of a structure over the domain of failure can be represented by the expression in eq 1 1 p f g x 0 f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 d x n where f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is the joint pdf of n random variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the difficulty in determining the joint pdf has led to approximate methods like form and sorm to obtain the standard normal plane design point and consequently the system reliability simulation type methods such as mcs importance sampling is and subset simulation are other commonly used methods for evaluating the p f these methods use large simulation cycles and provides greater accuracy but are computationally expensive and cumbersome melchers and beck 2018 this paper utilizes the approximate method sorm and simulation techniques in the structural reliability evaluation of the lsf the is approach eq 2 which relies on the convergence speed of form and the robustness of mcs is used as a benchmark for the results obtained 2 p f 1 n i 1 n i g x i f x x i f i x i for eq 2 n is the number of simulations i g an indicator function f i x i is the sampling density function and x i are realizations of random variables for the i t h simulation in reliability assessment copulas are an important linking function between marginal distributions to enhance the estimation of the p f of a system 2 2 copula functions copulas are multivariate probability distribution with uniform marginals which allows for dependence modelling under uncertainty and are useful and flexible linking tools for random input variables the 1959 sklar s theorem serves as a foundation for the concept of copulas it explains the decomposition of multivariate distribution into univariate marginals and copulas which allows for the expression of dependency between variables nelsen 2006 equation 3 eq 4 and eq 5 show important expressions of sklar s theorem 3 f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n 4 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n i 1 n f i x i 5 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n p x 1 f 1 1 u 1 x 1 f n 1 u n where c is the unique copula distribution function which is the dependence structure f i x i is the continuous marginal distribution function for the i t h variable with n dimension random vector f is the joint distribution function with x i realization of the random variable x i the effect of copula creates simplicity in analysing the joint pdf f x 1 x 2 x n where c is the copula density function and u i the uniform marginal of the copula from sklar s theorem it becomes possible to create an approximate joint pdf from copulas and marginals of random variables among the commonly used copula functions are the elliptical copulas gaussian student t copula and the archimedean copulas clayton frank gumbel table a 1 of appendix a shows various copulas and their properties this study will limit optimal copula selection to those mentioned in this section the vine copula is a simple and efficient way of dealing with conditional dependence between variables nonlinear correlation and tail dependence it comprises a graphical object of nodes and edges with connected trees it uses bivariate copulas to construct an approximate joint pdf for multivariate distributions vine copulas have found wide applications in the financial insurance genetics and health sectors it is an evolving area in various engineering sectors for determining dependency between system variables chang and joe 2019 among the class of vine copulas used for linking marginals and dealing with the variables are the drawable vine d vine and the canonical vine c vine with the pdf relating its n dimensional variables as shown in eq 6 and eq 7 respectively aas et al 2009 6 f x 1 x n k 1 n f x k j 1 n 1 i 1 n j c i i j i 1 i j 1 f x i x i 1 x i

indicates the edges within each tree of the vine copula when a leading variable drives interaction between the data set a c vine copula is adopted aas et al 2009 in the absence of such variables the d vine copula provides a more direct approach in modelling dependency between variables this study adopts the d vine approach since the problems presented have no leading variable governing random variables interaction statistical independence test is essential in ascertaining a relationship linear or nonlinear between random variables especially in the first tree of a d vine structure the non parametric kendall s test which is simple to implement interpret and depends on the empirical kendall s tau τ k is applied in this study to test for independence between variables before copula type determination equation 8 shows an expression for kendall s test statistic where n represents the number of variable observations and t the test statistic value a null hypothesis of independence is accepted when t 1 96 at a 5 significance level genset and favre 2007 8 t 9 n n 1 2 2 n 5 τ k for copula selection this study adopts the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach in copula parameter θ determination and the akaike information criteria aic in the optimal selection of copulas for the d vine structure the aic value captures the information loss in determining θ while fitting various copula in the vine tree a minimum value of aic indicates less information loss the selection of the most suitable copula model for the vine is dependent on the copula with the minimum aic value zhai et al 2017 the aic creates a trade off between the goodness of fit of the copula and its simplicity the expression for the logarithm likelihood function aic and determination of θ are shown in eqs 9

essential in modelling with copulas in reliability study ρ p is the most common measure of dependence due to its simplicity in implementation this is not without its shortcomings of capturing only linear relationships between variables also ρ p is with the assumption of normality and homoscedasticity between the variables other measures of dependence are spearman s correlation ρ r h o which considers the correlation of ranks and τ k which represents the likelihood of concordance over discordance of data these other dependence measures are non parametric and independent of the marginal distribution joe 2014 3 framework for reliability assessment using vine copulas this section describes a five step approach for the reliability assessment of marine structures considering dependency

consists of nodes and edges with tree 1 containing all four random variables of the problem step 3 test for independence a test for independence of variables in tree 1 of the d vine structure shown in fig 3 is determined using kendall s test as obtained in eq 8 from the results table 3 since t 1 96 the null hypothesis of independence between variables is rejected at a 5 confidence level consequent

97m jacket support structure with four legs the structure is subjected to extreme sea state conditions at jeanned arc basin on canada s east coast this basin is a significant source for oil and gas exploration in canada and is located offshore newfoundland and labrador jacket structures are tubular steel structures fig 7 that can support drilling and production operations in shallow and intermediate water depths 4 1 statistical parameters and probability distribution the random loads considered on the structure include wave effects significant wave height h current at mean sea level

average magnitude and direction of 32 7 m s sw 235 o the wind is assumed to approach the jacket approximately 10m above the mean sea level the structure s response required to develop the lsf under extreme load conditions is the base shear force bsf the jacket support structure fig 7 is modelled and structural response obtained under ultimate limit state uls condition using structural analysis computer software sacs which is efficient for computer modelling of jackets and tubular structures the structure is assumed to be located at a water depth of 90m in the basin for modelling purposes information on prevailing and extreme environmental conditions in the offshore basin is obtained from site specific met ocean data and reports c core 2017 the essential statistical data summary used in this study is shown in table 6 also the observation data of random variables h v s v m obtained from the block maxima approach are fitted to extreme value distribution evd using the mle minimum aic method this is to determine the appropriate evd to fit the random variables related to environmental load on the jacket support structure as shown in table 7 this study assumes sea state data of a given random variable as independent and identically distributed and limits the selection to commonly used evd for ocean data weibull and gumbel as shown in table 7 p p and q q plots of appendix b fig

copula families using the mle approach table 10 the result from copula selection table 11 using the mle method is essential in characterizing the dependency between variables for the jacket reliability assessment the scatter plots of the random variables h v s v m suggest evidence of tail dependence between variables fig 9 4 3 metamodel and reliability assessment of the structure the lsf of most complex marine structures is implicit in form to reduce the computational burden of large runs using finite element method for reliability assessment a metamodel describing the jacket uls condition is developed using experimental design points and corresponding responses the experimental design is constructed using the infill sampling technique called latin hypercube sampling lhs and 150 sampling points are obtained from met ocean statistical summary data as shown in table 6 bsf responses of the jacket for the sampling points are determined using sacs at different environmental load angles the polynomial chaos kriging pck technique is used to develop metamodel for reliability analysis pck eq 13 combines the advantages of the polynomial chaos expansion pce and kriging metamodel as it captures both the global behaviour and local variability of the model 13 m p c k x α ε a y α ϕ α x σ 2 z x ω m p c k x is the approximated pck response σ 2 is the variance of the gaussian process z x ω represents the stationary gaussian process and ϕ α x represents the orthonormal polynomial with the corresponding coefficient y α the pck model substitutes the trend function of kriging with orthonormal polynomials schobi et al 2015 with sampling points copula functions and responses the pck approach is used to develop the metamodel required for reliability analysis the metamodel is validated with 50 environmental load data and their corresponding bsf responses which showed minimal deviation from the actual structural responses see table c 1 appendix c in this case g h v s v m m p c k x represents the lsf of the jacket structure next we determine the jacket s reliability from the constructed metamodel at various environmental load angles for reliability analysis this study focuses on the uls condition with its violation resulting in an eventual collapse of the jacket structure also it considers the dependency between environmental variables affecting the jacket support structure using a d vine copula current and wave loads are assumed to approach the jacket from the same direction and at a step of 45 o the metamodel is constructed at various approach angles to the structure considering dependency appendix c fig c 1 shows the convergence plot at various approach angles of the jacket structure s environmental load the contribution of the variables fig 10 to the reliability assessment using d vine copula is also determined to ascertain the essential and leading variables that affect the structure s reliability the is simulation approach 10 5 simulation cycles is used as a reference to compare results obtained from reliability assessment using d vine copula gaussian copula and statistically independent variables as shown in table 12 this comparison further emphasizes the effectiveness of the d vine copula approach in obtaining p f results close to that for the actual structure 4 4 discussion on results from the cantilever beam example in section 3 and the case study presented in this section it is evident that the introduction of d vine copula to model dependency between random variables provides a better approximation of the p f of complex marine structures compared to the use of gaussian copula or when variables are assumed statistically independent in the case of the cantilever beam p f result for the d vine copula approach was found to be relatively closer to the is benchmark result p f deviation 1 9 x 10 4 as shown in table 5 similarly p f results for all approach angles of the environmental loads to the jacket support structure table 12 shows the comparative superiority of d vine copulas in the reliability assessment to the benchmark values d vine copula provides robustness in its ability to capture nonlinearity tail dependence between variables as seen in the selection of clayton and gumbel copulas in the presented example and case study the d vine copula overcomes the gaussian copula s limitation which uses correlation values and can only capture linear dependence between variables although vine copulas are flexible for dependence modelling the results from the copula sensitivity plot for tree 1 of the cantilever beam fig 6 reveals that the clayton and gumbel copulas are highly sensitive to a change in copula parameter in contrast the frank copula is the least susceptible to parameter change the results suggest the need for optimal copula selection and accurate determination of copula parameters during dependence modelling of structures to obtain reliable results with a higher confidence level in this study the optimal copula s choice is made considering the copula type with the lowest aic value between random variables as illustrated in table 10 of the jacket support structure from the reliability analysis results table 12 of the support structure using the d vine copula gumbel and independent the highest p f 7 06 x 10 5 is observed at an approach angle of 225 o of wave and current to the jacket structure consequently this value indicates how the structure meets target reliability values and gives insight into critical environmental load direction required in the site specific structural reliability design and reassessment under uls conditions as shown in fig 10 the random variable h m provides approximately 70 of the contribution to the lsf and is the most significant variable in the reliability assessment of the jacket structure with the least contribution from v m m s in all directions the contribution of random variables to the lsf can help design engineers in variable screening and determine the essential variables during limit state design of marine structures although there exists a wide range of bivariate copulas this study is limited to a few known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel independent and frank however this can be expanded to consider more copulas families to determine the best fit copula for modelling dependency of marine structures under specific conditions the selection of probability distribution for random variables is limited to the known extreme weibull and gumbel and continuous distributions more distribution types can be considered especially in a data driven case to ascertain the d vine copula s efficacy in the reliability study of marine structures the case study jacket considered three dimensional input random ocean variables due to limited data with data available for different ocean parameters such as ice earthquakes and tidal effects the framework can be further investigated to determine its robustness 5 conclusion this paper develops a framework to model the dependency between variables of marine structures using a d vine copula the method overcomes the challenge of capturing the nonlinearity and tail dependence among variables that may affect its reliability evaluation and cannot be accounted for by the pearson correlation the authors applied the framework to on an offshore structure with results showing the efficiency of the d vine copula in providing a more accurate estimate of the p f compared to the gaussian copula or when variables were assumed statistically independent the bias in results using gaussian copula or statistically independent variables was evident in the jacket structure and cantilever beam problem presented in this paper d vine copula proved to be a powerful and flexible tool for modelling dependency between marine structural variables and ensuring an improved quality of reliability based assessment the framework presented in this study can be applied to different marine structures with higher dimension variables implicit lsf as well as low p f under various limit state conditions with the limitation of this study to commonly used copulas research into the use of other families of copulas can be investigated an optimal selection among various copulas can improve the quality of dependence modelling for

20752,an eulerian vorticity method based on a vorticity stream function formulation initially developed for the 2 d viscous unsteady flow past a circular cylinder is extended in the case of 2 d flow past a rotating cylinder in a rotational frame of reference the vorticity equation is shown to have the same form as in the case of an inertial frame of reference thus the general structure of the numerical algorithm remains the same as in the inertial frame of reference the non inertial effects only enter in the calculation of the velocity field and the vorticity induced velocity is modified to account for the non inertial contributions due to the frame rotation results from the current method for the flow past a rotating cylinder are presented and shown to agree very well with those from

this paper proposes a viscous vorticity equation visve method for 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow past a rotating circular cylinder in the non inertial frame of reference this method is based on the finite volume method fvm discretized vorticity stream function formulation of navier stokes n s equations continuing the work of 54 the vorticity methods solve for vorticity instead of velocity and in other words focus only on the vortical regions of the flow the number of unknowns reduces from 3 to 2 in 2 d by using the vorticity stream function formulation 25 41 these methods are proved to exhibit considerable accuracy and high performance compared with commonly used velocity based methods such as the n s methods 5 the discrete vortex methods can produce results with extremely high resolution to capture the complex and fine vortical structures in the flow 4 8 20 like any two edged sword benefits always come with challenges the vorticity methods also struggle from specific weaknesses especially while extending to 3 d space the divergence free condition is required by both velocity and vorticity which must be addressed by meticulous designed numerical approaches 47 the 3 d vorticity methods also increase the count of unknown variables by 2 in the system 25 besides specifying universally valid boundary conditions for the vorticity on the wall is not straight forward in general applications 21 nevertheless the vorticity methods are still espoused by numerous researchers because of their advantages in general the vorticity methods can be divided into 3 types namely the lagrangian methods the eulerian methods and the hybrid lagrangian eulerian methods the uniform inflow past a spinning circular cylinder also frequently referred to as the magnus effect has been extensively studied scientific curiosity arises mainly from the broad employment of cylindrical components in civil structures and mechanical systems another reason is that imposing rotational motion to a circular cylinder turns out to affect the surrounding flow substantially this type of flow is characterized by two parameters reynolds number r e and non dimensional rotation rate α the reynolds number is defined as r e u d ν based on the free stream speed u the diameter of the cylinder d and the kinematic viscosity of the fluids ν the rotation rate describes how fast the cylinder spins with respect to the uniform inflow and is given as α ω d 2 u where ω is the angular velocity of the cylinder about its own origin one noteworthy topic of the flow past a rotating cylinder is the wake dynamics including flow regimes and various transitions depending on different combinations of reynolds number and rate of rotation a myriad of investigations have been conducted to identify and classify the flow regimes by the pioneer researchers and a comprehensive review was given by 37 generally four flow regimes are observed in 2 d at low reynolds numbers the instability of flow leads to the formation of von karman vortex shedding at low rotation rates named as mode i shedding 16 18 further increase of α will suppress the boundary layer separation and therefore prevent vortex shedding from the cylinder wall as a result the flow eventually develops into steady state i at a specific velocity condition 26 29 at even higher rotation rates the vortex shedding resurrects within only a narrow range of α this is referred to as the mode ii shedding characterized by only one sided vortex shedding at a much lower frequency than that of the two sided karman shedding in mode i 31 44 45 if α goes beyond the higher boundary of mode ii shedding range the fully developed flow becomes steady again recognized as steady state ii 35 36 the three dimensionality of this flow began to draw more attention in the latest publications but quite a few studies had been documented variations along the span wise direction of the cylinder caused by centrifugal instabilities were found to exist 13 32 35 36 notably 35 37 summarized the transition from 2 d to 3 d and showed a diagram marking the stability boundaries of various modes detected based on r e and α the magnus robins force is generated by a rotating object translating through the fluid 49 this force perpendicular to the direction of the relative inflow velocity is caused by the difference in pressure on opposite sides of the rotating object net mean lift force appears when the rotation of the cylinder breaks the symmetry of wake with respect to the cylinder centreline the flow is only partially attached to the cylinder and separates from the regions of the cylinder with reversing speed that negates the free stream velocity resulting in a net lift force perpendicular to the inflow direction and pointing to the cylinder side where separation happens the lift and drag forces experiencing by the cylinder have been quantified the mean lift coefficient is found to increase almost linearly with the rotation rate at lower values of α and grows parabolically with the rotation rate for α 2 before reaching the mode ii shedding range 6 18 26 44 33 34 claimed that the maximum lift coefficient exerted on a spinning cylinder in uniform flow is 4 π however this limit can indeed be transcended as proved both numerically and experimentally 6 15 26 46 a well known engineering application of the magnus robins force is the flettner rotor the flettner rotor 39 provides an alternative way of vessel propulsion extracting energy from a renewable source that is available almost everywhere on the oceans wind also the limits on carbon emissions and the increasing requirements on using fossil fuels in the most efficient and environmentally beneficial way constantly urge engineers and scientists to seek for better substitutions for conventional propulsion systems 11 12 conducted comprehensive numerical investigations to analyze the effects of the spin ratio rotor aspect ratio and end plates ratio on the performance of a flettner rotor 3 carried out wind tunnel experiments to understand the influence of reynolds number on the performance of a flettner rotor at high reynolds numbers the studies in the current work may provide an effective vorticity method for the simulation analysis and design of a flettner rotor another important engineering application of the magnus robins force is the ship stabilizers 23 used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method combined with the pid controller to model the magnus rotating roll stabilizer using two spinning cylinders on both the port side and starboard side of the ship and confirmed its effectiveness in reducing the roll motion of the hull 28 numerically studied the roll and heave motion of a full scale motor yacht mounted with a magnus rotating roll stabilizer in turbulent flow and significant decreases in the roll motions were observed the current method may also be able to handle the turbulent flow after incorporating the turbulence model 56 the current numerical scheme was validated by applying to the uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 this type of flow is typified by significant separations and complex vortex body as well as vortex vortex interactions the eulerian centrifugal translational and coriolis acceleration terms introduced by the non inertial frame rotation into the governing equations unduly complicate the numerical algorithms used to solve the system 43 the authors will show later that the present numerical scheme can remain simple implementation and meanwhile capable of handling the non inertial effects due to the non inertial frame motions the present results were compared with the experimental measurements and numerical predictions of established benchmark tests remarkably this paper successfully recovers the two steady solution states steady state i and steady state ii and the two vortex shedding modes mode i shedding and mode ii shedding the velocity field predicted by the current method is highly consistent with the benchmark results and the streamlines also agree well with the observations in experiments in addition the phase diagram of lift and drag forces calculated by the present method also compares favorably with published results the primary objective of this work is to propose a compact and efficient method that effectively handles the non inertial effects due to frame rotation in a simple and affordable way to numerically simulate the flow past a rotating cylinder under the non inertial frame this paper is an extension of the conservative scheme based on the vorticity stream function formulation of n s equations as detailed by 54 who have shown the method to be spatially compact and computationally efficient and meanwhile capable of modeling the dynamics of vortices in the presence of wall boundaries the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations under the non inertial frame is discretized using the cell centered fvm in addition the analytical formula used to recover the vorticity induced stream functions for a given vorticity distribution is improved to account for the contribution from frame rotation further a vorticity creation scheme is implemented to determine the amount of vorticity generated on the wall by enforcing the zero velocity boundary condition and release the created vorticity into the flow domain by solving a diffusion equation a comprehensive explanation of the numerical schemes that have been proved to guarantee both the continuity of velocity and the conservation of vorticity at all times is given by 54 the method has already been successfully extended to 3 d in the inertial frame of 53 the method has also been applied to the flow past a rotating propeller and some preliminary results were given by 51 however the results of propeller flow did not correlate well with other methods due to a lack of correction on velocity due to the rotating frame which triggered the current work on 2 d flow past a rotating cylinder the remainder is organized as follows section 2 describes the overall model and governing equations the numerical algorithms are explained in detail in section 3 section 4 presents the numerical results of uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α between 0 0 and 5 0 to validate the proposed method under the non inertial rotating frame finally the conclusions and future work are summarized in section 5 2 governing equations considering a non inertial frame that translates with a time dependent velocity u t and rotates with a time dependent angular velocity ω t four additional acceleration terms are introduced into the velocity pressure formulation of n s equations due to the non inertial effects 1 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u d ω d t r p 2 ω u ω ω r p d u d t 2 u 0 where u is the velocity under the non inertial frame t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluids ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids and r p is the relative position vector with respect to the center of rotation the velocity in the non inertial frame of reference should include the contributions from both frame translation and frame rotation besides the velocity under the inertial frame u 3 u u ω r p u the problem of fluid dynamics can be partitioned into two consecutive steps the kinetic process and the kinematic process 48 55 in the present model the kinetic process describes the development of vorticity in the form of convection and diffusion the kinematic process relates the velocity field to the vorticity field at any given time it has been derived in appendix that the centrifugal and translational acceleration terms can be absorbed into the pressure term as potential in eq 1 and so the curl operation on this equation will result in a vorticity transport equation representing the kinetics of the flow without any additional acceleration term under the non inertial frame the authors remark that this equation takes the same form as the one in the inertial frame of reference 4 ω t u ω ν 2 ω with the initial and boundary conditions 5 u t 0 u ω r p u u b on body surface u u ω r p at infinity where u b is the velocity of the wall surface since the 2 d cylinder is considered to be stationary under the non inertial frame u b 0 ω is the vorticity relative to the inertial frame and does not include the contribution 2 ω from the frame rotation the initial condition implies that the flow starts impulsively from rest in 2 d the velocity u u v can be represented by the gradient of stream function ψ as 6 u ψ y ψ x the kinematics of the flow is described by the definition of vorticity and the continuity equation notably the vorticity in eq 4 is relative to the inertial frame of reference 7 ω u v x u y then it is necessary to recover the velocity field from the newly obtained vorticity field the velocity field can be uniquely determined by knowing a vorticity field according to helmholtz theory the velocity field and vorticity field are related by a poisson s equation which is solved using green s function in 2 d and an integral representation is achieved 24 8 ψ x c ψ ω x c ψ κ x c ψ b x c 9 ψ ω x c ϒ ω x ln x c x 2 π d υ 10 ψ κ x c ϒ κ x ln x c x 2 π d σ where x c is the location where the stream function is evaluated and the dummy variable x runs through the integral domain ϒ covering all the vortical flow regions κ x is the wall surface vortex sheet due to the solid body rotation ψ ω x c is the stream function induced by the vorticity in the interior of the flow domain ψ κ x c which can be equivalently seen as the rotational correction term is the stream function induced by the wall surface vortex sheet due to rotation ψ b x c is the stream function of the background flow this integral form bypasses the explicit specification of velocity boundary conditions at the outer boundaries of the computational domain notice that the calculation of ψ ω x c only covers the regions of flow with non zero vorticity the kinetic process and kinematic process of the problem are interconnected with each other the kinetic process necessitates the velocity to convect the vorticity and the kinematic process needs the vorticity to predict the velocity for a known vorticity field and the corresponding velocity field solving the vorticity transport equation 4 convects and diffuses the vorticity in the computational domain and marches the solutions to the next time step at the new time step the velocity induced by the redistributed vorticity is evaluated by eq 8 9 and 10 this is a well established legitimate scheme and has been used in many vorticity based methods 48 55 in addition to solve the vorticity equation 4 explicit vorticity boundary conditions must be established please note that the vorticity can only be created at the wall and the vorticity in the flow domain is distributed from the wall by the vorticity equation a vorticity creation scheme is implemented to determine the amount of vorticity released into the flow domain at every time step the current method is an implementation of the vorticity stream function formulation obviously the frame translation and rotation are considered into the calculations only through the velocity field eq 4 may seem to be a little peculiar at the first sight since the velocity and vorticity in a single equation are with respect to different frames nonetheless this feature actually gives rise to simple numerical implementation and high computational performance 3 numerical algorithms 3 1 kinetics vorticity transport equation the vorticity transport equation 4 is discretized using the cell centered fvm in space and the alternating directional implicit adi scheme 30 is utilized to advance the vorticity in time the discretized equation is eventually solved iteratively by using the deferred correction technique 38 to allow for the employment of high order schemes such as quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick 14 22 applying the gauss theorem and the crank nicolson c n method to the conservative form of the vorticity transport equation over the control volume as shown in fig 1 eq 4 is broken in two sweeps as 11 ω t δ t 2 1 δ t 2 a c 1 d 1 1 1 δ t 2 a c 2 d 2 ω t ω t δ t 1 δ t 2 a c 2 d 2 1 1 δ t 2 a c 1 d 1 ω t δ t 2 where c 1 2 and d 1 2 are the convective and diffusive coefficients in two sweeps and a denotes the area of the control volume c 1 and c 2 are collections of the convective flux a f u n d l ψ end ψ start in the corresponding directions respectively with n defined as the vector normal to the cell edge using the stream function at the vertices of a cell to determine the flux can guarantee zero net volumetric mass flux of the cell at all times the convective terms are interpolated by a hybrid convection limiter a blend of the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme to keep the results monotone for large gradients and meanwhile maintain the order of accuracy for small and mild gradients 50 d 1 and d 2 are evaluated from the diffusive term ν n δ l in two sweeps separately where δ l represents the length of the cell edge these terms are calculated by a linear interpolation scheme since only orthogonal meshes are employed in this work further the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition ω 0 is specified at the far field boundary indicating that the computational domain should cover all the significant vortical regions the homogeneous neumann boundary condition ω n 0 is suggested by 9 at both the out flow boundary and the wall boundary the numerical treatments of the vorticity transport equation under the non inertial frame is exactly the same as that relative to the inertial frame 54 at least in this aspect the current method shows the unparalleled advantage of simple implementations of conservative or high order schemes including fvm c n and quick over the n s methods while solving the dynamics of fluids in the non inertial frame of reference also fewer terms in the governing equation lead to lighter intermediate calculations such as interpolations between solving the linear system at consecutive time steps 3 2 kinematics vorticity induced stream function upon obtaining the vorticity at the new time step the stream functions at the vertices of the mesh cells must be determined using eq 8 in order to march the solutions to the next time step by considering a constant vorticity distribution ω within every mesh cell the integral term in eq 9 is broken into the sum of the influence of each individual mesh cell with non zero vorticity 12 ψ ω x c i 1 n ϒ ω x i ϒ i ln x c x i 2 π d υ where n ϒ is the number of mesh cells with non zero vorticity in the computational domain similarly assuming a constant strength of wall surface vortex sheet κ on every wall panel the integral term in eq 10 is broken into the sum of the contribution from all the wall panels 13 ψ κ x c j 1 m ϒ b κ x j ϒ j ln x c x j 2 π d σ where m ϒ b is number of panels on the surface of the cylinder hence the induced stream function ψ x c ψ ω x c ψ κ x c ψ b x c is calculated in a discrete sense but the integral over one element inside the summation still remains undetermined the surface integral in eq 12 is evaluated using an analytical solution 54 in an exact way in contrast eq 13 integrates along a curve and cannot be treated using the same formula the flow field induced by the surface vortex sheet should satisfy two conditions 1 it is a potential field since it should not bring more vorticity into the flow 2 its velocity field has zero divergence because it must be governed by the continuity equation in fact the flow field described by eq 13 in the 2 d circular cylinder case is a free vortex which is the irrotational flow of a rankine vortex therefore alternatively and precisely 14 ψ κ r ω r 2 ln r where r d 2 is the radius of the circular cylinder and the circulation of this rankine vortex depends only on the rotational speed γ 2 π κ r 2 π ω r 2 strictly speaking eq 14 should also include a constant but the constant does not matter in the numerical solutions since the convective flux of eq 7 is determined by the difference of stream function on the neighboring two vertices which cancels out the constant the authors stress again that this is a special treatment that only works for a 2 d circular cylinder and eq 13 evaluated either numerically or analytically should be employed to find the stream function due to the surface vortex sheet when the body is in arbitrary shapes traversing the 2 d domain with a mesh of n cells to get the stream function at all vertices is a full o n 2 summation which is comparatively expensive but sill affordable considering the limited scale of the current model to improve the overall performance on computing clusters this process is paralleled using open mp and the work is divided equally and assigned to all the threads to perform concurrently 54 3 3 vorticity creation on the wall the kinetic aspect drives the evolution of vorticity inside the flow domain with time and the kinematic aspect recovers the solenoidal velocity field corresponding to the given vorticity field at any instant of time however neither of these two procedures controls the local generation of vorticity on the wall boundaries as a matter of fact the vorticity in the interior of the domain is all originally generated on the wall surface and the kinetic process only redistributes the vorticity in the domain the vorticity generation process can be modeled as determining a spurious vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder 7 this vorticity creation process acts as the enforcement of non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions of the velocity at the wall and the strength of the surface vortex sheet is determined along the way 20 let us assume that the solutions have just been marched from the previous time step t δ t to the current time step t but the velocity relative to the non inertial frame induced by the newly computed vorticity ω ˆ t has non zero components on the wall surface here we define a cylinder oriented polar coordinate system s n where n indicates the radial direction and s represents the circumferential direction the non penetrating boundary condition is enforced by solving a boundary element method bem 2 solver and a potential distribution on the wall surface ϕ is acquired by applying the following boundary condition 15 ϕ n ψ t s subsequently the strength of the vortex sheet γ is the summation of the gradient of ϕ and the residual velocity tangential to the wall direction 16 γ ϕ s ψ t n it is necessary to clarify that the potential ϕ is only used to determine the strength of the surface vortex sheet γ and the interior of the flow domain is not influenced by the potential the spurious vortex sheet is then converted into a vorticity flux across the wall boundary 20 and released into the flow domain from all the panels on the wall via viscous diffusion 17 ω γ t ν 2 ω γ ν ω γ n γ δ t on body surface ω γ t 0 at infinity ω γ t δ t 0 where ω γ is the augmentation vorticity the above system is numerically resolved using a standard fvm this releasing step is equivalent to imposing the no slip boundary condition eventually the vorticity at the current time step t reads 18 ω t ω ˆ t ω γ t 3 4 body forces the body force on the circular cylinder comprises of two parts pressure force and friction force the pressure p variation along the body surface is directly related to the vorticity production rate on the wall surface 19 p s μ ω n where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluids it is obvious that the vorticity flux ω n has already been calculated during the vorticity creation stage given the pressure at a reference point the pressure everywhere on the body surface can be numerically determined the wall shear stress τ is computed from the vorticity on the body surface the contribution from the frame rotation should also be incorporated into the friction as 20 τ μ ω 2 ω the total body force acting on the circular cylinder f is the sum of pressure force and friction force which are calculated by integrating the pressure and the shear stress along the body surface ϒ b respectively 21 f ϒ b p n d σ ϒ b τ s d σ the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of the body are non dimensionalized as 22 c l f e 1 ρ u 2 r c d f e 2 ρ u 2 r where e 1 and e 2 are the unit directional vector perpendicular and parallel to the oncoming flow direction respectively 4 numerical results of uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder magnus effect the present method is used to simulate the uniform flow past a rotating cylinder as validations to prove that the method is accurate and reliable in solving the fluid dynamics under the rotational frame in this problem the uniform inflow goes along the x direction and hits the circular cylinder with a diameter of d the cylinder located at the origin x d y d 0 0 rotates in the anti clockwise direction as illustrated in fig 2 notice that the cylinder rotation is resolved in the non inertial frame of reference by assuming there is a frame rotating with the same angular velocity as the cylinder both the uniform inflow and the frame rotation start impulsively from the rest the computational domain employed in this simulation is circular and has a radius of 200 d the mesh is uniform in the circumferential direction and exponential in the radial direction as shown in fig 3 the size of the computational domain is chosen to be relatively large to capture and visualize the vortex structures in the wake during long time simulations again the current method only performs the numerical calculations in the vortical region which is merely a small portion of the entire computational domain in this section the definitions of reynolds number r e and rotation rate α are already given in the introduction part the non dimensional time t is defined as 23 t t u r in this section the results such as streamlines vorticity contours and body forces of the flow past a rotating cylinder predicted by the proposed method at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 are presented the simulations were conducted for a time long enough such that the flow was fully developed and distinguishable features could be identified measured and analyzed the present results are compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental measurements of 10 and the numerical predictions of 26 the main characteristics of this flow have been systemically investigated in the experiments of 1 10 27 numerically solved the vorticity stream function formulation using the third order upwind scheme to simulate this type of flow which successfully recovered the experimental results of 10 40 42 then studied the temporal flow instability at a higher reynolds number r e 3800 using the same method and uncovered a new instability later 26 established a finite element formulation of numerically investigating the flow at r e 200 however the new instability shown by 40 was not discussed by 26 4 1 grid and time step size independence study a grid independence study is conducted for the flow at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α 2 07 by using meshes with multiple levels of resolution circumferential direction normal direction including the coarse grid 100 141 the medium grid 160 161 and the fine grid 200 200 the evolution of lift coefficients in time displayed in fig 4 a demonstrates that the results become independent of the mesh quality as the resolution becomes finer additionally the time step size independence study is performed by using the fine grid resolution with various time step sizes δ t 1 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 3 and 4 0 1 0 4 respectively the comparison in fig 4 b verifies that the evolution of lift coefficients is independent of the time step size if δ t is smaller than 2 0 1 0 3 4 2 a glimpse of the circular cylinder rotating in the quiescent flow the current method is validated by applying to a rotating cylinder in the quiescent flow the radius of the computational domain is set to be 17 d and the mesh resolution is 200 100 circumferential direction normal direction notice that there is no uniform inflow in this case and the reynolds number is defined as r e d ω r ν the flow at r e 500 and ω 5 0 r a d s is simulated using the current method the evolutions of tangential velocity u θ and vorticity ω distributions along the radial direction r are given in fig 5 the present results are compared with the solutions of 1 d n s equation 24 derived and simplified in the polar coordinate system the governing equation is solved using the finite difference method fdm in the inertial frame of reference by considering a moving wall boundary as is observed the results evaluated by the two methods overlap with each other 24 u θ t ν 1 r r r u θ r u θ r 2 after the impulsive start of the rotation the flow is initialized with a vorticity field which has a total circulation equal to γ 2 π ω r 2 in the beginning the vorticity is concentrated near the cylinder and forms a very thin boundary layer the vorticity gradually diffuses into the domain and the boundary layer becomes thicker in time with a decreasing maximum magnitude as the vorticity covers more parts of the domain the influence of the rotating cylinder affects increasing portions of the domain and the border of the zero velocity zone is pushed further away from the cylinder to some point the non zero velocity will finally reach the boundary of the computational domain which has a predefined finite radius the current method is able to predict the far field boundary conditions correctly and does not require unperturbed far field boundary conditions therefore although the radius of the domain is only 17 d the results calculated by the present method maintain high accuracy eventually this type of flow will behave like a rankine vortex when it is fully developed and reaches a steady state 4 3 velocity field validation at r e 200 and α 0 5 1 0 and 2 07 the streamlines obtained from the present simulations are compared with the experimental observations of 10 at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α 0 5 given at a sequential of flow times in figs 6a 6d the first vortex ① was formed quickly on the upper side after the start of the motion at about t 2 0 the second vortex ② is observed on the lower side both vortices grow with time as the vortex ① separates from the cylinder at time t 4 0 the vortex ① detaches from the cylinder and its strength starts to decrease as propagating further downstream meanwhile the vortex ② also begins to split from the cylinder at t 7 0 which leads to the creation of the third vortex ③ above vortex ② on the upper side and the fourth vortex ④ below vortex ② on the lower side these two new vortices develop simultaneously along with the separation of vortex ② which finally fades as moving downstream vortex ③ and vortex ④ grow and become closer to each other in time and are eventually merged into one larger vortex that dominates the wake at t 12 0 the comparisons of streamlines at larger rotation rates are also given figs 7a 7c show the results at r e 200 and α 1 0 and fig 8 displays the results at r e 200 and α 2 07 at α 1 0 the first vortex ① is formed immediately after the motion begins however the second vortex ② does not appear on the upper side until t 5 0 after the vortex ① fully detaches from the cylinder almost at the same time as the emergence of vortex ② the third vortex ③ is generated also on the upper side but below the vortex ② yet the vortex ③ begins to separate and move away from the cylinder first resulting in the creation of the fourth vortex ④ on the lower side at roughly t 8 0 the vortex ② and vortex ④ grow and approach each other gradually and are eventually merged at t 10 0 at rotation rate α 2 07 the first vortex ① dominates the wake from the beginning to time t 7 0 before the second vortex ② is formed on the upper side it is observed that the current predictions are almost the same as the experimental measurements performed by 10 the streamlines at r e 200 and α 0 5 1 0 were also given by 27 which can also be used to validate the current results in addition the boundary layer profiles in terms of the velocity component in the x direction u and the velocity component in the y direction v along the radial direction at θ 0 which is the rear centerline of the cylinder as shown in fig 2 are validated against the experimental data quantified by 10 the boundary layer comparison at r e 200 α 0 5 is illustrated graphically in fig 9 and the comparison at r e 200 α 1 0 is given in fig 10 the vortices induce reversed flow that moves against the uniform inflow and so negative values of u velocity are observed inside the recirculation zone behind the cylinder the magnitude of negative u could roughly indicate the size of the recirculation zone this magnitude increases to a maximum value at a certain time and then decreases to be specific this value appears at t 4 0 for α 0 5 and t 3 0 for α 1 0 respectively it is noteworthy to point out that the evolution of velocity profile in time is a direct result of the development of vortices in the wake the trough of the velocity profile increases with the growth of the first shedding vortex after reaching the maximum value the trough starts to drop when the vortex begins to detach from the cylinder thus the magnitude of negative velocity differs between α 0 5 and α 1 0 since the structure strength and size of the shedding vortex vary at different rotation rates the velocity field predicted by the current method closely matches the measurements of 10 4 4 body force and vorticity field validation at r e 200 and α between 0 0 and 5 0 the evolution of lift coefficient c l in time at various rotation rates is summarized and shown in fig 11 fig 12 collects all the phase diagrams of lift coefficient and drag coefficient at the chosen rotation rates in addition the intervals of α chosen here are the reference values used in the work of 26 so that the present results can be fairly compared with those predicted using the velocity pressure formulation of n s method in their study these intervals were quantitatively determined according to the distinguished states of established flow it is seen in particular that the flow regimes exhibit four distinct stages as the rotation rates increases at low rotation rates 0 α 1 91 the well known karman vortex shedding happens in the wake of the cylinder the mode i shedding shown in fig 13 the wake will twist towards the direction of cylinder rotation and the faster the cylinder spins the larger the distortion is the vortex shedding will be suppressed by the cylinder rotation for rotation rates 1 91 α 4 35 given in fig 14 as graphically illustrated in fig 15 at r e 200 and α 2 5 vortex shedding still exits at the beginning but it fades with time during the vortex shedding suppression stage eventually the flow can reach a steady state steady state i given enough time of evolution when the rotation rate is further increased to be 4 35 α 4 75 a much stronger vortex shedding phase which is described in fig 16 is initiated again this is the mode ii shedding in which the cylinder is subject to oscillating body forces with a much larger amplitude and period than it is at smaller rotation rates for rotation rates 4 75 α 5 0 the flow develops directly to the steady state without intermediate vortex shedding phase which is the steady state ii and displayed in fig 17 generally the average lift on the cylinder increases with the rotation rate α in other words raising the rotation rate of the cylinder will directly lead to a rise in the thrust provided by the flettner rotor however one needs to avoid the possible vibrations resulting from the unsteady vortex shedding for certain range of rotation rates especially the mode ii vortex shedding must be accurately detected and prevented since the triggering rotation rates are hidden in between the two steady modes and the periodic body forces have much larger magnitudes 5 conclusions and future work a compact viscous vorticity method that effectively resolves the non inertial effects due to a rotating frame of reference is proposed to simulate the flow past a rotating cylinder the current study serves as an indispensable extension and supplement to the previous work of 54 proving the method to be highly conservative and efficient it turns out that the vorticity transport equation in the non inertial frame of reference keeps the same form as that in the inertial frame of reference the biggest advantage of the current method is that the additional acceleration terms which appear in the non inertial navier stokes equations do not appear in the vorticity equation thus allowing to maintain the same numerical implementation as in the case of the inertial frame of reference the non inertial vorticity transport equation is solved using the cell centered finite volume method the formula for evaluating the vorticity induced stream function is modified to accommodate the non inertial effects properly the advantages of the current method over the other numerical approaches were discussed in detail by 54 based on the conclusions given by 43 the authors emphasize the key benefits of the vorticity method in addressing the non inertial problems are as follows no additional acceleration terms due to the non inertial effects appear in the vorticity transport equation in other words the governing equation in the non inertial frame of reference keeps the same form as that in the inertial frame of reference thus allowing for simple implementations of fvm and high order numerical schemes such as quick the constant vorticity 2 ω due to the frame rotation never enters in the vorticity equation otherwise we would have to consider the contribution of this constant vorticity distributed globally and the mesh grid would need to cover the entire space including that inside the wall and beyond the far field the non inertial frame motions are considered into the solution only through the velocity field the vorticity field is not directly affected by the non inertial terms during the calculations the method was first applied to the pure rotating cylinder in quiescent flow without any uniform inflow at reynolds number r e 500 and angular velocity ω 5 0 rad s and the velocity and vorticity fields were found to agree very well with those from the solution of the navier stokes equations furthermore the proposed vorticity method was validated by simulating the uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder which is also known as the magnus effect at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 the present results agree very well with the results of available numerical studies and experimental investigations verifying that the current method has high accuracy in handling the dynamics of vortices under the non inertial frame of reference this work successfully reproduces the two steady solution states and the two vortex shedding modes observed and quantified in the established benchmark tests periodic vortex shedding happens for 0 0 α 1 91 the vortex shedding is gradually suppressed by the cylinder rotation and the flow eventually reaches a steady state for 1 91 α 4 35 a stronger vortex shedding phase with a larger amplitude and period is triggered for 4 35 α 4 75 the flow develops straight to a steady state without any transitional periodic vortex shedding phase for 4 75 α 5 0 the current method is designed to resolve the 2 d laminar flow past solid bodies in both the inertial and non inertial frame of reference effectively and efficiently the authors remark that the method is capable of handling both lifting and bluff bodies of arbitrary shape even though the results documented in this paper are about the flow past a circular cylinder this method has already been extended to treat the turbulent flow around a 2 d hydrofoil and a cylinder 19 56 also the 3 d version of the method is currently under development and reliable solutions have already been obtained for the flow past a 3 d hydrofoil under an inertial frame 52 53 the current method could further be coupled with optimizing algorithms to systemically and automatically improve the design of flettner rotors credit authorship

20752,an eulerian vorticity method based on a vorticity stream function formulation initially developed for the 2 d viscous unsteady flow past a circular cylinder is extended in the case of 2 d flow past a rotating cylinder in a rotational frame of reference the vorticity equation is shown to have the same form as in the case of an inertial frame of reference thus the general structure of the numerical algorithm remains the same as in the inertial frame of reference the non inertial effects only enter in the calculation of the velocity field and the vorticity induced velocity is modified to account for the non inertial contributions due to the frame rotation results from the current method for the flow past a rotating cylinder are presented and shown to agree very well with those from

this paper proposes a viscous vorticity equation visve method for 2 d incompressible unsteady viscous flow past a rotating circular cylinder in the non inertial frame of reference this method is based on the finite volume method fvm discretized vorticity stream function formulation of navier stokes n s equations continuing the work of 54 the vorticity methods solve for vorticity instead of velocity and in other words focus only on the vortical regions of the flow the number of unknowns reduces from 3 to 2 in 2 d by using the vorticity stream function formulation 25 41 these methods are proved to exhibit considerable accuracy and high performance compared with commonly used velocity based methods such as the n s methods 5 the discrete vortex methods can produce results with extremely high resolution to capture the complex and fine vortical structures in the flow 4 8 20 like any two edged sword benefits always come with challenges the vorticity methods also struggle from specific weaknesses especially while extending to 3 d space the divergence free condition is required by both velocity and vorticity which must be addressed by meticulous designed numerical approaches 47 the 3 d vorticity methods also increase the count of unknown variables by 2 in the system 25 besides specifying universally valid boundary conditions for the vorticity on the wall is not straight forward in general applications 21 nevertheless the vorticity methods are still espoused by numerous researchers because of their advantages in general the vorticity methods can be divided into 3 types namely the lagrangian methods the eulerian methods and the hybrid lagrangian eulerian methods the uniform inflow past a spinning circular cylinder also frequently referred to as the magnus effect has been extensively studied scientific curiosity arises mainly from the broad employment of cylindrical components in civil structures and mechanical systems another reason is that imposing rotational motion to a circular cylinder turns out to affect the surrounding flow substantially this type of flow is characterized by two parameters reynolds number r e and non dimensional rotation rate α the reynolds number is defined as r e u d ν based on the free stream speed u the diameter of the cylinder d and the kinematic viscosity of the fluids ν the rotation rate describes how fast the cylinder spins with respect to the uniform inflow and is given as α ω d 2 u where ω is the angular velocity of the cylinder about its own origin one noteworthy topic of the flow past a rotating cylinder is the wake dynamics including flow regimes and various transitions depending on different combinations of reynolds number and rate of rotation a myriad of investigations have been conducted to identify and classify the flow regimes by the pioneer researchers and a comprehensive review was given by 37 generally four flow regimes are observed in 2 d at low reynolds numbers the instability of flow leads to the formation of von karman vortex shedding at low rotation rates named as mode i shedding 16 18 further increase of α will suppress the boundary layer separation and therefore prevent vortex shedding from the cylinder wall as a result the flow eventually develops into steady state i at a specific velocity condition 26 29 at even higher rotation rates the vortex shedding resurrects within only a narrow range of α this is referred to as the mode ii shedding characterized by only one sided vortex shedding at a much lower frequency than that of the two sided karman shedding in mode i 31 44 45 if α goes beyond the higher boundary of mode ii shedding range the fully developed flow becomes steady again recognized as steady state ii 35 36 the three dimensionality of this flow began to draw more attention in the latest publications but quite a few studies had been documented variations along the span wise direction of the cylinder caused by centrifugal instabilities were found to exist 13 32 35 36 notably 35 37 summarized the transition from 2 d to 3 d and showed a diagram marking the stability boundaries of various modes detected based on r e and α the magnus robins force is generated by a rotating object translating through the fluid 49 this force perpendicular to the direction of the relative inflow velocity is caused by the difference in pressure on opposite sides of the rotating object net mean lift force appears when the rotation of the cylinder breaks the symmetry of wake with respect to the cylinder centreline the flow is only partially attached to the cylinder and separates from the regions of the cylinder with reversing speed that negates the free stream velocity resulting in a net lift force perpendicular to the inflow direction and pointing to the cylinder side where separation happens the lift and drag forces experiencing by the cylinder have been quantified the mean lift coefficient is found to increase almost linearly with the rotation rate at lower values of α and grows parabolically with the rotation rate for α 2 before reaching the mode ii shedding range 6 18 26 44 33 34 claimed that the maximum lift coefficient exerted on a spinning cylinder in uniform flow is 4 π however this limit can indeed be transcended as proved both numerically and experimentally 6 15 26 46 a well known engineering application of the magnus robins force is the flettner rotor the flettner rotor 39 provides an alternative way of vessel propulsion extracting energy from a renewable source that is available almost everywhere on the oceans wind also the limits on carbon emissions and the increasing requirements on using fossil fuels in the most efficient and environmentally beneficial way constantly urge engineers and scientists to seek for better substitutions for conventional propulsion systems 11 12 conducted comprehensive numerical investigations to analyze the effects of the spin ratio rotor aspect ratio and end plates ratio on the performance of a flettner rotor 3 carried out wind tunnel experiments to understand the influence of reynolds number on the performance of a flettner rotor at high reynolds numbers the studies in the current work may provide an effective vorticity method for the simulation analysis and design of a flettner rotor another important engineering application of the magnus robins force is the ship stabilizers 23 used the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method combined with the pid controller to model the magnus rotating roll stabilizer using two spinning cylinders on both the port side and starboard side of the ship and confirmed its effectiveness in reducing the roll motion of the hull 28 numerically studied the roll and heave motion of a full scale motor yacht mounted with a magnus rotating roll stabilizer in turbulent flow and significant decreases in the roll motions were observed the current method may also be able to handle the turbulent flow after incorporating the turbulence model 56 the current numerical scheme was validated by applying to the uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 this type of flow is typified by significant separations and complex vortex body as well as vortex vortex interactions the eulerian centrifugal translational and coriolis acceleration terms introduced by the non inertial frame rotation into the governing equations unduly complicate the numerical algorithms used to solve the system 43 the authors will show later that the present numerical scheme can remain simple implementation and meanwhile capable of handling the non inertial effects due to the non inertial frame motions the present results were compared with the experimental measurements and numerical predictions of established benchmark tests remarkably this paper successfully recovers the two steady solution states steady state i and steady state ii and the two vortex shedding modes mode i shedding and mode ii shedding the velocity field predicted by the current method is highly consistent with the benchmark results and the streamlines also agree well with the observations in experiments in addition the phase diagram of lift and drag forces calculated by the present method also compares favorably with published results the primary objective of this work is to propose a compact and efficient method that effectively handles the non inertial effects due to frame rotation in a simple and affordable way to numerically simulate the flow past a rotating cylinder under the non inertial frame this paper is an extension of the conservative scheme based on the vorticity stream function formulation of n s equations as detailed by 54 who have shown the method to be spatially compact and computationally efficient and meanwhile capable of modeling the dynamics of vortices in the presence of wall boundaries the vorticity stream function formulation of the n s equations under the non inertial frame is discretized using the cell centered fvm in addition the analytical formula used to recover the vorticity induced stream functions for a given vorticity distribution is improved to account for the contribution from frame rotation further a vorticity creation scheme is implemented to determine the amount of vorticity generated on the wall by enforcing the zero velocity boundary condition and release the created vorticity into the flow domain by solving a diffusion equation a comprehensive explanation of the numerical schemes that have been proved to guarantee both the continuity of velocity and the conservation of vorticity at all times is given by 54 the method has already been successfully extended to 3 d in the inertial frame of 53 the method has also been applied to the flow past a rotating propeller and some preliminary results were given by 51 however the results of propeller flow did not correlate well with other methods due to a lack of correction on velocity due to the rotating frame which triggered the current work on 2 d flow past a rotating cylinder the remainder is organized as follows section 2 describes the overall model and governing equations the numerical algorithms are explained in detail in section 3 section 4 presents the numerical results of uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α between 0 0 and 5 0 to validate the proposed method under the non inertial rotating frame finally the conclusions and future work are summarized in section 5 2 governing equations considering a non inertial frame that translates with a time dependent velocity u t and rotates with a time dependent angular velocity ω t four additional acceleration terms are introduced into the velocity pressure formulation of n s equations due to the non inertial effects 1 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u d ω d t r p 2 ω u ω ω r p d u d t 2 u 0 where u is the velocity under the non inertial frame t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluids ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids and r p is the relative position vector with respect to the center of rotation the velocity in the non inertial frame of reference should include the contributions from both frame translation and frame rotation besides the velocity under the inertial frame u 3 u u ω r p u the problem of fluid dynamics can be partitioned into two consecutive steps the kinetic process and the kinematic process 48 55 in the present model the kinetic process describes the development of vorticity in the form of convection and diffusion the kinematic process relates the velocity field to the vorticity field at any given time it has been derived in appendix that the centrifugal and translational acceleration terms can be absorbed into the pressure term as potential in eq 1 and so the curl operation on this equation will result in a vorticity transport equation representing the kinetics of the flow without any additional acceleration term under the non inertial frame the authors remark that this equation takes the same form as the one in the inertial frame of reference 4 ω t u ω ν 2 ω with the initial and boundary conditions 5 u t 0 u ω r p u u b on body surface u u ω r p at infinity where u b is the velocity of the wall surface since the 2 d cylinder is considered to be stationary under the non inertial frame u b 0 ω is the vorticity relative to the inertial frame and does not include the contribution 2 ω from the frame rotation the initial condition implies that the flow starts impulsively from rest in 2 d the velocity u u v can be represented by the gradient of stream function ψ as 6 u ψ y ψ x the kinematics of the flow is described by the definition of vorticity and the continuity equation notably the vorticity in eq 4 is relative to the inertial frame of reference 7 ω u v x u y then it is necessary to recover the velocity field from the newly obtained vorticity field the velocity field can be uniquely determined by knowing a vorticity field according to helmholtz theory the velocity field and vorticity field are related by a poisson s equation which is solved using green s function in 2 d and an integral representation is achieved 24 8 ψ x c ψ ω x c ψ κ x c ψ b x c 9 ψ ω x c ϒ ω x ln x c x 2 π d υ 10 ψ κ x c ϒ κ x ln x c x 2 π d σ where x c is the location where the stream function is evaluated and the dummy variable x runs through the integral domain ϒ covering all the vortical flow regions κ x is the wall surface vortex sheet due to the solid body rotation ψ ω x c is the stream function induced by the vorticity in the interior of the flow domain ψ κ x c which can be equivalently seen as the rotational correction term is the stream function induced by the wall surface vortex sheet due to rotation ψ b x c is the stream function of the background flow this integral form bypasses the explicit specification of velocity boundary conditions at the outer boundaries of the computational domain notice that the calculation of ψ ω x c only covers the regions of flow with non zero vorticity the kinetic process and kinematic process of the problem are interconnected with each other the kinetic process necessitates the velocity to convect the vorticity and the kinematic process needs the vorticity to predict the velocity for a known vorticity field and the corresponding velocity field solving the vorticity transport equation 4 convects and diffuses the vorticity in the computational domain and marches the solutions to the next time step at the new time step the velocity induced by the redistributed vorticity is evaluated by eq 8 9 and 10 this is a well established legitimate scheme and has been used in many vorticity based methods 48 55 in addition to solve the vorticity equation 4 explicit vorticity boundary conditions must be established please note that the vorticity can only be created at the wall and the vorticity in the flow domain is distributed from the wall by the vorticity equation a vorticity creation scheme is implemented to determine the amount of vorticity released into the flow domain at every time step the current method is an implementation of the vorticity stream function formulation obviously the frame translation and rotation are considered into the calculations only through the velocity field eq 4 may seem to be a little peculiar at the first sight since the velocity and vorticity in a single equation are with respect to different frames nonetheless this feature actually gives rise to simple numerical implementation and high computational performance 3 numerical algorithms 3 1 kinetics vorticity transport equation the vorticity transport equation 4 is discretized using the cell centered fvm in space and the alternating directional implicit adi scheme 30 is utilized to advance the vorticity in time the discretized equation is eventually solved iteratively by using the deferred correction technique 38 to allow for the employment of high order schemes such as quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick 14 22 applying the gauss theorem and the crank nicolson c n method to the conservative form of the vorticity transport equation over the control volume as shown in fig 1 eq 4 is broken in two sweeps as 11 ω t δ t 2 1 δ t 2 a c 1 d 1 1 1 δ t 2 a c 2 d 2 ω t ω t δ t 1 δ t 2 a c 2 d 2 1 1 δ t 2 a c 1 d 1 ω t δ t 2 where c 1 2 and d 1 2 are the convective and diffusive coefficients in two sweeps and a denotes the area of the control volume c 1 and c 2 are collections of the convective flux a f u n d l ψ end ψ start in the corresponding directions respectively with n defined as the vector normal to the cell edge using the stream function at the vertices of a cell to determine the flux can guarantee zero net volumetric mass flux of the cell at all times the convective terms are interpolated by a hybrid convection limiter a blend of the first order upwind scheme and the quick scheme to keep the results monotone for large gradients and meanwhile maintain the order of accuracy for small and mild gradients 50 d 1 and d 2 are evaluated from the diffusive term ν n δ l in two sweeps separately where δ l represents the length of the cell edge these terms are calculated by a linear interpolation scheme since only orthogonal meshes are employed in this work further the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition ω 0 is specified at the far field boundary indicating that the computational domain should cover all the significant vortical regions the homogeneous neumann boundary condition ω n 0 is suggested by 9 at both the out flow boundary and the wall boundary the numerical treatments of the vorticity transport equation under the non inertial frame is exactly the same as that relative to the inertial frame 54 at least in this aspect the current method shows the unparalleled advantage of simple implementations of conservative or high order schemes including fvm c n and quick over the n s methods while solving the dynamics of fluids in the non inertial frame of reference also fewer terms in the governing equation lead to lighter intermediate calculations such as interpolations between solving the linear system at consecutive time steps 3 2 kinematics vorticity induced stream function upon obtaining the vorticity at the new time step the stream functions at the vertices of the mesh cells must be determined using eq 8 in order to march the solutions to the next time step by considering a constant vorticity distribution ω within every mesh cell the integral term in eq 9 is broken into the sum of the influence of each individual mesh cell with non zero vorticity 12 ψ ω x c i 1 n ϒ ω x i ϒ i ln x c x i 2 π d υ where n ϒ is the number of mesh cells with non zero vorticity in the computational domain similarly assuming a constant strength of wall surface vortex sheet κ on every wall panel the integral term in eq 10 is broken into the sum of the contribution from all the wall panels 13 ψ κ x c j 1 m ϒ b κ x j ϒ j ln x c x j 2 π d σ where m ϒ b is number of panels on the surface of the cylinder hence the induced stream function ψ x c ψ ω x c ψ κ x c ψ b x c is calculated in a discrete sense but the integral over one element inside the summation still remains undetermined the surface integral in eq 12 is evaluated using an analytical solution 54 in an exact way in contrast eq 13 integrates along a curve and cannot be treated using the same formula the flow field induced by the surface vortex sheet should satisfy two conditions 1 it is a potential field since it should not bring more vorticity into the flow 2 its velocity field has zero divergence because it must be governed by the continuity equation in fact the flow field described by eq 13 in the 2 d circular cylinder case is a free vortex which is the irrotational flow of a rankine vortex therefore alternatively and precisely 14 ψ κ r ω r 2 ln r where r d 2 is the radius of the circular cylinder and the circulation of this rankine vortex depends only on the rotational speed γ 2 π κ r 2 π ω r 2 strictly speaking eq 14 should also include a constant but the constant does not matter in the numerical solutions since the convective flux of eq 7 is determined by the difference of stream function on the neighboring two vertices which cancels out the constant the authors stress again that this is a special treatment that only works for a 2 d circular cylinder and eq 13 evaluated either numerically or analytically should be employed to find the stream function due to the surface vortex sheet when the body is in arbitrary shapes traversing the 2 d domain with a mesh of n cells to get the stream function at all vertices is a full o n 2 summation which is comparatively expensive but sill affordable considering the limited scale of the current model to improve the overall performance on computing clusters this process is paralleled using open mp and the work is divided equally and assigned to all the threads to perform concurrently 54 3 3 vorticity creation on the wall the kinetic aspect drives the evolution of vorticity inside the flow domain with time and the kinematic aspect recovers the solenoidal velocity field corresponding to the given vorticity field at any instant of time however neither of these two procedures controls the local generation of vorticity on the wall boundaries as a matter of fact the vorticity in the interior of the domain is all originally generated on the wall surface and the kinetic process only redistributes the vorticity in the domain the vorticity generation process can be modeled as determining a spurious vortex sheet on the surface of the cylinder 7 this vorticity creation process acts as the enforcement of non penetrating and no slip boundary conditions of the velocity at the wall and the strength of the surface vortex sheet is determined along the way 20 let us assume that the solutions have just been marched from the previous time step t δ t to the current time step t but the velocity relative to the non inertial frame induced by the newly computed vorticity ω ˆ t has non zero components on the wall surface here we define a cylinder oriented polar coordinate system s n where n indicates the radial direction and s represents the circumferential direction the non penetrating boundary condition is enforced by solving a boundary element method bem 2 solver and a potential distribution on the wall surface ϕ is acquired by applying the following boundary condition 15 ϕ n ψ t s subsequently the strength of the vortex sheet γ is the summation of the gradient of ϕ and the residual velocity tangential to the wall direction 16 γ ϕ s ψ t n it is necessary to clarify that the potential ϕ is only used to determine the strength of the surface vortex sheet γ and the interior of the flow domain is not influenced by the potential the spurious vortex sheet is then converted into a vorticity flux across the wall boundary 20 and released into the flow domain from all the panels on the wall via viscous diffusion 17 ω γ t ν 2 ω γ ν ω γ n γ δ t on body surface ω γ t 0 at infinity ω γ t δ t 0 where ω γ is the augmentation vorticity the above system is numerically resolved using a standard fvm this releasing step is equivalent to imposing the no slip boundary condition eventually the vorticity at the current time step t reads 18 ω t ω ˆ t ω γ t 3 4 body forces the body force on the circular cylinder comprises of two parts pressure force and friction force the pressure p variation along the body surface is directly related to the vorticity production rate on the wall surface 19 p s μ ω n where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluids it is obvious that the vorticity flux ω n has already been calculated during the vorticity creation stage given the pressure at a reference point the pressure everywhere on the body surface can be numerically determined the wall shear stress τ is computed from the vorticity on the body surface the contribution from the frame rotation should also be incorporated into the friction as 20 τ μ ω 2 ω the total body force acting on the circular cylinder f is the sum of pressure force and friction force which are calculated by integrating the pressure and the shear stress along the body surface ϒ b respectively 21 f ϒ b p n d σ ϒ b τ s d σ the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of the body are non dimensionalized as 22 c l f e 1 ρ u 2 r c d f e 2 ρ u 2 r where e 1 and e 2 are the unit directional vector perpendicular and parallel to the oncoming flow direction respectively 4 numerical results of uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder magnus effect the present method is used to simulate the uniform flow past a rotating cylinder as validations to prove that the method is accurate and reliable in solving the fluid dynamics under the rotational frame in this problem the uniform inflow goes along the x direction and hits the circular cylinder with a diameter of d the cylinder located at the origin x d y d 0 0 rotates in the anti clockwise direction as illustrated in fig 2 notice that the cylinder rotation is resolved in the non inertial frame of reference by assuming there is a frame rotating with the same angular velocity as the cylinder both the uniform inflow and the frame rotation start impulsively from the rest the computational domain employed in this simulation is circular and has a radius of 200 d the mesh is uniform in the circumferential direction and exponential in the radial direction as shown in fig 3 the size of the computational domain is chosen to be relatively large to capture and visualize the vortex structures in the wake during long time simulations again the current method only performs the numerical calculations in the vortical region which is merely a small portion of the entire computational domain in this section the definitions of reynolds number r e and rotation rate α are already given in the introduction part the non dimensional time t is defined as 23 t t u r in this section the results such as streamlines vorticity contours and body forces of the flow past a rotating cylinder predicted by the proposed method at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 are presented the simulations were conducted for a time long enough such that the flow was fully developed and distinguishable features could be identified measured and analyzed the present results are compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental measurements of 10 and the numerical predictions of 26 the main characteristics of this flow have been systemically investigated in the experiments of 1 10 27 numerically solved the vorticity stream function formulation using the third order upwind scheme to simulate this type of flow which successfully recovered the experimental results of 10 40 42 then studied the temporal flow instability at a higher reynolds number r e 3800 using the same method and uncovered a new instability later 26 established a finite element formulation of numerically investigating the flow at r e 200 however the new instability shown by 40 was not discussed by 26 4 1 grid and time step size independence study a grid independence study is conducted for the flow at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α 2 07 by using meshes with multiple levels of resolution circumferential direction normal direction including the coarse grid 100 141 the medium grid 160 161 and the fine grid 200 200 the evolution of lift coefficients in time displayed in fig 4 a demonstrates that the results become independent of the mesh quality as the resolution becomes finer additionally the time step size independence study is performed by using the fine grid resolution with various time step sizes δ t 1 0 1 0 2 2 0 1 0 3 and 4 0 1 0 4 respectively the comparison in fig 4 b verifies that the evolution of lift coefficients is independent of the time step size if δ t is smaller than 2 0 1 0 3 4 2 a glimpse of the circular cylinder rotating in the quiescent flow the current method is validated by applying to a rotating cylinder in the quiescent flow the radius of the computational domain is set to be 17 d and the mesh resolution is 200 100 circumferential direction normal direction notice that there is no uniform inflow in this case and the reynolds number is defined as r e d ω r ν the flow at r e 500 and ω 5 0 r a d s is simulated using the current method the evolutions of tangential velocity u θ and vorticity ω distributions along the radial direction r are given in fig 5 the present results are compared with the solutions of 1 d n s equation 24 derived and simplified in the polar coordinate system the governing equation is solved using the finite difference method fdm in the inertial frame of reference by considering a moving wall boundary as is observed the results evaluated by the two methods overlap with each other 24 u θ t ν 1 r r r u θ r u θ r 2 after the impulsive start of the rotation the flow is initialized with a vorticity field which has a total circulation equal to γ 2 π ω r 2 in the beginning the vorticity is concentrated near the cylinder and forms a very thin boundary layer the vorticity gradually diffuses into the domain and the boundary layer becomes thicker in time with a decreasing maximum magnitude as the vorticity covers more parts of the domain the influence of the rotating cylinder affects increasing portions of the domain and the border of the zero velocity zone is pushed further away from the cylinder to some point the non zero velocity will finally reach the boundary of the computational domain which has a predefined finite radius the current method is able to predict the far field boundary conditions correctly and does not require unperturbed far field boundary conditions therefore although the radius of the domain is only 17 d the results calculated by the present method maintain high accuracy eventually this type of flow will behave like a rankine vortex when it is fully developed and reaches a steady state 4 3 velocity field validation at r e 200 and α 0 5 1 0 and 2 07 the streamlines obtained from the present simulations are compared with the experimental observations of 10 at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α 0 5 given at a sequential of flow times in figs 6a 6d the first vortex ① was formed quickly on the upper side after the start of the motion at about t 2 0 the second vortex ② is observed on the lower side both vortices grow with time as the vortex ① separates from the cylinder at time t 4 0 the vortex ① detaches from the cylinder and its strength starts to decrease as propagating further downstream meanwhile the vortex ② also begins to split from the cylinder at t 7 0 which leads to the creation of the third vortex ③ above vortex ② on the upper side and the fourth vortex ④ below vortex ② on the lower side these two new vortices develop simultaneously along with the separation of vortex ② which finally fades as moving downstream vortex ③ and vortex ④ grow and become closer to each other in time and are eventually merged into one larger vortex that dominates the wake at t 12 0 the comparisons of streamlines at larger rotation rates are also given figs 7a 7c show the results at r e 200 and α 1 0 and fig 8 displays the results at r e 200 and α 2 07 at α 1 0 the first vortex ① is formed immediately after the motion begins however the second vortex ② does not appear on the upper side until t 5 0 after the vortex ① fully detaches from the cylinder almost at the same time as the emergence of vortex ② the third vortex ③ is generated also on the upper side but below the vortex ② yet the vortex ③ begins to separate and move away from the cylinder first resulting in the creation of the fourth vortex ④ on the lower side at roughly t 8 0 the vortex ② and vortex ④ grow and approach each other gradually and are eventually merged at t 10 0 at rotation rate α 2 07 the first vortex ① dominates the wake from the beginning to time t 7 0 before the second vortex ② is formed on the upper side it is observed that the current predictions are almost the same as the experimental measurements performed by 10 the streamlines at r e 200 and α 0 5 1 0 were also given by 27 which can also be used to validate the current results in addition the boundary layer profiles in terms of the velocity component in the x direction u and the velocity component in the y direction v along the radial direction at θ 0 which is the rear centerline of the cylinder as shown in fig 2 are validated against the experimental data quantified by 10 the boundary layer comparison at r e 200 α 0 5 is illustrated graphically in fig 9 and the comparison at r e 200 α 1 0 is given in fig 10 the vortices induce reversed flow that moves against the uniform inflow and so negative values of u velocity are observed inside the recirculation zone behind the cylinder the magnitude of negative u could roughly indicate the size of the recirculation zone this magnitude increases to a maximum value at a certain time and then decreases to be specific this value appears at t 4 0 for α 0 5 and t 3 0 for α 1 0 respectively it is noteworthy to point out that the evolution of velocity profile in time is a direct result of the development of vortices in the wake the trough of the velocity profile increases with the growth of the first shedding vortex after reaching the maximum value the trough starts to drop when the vortex begins to detach from the cylinder thus the magnitude of negative velocity differs between α 0 5 and α 1 0 since the structure strength and size of the shedding vortex vary at different rotation rates the velocity field predicted by the current method closely matches the measurements of 10 4 4 body force and vorticity field validation at r e 200 and α between 0 0 and 5 0 the evolution of lift coefficient c l in time at various rotation rates is summarized and shown in fig 11 fig 12 collects all the phase diagrams of lift coefficient and drag coefficient at the chosen rotation rates in addition the intervals of α chosen here are the reference values used in the work of 26 so that the present results can be fairly compared with those predicted using the velocity pressure formulation of n s method in their study these intervals were quantitatively determined according to the distinguished states of established flow it is seen in particular that the flow regimes exhibit four distinct stages as the rotation rates increases at low rotation rates 0 α 1 91 the well known karman vortex shedding happens in the wake of the cylinder the mode i shedding shown in fig 13 the wake will twist towards the direction of cylinder rotation and the faster the cylinder spins the larger the distortion is the vortex shedding will be suppressed by the cylinder rotation for rotation rates 1 91 α 4 35 given in fig 14 as graphically illustrated in fig 15 at r e 200 and α 2 5 vortex shedding still exits at the beginning but it fades with time during the vortex shedding suppression stage eventually the flow can reach a steady state steady state i given enough time of evolution when the rotation rate is further increased to be 4 35 α 4 75 a much stronger vortex shedding phase which is described in fig 16 is initiated again this is the mode ii shedding in which the cylinder is subject to oscillating body forces with a much larger amplitude and period than it is at smaller rotation rates for rotation rates 4 75 α 5 0 the flow develops directly to the steady state without intermediate vortex shedding phase which is the steady state ii and displayed in fig 17 generally the average lift on the cylinder increases with the rotation rate α in other words raising the rotation rate of the cylinder will directly lead to a rise in the thrust provided by the flettner rotor however one needs to avoid the possible vibrations resulting from the unsteady vortex shedding for certain range of rotation rates especially the mode ii vortex shedding must be accurately detected and prevented since the triggering rotation rates are hidden in between the two steady modes and the periodic body forces have much larger magnitudes 5 conclusions and future work a compact viscous vorticity method that effectively resolves the non inertial effects due to a rotating frame of reference is proposed to simulate the flow past a rotating cylinder the current study serves as an indispensable extension and supplement to the previous work of 54 proving the method to be highly conservative and efficient it turns out that the vorticity transport equation in the non inertial frame of reference keeps the same form as that in the inertial frame of reference the biggest advantage of the current method is that the additional acceleration terms which appear in the non inertial navier stokes equations do not appear in the vorticity equation thus allowing to maintain the same numerical implementation as in the case of the inertial frame of reference the non inertial vorticity transport equation is solved using the cell centered finite volume method the formula for evaluating the vorticity induced stream function is modified to accommodate the non inertial effects properly the advantages of the current method over the other numerical approaches were discussed in detail by 54 based on the conclusions given by 43 the authors emphasize the key benefits of the vorticity method in addressing the non inertial problems are as follows no additional acceleration terms due to the non inertial effects appear in the vorticity transport equation in other words the governing equation in the non inertial frame of reference keeps the same form as that in the inertial frame of reference thus allowing for simple implementations of fvm and high order numerical schemes such as quick the constant vorticity 2 ω due to the frame rotation never enters in the vorticity equation otherwise we would have to consider the contribution of this constant vorticity distributed globally and the mesh grid would need to cover the entire space including that inside the wall and beyond the far field the non inertial frame motions are considered into the solution only through the velocity field the vorticity field is not directly affected by the non inertial terms during the calculations the method was first applied to the pure rotating cylinder in quiescent flow without any uniform inflow at reynolds number r e 500 and angular velocity ω 5 0 rad s and the velocity and vorticity fields were found to agree very well with those from the solution of the navier stokes equations furthermore the proposed vorticity method was validated by simulating the uniform inflow past a rotating circular cylinder which is also known as the magnus effect at reynolds number r e 200 and rotation rate α ranging from 0 0 to 5 0 the present results agree very well with the results of available numerical studies and experimental investigations verifying that the current method has high accuracy in handling the dynamics of vortices under the non inertial frame of reference this work successfully reproduces the two steady solution states and the two vortex shedding modes observed and quantified in the established benchmark tests periodic vortex shedding happens for 0 0 α 1 91 the vortex shedding is gradually suppressed by the cylinder rotation and the flow eventually reaches a steady state for 1 91 α 4 35 a stronger vortex shedding phase with a larger amplitude and period is triggered for 4 35 α 4 75 the flow develops straight to a steady state without any transitional periodic vortex shedding phase for 4 75 α 5 0 the current method is designed to resolve the 2 d laminar flow past solid bodies in both the inertial and non inertial frame of reference effectively and efficiently the authors remark that the method is capable of handling both lifting and bluff bodies of arbitrary shape even though the results documented in this paper are about the flow past a circular cylinder this method has already been extended to treat the turbulent flow around a 2 d hydrofoil and a cylinder 19 56 also the 3 d version of the method is currently under development and reliable solutions have already been obtained for the flow past a 3 d hydrofoil under an inertial frame 52 53 the current method could further be coupled with optimizing algorithms to systemically and automatically improve the design of flettner rotors credit authorship

20753,three dimensional rankine source model is utilized to investigate the hydrodynamic responses for wave radiation problems under arbitrary seabed condition in time domain the free surface seabed surface and body surface are presented by layer of continuous panels rather than a discretization by isolated points these panels are positioned exactly on the fluid boundary surfaces and no desingularization technique required to accommodate the sloping seabed profile a straightforward source panel distribution on seabed surface is newly developed with two parameters determined by numerical tests the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical solutions are validated by comparison with published data the influences of flat seabed uneven seabed and sloping seabeds are examined numerical simulations demonstrate that various seabed profiles have significant and complicated effects on the body hydrodynamic response characteristics keywords three dimensional rankine source uneven and sloping seabeds 1 introduction the wave structure interaction problem within a potential flow framework can be solved theoretically by eigenfunction method or numerically investigated by either a free surface green function or a rankine source approach the eigenfunction can supply analytical result but it can only deal with very simple body and seabed shape conditions garrett 1971 yeung 1981 the free surface green function model involves a complicated free surface green function which requires a singular wave integral on the free surface boundary and is very limited to investigate various seabed conditions wehausen and laitone 1960 newman 1985 the rankine source approach only needs to calculate the integral of rankine sources and is very flexible to deal with various boundary conditions problems beck 1994 feng and price 2018 the importance of finite water depth and flat seabed on the hydrodynamic responses has been demonstrated using different mathematical models mei and black 1969 tuck 1970 drimer et al 1992 clauss et al 2009 the numerical techniques for infinite water depth problem can be directly applied for finite water problems by mirror image technique john 1950 liu et al 2015 mackay 2019 mei et al 2019 however this method can only deal with flat seabed and is not valid for arbitrary seabed profile in ocean engineering wave energy converters wecs are deployed in arrays of multiple devices which cover large ocean area in nearshore and coastal areas the ocean bottom topography has noticeable effects on the wave absorption efficiency and operation of wec farm and attracts extensive research interest recently mccallum et al 2014 charrayre et al 2014 belibassakis et al 2018 bonovas et al 2019 magkouris et al 2020 buchner 2006 applied second body method to simulate sloping seabed effects and obvious discrepancy between experimental and numerical results suggests that it is not possible to module a sloping seabed as a second body for diffraction problem as the refraction and interference effects are too strong buchner 2006 also concluded that the second body method can supply accurate results for wave radiation problem ferreira and newman 2009 pointed out the abrupt seabed depth change caused wave refraction and reflection effects should be avoided in the numerical simulations de hauteclocque et al 2008 proposed partial transparent panels to eliminate the disturbance caused by abrupt sea bottom based on the fixed second body model satisfactory results are obtained for wave kinematic on sloping sea bottom for the work of buchner 2006 de hauteclocque et al 2008 and ferreira and newman 2009 no special measurement were given to the incoming wave propagating on the sloping seabed belibassakis 2005 2008 and gerostathis et al 2016 introduced an extra term called the sloping bottom mode to modify the incident wave potential to satisfies the sloping seabed condition kim and kim 2013 proposed two models involving the rankine source method and a unified method coupled to the boussinesq equation the latter supplies all the relevant information for wave kinematic and the former supplies floating body dynamic analysis they found that the peak frequency of the exciting forces and motion responses shifted due to the influence of the sloping seabed ding et al 2017 applied the coupled boussinesq equation with rankine source model to analyse the hydroelasticity performance of vlfs near island and reef and found that the influence of non uniform seabed on the loads and motions is mainly concentrated in a certain interval of the frequencies one key numerical technique in the boundary integral method is the evaluation of rankine source on the surface panel the fluid surface can be discretized by a b spline function into curve panels and gaussian quadrature numerical integration can be directly applied isaacson and cheung 1991 maniar 1995 das and cheung 2012 kouh and suen 2001 yang et al 2019 this method introduces weight functions and associated polynomials to approximate the rankine source integral however this method is troublesome as singularity integral arises when these two kinds of points are located closely in the same panel as a numerical approximation in order to get higher accuracy more gaussian sampling points are required and this significantly increases the computational loads the analytical expression of rankine source integral was first derived for arbitrary bodies in unbounded fluid domains by hess and smith 1964 by using constant strength distributions on quadrilateral flat panels the panel integral can be analytically expressed as a superposition of integral over four parallel strips each strip is defined by one side of the quadrilateral panel the value of corresponding integral depends only on the coordinates of each side and therefore the contribution from each side can be evaluated independently this so called hess smith method is demonstrated very robust and accurate in hydrodynamic analysis kerwin 1986 cao et al 1991 sutulo et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 though high order panel method has sensible advantages for rankine source integral in terms of accuracy and efficiency the extent of the advantages for high order model is uncertain considering the multiple different boundary conditions investigated in present study in addition the high order panel integral is much more complicated to implement than constant panel integral and therefore the constant panel integral is adopted in present study the rankine source model cannot theoretically satisfy far field wave radiation condition the infinite free surface integral domain has to be truncated to a bounded domain but the truncated boundary may cause a reflective wave propagation disturbance numerical beach techniques are widely employed to reduce non physical wave reflection from the truncated boundary israeli and orszag 1981 kim et al 1997 koo and kim 2004 2007 however numerical beach always gives rise to artificially induced numerical errors cao et al 1993 zhang and beck 2008 and bandyk and beck 2011 divided the free surface range into inner and outer domains the rankine source points are placed in an exponentially increasing form in the outer domain and cover a very large area of free surface range due to the periodic characteristics of progressive wave the numerical computation is completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary this straightforward method is free of artificial errors and very efficient for both two and three dimensional water wave problems the source points distribution on the free surface is vital for the accuracy and efficiency of the boundary integral method lee 1992 zhang et al 2010 feng et al 2019c lee 1992 beck 1994 zhang and beck 2008 and bandyk and beck 2011 applied an even rankine source distribution method in the inner domain and applied this method in various wave body problems however this method ignores the fact that the importance of rankine source decays as it is located away from the body and it is very time consuming as it requires many rankine source panels on the free surface feng et al 2014 2015 2019b developed an ever increasing spaces between source points to replace the even space method this method places a higher density of source points near the floating body and at distant from the body a distribution of lesser density through this method the number of source points is reduced and therefore the computational effort is significantly reduced in previous work rankine source model was developed to investigate two dimensional body hydrodynamic responses within arbitrary seabed conditions feng et al 2015 2016 2017 feng and price 2018 feng et al 2019a three dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate more realistic and complicated ocean seabed conditions in present study for the three dimensional model the boundary surface has to be discretized into surface panel with rankine source surface integral calculation which requires more panel numbers and computational cost than two dimensional case the establishment of the three dimensional time domain linear model will lay the foundation for future work about nonlinear problem with expectation to supply practical insight for real engineering problem in this paper layer of rankine source panels is distributed to simulate three dimensional flat uneven and sloping seabed profiles the source panel distance ever increasing method is applied to arrange the source panel on both the free surface and seabed surface to accommodate the sloping seabed condition a straightforward source panel distribution on seabed surface is developed the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical solutions are validated extensively by comparison with published data for a three dimensional oscillatory body problem the influences of flat at different water depths various uneven seabed profiles sloping seabed with different slope angles are investigated numerical simulations demonstrate that various seabed profiles have significant and complicated effects on the body hydrodynamic characteristics 2 problem formulation 2 1 fluid motion equations a coordinate frame of reference o x y z is defined with origin o at the centre of a three dimensional body floating in a fluid domain the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and enclosing surface at infinity s fig 1 shows the sketch of a three dimensional wave body interaction problem in arbitrary seabed condition the fluid flow is assumed irrotational and total velocity potential ϕ is subject to laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the associated kinematic body boundary condition is given by 2 ϕ n b v b n b on s b where n b is the unit normal vector on the body surface pointing into the fluid domain the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are given respectively by 3 η ˆ t ϕ z 0 on s f and 4 ϕ t g η ˆ 0 on s f where η ˆ denotes the wave elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration the boundary condition applied on the far field boundary at infinity requires that the disturbance vanishes such that 5 ϕ 0 on s it is assumed that no flow penetrates the solid seabed boundary and therefore 6 ϕ n 0 0 on s 0 where n 0 is the unit normal vector on the seabed surface pointing into the fluid domain lamb 1945 expressed the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources continuously distributed on the fluid boundary surface s s b s f s 0 in the form 7 ϕ x t s b σ b 1 x x d s x s f σ f 1 x x d s x s 0 σ 0 1 x x d s x here we denote control point x x y z source point x x y z body source strength σ b σ x t free surface source strength σ f σ x t and seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x 2 2 numerical model discretization in present simulation the fluid domain surface s is discretized by rankine source panels rather than isolated rankine source points these source panels are located exactly on the fluid domain surface s let the integral surfaces s b s f and s 0 be approximated as sums of panels n b n f and n 0 respectively such as s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 therefore the discretization of eq 7 is given by 8 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i b s i b 1 x x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f 1 x x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k f s k 0 1 x x k d s x let x i b x i b s b x j f x j f s f and x k 0 x k 0 s 0 be source points and control points respectively for i 1 n b j 1 n f and k 1 n k these control points are located at the centre of three dimensional surface panels with the use of the body boundary conditions 2 and the boundary integral equation 8 with its normal derivative we solve the source strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 on s i b s j f and s k 0 from the following equations 9 ϕ x i b t n b i

0 1 x k 0 x k 0 d s x eqs 9 and 11 feature a neumann boundary condition whereas eqs 10 is constructed as dirichlet boundary condition these three boundary conditions formulate a mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity potential in the whole domain the intersection points between free surface and body surface have to satisfy both neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions this intersection point requires special treatment and the single point method is applied in present study interested readers can find detailed information of this approach in previous study feng et al 2015 2019c and is omitted herein it should be noted that theoretically both the free surface s f and seabed surface s 0 are of infinite length but the integrals of these infinite value are not possible by numerical technique for this reason the computational domain has to be truncated in the numerical simulation feng et al 2014 2019b c distributed the rankine source panels in an exponential manner allowing the covering of a very large area of free surface and numerical computations completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary in present study this source panel distribution approach is applied for the free surface based on the same principle a new source distribution method is proposed to facilitate the seabed surface boundary integral and this will be discussed in section 3 the new source distribution method covers more than 100 wave length distance in the radial direction the numerical simulations are ended before the radiated wave reaches the truncated border in all the numerical simulations no wave reflection is observed this treatment makes the proposed numerical model satisfy the far field boundary condition the integral of rankine source 1 r and the derivative of the integral of rankine source 1 r on the three dimensional panel involve transformation of three dimensional element panel in global coordinate system into quadrilateral element in local element coordinate system first and then inverse transformation back to global coordinate system hess and smith 1964 as the source point approaches the control point on the surface both the integral and induced velocity are singular on account of the term 1 r x x the integration of induced velocity should be treated as a principal integral problem by taking the centre of the circle ε x as source point and letting its radius ε approach 0 the contribution of a unit source to induced normal velocity is 2 π when the source point and control point are overlapped the integral of 1 r x x can be calculated directly based on the hess smith method without special treatment for a floating body experiencing forced oscillatory motion the body position z is given by the displacement function z ξ s i n ω t 0 0 z 0 ξ s i n ω t 0 o r 12 z 0 0 ξ s i n ω t for surge heave or pitch motion where ξ and ω denote motion amplitude and oscillatory angular velocity respectively the corresponding body velocity v b is given v b ξ ω c o s ω t 0 0 v b 0 ξ ω c o s ω t 0 o r 13 v b 0 0 ξ ω c o s ω t the substitution of the source strength values σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 at time t obtained from the set of eqs 9 11 produces calculation of the normal velocity v f z x j f t ϕ x j f t z on the free surface as 14 ϕ x j f t z i 1 n b σ i b z s i b 1 x j f x i b d s x j 1 n f σ j f z s j f 1 x j f x j f d s x k 1 n f σ j f z s k 0 1 x j f x k 0 d s x fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the numerical process applied in the present study the ramp function is usually adopted during the initial period to ensure the flow smoothly develops but is not used here because numerical instability is not a problem in this numerical model 2 3 free surface time updating at any time t during the numerical simulation the free surface boundary conditions are updated according to eqs 3 and 4 by a 3rd order adams bashforth scheme for the first time step t δ t no previous time steps information is available and the updating scheme is 15 η ˆ δ t v f z 0 δ t 16 ϕ δ t g η ˆ δ t δ t and for the second time step t 2 δ t a 2nd order adam bashforth scheme is applied as 17 η ˆ 2 δ t η ˆ

scheme is therefore adopted we have 19 η ˆ t δ t η ˆ t δ t 12 23 v f z t 16 v f z t δ t 5 v f z t 2 δ t 20 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 12 23 g η ˆ t 16 g η ˆ t δ t 5 g η ˆ t 2 δ t 2 4 body force calculation with strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 determined the velocity potentials on the body surface s b are derived from eq 7 in the form 21 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ j b s i b 1 x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f 1 x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 1 x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure on the body surface p p x i b t is evaluated from bernoulli s equation expressed as 22 p t ρ ϕ t where ρ denotes the fluid density the temporal derivative of the potential is calculated by a finite difference method using the values of the velocity potential at two consecutive time steps the dynamic force f ˆ t and moment m ˆ t applied on the body surface is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface as given by 23 f ˆ t s b p x i b t n b d s 24 m ˆ t s b p x i b t r n b d s where r is the position vector of the body surface d s by adopting fourier transforms the added mass a ˆ k l ω k l 1 2 3 4 5 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motion respectively and damping coefficient b ˆ k l ω can be obtained as 25 a ˆ k l ω 2 ξ ω 2 t 0 0 t 0 f ˆ k l t sin ω t d t 26 b ˆ k l ω 2 ξ ω t 0 0 t 0 f ˆ k l t cos ω t d t where t 0 denotes the period of the body s motion for direct comparison the results will be presented in nondimensional form the force f ˆ t moment m ˆ t wave elevation η ˆ t added mass coefficient a ˆ k k ω and damping coefficient b ˆ k k ω are nondimensionalized in the form of f t f ˆ t ρ g a 2 ξ m t m ˆ t ρ g a 2 ξ 2 η t η ˆ t ξ a k l ω a ˆ k l ω m b k l ω b ˆ k l ω m ω where m and a denote body mass and body radius respectively 3 fluid domain panel distribution the fluid domain surface is composed of a body surface s b free surface s f and seabed surface s 0 these surfaces are approximated by quadrilateral panels in present study the free surface is divided into inner and outer domains in the inner domain the source panel distribution method discussed by feng et al 2015 2014 is adopted in the radial direction s f is divided into inner and outer domains distributed with source points x j f the horizontal distances between neighbouring free surface control points are expressed in the form 27 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 in the inner domain 28 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 1 0 5 j j 1 2 in the outer domain where l b is the area of the body surface panel covering the intersection point of the body and free surface the parameters α j define the separation distances and are decided according to the method discussed by feng 2014 which for this reason is omitted herein fig 3 shows a portion of free surface source panel distribution it can be seen that the rankine source points distance increase as they are located further away from the body it should be noticed that the rankine source distances depend on the oscillatory angular velocity ω as presented in eqs 27 and 28 for larger motion frequency the distances between rankine source points are smaller while the distance are larger for smaller motion frequency this free surface rankine source distribution method can be adopted in the seabed surface source distribution with minor modification in the free surface 100 panels are arranged in inner domain and 10 panels are distributed in outer domain in the radial direction in the axial direction the source panels are evenly distributed by 80 panels therefore the total number is 8800 panel on the free surface numerical simulation shows this source distribution method produces very reliable and accurate numerical data when applied on both free surface and seabed surface for flat seabed conditions however when this method is applied for the sloping seabed case parts of the source points cannot form a quadrilateral panel on the sloping seabed part this invalids the basement of hess smith method hess and smith 1964 which requires the four source grid points located in one single plane in view of this a new rankine source model is proposed in present study a tangent format function is applied to distribute the source grid points and the distances between neighbouring seabed source points are expressed in the form 29 x k 0 δ t a n γ π k 1 n 0 0 5 here parameters δ and γ define the source point distance and are decided based on the numerical test a semi sphere with radius a is selected in the numerical test this sphere is located at water depth h 2 a the sphere surface is discretized by 144 12 12 panel and the free surface is approximated by 720 60 12 panels for the seabed surface the distribution method 29 is applied in both x and y directions on the surface with 400 20 20 panels cover the whole seabed surface for δ and γ 5 sets of data are applied in the numerical predictions the values of these data sets are presented in table 1 it is noticed that both the single source panel area and whole source panel covered area increase with the increasing of parameters δ and γ from data set 1 to 5 parameter δ is arranged in an increasing manner while the value of γ decreases the semi sphere is forced to undergo oscillatory heave motion fig 4 shows comparisons of heave added mass of this semi sphere obtained by hydrostar bureau veritas 2007 and proposed model with data set 1 2 3 4 and 5 the proposed model with data set 3 produces most accurate data and therefore values in set 3 are selected for δ and γ as limited data sets are tested in the numerical simulations this selection process cannot guarantee data set 3 is the best parameters but the proposed model with set 3 produces satisfying results in the numerical test the seabed source distribution method with data set 3 for parameters δ and γ are applied in the following numerical simulations comparing with the source distribution method in the free surface the seabed source distribution method has only one formula for the whole seabed surface and there are only two parameters therefore this method is more straightforward than that applied on the free surface similar as the source distribution on the free surface this distribution scheme places high density of source near the floating body and sparse source away from the body the proposed model distributes source panels on more than 100 wave lengths distance on the seabed surface the covered area is similar as that for free surface moreover the proposed method can guarantee the sloping seabed source grid points located in one plane and therefore hess smith method can be applied to calculate the rankine source integral fig 5 shows a portion of sloping seabed source panel mesh by the proposed method for every panel the four grid points are located in one plane 4 numerical results in present study all the numerical simulations are performed in time domain and converted to frequency domain data for direct comparison 4 1 flat seabed effects numerical convergence test is performed to check the numerical convergence of the proposed model 6 sets of panel numbers are applied in the numerical tests 8 12 16 and 20 panels in both x and y directions are applied which correspond to 64 144 196 and 400 panels on the whole seabed surface respectively a truncated cylinder with water depth h to cylinder radius a ratio h a 2 0 and cylinder draft d to cylinder radius a ratio d a 1 0 is selected in the numerical simulation fig 6 shows the sketch of the truncated cylinder in the fluid domain the truncated cylinder is forced to undergo oscillatory surge motion fig 7 shows comparison of the cylinder surge added mass a 11 ω between jiang et al 2014 analytical data and proposed method results for seabed surface panel number n 0 64 144 196 and 400 respectively it is noticed that the proposed method produces more and more accurate results compared with the analytical data as the seabed surface panel number increases the present model with panel number n 0 400 produces satisfying results and is therefore applied in the following numerical simulations in summary the free surface body surface and seabed surface have n f 720 n b 400 and n 0 400 respectively in present numerical simulations numerical simulations are further performed to validate the proposed numerical model two truncated cylinders are applied in the numerical simulations the first truncated cylinder has ratio h a 2 0 and d a 1 0 while the second one has h a 2 0 and d a 1 5 fig 8 demonstrates comparison between proposed method data and yeung 1981 analytical data for heave added mass a 33 ω a and jiang et al 2014 for pitch surge added mass a 51 ω b for both two cylinders it is noticed that both the self induced and the coupled coefficients obtained by proposed model agree with published data favourably well these numerical tests further validate the proposed numerical model to investigate wave body interaction problem within seabed condition feng et al 2016 pointed out that the mean water depth remarkably influences the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating body the water depth of real ocean environment varies significantly in order to investigate the water depth effects to the floating body hydrodynamic performance numerical simulations are performed for a truncated cylinder with d a 0 5 experiencing forced surge and heave motion respectively fig 9 shows comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients between yeung 1981 analytical data for h a 1 0 and proposed method results for the cylinder with water depth h a 1 0 h a 0 8 h a 0 7 and h a 0 6 respectively it is noticed that both surge added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω coefficients are noticeably effected by water depth in low frequency range both a 11 ω and b 11 ω are increased when water depths decrease however the water depth has little effect for surge added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω when k a 1 0 and k a 2 0 respectively fig 10 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients between jiang et al 2014 analytical data for h a 1 0 and proposed method results for the cylinder with water depth h a 1 0 h a 0 8 h a 0 7 and h a 0 6 respectively the water depths have significant effects for the heave added mass a 33 ω and damping b 33 ω coefficients across the whole frequency the heave added mass a 33 ω is approximately three times larger when water depth is h a 0 6 than that when water depth is h a 1 0 across the whole frequency range numerical simulations are further conducted to investigate the seabed effects for force responses excited by forced oscillatory motions a cylinder with d a 1 0 is located in water depths h a 2 0 h a 1 6 and h a 1 2 respectively fig 11 demonstrates the time record of vertical force f z t when the cylinder experiences forced heave motion with motion frequency ω 2 a g 0 7 it is noticed that the floating body experiences larger hydrodynamic force for shallower water depth it is also noticed that the seabed has little effect for the force phase numerical simulation also shows the flat seabed has noticeable effects for the time series of horizontal force and pitch moment though these results are not presented here fig 13 shows the time record of wave elevation η t when the cylinder experiences forced heave motions with motion frequency ω 2 a g 0 7 the wave probe is located in the same position as the third rankine source point in the radial direction and it is about 0 115 λ away from the body edge the wave profiles generated at first and second source points are not steady because they are close to the intersection point between body and free surfaces in present study the wave probe is always located in the same position as the third rankine source point unless otherwise stated the shallower water depths increase the wave elevation amplitude but have little effects for the wave phase 4 2 uneven seabed effects numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the uneven seabed effects for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the body concave and convex shaped undulations are two basic seabed topographies and widely exist in the marine environment su et al 2008 düzbastilar and sentürk 2009 for example a sediment scour or a buried pipeline can significantly change the seabed topography in present study concave and convex semi ellipsoid shaped seabed topographies are used to represent an undulating seabed fig 12 shows a sketch of uneven seabed profile applied in present study the seabed model is constructed by the ellipsoid equation 30 x 2 x 1 2 y 2 y 1 2 z 2 z 1 2 1 here x 1 y 1 and z 1 denote half length of the principal axes x and y axes forms flat seabed surface and positive z denotes concave seabed shape while negative z denotes convex shape which is similar as that illustrated in fig 12 a truncated cylinder with water depth h to cylinder radius a ratio h a 1 0 and cylinder draft d to cylinder radius a ratio d a 0 5 is applied in the numerical simulation fig 14 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 z 1 2 h respectively z 1 0 refers to flat seabed essentially in this numerical simulation the seabed profile has x 1 3 h and y 1 2 h it is noticed that both added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping coefficients b 33 ω significantly increase as z 1 increasing this is especially true for the added mass coefficient a 33 ω this hydrodynamic coefficient is almost tripled as z 1 increases from 2 h to 0 4 h across the frequency range fig 15 demonstrates comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 and z 1 2 0 h respectively the value of z 1 effects both added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω coefficients significantly surge added mass coefficient a 11 ω increases with z 1 going up in lower frequency range k a 0 8 while this coefficient decreases in higher frequency range k a 0 8 surge damping coefficient b 11 ω increases with z 1 increasing when the frequency k a is smaller than 1 7 and keeps constant when the frequency k a is bigger than 1 7 fig 16 shows comparison of wave elevation η excited by body experiencing forced heave motion a and surge motion b over uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 and z 1 2 0 h respectively the wave probe is located in the same position as the third rankine source point in the radial direction and it is about 0 115 λ away from the body edge for the wave elevation η 3 generated by forced heave motion η 3 increases as the z 1 increases across the whole frequency range for the wave elevation η 1 the value increases first and then decrease as the z 1 increases fig 17 shows oblique views of free surface profile generated by heave motion a and surge motion b for k a 2 0 and z 1 0 4 h at time t 6 t 0 it should be noticed the wave elevation is in a radiated way around the body for heave motion and it is approximately symmetric along y axis for body experiencing surge motion numerical simulations are also performed for the semi ellipsoid shaped seabed profile with z 1 0 4 h and x 1 y 1 fig 18 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with x 1 0 5 h x 1 1 0 h x 1 2 0 h and x 1 3 0 h respectively both the added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping coefficient b 33 ω are significantly affected by the values of x 1 it should be noticed that both the added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping b 33 ω b coefficients increase with x 1 increasing fig 19 shows comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with x 1 0 5 h x 1 1 0 h x 1 2 0 h and x 1 3 0 respectively the surge added mass a 11 ω increases when frequency k a is smaller than 0 7 and decreases when k a is bigger than 0 7 with the value of x 1 increasing the surge damping b 11 ω goes up when frequency k a is smaller than 2 and keeps roughly constant for k a 2 0 as the change of x 1 alters the seabed profile the data presented in figs 18 and 19 further demonstrates the importance of seabed topography for the hydrodynamic characteristics of floating body 4 3 sloping seabed effects one major concern about sloping seabed effects is the reflection caused by the sloping seabed side feng et al 2017 in proposed model large area of free surface and seabed surface are covered by rankine source panel according to the proposed source distributed method the sloping seabed side causes reflected wave and this reflected wave travels into fluid domain in another side as very large areas are covered by rankine source panel the reflected wave can travel towards far field without suffering second reflection this principle is the same as that applied to deal with two dimensional sloping seabed problem feng et al 2017 numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the sloping seabed effects for cylinder experiencing forced motions the seabed inclination is indicated by seabed sloping angle β which is defined as tan β l x l z here l x and l z denote the horizontal and vertical distance of sloping seabed part in the x and z direction respectively fig 20 illustrates the definition of the seabed sloping angle β a cylinder with a d 6 is applied in the numerical simulation and this cylinder is located in mean water depth h d 1 6 in order to give a direct comparison the flat seabed condition is also included in the numerical simulation time convergent tests are performed for both flat and sloping seabed conditions for flat seabed generally satisfied results can be obtained when time step δ t t 0 100 for sloping seabed the time step has to be smaller than δ t t 0 100 to guarantee convergent results fig 21 shows the convergence test for wave profile generated when the cylinder experiencing forced heave motion with k a 0 40 measured at third source point under sloping seabed condition it is noticed that the numerical model produces convergent results when δ t t 0 120 and the data produced when δ t t 0 120 and δ t t 0 160 are almost overlapped δ t t 0 120 is applied in the following numerical simulation unless otherwise stated fig 22 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is noticed that the sloping seabed increases the heave added mass a 11 ω significantly across the frequency range the heave damping coefficient a 11 ω also increases noticeably as the slope angle increases fig 23 demonstrates time series of vertical force f z t for cylinder experiencing forced heave motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is observed that the seabed inclination increase the heave force amplitude but has no effects on the force phase fig 24 shows top view of wave profile for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 t 0 for flat seabed a and sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 8 b respectively for flat seabed case the wave is in a radiated symmetrical profile along the body for sloping seabed the wave profile becomes unsymmetrical as the slope seabed angle β increases the wave length on the slope side becomes more and more less fig 25 shows comparison of wave elevation η in x z plan on sloping part for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 00 t 0 a t 6 25 t 0 b t 6 50 t 0 c and t 6 75 t 0 d for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the sloping part has length l x 70 m in the numerical simulation the dashed line in fig 25 illustrates the sloping and flat seabed bottom profile applied in the numerical simulation it should be noticed that the wave starting from the body surface rather than x 0 in the numerical simulation the starting point is placed at x 0 artificially for clear demonstration in fig 25 it is further confirmed that the sloping seabed part shortens the wavelength the wave amplitude decreases on this plane as the seabed inclination increases recalling fig 24 it is noticed that the wave amplitude actually increases on the plane between x 0 and y 0 this can be contributed to the three dimensional characteristics of the fluid domain and the generated wave travels is a non uniform pattern on the free surface fig 26 demonstrates comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the seabed inclination reduces the surge added mass coefficient a 11 ω but increases the surge damping coefficient a 11 ω noticeably across the frequency range fig 27 shows time series of horizontal force f x t for cylinder experiencing forced surge motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is noticed that the seabed inclination has limited effects on the horizontal force f x t fig 28 demonstrates time series of vertical force f z t for the cylinder experiencing forced surge motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for the same seabed condition as presented in fig 27 the seabed inclination has significant effect on the vertical force f z t for flat seabed no vertical force is generated because of the symmetry the vertical force f z t increases as the seabed slope angle increases for the slope seabed with tan β 0 8 the vertical force f z t amplitude reaches about 25 of the horizontal force the vertical force is expected to increase further as slope angle β increase this implies the importance of seabed inclination for the hydrodynamic effects on the floating body fig 29 illustrates the top view of wave profile for body experiencing forced surge motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 t 0 for flat seabed a and sloping seabed with t a n β 8 b respectively for flat seabed the wave profile is roughly symmetric along the y axis but the seabed inclination alters this symmetric characteristics and shortens the generated wave length on the sloping seabed side fig 30 shows comparison of wave elevation η in x z plan on sloping part for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 00 t 0 a t 6 25 t 0 b t 6 50 t 0 c and t 6 75 t 0 d for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the sloping part has length l x 70 m in the numerical simulation it should be noticed that the wave starting from the body surface rather than x 0 in the numerical simulation the starting point is placed at x 0 artificially for clear demonstration in fig 30 it is further confirmed that the sloping seabed part shortens the wavelength and increases the wave amplitude on this plane as the seabed inclination increases from figs 24 25 29 and 30 it is observed that the wave elevation reduces as it travels outside this is because the generated wave travels outwards in a radial pattern and the wave amplitude decays naturally as the wave travels in an ever increasing circle the distance ever increasing method is applied to distribute the rankine source panel in the free surface that is high density mesh near the oscillating body and low density mesh when it is away from the body the rankine source is distributed in an exponential way in the outer domain which covers very large area the generated wave cannot reach the border before numerical simulation is ended on the free surface totally 8800 panels are used with 110 panels in the radial direction and 80 panels in the axial direction for numerical simulation with 10 t 0 and time step δ t 0 005 t 0 it requires 521 s cpu time in a desktop with processor of 2 90 ghz this paper uses 3 d rankine source model to investigate the hydrodynamic responses of body experiencing forced oscillation motion over flat uneven and sloping seabed in time domain the numerical model can simulate arbitrary seabed profile without much difficulty in present paper only radiation problem is investigated the diffraction problem involving sloping seabed can be challenging considering wave reflection and refraction by the sloping seabed as pointed out by buchner 2006 and ferreira and newman 2009 the present model cannot be directly applied to investigate the wave diffraction and floating body motion problems substantial modification is expected to make in order to investigate this problem 5 conclusions three dimensional rankine source model is developed to investigate the hydrodynamic responses for oscillatory body in arbitrary seabed condition the free surface seabed surface and body surface are presented by layer of continuous panels rather than a discretization by isolated points the free surface and seabed surface boundary conditions feature a neumann boundary condition whereas body surface boundary condition construct a dirichlet boundary condition these mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions formulate a closed boundary element model to investigate the wave body interaction problem within various seabed conditions the rankine source panels are positioned exactly on the fluid boundary surfaces without desingularization technique applied the ever increasing spaces distribution method is applied to arrange free surface source panel distribution to accommodate the sloping seabed profile a straightforward source panel distribution on seabed surface is newly developed with two parameters determined by numerical tests these numerical techniques facilities the computational cost in an accepted level as very large area free surface and seabed surface are covered by rankine source panel the reflected wave produced by sloping seabed side can travel towards far field without further reflection caused by truncated boundary numerical convergence test is conducted to check the numerical convergent performance of the proposed rankine source distribution model on the seabed surface good numerical convergence result demonstrates the reliability of the proposed model the proposed model are validated by comparison with published data extensively for a truncated cylinder experiencing forced surge heave and pitch motions the flat seabed demonstrates significant and complicated effects for the body experiencing forced oscillatory motions as water depths decreases both the surge added mass and damping coefficients increase noticeably when the oscillatory frequency is in lower frequency range however the water depth has little effect when the oscillatory frequency is in larger frequency range the water depth has significant effects for both heave and pitch motions across the whole frequency range for example the pitch damping coefficient is more than five times larger when water depth is h a 0 6 than that when water depth is h a 1 0 across the whole frequency range the horizontal vertical force and moment amplitudes increase as water depth decreases but vertical force is much more sensitive than the other two to water depth the water depth has little effects to the phase of the force time series the water depth affects the heave wave elevation slightly and has very limited effects to the surge and pitch wave elevation the ellipsoid equation is applied to represent the concave and convex seabed shapes the values of z 1 and x 1 have significant effects on the hydrodynamic responses for the floating body with z 1 increasing both the heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 increase dramatically across the frequency range the surge hydrodynamic coefficients a 11 and b 11 also change noticeable but demonstrate different trends across the frequency range the wave elevation η 3 increases along the frequency range while the wave elevation η 1 increases first and then decreases with the value of z 1 going up with x 1 increasing both the heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 increase dramatically across the frequency range but the surge hydrodynamic coefficients a 11 and b 11 show different trends across the frequency range the sloping seabed inclination has remarkable and complicated effects to the floating body hydrodynamic coefficients both the heave added mass coefficient a 33 and b 33 increase significantly across the whole frequency range as seabed sloping angle increases the increasing of seabed inclination also increases the heave force amplitudes but has no effects on the force phase the sloping seabed alters the symmetrical characteristics of the seabed profile and causes wave profile become more and more unsymmetrical as the slope seabed angle β increases with the increase of sloping angle the surge added mass coefficient a 11 decreases while surge damping coefficient b 11 increases across the frequency range noticeably the seabed inclination has little effect for the time record of horizontal force f x t while the vertical force f z t increases significantly as sloping angle β increases due to the change of seabed profile the wave profile becomes unsymmetrical and the generated wave has shorter wave length on the sloping seabed side for body experiencing both forced heave and surge motions flat seabed uneven seabed and sloping seabed profiles are considered in present study the proposed model can be further extended to investigate arbitrary seabed profile without much difficulty for more complicated seabed profiles generally higher mesh density is expected to require declaration of competing interest the

numerical tests the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical solutions are validated by comparison with published data the influences of flat seabed uneven seabed and sloping seabeds are examined numerical simulations demonstrate that various seabed profiles have significant and complicated effects on the body hydrodynamic response characteristics keywords three dimensional rankine source uneven and sloping seabeds 1 introduction the wave structure interaction problem within a potential flow framework can be solved theoretically by eigenfunction method or numerically investigated by either a free surface green function or a rankine source approach the eigenfunction can supply analytical result but it can only deal with very simple body and seabed shape conditions garrett 1971 yeung 1981 the free surface green function model involves a complicated free surface green function which requires a singular wave integral on the free surface boundary and is very limited to investigate various seabed conditions wehausen and laitone 1960 newman 1985 the rankine source approach only needs to calculate the integral of rankine sources and is very flexible to deal with various boundary conditions problems beck 1994 feng and price 2018 the importance of finite water depth and flat seabed on the hydrodynamic responses has been demonstrated using different mathematical models mei and black 1969 tuck 1970 drimer et al 1992 clauss et al 2009 the numerical techniques for infinite water depth problem can be directly applied for finite water problems by mirror image technique john 1950 liu et al 2015 mackay 2019 mei et al 2019 however this method can only deal with flat seabed and is not valid for arbitrary seabed profile in ocean engineering wave energy converters wecs are deployed in arrays of multiple devices which cover large ocean area in nearshore and coastal areas the ocean bottom topography has noticeable effects on the wave absorption efficiency and operation of wec farm and attracts extensive research interest recently mccallum et al 2014 charrayre et al 2014 belibassakis et al 2018 bonovas et al 2019 magkouris et al 2020 buchner 2006 applied second body method to simulate sloping seabed effects and obvious discrepancy between experimental and numerical results suggests that it is not possible to module a sloping seabed as a second body for diffraction problem as the refraction and interference effects are too strong buchner 2006 also concluded that the second body method can supply accurate results for wave radiation problem ferreira and newman 2009 pointed out the abrupt seabed depth change caused wave refraction and reflection effects should be avoided in the numerical simulations de hauteclocque et al 2008 proposed partial transparent panels to eliminate the disturbance caused by abrupt sea bottom based on the fixed second body model satisfactory results are obtained for wave kinematic on sloping sea bottom for the work of buchner 2006 de hauteclocque et al 2008 and ferreira and newman 2009 no special measurement were given to the incoming wave propagating on the sloping seabed belibassakis 2005 2008 and gerostathis et al 2016 introduced an extra term called the sloping bottom mode to modify the incident wave potential to satisfies the sloping seabed condition kim and kim 2013 proposed two models involving the rankine source method and a unified method coupled to the boussinesq equation the latter supplies all the relevant information for wave kinematic and the former supplies floating body dynamic analysis they found that the peak frequency of the exciting forces and motion responses shifted due to the influence of the sloping seabed ding et al 2017 applied the coupled boussinesq equation with rankine source model to analyse the hydroelasticity performance of vlfs near island and reef and found that the influence of non uniform seabed on the loads and motions is mainly concentrated in a certain interval of the frequencies one key numerical technique in the boundary integral method is the evaluation of rankine source on the surface panel the fluid surface can be discretized by a b spline function into curve panels and gaussian quadrature numerical integration can be directly applied isaacson and cheung 1991 maniar 1995 das and cheung 2012 kouh and suen 2001 yang et al 2019 this method introduces weight functions and associated polynomials to approximate the rankine source integral however this method is troublesome as singularity integral arises when these two kinds of points are located closely in the same panel as a numerical approximation in order to get higher accuracy more gaussian sampling points are required and this significantly increases the computational loads the analytical expression of rankine source integral was first derived for arbitrary bodies in unbounded fluid domains by hess and smith 1964 by using constant strength distributions on quadrilateral flat panels the panel integral can be analytically expressed as a superposition of integral over four parallel strips each strip is defined by one side of the quadrilateral panel the value of corresponding integral depends only on the coordinates of each side and therefore the contribution from each side can be evaluated independently this so called hess smith method is demonstrated very robust and accurate in hydrodynamic analysis kerwin 1986 cao et al 1991 sutulo et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 though high order panel method has sensible advantages for rankine source integral in terms of accuracy and efficiency the extent of the advantages for high order model is uncertain considering the multiple different boundary conditions investigated in present study in addition the high order panel integral is much more complicated to implement than constant panel integral and therefore the constant panel integral is adopted in present study the rankine source model cannot theoretically satisfy far field wave radiation condition the infinite free surface integral domain has to be truncated to a bounded domain but the truncated boundary may cause a reflective wave propagation disturbance numerical beach techniques are widely employed to reduce non physical wave reflection from the truncated boundary israeli and orszag 1981 kim et al 1997 koo and kim 2004 2007 however numerical beach always gives rise to artificially induced numerical errors cao et al 1993 zhang and beck 2008 and bandyk and beck 2011 divided the free surface range into inner and outer domains the rankine source points are placed in an exponentially increasing form in the outer domain and cover a very large area of free surface range due to the periodic characteristics of progressive wave the numerical computation is completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary this straightforward method is free of artificial errors and very efficient for both two and three dimensional water wave problems the source points distribution on the free surface is vital for the accuracy and efficiency of the boundary integral method lee 1992 zhang et al 2010 feng et al 2019c lee 1992 beck 1994 zhang and beck 2008 and bandyk and beck 2011 applied an even rankine source distribution method in the inner domain and applied this method in various wave body problems however this method ignores the fact that the importance of rankine source decays as it is located away from the body and it is very time consuming as it requires many rankine source panels on the free surface feng et al 2014 2015 2019b developed an ever increasing spaces between source points to replace the even space method this method places a higher density of source points near the floating body and at distant from the body a distribution of lesser density through this method the number of source points is reduced and therefore the computational effort is significantly reduced in previous work rankine source model was developed to investigate two dimensional body hydrodynamic responses within arbitrary seabed conditions feng et al 2015 2016 2017 feng and price 2018 feng et al 2019a three dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate more realistic and complicated ocean seabed conditions in present study for the three dimensional model the boundary surface has to be discretized into surface panel with rankine source surface integral calculation which requires more panel numbers and computational cost than two dimensional case the establishment of the three dimensional time domain linear model will lay the foundation for future work about nonlinear problem with expectation to supply practical insight for real engineering problem in this paper layer of rankine source panels is distributed to simulate three dimensional flat uneven and sloping seabed profiles the source panel distance ever increasing method is applied to arrange the source panel on both the free surface and seabed surface to accommodate the sloping seabed condition a straightforward source panel distribution on seabed surface is developed the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical solutions are validated extensively by comparison with published data for a three dimensional oscillatory body problem the influences of flat at different water depths various uneven seabed profiles sloping seabed with different slope angles are investigated numerical simulations demonstrate that various seabed profiles have significant and complicated effects on the body hydrodynamic characteristics 2 problem formulation 2 1 fluid motion equations a coordinate frame of reference o x y z is defined with origin o at the centre of a three dimensional body floating in a fluid domain the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and enclosing surface at infinity s fig 1 shows the sketch of a three dimensional wave body interaction problem in arbitrary seabed condition the fluid flow is assumed irrotational and total velocity potential ϕ is subject to laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the associated kinematic body boundary condition is given by 2 ϕ n b v b n b on s b where n b is the unit normal vector on the body surface pointing into the fluid domain the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions are given respectively by 3 η ˆ t ϕ z 0 on s f and 4 ϕ t g η ˆ 0 on s f where η ˆ denotes the wave elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration the boundary condition applied on the far field boundary at infinity requires that the disturbance vanishes such that 5 ϕ 0 on s it is assumed that no flow penetrates the solid seabed boundary and therefore 6 ϕ n 0 0 on s 0 where n 0 is the unit normal vector on the seabed surface pointing into the fluid domain lamb 1945 expressed the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources continuously distributed on the fluid boundary surface s s b s f s 0 in the form 7 ϕ x t s b σ b 1 x x d s x s f σ f 1 x x d s x s 0 σ 0 1 x x d s x here we denote control point x x y z source point x x y z body source strength σ b σ x t free surface source strength σ f σ x t and seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x 2 2 numerical model discretization in present simulation the fluid domain surface s is discretized by rankine source panels rather than isolated rankine source points these source panels are located exactly on the fluid domain surface s let the integral surfaces s b s f and s 0 be approximated as sums of panels n b n f and n 0 respectively such as s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 therefore the discretization of eq 7 is given by 8 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i b s i b 1 x x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f 1 x x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k f s k 0 1 x x k d s x let x i b x i b s b x j f x j f s f and x k 0 x k 0 s 0 be source points and control points respectively for i 1 n b j 1 n f and k 1 n k these control points are located at the centre of three dimensional surface panels with the use of the body boundary conditions 2 and the boundary integral equation 8 with its normal derivative we solve the source strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 on s i b s j f and s k 0 from the following equations 9 ϕ x i b t n b i 1 n b σ i b n b i s i b 1 x i b x i b d s x j 1 n f σ j f n b i s j f 1 x i b x j f d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n b i s k 0 1 x i b x k 0 d s x 10 ϕ x j f t i 1 n b σ i b s i b 1 x j f x i b d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f 1 x j f x j f d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 1 x j f x k 0 d s x 11 ϕ x k 0 t n 0 i 1 n b σ i b n 0 k s i b 1 x k 0 x i b d s x j 1 n f σ j f n 0 k s j f 1 x k 0 x j f d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 n 0 k s k 0 1 x k 0 x k 0 d s x eqs 9 and 11 feature a neumann boundary condition whereas eqs 10 is constructed as dirichlet boundary condition these three boundary conditions formulate a mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity potential in the whole domain the intersection points between free surface and body surface have to satisfy both neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions this intersection point requires special treatment and the single point method is applied in present study interested readers can find detailed information of this approach in previous study feng et al 2015 2019c and is omitted herein it should be noted that theoretically both the free surface s f and seabed surface s 0 are of infinite length but the integrals of these infinite value are not possible by numerical technique for this reason the computational domain has to be truncated in the numerical simulation feng et al 2014 2019b c distributed the rankine source panels in an exponential manner allowing the covering of a very large area of free surface and numerical computations completed before the surface wave reaches the truncated boundary in present study this source panel distribution approach is applied for the free surface based on the same principle a new source distribution method is proposed to facilitate the seabed surface boundary integral and this will be discussed in section 3 the new source distribution method covers more than 100 wave length distance in the radial direction the numerical simulations are ended before the radiated wave reaches the truncated border in all the numerical simulations no wave reflection is observed this treatment makes the proposed numerical model satisfy the far field boundary condition the integral of rankine source 1 r and the derivative of the integral of rankine source 1 r on the three dimensional panel involve transformation of three dimensional element panel in global coordinate system into quadrilateral element in local element coordinate system first and then inverse transformation back to global coordinate system hess and smith 1964 as the source point approaches the control point on the surface both the integral and induced velocity are singular on account of the term 1 r x x the integration of induced velocity should be treated as a principal integral problem by taking the centre of the circle ε x as source point and letting its radius ε approach 0 the contribution of a unit source to induced normal velocity is 2 π when the source point and control point are overlapped the integral of 1 r x x can be calculated directly based on the hess smith method without special treatment for a floating body experiencing forced oscillatory motion the body position z is given by the displacement function z ξ s i n ω t 0 0 z 0 ξ s i n ω t 0 o r 12 z 0 0 ξ s i n ω t for surge heave or pitch motion where ξ and ω denote motion amplitude and oscillatory angular velocity respectively the corresponding body velocity v b is given v b ξ ω c o s ω t 0 0 v b 0 ξ ω c o s ω t 0 o r 13 v b 0 0 ξ ω c o s ω t the substitution of the source strength values σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 at time t obtained from the set of eqs 9 11 produces calculation of the normal velocity v f z x j f t ϕ x j f t z on the free surface as 14 ϕ x j f t z i 1 n b σ i b z s i b 1 x j f x i b d s x j 1 n f σ j f z s j f 1 x j f x j f d s x k 1 n f σ j f z s k 0 1 x j f x k 0 d s x fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the numerical process applied in the present study the ramp function is usually adopted during the initial period to ensure the flow smoothly develops but is not used here because numerical instability is not a problem in this numerical model 2 3 free surface time updating at any time t during the numerical simulation the free surface boundary conditions are updated according to eqs 3 and 4 by a 3rd order adams bashforth scheme for the first time step t δ t no previous time steps information is available and the updating scheme is 15 η ˆ δ t v f z 0 δ t 16 ϕ δ t g η ˆ δ t δ t and for the second time step t 2 δ t a 2nd order adam bashforth scheme is applied as 17 η ˆ 2 δ t η ˆ

scheme is therefore adopted we have 19 η ˆ t δ t η ˆ t δ t 12 23 v f z t 16 v f z t δ t 5 v f z t 2 δ t 20 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 12 23 g η ˆ t 16 g η ˆ t δ t 5 g η ˆ t 2 δ t 2 4 body force calculation with strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 determined the velocity potentials on the body surface s b are derived from eq 7 in the form 21 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ j b s i b 1 x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f 1 x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 1 x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure on the body surface p p x i b t is evaluated from bernoulli s equation expressed as 22 p t ρ ϕ t where ρ denotes the fluid density the temporal derivative of the potential is calculated by a finite difference method using the values of the velocity potential at two consecutive time steps the dynamic force f ˆ t and moment m ˆ t applied on the body surface is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface as given by 23 f ˆ t s b p x i b t n b d s 24 m ˆ t s b p x i b t r n b d s where r is the position vector of the body surface d s by adopting fourier transforms the added mass a ˆ k l ω k l 1 2 3 4 5 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motion respectively and damping coefficient b ˆ k l ω can be obtained as 25 a ˆ k l ω 2 ξ ω 2 t 0 0 t 0 f ˆ k l t sin ω t d t 26 b ˆ k l ω 2 ξ ω t 0 0 t 0 f ˆ k l t cos ω t d t where t 0 denotes the period of the body s motion for direct comparison the results will be presented in nondimensional form the force f ˆ t moment m ˆ t wave elevation η ˆ t added mass coefficient a ˆ k k ω and damping coefficient b ˆ k k ω are nondimensionalized in the form of f t f ˆ t ρ g a 2 ξ m t m ˆ t ρ g a 2 ξ 2 η t η ˆ t ξ a k l ω a ˆ k l ω m b k l ω b ˆ k l ω m ω where m and a denote body mass and body radius respectively 3 fluid domain panel distribution the fluid domain surface is composed of a body surface s b free surface s f and seabed surface s 0 these surfaces are approximated by quadrilateral panels in present study the free surface is divided into inner and outer domains in the inner domain the source panel distribution method discussed by feng et al 2015 2014 is adopted in the radial direction s f is divided into inner and outer domains distributed with source points x j f the horizontal distances between neighbouring free surface control points are expressed in the form 27 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 in the inner domain 28 x j f x j 1 f l b α j ω 2 1 0 5 j j 1 2 in the outer domain where l b is the area of the body surface panel covering the intersection point of the body and free surface the parameters α j define the separation distances and are decided according to the method discussed by feng 2014 which for this reason is omitted herein fig 3 shows a portion of free surface source panel distribution it can be seen that the rankine source points distance increase as they are located further away from the body it should be noticed that the rankine source distances depend on the oscillatory angular velocity ω as presented in eqs 27 and 28 for larger motion frequency the distances between rankine source points are smaller while the distance are larger for smaller motion frequency this free surface rankine source distribution method can be adopted in the seabed surface source distribution with minor modification in the free surface 100 panels are arranged in inner domain and 10 panels are distributed in outer domain in the radial direction in the axial direction the source panels are evenly distributed by 80 panels therefore the total number is 8800 panel on the free surface numerical simulation shows this source distribution method produces very reliable and accurate numerical data when applied on both free surface and seabed surface for flat seabed conditions however when this method is applied for the sloping seabed case parts of the source points cannot form a quadrilateral panel on the sloping seabed part this invalids the basement of hess smith method hess and smith 1964 which requires the four source grid points located in one single plane in view of this a new rankine source model is proposed in present study a tangent format function is applied to distribute the source grid points and the distances between neighbouring seabed source points are expressed in the form 29 x k 0 δ t a n γ π k 1 n 0 0 5 here parameters δ and γ define the source point distance and are decided based on the numerical test a semi sphere with radius a is selected in the numerical test this sphere is located at water depth h 2 a the sphere surface is discretized by 144 12 12 panel and the free surface is approximated by 720 60 12 panels for the seabed surface the distribution method 29 is applied in both x and y directions on the surface with 400 20 20 panels cover the whole seabed surface for δ and γ 5 sets of data are applied in the numerical predictions the values of these data sets are presented in table 1 it is noticed that both the single source panel area and whole source panel covered area increase with the increasing of parameters δ and γ from data set 1 to 5 parameter δ is arranged in an increasing manner while the value of γ decreases the semi sphere is forced to undergo oscillatory heave motion fig 4 shows comparisons of heave added mass of this semi sphere obtained by hydrostar bureau veritas 2007 and proposed model with data set 1 2 3 4 and 5 the proposed model with data set 3 produces most accurate data and therefore values in set 3 are selected for δ and γ as limited data sets are tested in the numerical simulations this selection process cannot guarantee data set 3 is the best parameters but the proposed model with set 3 produces satisfying results in the numerical test the seabed source distribution method with data set 3 for parameters δ and γ are applied in the following numerical simulations comparing with the source distribution method in the free surface the seabed source distribution method has only one formula for the whole seabed surface and there are only two parameters therefore this method is more straightforward than that applied on the free surface similar as the source distribution on the free surface this distribution scheme places high density of source near the floating body and sparse source away from the body the proposed model distributes source panels on more than 100 wave lengths distance on the seabed surface the covered area is similar as that for free surface moreover the proposed method can guarantee the sloping seabed source grid points located in one plane and therefore hess smith method can be applied to calculate the rankine source integral fig 5 shows a portion of sloping seabed source panel mesh by the proposed method for every panel the four grid points are located in one plane 4 numerical results in present study all the numerical simulations are performed in time domain and converted to frequency domain data for direct comparison 4 1 flat seabed effects numerical convergence test is performed to check the numerical convergence of the proposed model 6 sets of panel numbers are applied in the numerical tests 8 12 16 and 20 panels in both x and y directions are applied which correspond to 64 144 196 and 400 panels on the whole seabed surface respectively a truncated cylinder with water depth h to cylinder radius a ratio h a 2 0 and cylinder draft d to cylinder radius a ratio d a 1 0 is selected in the numerical simulation fig 6 shows the sketch of the truncated cylinder in the fluid domain the truncated cylinder is forced to undergo oscillatory surge motion fig 7 shows comparison of the cylinder surge added mass a 11 ω between jiang et al 2014 analytical data and proposed method results for seabed surface panel number n 0 64 144 196 and 400 respectively it is noticed that the proposed method produces more and more accurate results compared with the analytical data as the seabed surface panel number increases the present model with panel number n 0 400 produces satisfying results and is therefore applied in the following numerical simulations in summary the free surface body surface and seabed surface have n f 720 n b 400 and n 0 400 respectively in present numerical simulations numerical simulations are further performed to validate the proposed numerical model two truncated cylinders are applied in the numerical simulations the first truncated cylinder has ratio h a 2 0 and d a 1 0 while the second one has h a 2 0 and d a 1 5 fig 8 demonstrates comparison between proposed method data and yeung 1981 analytical data for heave added mass a 33 ω a and jiang et al 2014 for pitch surge added mass a 51 ω b for both two cylinders it is noticed that both the self induced and the coupled coefficients obtained by proposed model agree with published data favourably well these numerical tests further validate the proposed numerical model to investigate wave body interaction problem within seabed condition feng et al 2016 pointed out that the mean water depth remarkably influences the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating body the water depth of real ocean environment varies significantly in order to investigate the water depth effects to the floating body hydrodynamic performance numerical simulations are performed for a truncated cylinder with d a 0 5 experiencing forced surge and heave motion respectively fig 9 shows comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients between yeung 1981 analytical data for h a 1 0 and proposed method results for the cylinder with water depth h a 1 0 h a 0 8 h a 0 7 and h a 0 6 respectively it is noticed that both surge added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω coefficients are noticeably effected by water depth in low frequency range both a 11 ω and b 11 ω are increased when water depths decrease however the water depth has little effect for surge added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω when k a 1 0 and k a 2 0 respectively fig 10 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients between jiang et al 2014 analytical data for h a 1 0 and proposed method results for the cylinder with water depth h a 1 0 h a 0 8 h a 0 7 and h a 0 6 respectively the water depths have significant effects for the heave added mass a 33 ω and damping b 33 ω coefficients across the whole frequency the heave added mass a 33 ω is approximately three times larger when water depth is h a 0 6 than that when water depth is h a 1 0 across the whole frequency range numerical simulations are further conducted to investigate the seabed effects for force responses excited by forced oscillatory motions a cylinder with d a 1 0 is located in water depths h a 2 0 h a 1 6 and h a 1 2 respectively fig 11 demonstrates the time record of vertical force f z t when the cylinder experiences forced heave motion with motion frequency ω 2 a g 0 7 it is noticed that the floating body experiences larger hydrodynamic force for shallower water depth it is also noticed that the seabed has little effect for the force phase numerical simulation also shows the flat seabed has noticeable effects for the time series of horizontal force and pitch moment though these results are not presented here fig 13 shows the time record of wave elevation η t when the cylinder experiences forced heave motions with motion frequency ω 2 a g 0 7 the wave probe is located in the same position as the third rankine source point in the radial direction and it is about 0 115 λ away from the body edge the wave profiles generated at first and second source points are not steady because they are close to the intersection point between body and free surfaces in present study the wave probe is always located in the same position as the third rankine source point unless otherwise stated the shallower water depths increase the wave elevation amplitude but have little effects for the wave phase 4 2 uneven seabed effects numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the uneven seabed effects for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the body concave and convex shaped undulations are two basic seabed topographies and widely exist in the marine environment su et al 2008 düzbastilar and sentürk 2009 for example a sediment scour or a buried pipeline can significantly change the seabed topography in present study concave and convex semi ellipsoid shaped seabed topographies are used to represent an undulating seabed fig 12 shows a sketch of uneven seabed profile applied in present study the seabed model is constructed by the ellipsoid equation 30 x 2 x 1 2 y 2 y 1 2 z 2 z 1 2 1 here x 1 y 1 and z 1 denote half length of the principal axes x and y axes forms flat seabed surface and positive z denotes concave seabed shape while negative z denotes convex shape which is similar as that illustrated in fig 12 a truncated cylinder with water depth h to cylinder radius a ratio h a 1 0 and cylinder draft d to cylinder radius a ratio d a 0 5 is applied in the numerical simulation fig 14 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 z 1 2 h respectively z 1 0 refers to flat seabed essentially in this numerical simulation the seabed profile has x 1 3 h and y 1 2 h it is noticed that both added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping coefficients b 33 ω significantly increase as z 1 increasing this is especially true for the added mass coefficient a 33 ω this hydrodynamic coefficient is almost tripled as z 1 increases from 2 h to 0 4 h across the frequency range fig 15 demonstrates comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 and z 1 2 0 h respectively the value of z 1 effects both added mass a 11 ω and damping b 11 ω coefficients significantly surge added mass coefficient a 11 ω increases with z 1 going up in lower frequency range k a 0 8 while this coefficient decreases in higher frequency range k a 0 8 surge damping coefficient b 11 ω increases with z 1 increasing when the frequency k a is smaller than 1 7 and keeps constant when the frequency k a is bigger than 1 7 fig 16 shows comparison of wave elevation η excited by body experiencing forced heave motion a and surge motion b over uneven seabed with z 1 0 4 h z 1 0 2 h z 1 0 and z 1 2 0 h respectively the wave probe is located in the same position as the third rankine source point in the radial direction and it is about 0 115 λ away from the body edge for the wave elevation η 3 generated by forced heave motion η 3 increases as the z 1 increases across the whole frequency range for the wave elevation η 1 the value increases first and then decrease as the z 1 increases fig 17 shows oblique views of free surface profile generated by heave motion a and surge motion b for k a 2 0 and z 1 0 4 h at time t 6 t 0 it should be noticed the wave elevation is in a radiated way around the body for heave motion and it is approximately symmetric along y axis for body experiencing surge motion numerical simulations are also performed for the semi ellipsoid shaped seabed profile with z 1 0 4 h and x 1 y 1 fig 18 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with x 1 0 5 h x 1 1 0 h x 1 2 0 h and x 1 3 0 h respectively both the added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping coefficient b 33 ω are significantly affected by the values of x 1 it should be noticed that both the added mass coefficient a 33 ω and damping b 33 ω b coefficients increase with x 1 increasing fig 19 shows comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for uneven seabed with x 1 0 5 h x 1 1 0 h x 1 2 0 h and x 1 3 0 respectively the surge added mass a 11 ω increases when frequency k a is smaller than 0 7 and decreases when k a is bigger than 0 7 with the value of x 1 increasing the surge damping b 11 ω goes up when frequency k a is smaller than 2 and keeps roughly constant for k a 2 0 as the change of x 1 alters the seabed profile the data presented in figs 18 and 19 further demonstrates the importance of seabed topography for the hydrodynamic characteristics of floating body 4 3 sloping seabed effects one major concern about sloping seabed effects is the reflection caused by the sloping seabed side feng et al 2017 in proposed model large area of free surface and seabed surface are covered by rankine source panel according to the proposed source distributed method the sloping seabed side causes reflected wave and this reflected wave travels into fluid domain in another side as very large areas are covered by rankine source panel the reflected wave can travel towards far field without suffering second reflection this principle is the same as that applied to deal with two dimensional sloping seabed problem feng et al 2017 numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the sloping seabed effects for cylinder experiencing forced motions the seabed inclination is indicated by seabed sloping angle β which is defined as tan β l x l z here l x and l z denote the horizontal and vertical distance of sloping seabed part in the x and z direction respectively fig 20 illustrates the definition of the seabed sloping angle β a cylinder with a d 6 is applied in the numerical simulation and this cylinder is located in mean water depth h d 1 6 in order to give a direct comparison the flat seabed condition is also included in the numerical simulation time convergent tests are performed for both flat and sloping seabed conditions for flat seabed generally satisfied results can be obtained when time step δ t t 0 100 for sloping seabed the time step has to be smaller than δ t t 0 100 to guarantee convergent results fig 21 shows the convergence test for wave profile generated when the cylinder experiencing forced heave motion with k a 0 40 measured at third source point under sloping seabed condition it is noticed that the numerical model produces convergent results when δ t t 0 120 and the data produced when δ t t 0 120 and δ t t 0 160 are almost overlapped δ t t 0 120 is applied in the following numerical simulation unless otherwise stated fig 22 shows comparison of heave added mass a 33 ω a and damping b 33 ω b coefficients for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is noticed that the sloping seabed increases the heave added mass a 11 ω significantly across the frequency range the heave damping coefficient a 11 ω also increases noticeably as the slope angle increases fig 23 demonstrates time series of vertical force f z t for cylinder experiencing forced heave motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is observed that the seabed inclination increase the heave force amplitude but has no effects on the force phase fig 24 shows top view of wave profile for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 t 0 for flat seabed a and sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 8 b respectively for flat seabed case the wave is in a radiated symmetrical profile along the body for sloping seabed the wave profile becomes unsymmetrical as the slope seabed angle β increases the wave length on the slope side becomes more and more less fig 25 shows comparison of wave elevation η in x z plan on sloping part for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 00 t 0 a t 6 25 t 0 b t 6 50 t 0 c and t 6 75 t 0 d for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the sloping part has length l x 70 m in the numerical simulation the dashed line in fig 25 illustrates the sloping and flat seabed bottom profile applied in the numerical simulation it should be noticed that the wave starting from the body surface rather than x 0 in the numerical simulation the starting point is placed at x 0 artificially for clear demonstration in fig 25 it is further confirmed that the sloping seabed part shortens the wavelength the wave amplitude decreases on this plane as the seabed inclination increases recalling fig 24 it is noticed that the wave amplitude actually increases on the plane between x 0 and y 0 this can be contributed to the three dimensional characteristics of the fluid domain and the generated wave travels is a non uniform pattern on the free surface fig 26 demonstrates comparison of surge added mass a 11 ω a and damping b 11 ω b coefficients for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the seabed inclination reduces the surge added mass coefficient a 11 ω but increases the surge damping coefficient a 11 ω noticeably across the frequency range fig 27 shows time series of horizontal force f x t for cylinder experiencing forced surge motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively it is noticed that the seabed inclination has limited effects on the horizontal force f x t fig 28 demonstrates time series of vertical force f z t for the cylinder experiencing forced surge motion with motion frequency k a 2 1 for the same seabed condition as presented in fig 27 the seabed inclination has significant effect on the vertical force f z t for flat seabed no vertical force is generated because of the symmetry the vertical force f z t increases as the seabed slope angle increases for the slope seabed with tan β 0 8 the vertical force f z t amplitude reaches about 25 of the horizontal force the vertical force is expected to increase further as slope angle β increase this implies the importance of seabed inclination for the hydrodynamic effects on the floating body fig 29 illustrates the top view of wave profile for body experiencing forced surge motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 t 0 for flat seabed a and sloping seabed with t a n β 8 b respectively for flat seabed the wave profile is roughly symmetric along the y axis but the seabed inclination alters this symmetric characteristics and shortens the generated wave length on the sloping seabed side fig 30 shows comparison of wave elevation η in x z plan on sloping part for body experiencing forced heave motion with k a 2 1 at time t 6 00 t 0 a t 6 25 t 0 b t 6 50 t 0 c and t 6 75 t 0 d for flat seabed sloping seabed with sloping angle t a n β 4 t a n β 6 and t a n β 8 respectively the sloping part has length l x 70 m in the numerical simulation it should be noticed that the wave starting from the body surface rather than x 0 in the numerical simulation the starting point is placed at x 0 artificially for clear demonstration in fig 30 it is further confirmed that the sloping seabed part shortens the wavelength and increases the wave amplitude on this plane as the seabed inclination increases from figs 24 25 29 and 30 it is observed that the wave elevation reduces as it travels outside this is because the generated wave travels outwards in a radial pattern and the wave amplitude decays naturally as the wave travels in an ever increasing circle the distance ever increasing method is applied to distribute the rankine source panel in the free surface that is high density mesh near the oscillating body and low density mesh when it is away from the body the rankine source is distributed in an exponential way in the outer domain which covers very large area the generated wave cannot reach the border before numerical simulation is ended on the free surface totally 8800 panels are used with 110 panels in the radial direction and 80 panels in the axial direction for numerical simulation with 10 t 0 and time step δ t 0 005 t 0 it requires 521 s cpu time in a desktop with processor of 2 90 ghz this paper uses 3 d rankine source model to investigate the hydrodynamic responses of body experiencing forced oscillation motion over flat uneven and sloping seabed in time domain the numerical model can simulate arbitrary seabed profile without much difficulty in present paper only radiation problem is investigated the diffraction problem involving sloping seabed can be challenging considering wave reflection and refraction by the sloping seabed as pointed out by buchner 2006 and ferreira and newman 2009 the present model cannot be directly applied to investigate the wave diffraction and floating body motion problems substantial modification is expected to make in order to investigate this problem 5 conclusions three dimensional rankine source model is developed to investigate the hydrodynamic responses for oscillatory body in arbitrary seabed condition the free surface seabed surface and body surface are presented by layer of continuous panels rather than a discretization by isolated points the free surface and seabed surface boundary conditions feature a neumann boundary condition whereas body surface boundary condition construct a dirichlet boundary condition these mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions formulate a closed boundary element model to investigate the wave body interaction problem within various seabed conditions the rankine source panels are positioned exactly on the fluid boundary surfaces without desingularization technique applied the ever increasing spaces distribution method is applied to arrange free surface source panel distribution to accommodate the sloping seabed profile a straightforward source panel distribution on seabed surface is newly developed with two parameters determined by numerical tests these numerical techniques facilities the computational cost in an accepted level as very large area free surface and seabed surface are covered by rankine source panel the reflected wave produced by sloping seabed side can travel towards far field without further reflection caused by truncated boundary numerical convergence test is conducted to check the numerical convergent performance of the proposed rankine source distribution model on the seabed surface good numerical convergence result demonstrates the reliability of the proposed model the proposed model are validated by comparison with published data extensively for a truncated cylinder experiencing forced surge heave and pitch motions the flat seabed demonstrates significant and complicated effects for the body experiencing forced oscillatory motions as water depths decreases both the surge added mass and damping coefficients increase noticeably when the oscillatory frequency is in lower frequency range however the water depth has little effect when the oscillatory frequency is in larger frequency range the water depth has significant effects for both heave and pitch motions across the whole frequency range for example the pitch damping coefficient is more than five times larger when water depth is h a 0 6 than that when water depth is h a 1 0 across the whole frequency range the horizontal vertical force and moment amplitudes increase as water depth decreases but vertical force is much more sensitive than the other two to water depth the water depth has little effects to the phase of the force time series the water depth affects the heave wave elevation slightly and has very limited effects to the surge and pitch wave elevation the ellipsoid equation is applied to represent the concave and convex seabed shapes the values of z 1 and x 1 have significant effects on the hydrodynamic responses for the floating body with z 1 increasing both the heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 increase dramatically across the frequency range the surge hydrodynamic coefficients a 11 and b 11 also change noticeable but demonstrate different trends across the frequency range the wave elevation η 3 increases along the frequency range while the wave elevation η 1 increases first and then decreases with the value of z 1 going up with x 1 increasing both the heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 increase dramatically across the frequency range but the surge hydrodynamic coefficients a 11 and b 11 show different trends across the frequency range the sloping seabed inclination has remarkable and complicated effects to the floating body hydrodynamic coefficients both the heave added mass coefficient a 33 and b 33 increase significantly across the whole frequency range as seabed sloping angle increases the increasing of seabed inclination also increases the heave force amplitudes but has no effects on the force phase the sloping seabed alters the symmetrical characteristics of the seabed profile and causes wave profile become more and more unsymmetrical as the slope seabed angle β increases with the increase of sloping angle the surge added mass coefficient a 11 decreases while surge damping coefficient b 11 increases across the frequency range noticeably the seabed inclination has little effect for the time record of horizontal force f x t while the vertical force f z t increases significantly as sloping angle β increases due to the change of seabed profile the wave profile becomes unsymmetrical and the generated wave has shorter wave length on the sloping seabed side for body experiencing both forced heave and surge motions flat seabed uneven seabed and sloping seabed profiles are considered in present study the proposed model can be further extended to investigate arbitrary seabed profile without much difficulty for more complicated seabed profiles generally higher mesh density is expected to require declaration of competing interest the

20754,currently most autonomous underwater gliders augs operate on primary lithium batteries as the state of charge of a primary lithium battery and the influence of marine environment on the glider are difficult to measure it is hard to forecast the energy consumption of a glider accurately which has caused the failure of many glider missions for the purpose of safely deploying the aug mission and effectively optimizing the motion parameters to increase the endurance it is very important to make an accurate energy consumption prediction model of the aug in this paper a novel model based on the least squares support vector machine lssvm and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm namely the lssvm pso model is proposed to forecast the energy consumption of the aug considering that the kernel function and the lssvm related parameters have a great influence on the performance of the prediction model several lssvm models based on different kernel functions for energy consumption prediction are established and the parameters are optimized by the pso algorithm the performance of lssvm pso models with different kernel functions are compared based on the sea trial data the results indicate that the lssvm pso model with a radial basis kernel function has a higher accuracy than other models for energy consumption prediction moreover the performance of the lssvm pso model trained by different sample sizes and that of the conventional mathematical energy consumption prediction model are compared the results demonstrate that the lssvm pso model is superior with a large enough training sample size keywords autonomous underwater gliders energy consumption prediction least squares support vector machines particle swarm optimization algorithm 1 introduction ocean observation is critical to many human activities including coastal protection fishing defense and security tourism and marine renewable energy utilization in recent years autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have been conceived for long term large scale ocean observations by marine scientists and engineers bi et al 2020 falcão carneiro and gomes de almeida 2018 however limited by the battery energy the conventional propeller driven auvs can only operate for a few hours mahmoudian et al 2007 as a special form of auvs autonomous underwater gliders augs which use a buoyancy engine combined with a set of fixed wings to move vertically and horizontally in a sawtooth like pattern through the water column are capable of extended duration deployments on the order of weeks to months or even close to a year claus et al 2012 ramos et al 2018 due to the low cost and high sustainability augs have been an integral part of the global ocean observing system goos liblik et al 2016 testor et al 2019 and the integrated marine observing system imos pattiaratchi et al 2017 etc to facilitate deployment and concealment augs are usually designed to be very compact with a length of less than 3 m and a weight of less than 100 kg resulting in limited battery supply therefore a current research focus is to reduce energy consumption and improve the voyage of augs under the constraints of limited energy namely to improve the energy efficiency moreover as the state of charge soc of primary lithium batteries used by most of the current gliders is difficult to directly and accurately estimate the battery power failures have been the second leading cause of glider mission failures smeed et al 2014 as a consequence accurately calculating the energy consumption of the glider and then making a trade off between the energy consumption and glider mission i e energy management are very important and challenging for operating the glider safely and efficiently at present it is a primary and effective method to solve the above problems by establishing and analyzing of an energy consumption prediction model ecpm in most studies the ecpm namely cost function in some literature is used as a heuristic function in various optimization algorithms and has played a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methods by integrating the ecpm into a simulation environment or an onboard controller the glider may automatically adjust its state to reduce energy cost and the operator can acquire the accurate soc in the last two decades several efforts have been made to forecast energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of augs by establishing ecpms based on an energy cost model inanc et al 2005 proved the important role of lagrangian coherent structures in the energy optimal path planning of underwater gliders considering the ocean currents as an extension to the results of inanc et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 established a 3d b spline models of the ocean current flows which are applied in nonlinear trajectory generation to find the energy optimal glider trajectories rao and williams 2009 used rapidly exploring random trees rrts with a heuristic energy cost function to determine energy optimal paths that account for the influence of ocean currents and terrain subramani et al 2014 presented a method to find an energy optimal path among time optimal paths based on stochastic dynamically orthogonal level set equations and a simple ecpm cao et al 2016a optimized the 3d trajectory with minimal energy consumption of augs by a modified dubins curve with genetic algorithm where a highly nonlinear and coupled ecpm was employed as the heuristic function using the same method and ecpm in cao et al 2016a cao et al 2016b found the rendezvous trajectories for multiple gliders with a minimal energy consumption over all participating vehicles lee et al 2017 implemented the fmt algorithm to address the problem of energy optimal path planning in the presence of flow fields for augs with complex dynamics an ecpm dependent on the internal non linear dynamics was presented and in particular the energy required to change the heading angle was taken into account yu et al 2013 established an applied mathematical ecpm by analyzing the dynamic model and workflow of the glider in the vertical plane to optimize the motion parameters of sea wing and extend the gliding range the model relating the gliding range to steady gliding motion parameters and energy consumption has been adopted in several studies sun et al 2016 2017 xue et al 2018 in xue et al 2018 the accuracy of the ecpm was verified to be 22 24 by three petrel ii gliders in sun et al 2016 the motion parameters of a blended wing body bwb glider were optimized to increase the gliding range in sun et al 2017 the shape of bwb glider was optimized to improve the hydrodynamic performance and achieve the maximum gliding range woithe et al 2010 deduced an energy cost model of slocum glider from sea trial data and integrated it into the simulation environment to efficiently plan the glider deployment based on woithe et al 2010 woithe and kremer 2015 presented a sensor control technique to observe energy savings by applying the published thermocline detection and tracking algorithms to an underwater glider yang et al 2019 obtain the optimized motion parameters of petrel l glider by combining an ecpm and the inner penalty function method ipfm and proposed a hidden gliding strategy model to save energy in song et al 2020 a complete ecpm of the glider was deduced based on the dynamic equations and the key parameters that affect the energy consumption of petrel ii glider were identified through the sobol sensitivity analysis method the accuracy of the model has been verified through the sea trial data which is 2 68 in the vertical plane and 7 18 in 3d space the above works have made remarkable contributions to improving the performance of gliders especially the endurance however the existing ecpms derived from the dynamic model have the following limitations i the random marine environmental factors acting on gliders such as the ocean current and biofouling which have a significant impact on energy consumption haldeman et al 2016 rao and williams 2009 are difficult to be included in the ecpm and ii different control algorithms in different gliders are difficult to be reflected in one ecpm these limitations have led to the low accuracy and non universality of the existing ecpms which may cause inefficient or even failed mission deployment of augs in light of the above problems we introduce artificial intelligence ai to predict the energy consumption with another purpose to improve the intelligence of the gliders ai has made a quantum leap in the last few years which has the capabilities of learning reasoning and decision making ai has seen remarkable advancements in the field of medicine chemical engineering etc chang 2020 mesbah et al 2014 2017 2019 2020 pan and zhang 2021 tandon and rajawat 2020 xu and guedes soares 2016 xu and soares 2019 as a subfield of ai machine learning algorithms linear regression support vector machine naive bayes etc are used to perform tasks by learning patterns from data in this paper the least squares support vector machine lssvm with different kernel functions are adopted to establish the ecpms and the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of lssvm the optimal kernel function is then obtained and the lssvm pso models trained by different sample sizes are compared with the mathematical ecpm in song et al 2020 through sea trial data the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the lssvm pso model is higher than other existing ecpms if there are enough training samples finally a combination of the lssvm pso model and conventional mathematical ecpm is recommended as the existing augs are capable of operating more than one thousand work cycles a work cycle consists of an ascent and a dive which can provide a large number of training samples we argue that the proposed lssvm pso model is more suitable to forecast the energy consumption than the math ecpm in addition as the lssvm pso model is determined only by the real operation data of the glider which includes the influence of marine environmental factors and control strategies it has better universality for various augs the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the basic principle of lssvm section 3 presents the overview of the pso algorithm in brief section 4 illustrates the novel intelligent ecpm based on lssvm pso in section 5 the performance of different models is compared and the results are discussed finally section 6 ends the paper by presenting the main conclusions drawn from this work 2 lssvm 2 1 basic principle of lssvm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 lssvm has a unique superiority in dealing with the small sample learning problem which has become a powerful tool for data regression lssvm has been improved in two ways over its predecessor svm firstly the inequality constraints in the svm are modified to equality constraints secondly instead of the slack variable lssvm adopts the training error square in the cost function as a result the original quadratic programming problem is transformed into solving a set of linear equations which thus improves the computation speed and accuracy significantly gu et al 2011 the lssvm has played an important role in several fields including data regression yarveicy et al 2014 pattern recognition adankon and cheriet 2009 time series prediction yuan et al 2015 etc fig 1 illustrates the structure diagram of lssvm for the given n training data pairs x i y i i 1 2 n where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d t ℝ d d dimensional vector space is the input vector and y i r is the corresponding output value the input data can be mapped to a higher dimensional space from the original feature space ℝ d by adopting a nonlinear function ϕ x then the lssvm model can be constructed as follows 1 f x ω t ϕ x b where ω is weight vector and b is bias term based on the principle of structural risk minimization the estimation problem is formulated as the following optimization problem 2 min ω b e j ω e min 1 2 ω t ω 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 s t y i ω t ϕ x i b e i i 1 2 n γ 0 the 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 is the regularization function penalty term where γ is a nonnegative regularization parameter determining the trade off between precision and complexity of the model and e i represents the regression error between the actual and predicted values in lssvm the regularization function is a normal and effective method to limit overfitting more detailed information about the regularization can be seen in suvrit et al 2011 to solve the above optimization problem the corresponding lagrange function is employed to absorb the boundary conditions which can be expressed as 3 l ω b e α 1 2 ω t ω 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i ω t ϕ x i b e i y i where α i i 1 2 n are the lagrange multipliers partially differentiated with respect to ω b e i and α i the conditions for optimality solution of the problem can be obtained by setting all derivatives zero 4 l ω 0 ω i 1 n α i ϕ x i 5 l b 0 i 1 n α i 0 6 l e i 0 α γ e i 7 l α i 0 ω t ϕ x i b e i y i 0 by removing ω and e i the optimization process can be transformed into the linear equation below 8 0 e t e ω γ 1 e b α 0 y where y y 1 y n t e 1 1 t α α 1 α n t and ω is an n n symmetric matrix of kernel function in which 9 ω ij k x i x j ϕ x i t ϕ x j i j 1 2 n in eq 9 k x i x j is the kernel function satisfying the mercer s conditions the kernel function plays an important role in constructing high performance lssvm with the ability to reduce the computational complexity in high dimensional space then the lssvm model can be expressed as 10 y x i 1 n α i k x i x b 2 2 kernel functions and hyperparameters the performance of lssvm depends mostly on the combination of the kernel functions and hyperparameters which refer to the parameters in regularization item and kernel functions the selection of kernel functions and the optimization of parameters are described below 2 2 1 the selection of kernel functions the operating mechanism of kernel function is to map linearly inseparable samples into high dimensional space making the samples linearly separable as well as to avoid the curse of dimensionality the performance of lssvm varies greatly with different kernel functions many types of kernel function exist for selecting and we present some common forms as follows i line kernel 11 k x i x j x i x j t ii polynomial kernel 12 k x i x j x i x j t c m iii radial basis function rbf kernel 13 k x i x j exp x i x j 2 2 σ 2 iv sigmoid kernel 14 k x i x j tanh a x i x j t c as there is no prior experience in this paper the above four kernel functions available from existing literature and ls svmlab toolbox v1 8 de et al 2011 are employed to investigate the optimal lssvm model of energy consumption prediction 2 2 2 hyperparameter optimization the hyperparameters are the regularization parameter of lssvm and the parameters in the kernel functions in order to improve the performance of the lssvm model hyperparameter optimization is indispensable we express the optimization objective as follows 15 min e r r o r min 1 n k 1 n y k y ˆ k 2 where n is the number of samples used for optimization y k and y ˆ k are the actual value and predicted value respectively and error is the root mean square error between the actual value and predicted value considering that the pso algorithm has a higher convergence speed and occupies less memory than other heuristic search methods moayedi et al 2018 which is suitable for the onboard controller of the aug in this paper the pso algorithm is adopted to conduct the hyperparameter optimization the main principle of pso will be illustrated in the next section 3 basic principle of pso algorithm pso is a stochastic optimization algorithm proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on the simulation of the social behavior of birds within a flock and the swarm intelligence theory the swarm of particles in the pso algorithm cooperates and interacts to search for the best personal p best and the most appropriate global g best positions in the search space the velocity and position of all particles will be updated as follows 16 v new β v c 1 r 1 p best x c 2 r 2 g best x 17 x new x v new where x and v denote the present position and velocity of each particle respectively x new and v new designate the new position and velocity of each particle respectively β is inertia weight used to control the impact of the previous history of the velocity c 1 is the cognition learning factor c 2 is the social learning factor and r 1 and r 2 are two independent random numbers in the range of 0 1 more detailed information about the pso algorithm can be seen in wang et al 2017 4 ecpm based on lssvm pso in this section the lssvm and pso algorithm are combined to establish the novel ecpm of the underwater glider and hereinafter this ecpm is called the lssvm pso model for convenience the function of the lssvm pso model is to predict the energy consumption of a glider in a work cycle the output of the model is the energy consumption while the input may be various data including motion parameters control parameters etc once enough training samples are obtained the lssvm can be established to map the relationship between the input and output to improve the performance of the lssvm model different kernel functions are tried and the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm according to eq 15 namely the fitness function finally for arbitrary input parameters the prediction of energy consumption of a glider in a work cycle can be obtained the structure of the lssvm pso model is shown in fig 2 and the model is implemented as follows step 1 divide the data of the gliders into the training set validation set and test set among which the training set is used to train the lssvm model the validation set is used to calculate the fitness of the pso model and test set is a substitute for new input data to evaluate the performance of the lssvm pso model step 2 choose a kernel function herein four kernel functions in section 2 2 1 are selected to find the optimal one step 3 set the initial parameters of the lssvm and pso algorithm to establish the initial

discussion 5 1 data acquisition and preparation a petrel ii glider fig 3 developed by tianjin university liu et al 2017 is selected to verify the lssvm pso model the main specifications of the petrel ii glider are listed in table 1 a deployment was conducted with a petrel ii glider named hy06 from august 4 2017 to august 29 2017 as shown in fig 4 the glider made a round trip in the south china sea the reported number of work cycles is 195 and the corresponding motion parameters are shown in fig 5 in this study the velocity v gliding angle θ and diving depth h of the glider are taken as input data of the ecpm according to the fact that they have a more significant influence on the energy consumption and gliding range song et al 2020 and can be easily obtained from the onboard memory the corresponding output of the ecpm is the energy consumption of the glider in one work cycle the actual energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the voltage and current recorded in the onboard memory then integrating over the operation time we extracted the velocity gliding angle and diving depth of each work cycle of hy06 and calculated the corresponding energy consumption as samples then the samples were divided into training set 1 120 validation set 121 160 and test set 161 195 by 6 2 2 approximately so as to ensure that each dataset has enough data points and the prediction results are convergent and to avoid overfitting and expansion of computation 5 2 parameters initialization of the lssvm pso model the initial values of related parameters in lssvm pso model are set as follows the particle number is 100 the maximum evolutionary generation number is 200 the learning factors c 1 1 4 and c 2 1 the velocity of particle v 10 the weight β is set to 0 4 1 3 the regularization parameter γ is set to 0 01 1000 the bandwidth of rbf kernel σ is set to 0 01 100 the degree of polynomial kernel d is set to 0 01 100 the coefficient of sigmoid kernel a is set to 0 01 100 and the constant c is set to 0 01 100 5 3 performance evaluation index to evaluate and compare the performance of different ecpms the following indexes are employed i mean absolute error mae 19 mae 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i ii mean absolute percentage error mape 20 mape 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i y i iii root mean square error rmse 21 rmse 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 iv coefficients of determination r2 22 r 2 1 i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 t y i y i 2 where t is the sample size of test set and y is the average of true values the mae mape and rmse measure the error between the predicted energy consumption and actual energy consumption the r2 lying in 0 1 is a statistical measure of the agreement between the regression predictions and the real data points the larger r2 is the closer the predicted result of the model is to the true value another index is v prediction time pt which represents the time it takes for an ecpm to return an accurate prediction it is a critical indicator since underwater glider mission planning is usually real time and ecpm often plays a key role in mission planning the smaller the pt the higher the prediction efficiency of the ecpm since pt includes two parts the pso algorithm and the lssvm model we divide pt into ptpso and ptlssvm the former represents the time taken by pso algorithm to return the optimal hyperparameters and the latter corresponds to the time taken by lssvm model to return the prediction of energy consumption in this paper we investigate pt with a computer and matlab software the computer is configured as inter r core tm i5 10400 f cpu 2 90 ghz 16 gb ram win10 operating system 64 bit 5 4 lssvm pso models with different kernel functions the kernel functions of eq 11 14 are used to establish corresponding lssvm pso models the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm and the optimal results are presented in table 2 the lssvm models are trained by the complete training set while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of each lssvm pso model the prediction results are shown in figs 6 and 7 the detailed indexes are shown in table 3 the above results demonstrate that the rbf kernel function leads to smaller error indexes mae mape and rmse and higher coefficients of determination in the lssvm pso model than other kernel functions indicating a higher consistency between the true energy consumption and the predicted energy consumption of the lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function compared with the operation time of a glider work cycle several hours pt is very short 1 min indicating that the lssvm pso model has the ability to return prediction in a timely manner moreover a large part of pt is consumed by the pso algorithm to find the optimal hyperparameters the lssvm model only needs very little time to return the prediction results in practice the hyperparameters may not need to be recalculated therefore it can be considered that the actual pt is equal to ptlssvm which further ensures the prediction efficiency of lssvm pso model 5 5 comparison of lssvm pso model and mathematical model after getting the optimal lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function in section 5 4 we compared the performance of this lssvm pso model and conventional mathematical ecpm hereinafter called math ecpm in this paper the math ecpm established in the study song et al 2020 is adopted as it has higher accuracy than other math ecpms the test set is used for this comparison and the results are shown in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 fig 8 shows that the predicted energy consumption of the lssvm pso model is closer to the true value than that of the math ecpm fig 9 shows a smaller error of the lssvm pso model the indexes in table 4 quantify the above results the mae mape and rmse of the lssvm pso model are 49 54 and 18 smaller than those of the math ecpm respectively while the r2 of the lssvm pso model is 5 higher than that of math ecpm the results of pt indicate that once the optimal hyperparameters are determined the prediction efficiency of the optimal lssvm pso model will be significantly improved to surpass that of the math ecpm since the training sample size is small which may cause overfitting mae mape rmse and r2 for training set 1 120 and validation set 121 160 are also calculated to check the possibility of overfitting the results are shown in fig 10 and table 5 in table 5 it is shown that the prediction accuracy of lssvm pso model in the training set is slightly superior to that in the validation set and the test set which is inevitable however the differences between the performance indexes in each dataset are not very large the differences of mae between the training set and the other two datasets are 903 kj and 547 5 kj respectively the differences of mape are 1 71 and 1 14 respectively the differences of rmse are 1820 2 kj and 1122 3 kj respectively the differences of r2 are 0 0467 and 0 0679 respectively according to the above results there is no obvious overfitting in the above the optimal lssvm pso model is trained by the complete training set with 120 data points the performance of the lssvm however is greatly affected by the training sample size moreover the increase of the training sample size will result in the expansion of computation therefore the key to making a trade off between the performance and the computation is to take appropriate training sample size to address this issue we trained the lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function by different training sets containing various sample sizes the performance of these lssvm pso models and that of the math ecpm are compared through the test set to check the possibility of overfitting the performance of the lssvm pso models for training set and validation set is also investigated the results are shown in figs 11 14 for math ecpm the performance indexes are constants indicating that the accuracy is independent of the training sample size figs 11 and 12 show that the accuracy of the lssvm pso model will quickly exceed that of math ecpm when the indexes are mae and mape the corresponding training sample sizes are 20 and 12 respectively figs 13 and 14 however present a slower process for the lssvm pso model to reach a higher accuracy than the math ecpm the training sample sizes for rsme and r2 are 57 and 56 respectively in addition the training sample size is 110 when the lssvm pso model converges to the optimal value it s worth noting that there will be a significant gap between the performance indexes in training set and those in validation set and test set with a very small training sample size indicating there is a risk of overfitting when the training sample size is greater than 60 the gap is obviously smaller and tends to be stable and the possibility of overfitting is greatly reduced according to the results we argue that to accurately predict the energy consumption of the glider the math ecpm is superior when the work cycle is less than 60 while the lssvm pso model should be employed when the work cycle is greater than 60 moreover the training sample size of lssvm pso should range from 60 to 110 for avoiding overfitting and computational expansion 5 6 application expansion as shown in fig 15 augs rely on ballast tank and moving mass to control the diving motion although feedforward and feedback control have been applied to many gliders allowing motion parameters velocity gliding angle and depth as inputs of the ecpm the control parameters mass of the ballast tank and position of the moving mass are more important in mission planning in other words an ecpm which can cover the kinematic model and dynamic model should be developed as shown by part i in fig 15 in order to extend the input of the ecpm another lssvm model hereinafter called dy lssvm model is established to replace the kinematic model and dynamic model as shown in fig 16 in order to verify the accuracy of the dy lssvm we have obtained 984 samples through simulation of kinematics model and dynamics model the samples are divided into training set 1 600 validation set 600 800 and test set 801 984 and the rbf kernel function is employed the structure of the dy lssvm model is similar to that shown in fig 2 and the performance evaluation indexes in 5 3 are used the results are shown in figs 17 and 18 and table 6 the results demonstrate that the dy lssvm model can accurately predict the motion parameters with the mass of the ballast and the position of the moving mass for those augs which take ballast tank and moving mass as direct control parameters the combined use of dy lssvm model and ecpm can realize the prediction of the energy consumption 6 conclusions this paper presents an lssvm pso model for predicting the energy consumption of autonomous underwater gliders four kernel functions including line polynomial rbf and sigmoid are employed to establish the lssvm model and the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm the sea trial data of a petrel ii glider are used to train and validate the lssvm pso model the results demonstrate that the energy consumption prediction performance of the lssvm pso model based on the rbf kernel function is superior to that of other kernel functions meanwhile this paper makes a comparison between the conventional mathematical ecpm and the lssvm pso model based on the rbf kernel function by using different training sample sizes the results show that the lssvm pso model has a higher prediction accuracy with a large enough training sample size the input of the lssvm pso model can be extended by using dy lssvm model this work will enhance the intelligence level of gliders author contribution yang song conceptualization formal analysis data curation writing

20754,currently most autonomous underwater gliders augs operate on primary lithium batteries as the state of charge of a primary lithium battery and the influence of marine environment on the glider are difficult to measure it is hard to forecast the energy consumption of a glider accurately which has caused the failure of many glider missions for the purpose of safely deploying the aug mission and effectively optimizing the motion parameters to increase the endurance it is very important to make an accurate energy consumption prediction model of the aug in this paper a novel model based on the least squares support vector machine lssvm and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm namely the lssvm pso model is proposed to forecast the energy consumption of the aug considering that the kernel function and the lssvm related parameters have a great influence on the performance of the prediction model several lssvm models based on different kernel functions for energy consumption prediction are established and the parameters are optimized by the pso algorithm the performance of lssvm pso models with different kernel functions are compared based on the sea trial data the results indicate that the lssvm pso model with a radial basis kernel function has a higher accuracy than other models for energy consumption prediction moreover the performance of the lssvm pso model trained by different sample sizes and that of the conventional mathematical energy consumption prediction model are compared the results demonstrate that the lssvm pso model is superior with a large enough training sample size keywords autonomous underwater gliders energy consumption prediction least squares support vector machines particle swarm optimization algorithm 1 introduction ocean observation is critical to many human activities including coastal protection fishing defense and security tourism and marine renewable energy utilization in recent years autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have been conceived for long term large scale ocean observations by marine scientists and engineers bi et al 2020 falcão carneiro and gomes de almeida 2018 however limited by the battery energy the conventional propeller driven auvs can only operate for a few hours mahmoudian et al 2007 as a special form of auvs autonomous underwater gliders augs which use a buoyancy engine combined with a set of fixed wings to move vertically and horizontally in a sawtooth like pattern through the water column are capable of extended duration deployments on the order of weeks to months or even close to a year claus et al 2012 ramos et al 2018 due to the low cost and high sustainability augs have been an integral part of the global ocean observing system goos liblik et al 2016 testor et al 2019 and the integrated marine observing system imos pattiaratchi et al 2017 etc to facilitate deployment and concealment augs are usually designed to be very compact with a length of less than 3 m and a weight of less than 100 kg resulting in limited battery supply therefore a current research focus is to reduce energy consumption and improve the voyage of augs under the constraints of limited energy namely to improve the energy efficiency moreover as the state of charge soc of primary lithium batteries used by most of the current gliders is difficult to directly and accurately estimate the battery power failures have been the second leading cause of glider mission failures smeed et al 2014 as a consequence accurately calculating the energy consumption of the glider and then making a trade off between the energy consumption and glider mission i e energy management are very important and challenging for operating the glider safely and efficiently at present it is a primary and effective method to solve the above problems by establishing and analyzing of an energy consumption prediction model ecpm in most studies the ecpm namely cost function in some literature is used as a heuristic function in various optimization algorithms and has played a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methods by integrating the ecpm into a simulation environment or an onboard controller the glider may automatically adjust its state to reduce energy cost and the operator can acquire the accurate soc in the last two decades several efforts have been made to forecast energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of augs by establishing ecpms based on an energy cost model inanc et al 2005 proved the important role of lagrangian coherent structures in the energy optimal path planning of underwater gliders considering the ocean currents as an extension to the results of inanc et al 2005 zhang et al 2008 established a 3d b spline models of the ocean current flows which are applied in nonlinear trajectory generation to find the energy optimal glider trajectories rao and williams 2009 used rapidly exploring random trees rrts with a heuristic energy cost function to determine energy optimal paths that account for the influence of ocean currents and terrain subramani et al 2014 presented a method to find an energy optimal path among time optimal paths based on stochastic dynamically orthogonal level set equations and a simple ecpm cao et al 2016a optimized the 3d trajectory with minimal energy consumption of augs by a modified dubins curve with genetic algorithm where a highly nonlinear and coupled ecpm was employed as the heuristic function using the same method and ecpm in cao et al 2016a cao et al 2016b found the rendezvous trajectories for multiple gliders with a minimal energy consumption over all participating vehicles lee et al 2017 implemented the fmt algorithm to address the problem of energy optimal path planning in the presence of flow fields for augs with complex dynamics an ecpm dependent on the internal non linear dynamics was presented and in particular the energy required to change the heading angle was taken into account yu et al 2013 established an applied mathematical ecpm by analyzing the dynamic model and workflow of the glider in the vertical plane to optimize the motion parameters of sea wing and extend the gliding range the model relating the gliding range to steady gliding motion parameters and energy consumption has been adopted in several studies sun et al 2016 2017 xue et al 2018 in xue et al 2018 the accuracy of the ecpm was verified to be 22 24 by three petrel ii gliders in sun et al 2016 the motion parameters of a blended wing body bwb glider were optimized to increase the gliding range in sun et al 2017 the shape of bwb glider was optimized to improve the hydrodynamic performance and achieve the maximum gliding range woithe et al 2010 deduced an energy cost model of slocum glider from sea trial data and integrated it into the simulation environment to efficiently plan the glider deployment based on woithe et al 2010 woithe and kremer 2015 presented a sensor control technique to observe energy savings by applying the published thermocline detection and tracking algorithms to an underwater glider yang et al 2019 obtain the optimized motion parameters of petrel l glider by combining an ecpm and the inner penalty function method ipfm and proposed a hidden gliding strategy model to save energy in song et al 2020 a complete ecpm of the glider was deduced based on the dynamic equations and the key parameters that affect the energy consumption of petrel ii glider were identified through the sobol sensitivity analysis method the accuracy of the model has been verified through the sea trial data which is 2 68 in the vertical plane and 7 18 in 3d space the above works have made remarkable contributions to improving the performance of gliders especially the endurance however the existing ecpms derived from the dynamic model have the following limitations i the random marine environmental factors acting on gliders such as the ocean current and biofouling which have a significant impact on energy consumption haldeman et al 2016 rao and williams 2009 are difficult to be included in the ecpm and ii different control algorithms in different gliders are difficult to be reflected in one ecpm these limitations have led to the low accuracy and non universality of the existing ecpms which may cause inefficient or even failed mission deployment of augs in light of the above problems we introduce artificial intelligence ai to predict the energy consumption with another purpose to improve the intelligence of the gliders ai has made a quantum leap in the last few years which has the capabilities of learning reasoning and decision making ai has seen remarkable advancements in the field of medicine chemical engineering etc chang 2020 mesbah et al 2014 2017 2019 2020 pan and zhang 2021 tandon and rajawat 2020 xu and guedes soares 2016 xu and soares 2019 as a subfield of ai machine learning algorithms linear regression support vector machine naive bayes etc are used to perform tasks by learning patterns from data in this paper the least squares support vector machine lssvm with different kernel functions are adopted to establish the ecpms and the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of lssvm the optimal kernel function is then obtained and the lssvm pso models trained by different sample sizes are compared with the mathematical ecpm in song et al 2020 through sea trial data the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the lssvm pso model is higher than other existing ecpms if there are enough training samples finally a combination of the lssvm pso model and conventional mathematical ecpm is recommended as the existing augs are capable of operating more than one thousand work cycles a work cycle consists of an ascent and a dive which can provide a large number of training samples we argue that the proposed lssvm pso model is more suitable to forecast the energy consumption than the math ecpm in addition as the lssvm pso model is determined only by the real operation data of the glider which includes the influence of marine environmental factors and control strategies it has better universality for various augs the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the basic principle of lssvm section 3 presents the overview of the pso algorithm in brief section 4 illustrates the novel intelligent ecpm based on lssvm pso in section 5 the performance of different models is compared and the results are discussed finally section 6 ends the paper by presenting the main conclusions drawn from this work 2 lssvm 2 1 basic principle of lssvm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 lssvm has a unique superiority in dealing with the small sample learning problem which has become a powerful tool for data regression lssvm has been improved in two ways over its predecessor svm firstly the inequality constraints in the svm are modified to equality constraints secondly instead of the slack variable lssvm adopts the training error square in the cost function as a result the original quadratic programming problem is transformed into solving a set of linear equations which thus improves the computation speed and accuracy significantly gu et al 2011 the lssvm has played an important role in several fields including data regression yarveicy et al 2014 pattern recognition adankon and cheriet 2009 time series prediction yuan et al 2015 etc fig 1 illustrates the structure diagram of lssvm for the given n training data pairs x i y i i 1 2 n where x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d t ℝ d d dimensional vector space is the input vector and y i r is the corresponding output value the input data can be mapped to a higher dimensional space from the original feature space ℝ d by adopting a nonlinear function ϕ x then the lssvm model can be constructed as follows 1 f x ω t ϕ x b where ω is weight vector and b is bias term based on the principle of structural risk minimization the estimation problem is formulated as the following optimization problem 2 min ω b e j ω e min 1 2 ω t ω 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 s t y i ω t ϕ x i b e i i 1 2 n γ 0 the 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 is the regularization function penalty term where γ is a nonnegative regularization parameter determining the trade off between precision and complexity of the model and e i represents the regression error between the actual and predicted values in lssvm the regularization function is a normal and effective method to limit overfitting more detailed information about the regularization can be seen in suvrit et al 2011 to solve the above optimization problem the corresponding lagrange function is employed to absorb the boundary conditions which can be expressed as 3 l ω b e α 1 2 ω t ω 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i ω t ϕ x i b e i y i where α i i 1 2 n are the lagrange multipliers partially differentiated with respect to ω b e i and α i the conditions for optimality solution of the problem can be obtained by setting all derivatives zero 4 l ω 0 ω i 1 n α i ϕ x i 5 l b 0 i 1 n α i 0 6 l e i 0 α γ e i 7 l α i 0 ω t ϕ x i b e i y i 0 by removing ω and e i the optimization process can be transformed into the linear equation below 8 0 e t e ω γ 1 e b α 0 y where y y 1 y n t e 1 1 t α α 1 α n t and ω is an n n symmetric matrix of kernel function in which 9 ω ij k x i x j ϕ x i t ϕ x j i j 1 2 n in eq 9 k x i x j is the kernel function satisfying the mercer s conditions the kernel function plays an important role in constructing high performance lssvm with the ability to reduce the computational complexity in high dimensional space then the lssvm model can be expressed as 10 y x i 1 n α i k x i x b 2 2 kernel functions and hyperparameters the performance of lssvm depends mostly on the combination of the kernel functions and hyperparameters which refer to the parameters in regularization item and kernel functions the selection of kernel functions and the optimization of parameters are described below 2 2 1 the selection of kernel functions the operating mechanism of kernel function is to map linearly inseparable samples into high dimensional space making the samples linearly separable as well as to avoid the curse of dimensionality the performance of lssvm varies greatly with different kernel functions many types of kernel function exist for selecting and we present some common forms as follows i line kernel 11 k x i x j x i x j t ii polynomial kernel 12 k x i x j x i x j t c m iii radial basis function rbf kernel 13 k x i x j exp x i x j 2 2 σ 2 iv sigmoid kernel 14 k x i x j tanh a x i x j t c as there is no prior experience in this paper the above four kernel functions available from existing literature and ls svmlab toolbox v1 8 de et al 2011 are employed to investigate the optimal lssvm model of energy consumption prediction 2 2 2 hyperparameter optimization the hyperparameters are the regularization parameter of lssvm and the parameters in the kernel functions in order to improve the performance of the lssvm model hyperparameter optimization is indispensable we express the optimization objective as follows 15 min e r r o r min 1 n k 1 n y k y ˆ k 2 where n is the number of samples used for optimization y k and y ˆ k are the actual value and predicted value respectively and error is the root mean square error between the actual value and predicted value considering that the pso algorithm has a higher convergence speed and occupies less memory than other heuristic search methods moayedi et al 2018 which is suitable for the onboard controller of the aug in this paper the pso algorithm is adopted to conduct the hyperparameter optimization the main principle of pso will be illustrated in the next section 3 basic principle of pso algorithm pso is a stochastic optimization algorithm proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on the simulation of the social behavior of birds within a flock and the swarm intelligence theory the swarm of particles in the pso algorithm cooperates and interacts to search for the best personal p best and the most appropriate global g best positions in the search space the velocity and position of all particles will be updated as follows 16 v new β v c 1 r 1 p best x c 2 r 2 g best x 17 x new x v new where x and v denote the present position and velocity of each particle respectively x new and v new designate the new position and velocity of each particle respectively β is inertia weight used to control the impact of the previous history of the velocity c 1 is the cognition learning factor c 2 is the social learning factor and r 1 and r 2 are two independent random numbers in the range of 0 1 more detailed information about the pso algorithm can be seen in wang et al 2017 4 ecpm based on lssvm pso in this section the lssvm and pso algorithm are combined to establish the novel ecpm of the underwater glider and hereinafter this ecpm is called the lssvm pso model for convenience the function of the lssvm pso model is to predict the energy consumption of a glider in a work cycle the output of the model is the energy consumption while the input may be various data including motion parameters control parameters etc once enough training samples are obtained the lssvm can be established to map the relationship between the input and output to improve the performance of the lssvm model different kernel functions are tried and the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm according to eq 15 namely the fitness function finally for arbitrary input parameters the prediction of energy consumption of a glider in a work cycle can be obtained the structure of the lssvm pso model is shown in fig 2 and the model is implemented as follows step 1 divide the data of the gliders into the training set validation set and test set among which the training set is used to train the lssvm model the validation set is used to calculate the fitness of the pso model and test set is a substitute for new input data to evaluate the performance of the lssvm pso model step 2 choose a kernel function herein four kernel functions in section 2 2 1 are selected to find the optimal one step 3 set the initial parameters of the lssvm and pso algorithm to establish the initial lssvm model using the training set and activate the fitness function as the optimization objective step 4 evaluate the fitness of each particle using the validation set and calculate the p best and g best positions step 5 update particle velocity and position according to eqs 16 and 17 to optimize the regularization parameter γ and the corresponding kernel parameters step 6 repeat steps 4 and 5 until the stopping criteria are reached step 7 establish the final lssvm model with the optimal parameters step 8 evaluate the performance of the lssvm pso model using the test set 5 results and discussion 5 1 data acquisition and preparation a petrel ii glider fig 3 developed by tianjin university liu et al 2017 is selected to verify the lssvm pso model the main specifications of the petrel ii glider are listed in table 1 a deployment was conducted with a petrel ii glider named hy06 from august 4 2017 to august 29 2017 as shown in fig 4 the glider made a round trip in the south china sea the reported number of work cycles is 195 and the corresponding motion parameters are shown in fig 5 in this study the velocity v gliding angle θ and diving depth h of the glider are taken as input data of the ecpm according to the fact that they have a more significant influence on the energy consumption and gliding range song et al 2020 and can be easily obtained from the onboard memory the corresponding output of the ecpm is the energy consumption of the glider in one work cycle the actual energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the voltage and current recorded in the onboard memory then integrating over the operation time we extracted the velocity gliding angle and diving depth of each work cycle of hy06 and calculated the corresponding energy consumption as samples then the samples were divided into training set 1 120 validation set 121 160 and test set 161 195 by 6 2 2 approximately so as to ensure that each dataset has enough data points and the prediction results are convergent and to avoid overfitting and expansion of computation 5 2 parameters initialization of the lssvm pso model the initial values of related parameters in lssvm pso model

1 i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 t y i y i 2 where t is the sample size of test set and y is the average of true values the mae mape and rmse measure the error between the predicted energy consumption and actual energy consumption the r2 lying in 0 1 is a statistical measure of the agreement between the regression predictions and the real data points the larger r2 is the closer the predicted result of the model is to the true value another index is v prediction time pt which represents the time it takes for an ecpm to return an accurate prediction it is a critical indicator since underwater glider mission planning is usually real time and ecpm often plays a key role in mission planning the smaller the pt the higher the prediction efficiency of the ecpm since pt includes two parts the pso algorithm and the lssvm model we divide pt into ptpso and ptlssvm the former represents the time taken by pso algorithm to return the optimal hyperparameters and the latter corresponds to the time taken by lssvm model to return the prediction of energy consumption in this paper we investigate pt with a computer and matlab software the computer is configured as inter r core tm i5 10400 f cpu 2 90 ghz 16 gb ram win10 operating system 64 bit 5 4 lssvm pso models with different kernel functions the kernel functions of eq 11 14 are used to establish corresponding lssvm pso models the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm and the optimal results are presented in table 2 the lssvm models are trained by the complete training set while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of each lssvm pso model the prediction results are shown in figs 6 and 7 the detailed indexes are shown in table 3 the above results demonstrate that the rbf kernel function leads to smaller error indexes mae mape and rmse and higher coefficients of determination in the lssvm pso model than other kernel functions indicating a higher consistency between the true energy consumption and the predicted energy consumption of the lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function compared with the operation time of a glider work cycle several hours pt is very short 1 min indicating that the lssvm pso model has the ability to return prediction in a timely manner moreover a large part of pt is consumed by the pso algorithm to find the optimal hyperparameters the lssvm model only needs very little time to return the prediction results in practice the hyperparameters may not need to be recalculated therefore it can be considered that the actual pt is equal to ptlssvm which further ensures the prediction efficiency of lssvm pso model 5 5 comparison of lssvm pso model and mathematical model after getting the optimal lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function in section 5 4 we compared the performance of this lssvm pso model and conventional mathematical ecpm hereinafter called math ecpm in this paper the math ecpm established in the study song et al 2020 is adopted as it has higher accuracy than other math ecpms the test set is used for this comparison and the results are shown in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 fig 8 shows that the predicted energy consumption of the lssvm pso model is closer to the true value than that of the math ecpm fig 9 shows a smaller error of the lssvm pso model the indexes in table 4 quantify the above results the mae mape and rmse of the lssvm pso model are 49 54 and 18 smaller than those of the math ecpm respectively while the r2 of the lssvm pso model is 5 higher than that of math ecpm the results of pt indicate that once the optimal hyperparameters are determined the prediction efficiency of the optimal lssvm pso model will be significantly improved to surpass that of the math ecpm since the training sample size is small which may cause overfitting mae mape rmse and r2 for training set 1 120 and validation set 121 160 are also calculated to check the possibility of overfitting the results are shown in fig 10 and table 5 in table 5 it is shown that the prediction accuracy of lssvm pso model in the training set is slightly superior to that in the validation set and the test set which is inevitable however the differences between the performance indexes in each dataset are not very large the differences of mae between the training set and the other two datasets are 903 kj and 547 5 kj respectively the differences of mape are 1 71 and 1 14 respectively the differences of rmse are 1820 2 kj and 1122 3 kj respectively the differences of r2 are 0 0467 and 0 0679 respectively according to the above results there is no obvious overfitting in the above the optimal lssvm pso model is trained by the complete training set with 120 data points the performance of the lssvm however is greatly affected by the training sample size moreover the increase of the training sample size will result in the expansion of computation therefore the key to making a trade off between the performance and the computation is to take appropriate training sample size to address this issue we trained the lssvm pso model with rbf kernel function by different training sets containing various sample sizes the performance of these lssvm pso models and that of the math ecpm are compared through the test set to check the possibility of overfitting the performance of the lssvm pso models for training set and validation set is also investigated the results are shown in figs 11 14 for math ecpm the performance indexes are constants indicating that the accuracy is independent of the training sample size figs 11 and 12 show that the accuracy of the lssvm pso model will quickly exceed that of math ecpm when the indexes are mae and mape the corresponding training sample sizes are 20 and 12 respectively figs 13 and 14 however present a slower process for the lssvm pso model to reach a higher accuracy than the math ecpm the training sample sizes for rsme and r2 are 57 and 56 respectively in addition the training sample size is 110 when the lssvm pso model converges to the optimal value it s worth noting that there will be a significant gap between the performance indexes in training set and those in validation set and test set with a very small training sample size indicating there is a risk of overfitting when the training sample size is greater than 60 the gap is obviously smaller and tends to be stable and the possibility of overfitting is greatly reduced according to the results we argue that to accurately predict the energy consumption of the glider the math ecpm is superior when the work cycle is less than 60 while the lssvm pso model should be employed when the work cycle is greater than 60 moreover the training sample size of lssvm pso should range from 60 to 110 for avoiding overfitting and computational expansion 5 6 application expansion as shown in fig 15 augs rely on ballast tank and moving mass to control the diving motion although feedforward and feedback control have been applied to many gliders allowing motion parameters velocity gliding angle and depth as inputs of the ecpm the control parameters mass of the ballast tank and position of the moving mass are more important in mission planning in other words an ecpm which can cover the kinematic model and dynamic model should be developed as shown by part i in fig 15 in order to extend the input of the ecpm another lssvm model hereinafter called dy lssvm model is established to replace the kinematic model and dynamic model as shown in fig 16 in order to verify the accuracy of the dy lssvm we have obtained 984 samples through simulation of kinematics model and dynamics model the samples are divided into training set 1 600 validation set 600 800 and test set 801 984 and the rbf kernel function is employed the structure of the dy lssvm model is similar to that shown in fig 2 and the performance evaluation indexes in 5 3 are used the results are shown in figs 17 and 18 and table 6 the results demonstrate that the dy lssvm model can accurately predict the motion parameters with the mass of the ballast and the position of the moving mass for those augs which take ballast tank and moving mass as direct control parameters the combined use of dy lssvm model and ecpm can realize the prediction of the energy consumption 6 conclusions this paper presents an lssvm pso model for predicting the energy consumption of autonomous underwater gliders four kernel functions including line polynomial rbf and sigmoid are employed to establish the lssvm model and the hyperparameters are optimized by the pso algorithm the sea trial data of a petrel ii glider are used to train and validate the lssvm pso model the results demonstrate that the energy consumption prediction performance of the lssvm pso model based on the rbf kernel function is superior to that of other kernel functions meanwhile this paper makes a comparison between the conventional mathematical ecpm and the lssvm pso model based on the rbf kernel function by using different training sample sizes the results show that the lssvm pso model has a higher prediction accuracy with a large enough training sample size the input of the lssvm pso model can be extended by using dy lssvm model this work will enhance the intelligence level of gliders author contribution yang song conceptualization formal analysis data curation writing
