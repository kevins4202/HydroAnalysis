5870,in water pollution control of urban river basins one major issue is to reduce water pollutants at the least costs in this research an integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method was proposed to help optimize mitigation measures on water quality rehabilitation in shiwuli river basin of hefei city china initially multi response surface method mrsm with two levels and two responses i e cost effectiveness ratio cer and water quality standard reaching rate wqsr were designed where the factors of interests include the point source reducing rate i e factor a the non point source reducing rate i e factor b and water transfer i e factor c then a hydrodynamic water quality model was developed to predict water quality effects of the proposed combined factors at the same time the cost functions were established to estimate economic costs of the combined factors lastly the analysis of variance anova and multiple regression analysis mra were employed to help gain some new cognition in the statistically significant way the obtained model revealed that factor a and b were significant for both cer and wqsr this means that in the study area pollution source reduction is more important than water transfer though the optimal minimal cer was obtainable with 0 1493 m per percentage when the pointing source reducing rate is 77 9 the non point source reducing rate is 40 and the water transfer was controlled at a low level respectively with water quality standard reaching rate 70 7 it fails to achieve water quality objectives wqsr 90 0 moreover in order to meet water quality target simultaneous optimization of two objective functions minimal cer and maximal wqsr was achievable with the optimum value of 90 for wqsr and 0 1810 m per percentage for cer respectively with the pointing source reducing rate 90 0 the non point source reducing rate 57 2 and the water transfer at a low level it provided an alternative simulation optimization method for decision of water pollution control which had the advantages in reflecting the real water environment system and simplifying the algorithm compared to the conventional mathematical programming at the watershed scale keywords response surface method cost effectiveness analysis shiwuli river water quality pollution control 1 introduction urban rivers are vulnerable to water pollution due to their comparatively low self purification capacities and potentially high pollution loadings consequently water pollution in urban rivers is becoming a major environmental problem in many countries around the world lange et al 2015 saraswat et al 2017 previously a number of technologies and methods were used for alleviating water pollution a major disadvantage associated with such technologies and methods is the comparatively high costs which have posed a great pressure for city managers especially in developing countries gunawardena et al 2018 estimation and evaluation of costs and effectiveness of these technologies is preliminarily necessary it is thus important to explore fate and transport of water pollutants and assess the associated economic implications however due to the inherent complexities associated with these processes significant challenges are arising for local decision makers in figuring out relevant strategies and policies with maximum benefits and or minimal costs it is desired that effective tools be developed for helping evaluate pollution effects and identify suitable strategies policies to improve water quality with the least costs at the watershed scale over the past decades cost effectiveness analysis cea was widely used to evaluate economic aspects of strategic measures in catchment management cai et al 2011 gachango et al 2015 grieken et al 2013 diffusing nutrient reduction mewes 2012 water safety planning lindhe et al 2011 irrigation water allocation panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 stormwater management wang et al 2016 and ecosystem management boerema et al 2018 rong et al 2015 among these studies the minimal cost effectiveness ratio cer was a frequently used factor boerema et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 the main limitation of cea approaches lies in its low capability in predicting potential environmental quality changes girard et al 2015 such a deficiency can be remedied through integrating simulation models into a general cea based framework in which the impact of pressures can be analyzed at certain spatial and temporal scales balana et al 2011 2015 lescot et al 2013 gimeno et al 2018 for example a lot of scholars focused on integrating hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models into cea for supporting water quality restorations cai et al 2009 holguin gonzalez et al 2013 lee et al 2017 xue et al 2015 zhai et al 2017 in addition whitehead et al 2013 used a catchment scale model to simulate the status of phosphorus in thames river catchment of southern england and assessed cost effectiveness among a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies similarly mtibaa et al 2017 applied soil water assessment tool swat model based cea to evaluate cost effectiveness of multiple best management practices bmp in reducing sediment yields in the joumie watershed of northern tunisia a problem of cea is that it can hardly provide direct decision support for helping identify the best combinations of multiple mitigation measures if with infinite alternatives to obtain direct decision schemes through global or near global optimization an integrated framework of optimization based cea has been advanced vinten et al 2017 nainggolan et al 2018 geng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 such as hydro economic optimization models which could help generate decisions for balancing environmental effects and economic costs in river catchments through compromising analysis of hydrological engineering environmental and economic issues heinz et al 2007 brouwer and hofkes 2008 davidsen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 momblanch et al 2016 gunawardena et al 2018 mirchi et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 liu et al 2019a b kuriqi et al 2019 however it is difficult to accurately reflect inherent features of a real world hydro economic system through establishing optimization models for dealing with the intrinsic multiple components nonlinearity and complexities at certain scales due to algorithm complexity and long computation requirements in model solving processes zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 in order to overcome these defects a number of simulating models were integrated into optimization based cea were proposed in helping control non point sources nps panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 dai et al 2017 schuwirth et al 2018 kuriqi 2014 kuriqi et al 2016 and managing storm water runoff within a watershed dong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 alamdari and sample 2019 though the developed approach may be effective in identifying global optimum solution the linkage between simulation and optimization modeling is normally complicated especially when both are complex comparatively the response surface methodology rsm is a technique mainly for designing experiments developing models identifying optimal conditions for desirable responses and evaluate interaction of factors that may influence treatment efficiency through a reduced number of experiments ahmad et al 2007 bezerra et al 2008 sadeghifam et al 2015 galankashi et al 2016 karimifard and moghaddam 2018 it has also been proposed for designing multiple types of computational experiments li et al 2018 and solving optimization models tan et al 2015 yue et al 2014 as a process optimization tool it could provide an alternative method for replacing the original optimization models generally rsm could have advantages in a providing clear insights upon general effects of parameters and their interactions on the outputs in a statistic significance which is not easily revealed through many other methods rivera and sutherland 2015 b reducing the number of simulations or optimizations leading to significant time and cost savings scotti et al 2000 heijungs and lenzen 2014 and c deriving low order polynomial models which can serve as approximations of the true model khang et al 2017 it is very popular in experimental methods its applications in water management and decisions are limited few studies focused on analyzing uncertainties in parameters for hydrological groundwater simulation and basin simulation models wu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 tavakoli et al 2014 though rsm aided methods have proven the advantages in parameter analysis none of them could help address water quality management issues in river basins evaluate contributions of mitigation measures and identify desired schemes it is possible to achieve desired schemes for improving water quality in an urban river basin through combining cea with water quality simulation model based on rsm also it is expected to identify the main factors that are affecting system performances through analyzing the main effects of factors and interactions therefore the objective of this research is to develop an integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method ihwqs mrsm to analyze the main effects and interactions of factors in water quality mitigation measures it will then be used for identifying the optimal combination measures to improve urban river water quality at a minimum cost effectiveness ratio which is an indicator of balancing economic cost and water quality goals in detail cea will be used to evaluate the integrated environmental and economic effects of pollution reducing measures a one dimensional river hydrodynamic water quality model will be employed to forecast effects of mitigation measures on water quality the mrsm will be adopted to optimize mitigation measures and analyze main effects and interactions of the identified factors the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the first section shiwuli river basin in hefei city anhui province of china will be introduced as the case studied area then a frame of ihwqs mrsm will be developed in which methods of generic step by step operations pollution and remediation analysis water quality simulation cost estimation and optimization by mrsm will be combined in section 3 results of the developed models will be presented and discussed following the main findings and policy applications a series of conclusions will be presented then 2 overview of the shiwuli river basin the shiwuli river basin is located in the southwest suburb of hefei city the capital of anhui province southeast china fig 1 it is a small river with low water flow and velocity no obvious phenomenon of stratification is observed it flows from northwest to southeast and later entering into chao lake i e one of the country s top five freshwater lakes the basin area is 106 6 km2 including 12 4 km2 of agricultural area the population in the basin is 0 6 million in 2015 as one of the three major nutrient load contributors of chao lake water quality of the shiwuli river has drawn much attention and its water quality improvement has become a national goal chen et al 2018 the subtropical monsoon climate brings an average annual rainfall of approximately 1 000 mm into this area with annual average water surface evaporation of 835 mm and the water level in the shiwuli river varies considerably during the wet i e june to september normal i e march to may and october to november and dry i e december to february of the next year seasons zong et al 2014 the main stream beginning from swan lake dam and ending at chao lake entrance is approximately 22 9 km with an average gradient 0 5 its average flow in 2015 was 1 19 m3 s urban runoff accounted for 59 of the runoff waste water from sewage treatment plants stp and domestic sewage accounted for the remaining 41 due to interception of upstream impoundment reservoir swan lake reservoir there is almost no upstream inflow the previous studies show at least 1 77 m3 s of water is needed to satisfy the minimum water demands by local ecosystems therefore the current water flow seldom satisfies that infers extremely small ability in purifying pollutants therefore lack of clean water replenishment is identified as an important cause of water quality deterioration the water function of shiwuli river is defined as urban landscape water use with water quality goal of class v in the surface water quality standards gb3838 2002 regulated by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china according to the weekly water quality data provided by the local environmental protection bureau in 2015 the average concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp totally exceed the class v standard which means the necessity of improving water qualities according to local government the improving targets of nh3 n and tp will be reaching the class v in the near future i e 2020 comparatively there is no target for alleviating tn concentration to reach class v therefore nh3 n and tp are identified as controlling indicators of water quality improvement pollution loads are estimated according to the three categories including point non point and endogenous sources point sources include urban domestic sewage and stp discharge rural domestic sewage centralized livestock wastewater agricultural runoff storm runoff and aquaculture wastewater constitute of non point sources in the research sediment release is regarded as endogenous source statistical results of annual pollution load 2015 are present in table 1 accord to proportions of pollution loads from multiple sources the other sources except point source and storm runoff are neglected due to its very small proportion e g less than 5 among the pollution sources point sources are the top source accounting for 80 8 of nh3 n and 66 5 of tp respectively at present one stp with design capacity 100 000 tons day has been built to treat domestic sewage from entire basin the remove rates of target pollutants are designed as about 40 50 due to this low remove rate water qualities of stp discharges into river are far worse than class v standard therefore the stp discharges with a large amount and poor water quality have been regarded as a main point source besides the amount of currently municipal sewage would exceed the design capacity of stp which has been predicted about 260 000 tons day in 2020 moreover drainage in some areas is still combined sewer and not connected to stp in which mixed rainwater and sewage are discharged directly into the river therefore these deficiencies means upgrading sewage pipe network expanding capacity of stp and improving pollutant remove rate are necessary at the same time urban storm runoff is another main pollutant source especially the initial rainwater but no relevant mitigation measures are currently implemented in studied basin for this type of pollution low impact development best management practices lid bmps are common strategies for reducing storm water pollution loads eckart et al 2017 from the above analysis insufficient sewage treatment capacity with low remove rate highly polluted urban storm runoff together with no stable clean water replenishment are the main causes of water quality degeneration in the study area table 2 accordingly the corresponding mitigation measures that this research concerns include i perfecting drainage network expanding stp and improving removing rate of pollutants ii implementing lid bmps and iii augmenting river flow by water transfer from chao lake 3 integrated modeling of hydrodynamics water quality and economic implication a framework of the integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method ihwqs mrsm is developed for rehabilitation of water quality in shiwuli river basin as shown in fig 2 in this research daily values of water quality indicators were employed for the management objection since the detailed procedure of cea have been fully discussed boerema et al 2018 these were combined with hydrodynamic water quality model and mrsm to develop a framework of integrated modelling methodology briefly the steps are as follows 1 assessment of current water quality e g identify water quality index that is exceeding the corresponding environmental quality standards determination of water quality improving targets identification of major pollution sources e g sewage effluent domestic sewage storm runoff industrial wastewater and agricultural activities and identification of mitigation measures the measures are chosen based on features of pollution sources and available pollution treatment technologies 2 extract of the factors from the chosen measures and determination of levels according to features of the studied area and the relevant literatures 3 design of simulating experiments through using mrsm 4 cost estimation of combinational mitigation measures this involves the assessment of the investment costs and operation and management costs of mitigation measures as well considering time values of money 5 development of a one dimension hydrodynamic water quality model of river basin and prediction of water quality performance of mitigation measures and 6 optimization of mitigation measures under two targets minimal cost effective rates and water quality standard reaching rates and analysis of main effects and interactions of factors this involves application of analysis of variance anova multivariate regression analysis mra and multiple criteria optimization mco to determine optimal schemes for reaching water targets at the least cost 3 1 multi response surface methodology mrsm 3 1 1 identification of responding indicators in this research cea is employed as a tool to assess and rank alternative measures on the basis of their costs and effectiveness for achieving certain environmental objectives the assessment criterion of applying cea is known as a cost effectiveness ratio cer which is a monetary cost of physical effects non monetary the physical effect refers to the water quality improving effects therefore the water quality standard reaching rate wqsr of water environment function zone is adopted as an indicator which can be calculated as a frequency of days when water quality standard are satisfied within a year the average wqsr of nh3 n and tp are chosen to evaluate the water quality improving effect as for monetary cost the present value pv of total costs over the economic life of adopted mitigation measures is employed as an estimation of annual costs of those measures after considering discount rate then cost effectiveness ratio cer can be calculated as follows 1 c e r c pv 1 2 i 1 2 w q s r i where c pv is the present value of total costs million i denotes the index of water quality variables i 1 and 2 i 1 for nh3 n and i 2 for tp w q s r i denotes the value of wqsr for i th water quality variable that can be estimated as follows 2 wqsr i sd i 365 100 where sd i is the number of standard reaching days for the i th water quality variable as one of the response indicators the smaller value is cer the better of system performance however the best cer alternative may over or under reach water quality target values therefore the cer should not be used as the single criterion for evaluating alternatives to consider both the cost effective and water quality target in a sensible way average wqsr of nh3 n and tp are employed as another response indicator the simulation results can be interpreted with these two response indicators therefore design and analysis of mrsm will be performed in this research 3 1 2 determination of key factors and the associated levels from mitigation measures in table 2 three factors including the point source reducing rate factor a the non point source reducing rate factor b and water transfer factor c with two levels each can be extracted as system inputs for factor a the current removal rate of wtp is regarded as a low level and the average removal rate of the recommended best phosphorus and nitrogen removal processes is defined as high level li et al 2008 therefore 50 and 90 reducing rate are set as low and a high levels respectively as shown in table 2 because the non point source mainly comes from storm water the pollutant removing performance of single or aggregate lid bmps can be used to set up the levels of factor b according to literatures eckart et al 2017 mao et al 2017 there are at the least 40 and at the most 80 reducing rate for both nh3 n and tp accordingly 80 and 40 are set as high and low levels of factor b respectively for factor c 0 58 m3 s of water transfer from chao lake is set as the low level which is hoped to satisfy minimum ecological water demand and 1 74 m3 s of water transfer set as high level for increasing the ability of diluting pollutants during design of mrsm a real value of factor levels is expressed as a code value the following equation can be applied to transform a real value z i into a coded value x i bezerra et al 2008 3 x i z i z i 0 δ z i β d where δ z i is the distance between the real value of central point and factor level β d is the coded limit value in the matrix for each variable β d 1 in this research and z i 0 is the real value in the central point 3 1 3 arranging simulations through an orthogonal array because axis points should not exceed cubic points in this study the central composite face centered design ccf of mrsm was used for optimization of mitigation measures in urban river water quality improving through using minitab 17 as a symmetrical second order experimental design three factors with two levels ccf can be used for supporting the design including two stages and totally 16 simulation runs i first stage a full factorial design with 2 central point runs namely 23 points of factorial design and 2 central points together 10 trials this stage usually serves in finding near optimal interval of level by judging whether the model has curvature but in this paper the initial level setting interval already contains all cases it changes to judge whether to use linear regression or non linear regression to fit the functional relationship between factors and response variable rather than finding near optimal interval ii second stage an additional design namely 2 3 axial points with 6 trials in second stage optimum operating conditions on the control variables were determinated by using the second order regression model the detail arrangements of simulations are present at table 3 in this table the two replicates of the central point are used to estimate pure random errors the same value of two replicates means that pure random error is zero because the same inputs get the same outputs in simulating circumstance 3 2 economic costs of pollution mitigation measures according to table 3 there are 16 scenarios in total and indicators of cer and wqsr for each scenario need to be calculated firstly costs of each scenario should be calculated in order to calculate cer three general categories of costs have been considered in the implementation of mitigation measures including the establishment costs annual operational and maintenance o m costs and the relevant opportunity costs gachango et al 2015 in china the relevant opportunity is economic values of the occupied land for production although the total costs could be accurately calculated by item by item method such as the costs of design labor and equipment financing and maintenance the cost functions are employed to estimate these costs 3 2 1 cost estimation for sewage treatment plants stp as for establishment costs of stp jiang et al 2018 used an exponential function to fit the data of sizable samples from china the annual establishment cost function can be presented as follows 4 i n v 0 0736 e x p 2 647 0 782 d u m m y e s s q 0 484 e 3 104 where i n v is the annual capital investment cost of wastewater treatment plant million year q is the designed capacity of the plant m3 day e is pollutant removal efficiency expressed in percentage d u m m y e s s is a dummy variable i e d u m m y e s s 1 if 0 9 e 1 and if 0 i n v 20 m i l l i o n otherwise d u m m y e s s 0 all economic values in this paper are expressed in 2006 us level 1 rmb 0 1281 capital recovery factor crf is calculated as 0 0736 with a discount rate of 4 and lifetime of 20 years annual o m cost function can be presented as follows jiang et al 2018 5 v c e x p 0 119 0 907 d u m m y e s s q 0 413 e 2 575 where d u m m y e s s is a dummy variable d u m m y e s s 1 if 0 9 e 1 and if 0 i n v 1 m i l l i o n otherwise d u m m y e s s 0 3 2 2 cost estimation for low impact development best management practices lid bmps the use of lid bmps can be an effective control strategy to mitigate the negative impact of urban runoff jia et al 2015 various types of lid bmps such as grass swales permeable pavements bioretention cell wetland can be applied to reduce peak runoff and improving water quality of urban runoff eckart et al 2017 an exponential function with independent variable drainage area and dependent variable costs per drainage area is employed to fit the sample data from mao et al 2017 the fitting plot is present in fig 3 the determination coefficient is 0 9978 which means the model is accurate enough to predict the establishment cost function for lid bmps per area is written as 6 painv nps 0 4254 e x p 0 0334 e painv nps is the annual capital investment cost of lid bmps million year when considering of discount rate and total designed areas the annual investment cost is expressed as 7 inv nps 0 0736 0 4254 e x p 0 0334 e s where inv nps is annual capital investment cost of lid bmps million year s is designed areas of lid bmps km2 as well the annual o m cost for lid bmps is estimated 5 construction costs usepa 1999 3 2 3 cost estimation for water transfer the establishment costs of water transfer include costs of pipeline pumping house equipment and construction etc its value depends on amount of water transfer and length of pipeline which are estimated by power function zhang 1997 after considering of capital recovery factor crf annul costs of water transfer pipeline construction are express as 8 inv wd 0 0736 0 0863 q 0 656 l where inv wd is annul establishment costs of water transfer million q water discharges 104m3 day l is length of pipeline km o m costs briefly refer to operation cost of water pump depreciation of fixed assets and maintenance fees etc the exponential function is used to estimate the costs zhang 1997 9 vc wd 0 469 e x p 0 073 q where vc wd is annual o m cost million 3 3 hydrodynamic and water quality modeling as mentioned earlier in order to calculate the two response indicators it is necessary to simulate and predict the water quality restoration effect after each scenario is implemented this part of the work is done by the water quality model of shiwuli river 3 3 1 hydrodynamic and water quality simulation modeling a one dimension hydrodynamic water quality model based on mike11 software platform is employed in this paper model equations were descripted in feng et al 2016 and ardiclioglu and kuriqi 2019 and parameters setting had been detailed present in mike11 reference user manual 2005 the simulated length of shiwuli river system is 22 64 km beginning from upstream boundary swan lake to the downstream boundary entrance of chao lake eighty measured terrain data of river section are used to describe the underwater topography the main tributaries are xuxiao and weixi river which have been simplified as point sources in the model three automatic hydrologic stations at river chainage of 2 14 12 50 and 18 80 km respectively are labeled as 1 2 3 shown in fig 1 the daily time series flow data of 2015 at 1 hydrological station are set as upstream hd inflow boundary and daily time series water lever data of same periods at 3 automatic hydrological station are set as downstream hd water level boundary five weirs located at the upstream chainage 0 69 2 62 2 84 3 36 and 4 90 km respectively are set up as hydraulic structure the target water quality indicators nh3 n and tp are set up as state variables their concentrations in ad boundary and initial condition are both set up as class ii surface water quality standard nh3 n 1 mg l tp 0 2 mg l gb3838 2002 pollution sources are set up by categorized as point and distribution source in model boundary conditions as for hydrodynamic and water quality parameters such as manning coefficient diffusion coefficient and degradation coefficient are firstly set by expert experiences and then achieve optimal values by trial and error method during model calibrations 3 3 2 calibration and validation optimal parameters are achieved by model calibration when simulated values are very close to observed values after calibration another period time series observed data are needed to validate the model to test the transfer ability of optimal parameters an evaluation index is required to quantitative assess model performance percent bias pbias is used to evaluate model performance which is calculated with equation 10 pbias i 1 n y o i y s i 100 i 1 n y o i where y s i is simulated value at time i y o i observed value at time i the low magnitude value of pbias indicates accurate model simulation with optimal value is zero while positive values indicate underestimation bias and negative values overestimation bias according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the model is satisfactory if value of pbias is less than 25 for river flow and 70 for water qualities the automatic hydrologic stations labeled 2 is select as calibration and verification station for hydrology daily water flow and water level observed data from jan 1 2015 to jun 30 2015 are used to calibrate hydrodynamic parameters and those from jul 1 to dec 31 are used to validate for no enough stations in studied basin the calibration and validation results are present at fig 4 a and b pbias of water flow and water level during calibration and validation are all less than 25 which are desirable and can be used to predict similarly an automatic water quality monitor station at river chainage 19 89 km labeled as 1 shown in fig 1 is selected as calibration and verification station for water quality the weekly nh3 n and tp observed data from jan 1 2015 to jun 30 2015 are used to calibrate and that from jul 1 to dec 31 are used to validate the results are present at fig 5 a and b with all pbias are less than 70 which indicate that the simulated water quality data reasonably agree with the observed one and the parameters of model are reasonable 3 4 statistic analysis after combinations of different factor and level are arranged by mrsm the effects of combinations are simulated by hydrodynamic water quality model and the costs estimated by cost functions response indicators of cer and wqsr of each combination will be achieved as present in table 3 then anova and mra are used to distinguish significant factors and to estimate the parameters of multiple regression models the two responses cer and wqsr are optimized by using multi response optimizer tool in minitab this methodology initially constructs a desirability function for each individual response which each response is transformed into a dimensionless scale then the overall desirability function is defined as the weighted geometric average of the individual desirability with these operations the original multi response optimization is thus changed to optimize a single overall desirability function that can be solved by gradient descent algorithm with multiple starting points the detail information about desirability function can be seen from bezerra et al 2008 4 results 4 1 results of the first stage of multi response surface methodology multi response surface methodology mrsm is designed under two stages the main purpose of first stage is to judge whether to use linear regression or non linear regression to fit the functional relationship between factors and response variable by judging whether the model has curvature if the model has curvature further precise estimating parameters of a second order regression model will be performed in the second stage if not parameters of linear regression model after removing insignificant model term will be estimated in first stage the anova table for response of wqsr in first stage simulations is depicted in table 4 in table 4 if the p value of model term is less than 0 05 it indicates the model term is significant with desirable and considerably affecting wqsr therefore significates of model and linear term would reveal the linear relationship between wqsr and factors the main effect of point source reducing rate factor a and non point source reducing rate factor b are significant model terms other model terms can be expressed to be not significant these insignificant model terms can be removed and may result in an improved model the anova table for response of cer is depicted in table 5 in the same manner no significant of model and linear terms mean that linear model is inadequate when a nonlinear relationship between factors and cer exists thus further simulations should be added to the first stage design for generating a second order regression model in order to justify the possible curvature six axial points on the center of factors edge were augmented the simulations designed for augmentation and the related results are tabulated in table 3 4 2 results of the second stage of multi response surface methodology after six added simulations in second stages are finished all the data onto first and second stages are combined as a whole and anova is tested again the cer results after insignificant terms reduction are presented in table 6 here the tiny p value for the model indicates that the model is significant after adding the second order effect the decreasing for the standard deviation of model error and increasing for adj r2 indicate an improved model after insignificant terms reduction an r square value of 99 09 indicates that the model is able to explain about 99 09 of the variation on the response the adj r2 and predicted r2 are in reasonable agreement with each other means no over fit according to the anova results it can be concluded that the quadratic regression equation is suitable for fit the functional relationship between cer and factors of mitigation measures for the studied basin the same procedure is applied to the response of wqsr the anova table results after model reduction are depicted in table 7 here the p value 0 05 reveals that the main effects of the point and non point source reducing rates have significant effects on wqsr here the p value of 0 000 for the model indicates that the linear model is significant which is desirable the adj r2 value of 96 85 indicates that the model is able to explain about 96 85 of the variation on the wqsr the predicted r2 is 95 86 in reasonable agreement with adj r2 according to the anova results it can be concluded that this model can be used to predict wqsr within design space 4 2 1 optimal condition for pollution mitigation measures the non linear regression equation for cer is determined based on the significant factors present in table 6 and is presented in terms of actual values as follows 11 c e r 0 4472 0 00630 a 0 00310 b 0 000047 a 2 0 000072 b 2 0 000027 a b the linear regression equation for wqsr in terms of actual level value is written as 12 w q s r 18 17 0 8940 a 0 4820 b the normal probability plot of the residual for the empirical model of cer is present in fig 6 a it is desirable that the residual is generally fall on a straight line which implies that the residual error is distributed normally moreover the residual versus fitted value plot is depicted in fig 6 b it means that quadratic regression model eq 11 is correct and credible for the residuals of model are randomly scattered and no obvious pattern as some manner the normal probability plot and residual versus fitted value for wqsr are shown in fig 7 a and b it is obvious that the patterns of residual error in both responses are normal and random which are desirable it can be concluded that eqs 11 and 12 are reasonable and adequate with no need for any further test fig 8 a illustrates the contour plot for cer response surface at the center level of water transfer no significant the curvilinear is visible in the plot which is in accordance with the obtained quadratic model the contour plot reveals that the best response surface is obtainable at a high level of point source reduce rate about 80 and at a low level of non point source reduce rate about 40 fig 8 b depicts the counter plot for response surface of wqsr the slant line shaped contour is visible which justifies the obtained linear model the plot shows that the best response surface of wqsr is obtainable at a high level of the point source reducing rate about 90 and at a high level of the non point source reduce rate about 70 the different optimal decision space means conflict for simultaneously achieving optimal points for both responses the overlying contour plot for wqsr and cer can be developed to optimize multi response by overlapping the contour of both responses as present in fig 9 the good outcomes of cer can be defined as an interval 0 15 0 20 that of wqsr can be defined as 90 100 respectively the overlaying plot with the unshaded area means both optimized response surfaces have a part of same decision space that simultaneously good for both responses theoretically each point within overlay can be selected as the optimal result after balancing water quality improving and cost effectiveness ratio in this case the desirable optimal results within wqsr 90 and cer 0 2 are those schemes with about 85 90 of point source reducing rate about 60 of non point source reducing rate and low level of water transfer 0 58 m3 s respectively since water transfer is a no significant factor more precise optimization of multi response is based on response optimizer of minitab which is present in fig 10 a the setup of optimizing cer in response optimizer is a minimized goal with lower boundary 0 14 upper boundary 0 20 and goal importance 1 that of wqsr in response optimizer is a targeted goal with lower boundary 85 target 90 and upper boundary 100 and goal importance 5 where wqsr with greater weight means it is preferentially satisfied than cer the optimum value of 90 for wqsr and 0 1808 for cer is obtainable when the factor level 90 point source reducing rate 57 2 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer respectively at this solution individual desirability d for cer and wqsr is 0 37921 and 1 0000 respectively as well composite desirability is 0 8508 if without considering water quality target response optimization of cer is present in fig 10 b it shows that the optimum value of 0 1493 for cer is obtainable when the factors 77 9 point source reduce rate 40 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer respectively 4 2 2 the main effects and interaction of the factors the factorial main effect for wqsr is present as fig 11 a it is visible that factorial main effects are a b c that can be judged by the mean value difference of wqsr between two levels it infers the greatest influence on the wqsr value is point source reducing rate then non point source reducing rate and lastly water transfer this is consistent with the results of the previous anova which the effect of factor c is not significant table 7 as to nonsignificant factor the optimal level can be freely chosen generally considering other criteria such as saving time cost and labor etc in significant factors both effects of the point source reducing rate and non point source reducing rate on cer rise from low level to high level in a linear way but the former has a steeper slope it infers that factor a is better in water quality improving effect than factor b the interactional plots for wqsr are present as fig 11 b it is visible that none interactional effect is significant the factorial main effect on cer is present as fig 12 a in the same manner it is visible that factorial main effects are b a c which means the greatest influence on the cer value is the non point source reducing rate then point source reducing rate and lastly water transfer this is consistent with the results of the previous variance analysis table 6 which the effect of factor c is not significant in significant factors effects of point source reducing rate on cer decline from a low level to high level in a non linear way but that of non point source reducing rate is opposite which means a low level is better for minimizing cer it infers that factor a is better than factor b in terms of minimizing the cer the interactional plots for cer are present as fig 12 b it is visible that only interactional effect of a b is significant and declining when levels of a and b increased this infers factor b is also essential although individual b has the opposite effect to minimize cer 5 discussions 5 1 balancing economy and environment the advantage of simulation based mrsm lies in providing a tool for simulation and optimization for environmental economic system simultaneously though it is an optimization of quadratic approximation therefore it contributes to providing a dynamic and distributed simulation environment for a real water environment system allowing decision makers to understand optimize and innovate the system operation to achieve system goals with minimal cost time and labor in addition main effects interactions quadratic effects of impact factors are analyzed and thus helpful in identifying the key variables and their influences on the system withstatisticalsignificance moreover mrsm provides a multi criterion optimization methodology based on desirability function which is a simple algorithm in terms of watershed scale optimization in doe of minitab error includes pure error and lack of fit error which corresponds to usually random error and systematic error respectively in the same manner simulation based doe also includes these two types of error the one is systematic error that comes from imperfections of the model and approach parameters of personal estimation such as parameters in the hydrodynamic water quality model parameters in cost estimated etc the other is random error that comes from uncontrollable or unknown confounding factors and can be reduced by repetitions such as measuring error instability of environmental conditions the small differences between analysts and the instability of instruments etc the random error of the experiment is observed differences between replicates but not available in the simulation environment because all replicates produce same response value during simulation hence a key issue in simulation based doe is how to define the random error which is important in testing the significances of the effects fit of model and curvature since all observed data used in the model are time series based on average values of replicates the random error of measure is assumed to be eliminated therefore in simulating circumstance the random error is defined as zero which is the main different distinguished from experiment based doe in such circumstance tests of lack of fit and curvature are disabled which may be a trouble in the judgment when the second stage simulations will be performed at this time the alternative way used in this paper is to judge whether the test of model term and linear term are significant in fist stage if yes the regression equation used in second stage is linear function if not the regression equation is quadratic function 5 2 limitation of application of cost effectiveness analysis though a cea provides useful information for deciding best mitigation alternative by combing the effect and cost it should be careful to interpret the result according to specific objective of the specific river basin when the other targets besides minimum cer need to be considered inconsistency and conflict between targets may occur such as minimizing cer and water quality standard reaching rate which illustrated by case studied in such a situation it is required to use multi objective or multi criterion analysis to coordinate and balance conflicting goals such as minimal cer and maximum water quality target therefore the mrsm algorithm essentially a multi criterion programming is employed to balance water quality target and cer target 5 3 policy implications in order to reach the target of 90 water quality standard reaching rate with minimal cer 90 0 point source reducing rate 57 2 non point source reducing rate 0 58 m3 s water transfer from chao lake are required it infers sewage treatment plant of shiwuli river not only needs to be expanded the capacity of treatment but also be upgraded by the treatment process and be significantly improved the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal a variety of lid bmp measures need to be jointly used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in urban runoff though water transfer has no significant effect on both cer and wqsr low level of water transfer to satisfy minimum ecological water demand is beneficial for river social and ecological system these optimal results suggest priority should be given to reducing pollution sources rather than water transfer especially reducing municipal sewage and initial urban runoff pollution if considering cer alone 77 9 point source reducing rate 40 0 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer from chao lake get minimal cer 0 1493 m per percentage with water quality standard reaching rate 70 7 the cer firstly decreases and then increases when point source reducing rate increase from low level to high level and achieve the minimal value at 77 9 of reducing rate as for minimizing cer target non point source reducing rate is the most significant negative factor which means the costs of lid bmp measures are too expensive in terms of water quality improving effects therefore a low level of non point source reducing rate is adopted in the same manner water transfer is no significant for cer which mean low level is adopted from the performances of optimization scheme if the local government aims at the best environmental and economic benefits or insufficient funds for pollution control this scheme can also be adopted as the desired outcome in the near future 6 conclusions this research contributes to integrating hydrodynamic water quality simulation modeling econometric model with mrsm to investigate and optimize the water quality and economic performance of an urban river system at watershed scales it provides an alternative simulation optimization method for decision making of water pollution control which has the advantage of being more realistic in reflecting water environment system and simpler in computing algorithm this simulation based mrsm presented the procedure of abstracting impact factors from various mitigation measures i point source reducing rate ii non point source reducing rate and ii water transfer on cer and wqsr responses of shiwuli river system the anova results indicate that the factor a and b is the significant factors and factor c is not significant on both responses cer and wqsr the significances of a b a2 and b2 provide an interaction and nonlinear contribution to cer respectively as well the significances of factor a and b provide a linear model to wqsr the obtained regression models were reasonably accurate in statistical significances and can be used for prediction the optimal scheme without the constraint of water quality standard reaching rate wqsr is obtainable when the pointing source reducing rate was 77 9 non point source reducing rate 40 and the water transfer at a low level respectively the optimal scheme with the constraint of water quality standard reaching rate wqsr is achievable when the pointing source reducing rate was 90 0 non point source reducing rate 57 2 and water transfer at a low level these results provide decision makers with the basis of choice to balance the economy and the environment although this research aimed to find the optimal solution for an urban river watershed the optimization function provided by mrsm can only obtain the approximate optimal solution various sources of uncertainty including model structure and parameters cost function and parameters quality of data can be interpreted as the limitation of this research moreover screening the factors may need to be designed before mrsm when the number of factors exceeds three as a direction for future research the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to other river basin systems in order to optimize their pollution control in a way of balancing environment and economy credit authorship contribution statement yong zeng methodology software writing original draft yanpeng cai conceptualization qian tan writing review editing

5870,in water pollution control of urban river basins one major issue is to reduce water pollutants at the least costs in this research an integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method was proposed to help optimize mitigation measures on water quality rehabilitation in shiwuli river basin of hefei city china initially multi response surface method mrsm with two levels and two responses i e cost effectiveness ratio cer and water quality standard reaching rate wqsr were designed where the factors of interests include the point source reducing rate i e factor a the non point source reducing rate i e factor b and water transfer i e factor c then a hydrodynamic water quality model was developed to predict water quality effects of the proposed combined factors at the same time the cost functions were established to estimate economic costs of the combined factors lastly the analysis of variance anova and multiple regression analysis mra were employed to help gain some new cognition in the statistically significant way the obtained model revealed that factor a and b were significant for both cer and wqsr this means that in the study area pollution source reduction is more important than water transfer though the optimal minimal cer was obtainable with 0 1493 m per percentage when the pointing source reducing rate is 77 9 the non point source reducing rate is 40 and the water transfer was controlled at a low level respectively with water quality standard reaching rate 70 7 it fails to achieve water quality objectives wqsr 90 0 moreover in order to meet water quality target simultaneous optimization of two objective functions minimal cer and maximal wqsr was achievable with the optimum value of 90 for wqsr and 0 1810 m per percentage for cer respectively with the pointing source reducing rate 90 0 the non point source reducing rate 57 2 and the water transfer at a low level it provided an alternative simulation optimization method for decision of water pollution control which had the advantages in reflecting the real water environment system and simplifying the algorithm compared to the conventional mathematical programming at the watershed scale keywords response surface method cost effectiveness analysis shiwuli river water quality pollution control 1 introduction urban rivers are vulnerable to water pollution due to their comparatively low self purification capacities and potentially high pollution loadings consequently water pollution in urban rivers is becoming a major environmental problem in many countries around the world lange et al 2015 saraswat et al 2017 previously a number of technologies and methods were used for alleviating water pollution a major disadvantage associated with such technologies and methods is the comparatively high costs which have posed a great pressure for city managers especially in developing countries gunawardena et al 2018 estimation and evaluation of costs and effectiveness of these technologies is preliminarily necessary it is thus important to explore fate and transport of water pollutants and assess the associated economic implications however due to the inherent complexities associated with these processes significant challenges are arising for local decision makers in figuring out relevant strategies and policies with maximum benefits and or minimal costs it is desired that effective tools be developed for helping evaluate pollution effects and identify suitable strategies policies to improve water quality with the least costs at the watershed scale over the past decades cost effectiveness analysis cea was widely used to evaluate economic aspects of strategic measures in catchment management cai et al 2011 gachango et al 2015 grieken et al 2013 diffusing nutrient reduction mewes 2012 water safety planning lindhe et al 2011 irrigation water allocation panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 stormwater management wang et al 2016 and ecosystem management boerema et al 2018 rong et al 2015 among these studies the minimal cost effectiveness ratio cer was a frequently used factor boerema et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 the main limitation of cea approaches lies in its low capability in predicting potential environmental quality changes girard et al 2015 such a deficiency can be remedied through integrating simulation models into a general cea based framework in which the impact of pressures can be analyzed at certain spatial and temporal scales balana et al 2011 2015 lescot et al 2013 gimeno et al 2018 for example a lot of scholars focused on integrating hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models into cea for supporting water quality restorations cai et al 2009 holguin gonzalez et al 2013 lee et al 2017 xue et al 2015 zhai et al 2017 in addition whitehead et al 2013 used a catchment scale model to simulate the status of phosphorus in thames river catchment of southern england and assessed cost effectiveness among a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies similarly mtibaa et al 2017 applied soil water assessment tool swat model based cea to evaluate cost effectiveness of multiple best management practices bmp in reducing sediment yields in the joumie watershed of northern tunisia a problem of cea is that it can hardly provide direct decision support for helping identify the best combinations of multiple mitigation measures if with infinite alternatives to obtain direct decision schemes through global or near global optimization an integrated framework of optimization based cea has been advanced vinten et al 2017 nainggolan et al 2018 geng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 such as hydro economic optimization models which could help generate decisions for balancing environmental effects and economic costs in river catchments through compromising analysis of hydrological engineering environmental and economic issues heinz et al 2007 brouwer and hofkes 2008 davidsen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 momblanch et al 2016 gunawardena et al 2018 mirchi et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 liu et al 2019a b kuriqi et al 2019 however it is difficult to accurately reflect inherent features of a real world hydro economic system through establishing optimization models for dealing with the intrinsic multiple components nonlinearity and complexities at certain scales due to algorithm complexity and long computation requirements in model solving processes zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 in order to overcome these defects a number of simulating models were integrated into optimization based cea were proposed in helping control non point sources nps panagopoulos and makropoulos 2014 dai et al 2017 schuwirth et al 2018 kuriqi 2014 kuriqi et al 2016 and managing storm water runoff within a watershed dong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 alamdari and sample 2019 though the developed approach may be effective in identifying global optimum solution the linkage between simulation and optimization modeling is normally complicated especially when both are complex comparatively the response surface methodology rsm is a technique mainly for designing experiments developing models identifying optimal conditions for desirable responses and evaluate interaction of factors that may influence treatment efficiency through a reduced number of experiments ahmad et al 2007 bezerra et al 2008 sadeghifam et al 2015 galankashi et al 2016 karimifard and moghaddam 2018 it has also been proposed for designing multiple types of computational experiments li et al 2018 and solving optimization models tan et al 2015 yue et al 2014 as a process optimization tool it could provide an alternative method for replacing the original optimization models generally rsm could have advantages in a providing clear insights upon general effects of parameters and their interactions on the outputs in a statistic significance which is not easily revealed through many other methods rivera and sutherland 2015 b reducing the number of simulations or optimizations leading to significant time and cost savings scotti et al 2000 heijungs and lenzen 2014 and c deriving low order polynomial models which can serve as approximations of the true model khang et al 2017 it is very popular in experimental methods its applications in water management and decisions are limited few studies focused on analyzing uncertainties in parameters for hydrological groundwater simulation and basin simulation models wu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 tavakoli et al 2014 though rsm aided methods have proven the advantages in parameter analysis none of them could help address water quality management issues in river basins evaluate contributions of mitigation measures and identify desired schemes it is possible to achieve desired schemes for improving water quality in an urban river basin through combining cea with water quality simulation model based on rsm also it is expected to identify the main factors that are affecting system performances through analyzing the main effects of factors and interactions therefore the objective of this research is to develop an integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method ihwqs mrsm to analyze the main effects and interactions of factors in water quality mitigation measures it will then be used for identifying the optimal combination measures to improve urban river water quality at a minimum cost effectiveness ratio which is an indicator of balancing economic cost and water quality goals in detail cea will be used to evaluate the integrated environmental and economic effects of pollution reducing measures a one dimensional river hydrodynamic water quality model will be employed to forecast effects of mitigation measures on water quality the mrsm will be adopted to optimize mitigation measures and analyze main effects and interactions of the identified factors the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the first section shiwuli river basin in hefei city anhui province of china will be introduced as the case studied area then a frame of ihwqs mrsm will be developed in which methods of generic step by step operations pollution and remediation analysis water quality simulation cost estimation and optimization by mrsm will be combined in section 3 results of the developed models will be presented and discussed following the main findings and policy applications a series of conclusions will be presented then 2 overview of the shiwuli river basin the shiwuli river basin is located in the southwest suburb of hefei city the capital of anhui province southeast china fig 1 it is a small river with low water flow and velocity no obvious phenomenon of stratification is observed it flows from northwest to southeast and later entering into chao lake i e one of the country s top five freshwater lakes the basin area is 106 6 km2 including 12 4 km2 of agricultural area the population in the basin is 0 6 million in 2015 as one of the three major nutrient load contributors of chao lake water quality of the shiwuli river has drawn much attention and its water quality improvement has become a national goal chen et al 2018 the subtropical monsoon climate brings an average annual rainfall of approximately 1 000 mm into this area with annual average water surface evaporation of 835 mm and the water level in the shiwuli river varies considerably during the wet i e june to september normal i e march to may and october to november and dry i e december to february of the next year seasons zong et al 2014 the main stream beginning from swan lake dam and ending at chao lake entrance is approximately 22 9 km with an average gradient 0 5 its average flow in 2015 was 1 19 m3 s urban runoff accounted for 59 of the runoff waste water from sewage treatment plants stp and domestic sewage accounted for the remaining 41 due to interception of upstream impoundment reservoir swan lake reservoir there is almost no upstream inflow the previous studies show at least 1 77 m3 s of water is needed to satisfy the minimum water demands by local ecosystems therefore the current water flow seldom satisfies that infers extremely small ability in purifying pollutants therefore lack of clean water replenishment is identified as an important cause of water quality deterioration the water function of shiwuli river is defined as urban landscape water use with water quality goal of class v in the surface water quality standards gb3838 2002 regulated by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china according to the weekly water quality data provided by the local environmental protection bureau in 2015 the average concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp totally exceed the class v standard which means the necessity of improving water qualities according to local government the improving targets of nh3 n and tp will be reaching the class v in the near future i e 2020 comparatively there is no target for alleviating tn concentration to reach class v therefore nh3 n and tp are identified as controlling indicators of water quality improvement pollution loads are estimated according to the three categories including point non point and endogenous sources point sources include urban domestic sewage and stp discharge rural domestic sewage centralized livestock wastewater agricultural runoff storm runoff and aquaculture wastewater constitute of non point sources in the research sediment release is regarded as endogenous source statistical results of annual pollution load 2015 are present in table 1 accord to proportions of pollution loads from multiple sources the other sources except point source and storm runoff are neglected due to its very small proportion e g less than 5 among the pollution sources point sources are the top source accounting for 80 8 of nh3 n and 66 5 of tp respectively at present one stp with design capacity 100 000 tons day has been built to treat domestic sewage from entire basin the remove rates of target pollutants are designed as about 40 50 due to this low remove rate water qualities of stp discharges into river are far worse than class v standard therefore the stp discharges with a large amount and poor water quality have been regarded as a main point source besides the amount of currently municipal sewage would exceed the design capacity of stp which has been predicted about 260 000 tons day in 2020 moreover drainage in some areas is still combined sewer and not connected to stp in which mixed rainwater and sewage are discharged directly into the river therefore these deficiencies means upgrading sewage pipe network expanding capacity of stp and improving pollutant remove rate are necessary at the same time urban storm runoff is another main pollutant source especially the initial rainwater but no relevant mitigation measures are currently implemented in studied basin for this type of pollution low impact development best management practices lid bmps are common strategies for reducing storm water pollution loads eckart et al 2017 from the above analysis insufficient sewage treatment capacity with low remove rate highly polluted urban storm runoff together with no stable clean water replenishment are the main causes of water quality degeneration in the study area table 2 accordingly the corresponding mitigation measures that this research concerns include i perfecting drainage network expanding stp and improving removing rate of pollutants ii implementing lid bmps and iii augmenting river flow by water transfer from chao lake 3 integrated modeling of hydrodynamics water quality and economic implication a framework of the integrated hydrodynamic water quality simulation based multi response surface method ihwqs mrsm is developed for rehabilitation of water quality in shiwuli river basin as shown in fig 2 in this research daily values of water quality indicators were employed for the management objection since the detailed procedure of cea have been fully discussed boerema et al 2018 these were combined with hydrodynamic water quality model and mrsm to develop a framework of integrated modelling methodology briefly the steps are as follows 1 assessment of current water quality e g identify water quality index that is exceeding the corresponding environmental quality standards determination of water quality improving targets identification of major pollution sources e g sewage effluent domestic sewage storm runoff industrial wastewater and agricultural activities and identification of mitigation measures the measures are chosen based on features of pollution sources and available pollution treatment technologies 2 extract of the factors from the chosen measures and determination of levels according to features of the studied area and the relevant literatures 3 design of simulating experiments through using mrsm 4 cost estimation of combinational mitigation measures this involves the assessment of the investment costs and operation and management costs of mitigation measures as well considering time values of money 5 development of a one dimension hydrodynamic water quality model of river basin and prediction of water quality performance of mitigation measures and 6 optimization of mitigation measures under two targets minimal cost effective rates and water quality standard reaching rates and analysis of main effects and interactions of factors this involves application of analysis of variance anova multivariate regression analysis mra and multiple criteria optimization mco to determine optimal schemes for reaching water targets at the least cost 3 1 multi response surface methodology mrsm 3 1 1 identification of responding indicators in this research cea is employed as a tool to assess and rank alternative measures on the basis of their costs and effectiveness for achieving certain environmental objectives the assessment criterion of applying cea is known as a cost effectiveness ratio cer which is a monetary cost of physical effects non monetary the physical effect refers to the water quality improving effects therefore the water quality standard reaching rate wqsr of water environment function zone is adopted as an indicator which can be calculated as a frequency of days when water quality standard are satisfied within a year the average wqsr of nh3 n and tp are chosen to evaluate the water quality improving effect as for monetary cost the present value pv of total costs over the economic life of adopted mitigation measures is employed as an estimation of annual costs of those measures after considering discount rate then cost effectiveness ratio cer can be calculated as follows 1 c e r c pv 1 2 i 1 2 w q s r i where c pv is the present value of total costs million i denotes the index of water quality variables i 1 and 2 i 1 for nh3 n and i 2 for tp w q s r i denotes the value of wqsr for i th water quality variable that can be estimated as follows 2 wqsr i sd i 365 100 where sd i is the number of standard reaching days for the i th water quality variable as one of the response indicators the smaller value is cer the better of system performance however the best cer alternative may over or under reach water quality target values therefore the cer should not be used as the single criterion for evaluating alternatives to consider both the cost effective and water quality target in a sensible way average wqsr of nh3 n and tp are employed as another response indicator the simulation results can be interpreted with these two response indicators therefore design and analysis of mrsm will be performed in this research 3 1 2 determination of key factors and the associated levels from mitigation measures in table 2 three factors including the point source reducing rate factor a the non point source reducing rate factor b and water transfer factor c with two levels each can be extracted as system inputs for factor a the current removal rate of wtp is regarded as a low level and the average removal rate of the recommended best phosphorus and nitrogen removal processes is defined as high level li et al 2008 therefore 50 and 90 reducing rate are set as low and a high levels respectively as shown in table 2 because the non point source mainly comes from storm water the pollutant removing performance of single or aggregate lid bmps can be used to set up the levels of factor b according to literatures eckart et al 2017 mao et al 2017 there are at the least 40 and at the most 80 reducing rate for both nh3 n and tp accordingly 80 and 40 are set as high and low levels of factor b respectively for factor c 0 58 m3 s of water transfer from chao lake is set as the low level which is hoped to satisfy minimum ecological water demand and 1 74 m3 s of water transfer set as high level for increasing the ability of diluting pollutants during design of mrsm a real value of factor levels is expressed as a code value the following equation can be applied to transform a real value z i into a coded value x i bezerra et al 2008 3 x i z i z i 0 δ z i β d where δ z i is the distance between the real value of central point and factor level β d is the coded limit value in the matrix for each variable β d 1 in this research and z i 0 is the real value in the central point 3 1 3 arranging simulations through an orthogonal array because axis points should not exceed cubic points in this study the central composite face centered design ccf of mrsm was used for optimization of mitigation measures in urban river water quality improving through using minitab 17 as a symmetrical second order experimental design three factors with two levels ccf can be used for supporting the design including two stages and totally 16 simulation runs i first stage a full factorial design with 2 central point runs namely 23 points of factorial design and 2 central points together 10 trials this stage usually serves in finding near optimal interval of level by judging whether the model has curvature but in this paper the initial level setting interval already contains all cases it changes to judge whether to use linear regression or non linear regression to fit the functional relationship between factors and response variable rather than finding near optimal interval ii second stage an additional design namely 2 3 axial points with 6 trials in second stage optimum operating conditions on the control variables were determinated by using the second order regression model the detail arrangements of simulations are present at table 3 in this table the two replicates of the central point are used to estimate pure random errors the same value of two replicates means that pure random error is zero because the same inputs get the same outputs in simulating circumstance 3 2 economic costs of pollution mitigation measures according to table 3 there are 16 scenarios in total and indicators of cer and wqsr for each scenario need to be calculated firstly costs of each scenario should be calculated in order to calculate cer three general categories of costs have been considered in the implementation of mitigation measures including the establishment costs annual operational and maintenance o m costs and the relevant opportunity costs gachango et al 2015 in china the relevant opportunity is economic values of the occupied land for production although the total costs could be accurately calculated by item by item method such as the costs of design labor and equipment financing and maintenance the cost functions are employed to estimate these costs 3 2 1 cost estimation for sewage treatment plants stp as for establishment costs of stp jiang et al 2018 used an exponential function to fit the data of sizable samples from china the annual establishment cost function can be presented as follows 4 i n v 0 0736 e x p 2 647 0 782 d u m m y e s s q 0 484 e 3 104 where i n v is the annual capital investment cost of wastewater treatment plant million year q is the designed capacity of the plant m3 day e is pollutant removal efficiency expressed in percentage d u m m y e s s is a dummy variable i e d u m m y e s s 1 if 0 9 e 1 and if 0 i n v 20 m i l l i o n otherwise d u m m y e s s 0 all economic values in this paper are expressed in 2006 us level 1 rmb 0 1281 capital recovery factor crf is calculated as 0 0736 with a discount rate of 4 and lifetime of 20 years annual o m cost function can be presented as follows jiang et al 2018 5 v c e x p 0 119 0 907 d u m m y e s s q 0 413 e 2 575 where d u m m y e s s is a dummy variable d u m m y e s s 1 if 0 9 e 1 and if 0 i n v 1 m i l l i o n otherwise d u m m y e s s 0 3 2 2 cost estimation for low impact development best management practices lid bmps the use of lid bmps can be an effective control strategy to mitigate the negative impact of urban runoff jia et al 2015 various types of lid bmps such as grass swales permeable pavements bioretention cell wetland can be applied to reduce peak runoff and improving water quality of urban runoff eckart et al 2017 an exponential function with independent variable drainage area and dependent variable costs per drainage area is employed to fit the sample data from mao et al 2017 the fitting plot is present in fig 3 the determination coefficient is 0 9978 which means the model is accurate enough to predict the establishment cost function for lid bmps per area is written as 6 painv nps 0 4254 e x p 0 0334 e painv nps is the annual capital investment cost of lid bmps million year when considering of discount rate and total designed areas the annual investment cost is expressed as 7 inv nps 0 0736 0 4254 e x p 0 0334 e s where inv nps is annual capital investment cost of lid bmps million year s is designed areas of lid bmps km2 as well the annual o m cost for lid bmps is estimated 5 construction costs usepa 1999 3 2 3 cost estimation for water transfer the establishment costs of water transfer include costs of pipeline pumping house equipment and construction etc its value depends on amount of water transfer and length of pipeline which are estimated by power function zhang 1997 after considering of capital recovery factor crf annul costs of water transfer pipeline construction are express as 8 inv wd 0 0736 0 0863 q 0 656 l where inv wd is annul establishment costs of water transfer million q water discharges 104m3 day l is length of pipeline km o m costs briefly refer to operation cost of water pump depreciation of fixed assets and maintenance fees etc the exponential

calculate the two response indicators it is necessary to simulate and predict the water quality restoration effect after each scenario is implemented this part of the work is done by the water quality model of shiwuli river 3 3 1 hydrodynamic and water quality simulation modeling a one dimension hydrodynamic water quality model based on mike11 software platform is employed in this paper model equations were descripted in feng et al 2016 and ardiclioglu and kuriqi 2019 and parameters setting had been detailed present in mike11 reference user manual 2005 the simulated length of shiwuli river system is 22 64 km beginning from upstream boundary swan lake to the downstream boundary entrance of chao lake eighty measured terrain data of river section are used to describe the underwater topography the main tributaries are xuxiao and weixi river which have been simplified as point sources in the model three automatic hydrologic stations at river chainage of 2 14 12 50 and 18 80 km respectively are labeled as 1 2 3 shown in fig 1 the daily time series flow data of 2015 at 1 hydrological station are set as upstream hd inflow boundary and daily time series water lever data of same periods at 3 automatic hydrological station are set as downstream hd water level boundary five weirs located at the upstream chainage 0 69 2 62 2 84 3 36 and 4 90 km respectively are set up as hydraulic structure the target water quality indicators nh3 n and tp are set up as state variables their concentrations in ad boundary and initial condition are both set up as class ii surface water quality standard nh3 n 1 mg l tp 0 2 mg l gb3838 2002 pollution sources are set up by categorized as point and distribution source in model boundary conditions as for hydrodynamic and water quality parameters such as manning coefficient diffusion coefficient and degradation coefficient are firstly set by expert experiences and then achieve optimal values by trial and error method during model calibrations 3 3 2 calibration and validation optimal parameters are achieved by model calibration when simulated values are very close to observed values after calibration another period time series observed data are needed to validate the model to test the transfer ability of optimal parameters an evaluation index is required to quantitative assess model performance percent bias pbias is used to evaluate model performance which is calculated with equation 10 pbias i 1 n y o i y s i 100 i 1 n y o i where y s i is simulated value at time i y o i observed value at time i the low magnitude value of pbias indicates accurate model simulation with optimal value is zero while positive values indicate underestimation bias and negative values overestimation bias according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the model is satisfactory if value of pbias is less than 25 for river flow and 70 for water qualities the automatic hydrologic stations labeled 2 is select as calibration and verification station for hydrology daily water flow and water level observed data from jan 1 2015 to jun 30 2015 are used to calibrate hydrodynamic parameters and those from jul 1 to dec 31 are used to validate for no enough stations in studied basin the calibration and validation results are present at fig 4 a and b pbias of water flow and water level during calibration and validation are all less than 25 which are desirable and can be used to predict similarly an automatic water quality monitor station at river chainage 19 89 km labeled as 1 shown in fig 1 is selected as calibration and verification station for water quality the weekly nh3 n and tp observed data from jan 1 2015 to jun 30 2015 are used to calibrate and that from jul 1 to dec 31 are used to validate the results are present at fig 5 a and b with all pbias are less than 70 which indicate that the simulated water quality data reasonably agree with the observed one and the parameters of model are reasonable 3 4 statistic analysis after combinations of different factor and level are arranged by mrsm the effects of combinations are simulated by hydrodynamic water quality model and the costs estimated by cost functions response indicators of cer and wqsr of each combination will be achieved as present in table 3 then anova and mra are used to distinguish significant factors and to estimate the parameters of multiple regression models the two responses cer and wqsr are optimized by using multi response optimizer tool in minitab this methodology initially constructs a desirability function for each individual response which each response is transformed into a dimensionless scale then the overall desirability function is defined as the weighted geometric average of the individual desirability with these operations the original multi response optimization is thus changed to optimize a single overall desirability function that can be solved by gradient descent algorithm with multiple starting points the detail information about desirability function can be seen from bezerra et al 2008 4 results 4 1 results of the first stage of multi response surface methodology multi response surface methodology mrsm is designed under two stages the main purpose of first stage is to judge whether to use linear regression or non linear regression to fit the functional relationship between factors and response variable by judging whether the model has curvature if the model has curvature further precise estimating parameters of a second order regression model will be performed in the second stage if not parameters of linear regression model after removing insignificant model term will be estimated in first stage the anova table for response of wqsr in first stage simulations is depicted in table 4 in table 4 if the p value of model term is less than 0 05 it indicates the model term is significant with desirable and considerably affecting wqsr therefore significates of model and linear term would reveal the linear relationship between wqsr and factors the main effect of point source reducing rate factor a and non point source reducing rate factor b are significant model terms other model terms can be expressed to be not significant these insignificant model terms can be removed and may result in an improved model the anova table for response of cer is depicted in table 5 in the same manner no significant of model and linear terms mean that linear model is inadequate when a nonlinear relationship between factors and cer exists thus further simulations should be added to the first stage design for generating a second order regression model in order to justify the possible curvature six axial points on the center of factors edge were augmented the simulations designed for augmentation and the related results are tabulated in table 3 4 2 results of the second stage of multi response surface methodology after six added simulations in second stages are finished all the data onto first and second stages are combined as a whole and anova is tested again the cer results after insignificant terms reduction are presented in table 6 here the tiny p value for the model indicates that the model is significant after adding the second order effect the decreasing for the standard deviation of model error and increasing for adj r2 indicate an improved model after insignificant terms reduction an r square value of 99 09 indicates that the model is able to explain about 99 09 of the variation on the response the adj r2 and predicted r2 are in reasonable agreement with each other means no over fit according to the anova results it can be concluded that the quadratic regression equation is suitable for fit the functional relationship between cer and factors of mitigation measures for the studied basin the same procedure is applied to the response of wqsr the anova table results after model reduction are depicted in table 7 here the p value 0 05 reveals that the main effects of the point and non point source reducing rates have significant effects on wqsr here the p value of 0 000 for the model indicates that the linear model is significant which is desirable the adj r2 value of 96 85 indicates that the model is able to explain about 96 85 of the variation on the wqsr the predicted r2 is 95 86 in reasonable agreement with adj r2 according to the anova results it can be concluded that this model can be used to predict wqsr within design space 4 2 1 optimal condition for pollution mitigation measures the non linear regression equation for cer is determined based on the significant factors present in table 6 and is presented in terms of actual values as follows 11 c e r 0 4472 0 00630 a 0 00310 b 0 000047 a 2 0 000072 b 2 0 000027 a b the linear regression equation for wqsr in terms of actual level value is written as 12 w q s r 18 17 0 8940 a 0 4820 b the normal probability plot of the residual for the empirical model of cer is present in fig 6 a it is desirable that the residual is generally fall on a straight line which implies that the residual error is distributed normally moreover the residual versus fitted value plot is depicted in fig 6 b it means that quadratic regression model eq 11 is correct and credible for the residuals of model are randomly scattered and no obvious pattern as some manner the normal probability plot and residual versus fitted value for wqsr are shown in fig 7 a and b it is obvious that the patterns of residual error in both responses are normal and random which are desirable it can be concluded that eqs 11 and 12 are reasonable and adequate with no need for any further test fig 8 a illustrates the contour plot for cer response surface at the center level of water transfer no significant the curvilinear is visible in the plot which is in accordance with the obtained quadratic model the contour plot reveals that the best response surface is obtainable at a high level of point source reduce rate about 80 and at a low level of non point source reduce rate about 40 fig 8 b depicts the counter plot for response surface of wqsr the slant line shaped contour is visible which justifies the obtained linear model the plot shows that the best response surface of wqsr is obtainable at a high level of the point source reducing rate about 90 and at a high level of the non point source reduce rate about 70 the different optimal decision space means conflict for simultaneously achieving optimal points for both responses the overlying contour plot for wqsr and cer can be developed to optimize multi response by overlapping the contour of both responses as present in fig 9 the good outcomes of cer can be defined as an interval 0 15 0 20 that of wqsr can be defined as 90 100 respectively the overlaying plot with the unshaded area means both optimized response surfaces have a part of same decision space that simultaneously good for both responses theoretically each point within overlay can be selected as the optimal result after balancing water quality improving and cost effectiveness ratio in this case the desirable optimal results within wqsr 90 and cer 0 2 are those schemes with about 85 90 of point source reducing rate about 60 of non point source reducing rate and low level of water transfer 0 58 m3 s respectively since water transfer is a no significant factor more precise optimization of multi response is based on response optimizer of minitab which is present in fig 10 a the setup of optimizing cer in response optimizer is a minimized goal with lower boundary 0 14 upper boundary 0 20 and goal importance 1 that of wqsr in response optimizer is a targeted goal with lower boundary 85 target 90 and upper boundary 100 and goal importance 5 where wqsr with greater weight means it is preferentially satisfied than cer the optimum value of 90 for wqsr and 0 1808 for cer is obtainable when the factor level 90 point source reducing rate 57 2 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer respectively at this solution individual desirability d for cer and wqsr is 0 37921 and 1 0000 respectively as well composite desirability is 0 8508 if without considering water quality target response optimization of cer is present in fig 10 b it shows that the optimum value of 0 1493 for cer is obtainable when the factors 77 9 point source reduce rate 40 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer respectively 4 2 2 the main effects and interaction of the factors the factorial main effect for wqsr is present as fig 11 a it is visible that factorial main effects are a b c that can be judged by the mean value difference of wqsr between two levels it infers the greatest influence on the wqsr value is point source reducing rate then non point source reducing rate and lastly water transfer this is consistent with the results of the previous anova which the effect of factor c is not significant table 7 as to nonsignificant factor the optimal level can be freely chosen generally considering other criteria such as saving time cost and labor etc in significant factors both effects of the point source reducing rate and non point source reducing rate on cer rise from low level to high level in a linear way but the former has a steeper slope it infers that factor a is better in water quality improving effect than factor b the interactional plots for wqsr are present as fig 11 b it is visible that none interactional effect is significant the factorial main effect on cer is present as fig 12 a in the same manner it is visible that factorial main effects are b a c which means the greatest influence on the cer value is the non point source reducing rate then point source reducing rate and lastly water transfer this is consistent with the results of the previous variance analysis table 6 which the effect of factor c is not significant in significant factors effects of point source reducing rate on cer decline from a low level to high level in a non linear way but that of non point source reducing rate is opposite which means a low level is better for minimizing cer it infers that factor a is better than factor b in terms of minimizing the cer the interactional plots for cer are present as fig 12 b it is visible that only interactional effect of a b is significant and declining when levels of a and b increased this infers factor b is also essential although individual b has the opposite effect to minimize cer 5 discussions 5 1 balancing economy and environment the advantage of simulation based mrsm lies in providing a tool for simulation and optimization for environmental economic system simultaneously though it is an optimization of quadratic approximation therefore it contributes to providing a dynamic and distributed simulation environment for a real water environment system allowing decision makers to understand optimize and innovate the system operation to achieve system goals with minimal cost time and labor in addition main effects interactions quadratic effects of impact factors are analyzed and thus helpful in identifying the key variables and their influences on the system withstatisticalsignificance moreover mrsm provides a multi criterion optimization methodology based on desirability function which is a simple algorithm in terms of watershed scale optimization in doe of minitab error includes pure error and lack of fit error which corresponds to usually random error and systematic error respectively in the same manner simulation based doe also includes these two types of error the one is systematic error that comes from imperfections of the model and approach parameters of personal estimation such as parameters in the hydrodynamic water quality model parameters in cost estimated etc the other is random error that comes from uncontrollable or unknown confounding factors and can be reduced by repetitions such as measuring error instability of environmental conditions the small differences between analysts and the instability of instruments etc the random error of the experiment is observed differences between replicates but not available in the simulation environment because all replicates produce same response value during simulation hence a key issue in simulation based doe is how to define the random error which is important in testing the significances of the effects fit of model and curvature since all observed data used in the model are time series based on average values of replicates the random error of measure is assumed to be eliminated therefore in simulating circumstance the random error is defined as zero which is the main different distinguished from experiment based doe in such circumstance tests of lack of fit and curvature are disabled which may be a trouble in the judgment when the second stage simulations will be performed at this time the alternative way used in this paper is to judge whether the test of model term and linear term are significant in fist stage if yes the regression equation used in second stage is linear function if not the regression equation is quadratic function 5 2 limitation of application of cost effectiveness analysis though a cea provides useful information for deciding best mitigation alternative by combing the effect and cost it should be careful to interpret the result according to specific objective of the specific river basin when the other targets besides minimum cer need to be considered inconsistency and conflict between targets may occur such as minimizing cer and water quality standard reaching rate which illustrated by case studied in such a situation it is required to use multi objective or multi criterion analysis to coordinate and balance conflicting goals such as minimal cer and maximum water quality target therefore the mrsm algorithm essentially a multi criterion programming is employed to balance water quality target and cer target 5 3 policy implications in order to reach the target of 90 water quality standard reaching rate with minimal cer 90 0 point source reducing rate 57 2 non point source reducing rate 0 58 m3 s water transfer from chao lake are required it infers sewage treatment plant of shiwuli river not only needs to be expanded the capacity of treatment but also be upgraded by the treatment process and be significantly improved the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal a variety of lid bmp measures need to be jointly used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in urban runoff though water transfer has no significant effect on both cer and wqsr low level of water transfer to satisfy minimum ecological water demand is beneficial for river social and ecological system these optimal results suggest priority should be given to reducing pollution sources rather than water transfer especially reducing municipal sewage and initial urban runoff pollution if considering cer alone 77 9 point source reducing rate 40 0 non point source reducing rate and 0 58 m3 s water transfer from chao lake get minimal cer 0 1493 m per percentage with water quality standard reaching rate 70 7 the cer firstly decreases and then increases when point source reducing rate increase from low level to high level and achieve the minimal value at 77 9 of reducing rate as for minimizing cer target non point source reducing rate is the most significant negative factor which means the costs of lid bmp measures are too expensive in terms of water quality improving effects therefore a low level of non point source reducing rate is adopted in the same manner water transfer is no significant for cer which mean low level is adopted from the performances of optimization scheme if the local government aims at the best environmental and economic benefits or insufficient funds for pollution control this scheme can also be adopted as the desired outcome in the near future 6 conclusions this research contributes to integrating hydrodynamic water quality simulation modeling econometric model with mrsm to investigate and optimize the water quality and economic performance of an urban river system at watershed scales it provides an alternative simulation optimization method for decision making of water pollution control which has the advantage of being more realistic in reflecting water environment system and simpler in computing algorithm this simulation based mrsm presented the procedure of abstracting impact factors from various mitigation measures i point source reducing rate ii non point source reducing rate and ii water transfer on cer and wqsr responses of shiwuli river system the anova results indicate that the factor a and b is the significant factors and factor c is not significant on both responses cer and wqsr the significances of a b a2 and b2 provide an interaction and nonlinear contribution to cer respectively as well the significances of factor a and b provide a linear model to wqsr the obtained regression models were reasonably accurate in statistical significances and can be used for prediction the optimal scheme without the constraint of water quality standard reaching rate wqsr is obtainable when the pointing source reducing rate was 77 9 non point source reducing rate 40 and the water transfer at a low level respectively the optimal scheme with the constraint of water quality standard reaching rate wqsr is achievable when the pointing source reducing rate was 90 0 non point source reducing rate 57 2 and water transfer at a low level these results provide decision makers with the basis of choice to balance the economy and the environment although this research aimed to find the optimal solution for an urban river watershed the optimization function provided by mrsm can only obtain the approximate optimal solution various sources of uncertainty including model structure and parameters cost function and parameters quality of data can be interpreted as the limitation of this research moreover screening the factors may need to be designed before mrsm when the number of factors exceeds three as a direction for future research the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to other river basin systems in order to optimize their pollution control in a way of balancing environment and economy credit authorship contribution statement yong zeng methodology software writing original draft yanpeng cai conceptualization qian tan writing review editing

5871,detailed knowledge about the circulation of meteoric water in non magmatic orogenic belts is fundamental for assessing the potential of such settings for geothermal power production as well as their use as potential groundwater resources to get more general insight into these hydrological processes we have conducted regional 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical thc simulations of meteoric water circulation in the orogenic crystalline basement of the aar massif in the central alps switzerland model results were compared to numerous geochemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater discharging into the longest and deepest tunnel of the world the gotthard railbase tunnel located within the model domain explicitly considering the surface topography in our model was sufficient to reproduce all key characteristics of the tunnel inflows salinity temperature δ18o values and up and downward directed flow zones inferred from geochemical constraints this quantitatively confirms that surface topography operates as the governing control on fluid flow in orogenic crystalline basements with meteoric water infiltration occurring at high altitude and resulting upward directed flow zones along major valleys owing to low flow rates below 2 m year 1 computed residence times of the longest flow paths were above 100 k years confirming that groundwater and or porewater in orogenic crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations moreover simulation results show that down to the lower model boundary at 9 km depth penetration of meteoric water is not limited by the decrease in permeability with depth that is typically observed in granitic rocks this suggests that advective fluid transport in orogenic crystalline basements may reach the brittle ductile transition zone and that infiltrating meteoric water can attain temperatures well above 150 c we conclude that orogenic geothermal systems are promising plays for geothermal power production

interconnected fracture networks stober and bucher 2007 bucher and stober 2010 and the presence of hydrological driving forces ingebritsen and manning 1999 although mountain topography has been long ago recognized as key driver for meteoric water circulation in non magmatic orogenic belts e g hubbert 1940 forster and smith 1988 ge et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 direct observations linking downward and upward directed flow zones are still sparse on the one hand numerous studies have described the ascent of meteoric water along deep reaching faults i e along permeability anomalies based on the occurrence of thermal springs and their chemical and isotopic composition examples include sites in the canadian rocky mountains grasby et al 2016 the southern alps of new zealand reyes et al 2010 the central european alps pfeifer et al 1992 sonney and vuataz 2008 diamond et al 2018 the black forest stober et al 1999 stober and bucher 2015 the pyrenees taillefer et al 2018 the himalayas craw et al 2005 and locations in china bucher et al 2009 stober et al 2016 other manifestations of ascending fluids include fossil hydrothermal breccias hofmann et al 2004 and positive temperature anomalies i e above those predicted by the local geothermal gradient recorded along tunnels and boreholes pastorelli et al 2001 valla et al 2016 on the other hand shallow 2 km infiltration of meteoric water into crystalline rocks is evidenced by the occasional occurrence of large inflows 100 l s 1 of cold meteoric water into highway or railway tunnels associated with negative temperature anomalies hunziker et al 1990 maréchal et al 1999 pastorelli et al 2001 the maximum penetration of meteoric water however is still under debate and suggested depths range from 5 to 23 km diamond et al 2018 and references therein the rheology of the continental crust changes with increasing depth from brittle to ductile deformation behavior below the brittle ductile transition zone located in a depth of about 12 14 km at a typical crustal geothermal gradient of 25 30 c km 1 wintsch et al 1995 stober and bucher 2007 darcy flow is not possible stober and bucher 2015 and other transport mechanisms are responsible for fluid transfer through the ductile crust connolly and podladchikov 2015 thus the studies reporting the greatest depths invoke penetration of meteoric water below the brittle ductile transition zone wickham et al 1993 cartwright and buick 1999 the large range in postulated penetration depths however may also be inherited from a variation in methodology ranging from stable water isotope analyses of minerals and fluid inclusions in hydrothermal rocks to solute geothermometry and geochemical modeling applied to thermal springs and does not necessary imply penetration below the brittle ductile transition zone see diamond et al 2018 and references therein in any case it reflects the limited knowledge about structural controls on meteoric water infiltration into crystalline basements and on how infiltration zones are actually connected to deep reaching fault zones along which meteoric water can again reach the surface and discharge as thermal springs eventually belgrano et al 2016 this forms a particular challenge for assessing orogenic crystalline basements as potential groundwater resources ge et al 2008 and for evaluating their potential for geothermal power production wanner et al 2019 here we present results from regional 3d 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical thc simulations of fluid flow in the aar massif in the central alps switzerland the study area constitutes an ideal site to get more insight into regional hydrogeological processes in orogenic crystalline basements because i numerous chemical and isotopic analyses of water inflows along the world s longest and deepest tunnel the gotthard railbase tunnel bucher et al 2012 provide a unique opportunity to study such processes ii the area includes both major valleys as well as mountain peaks which appear to correlate with distinct upward and downward directed flow zones at the tunnel level and iii major i e regional structural and thermal anomalies are absent to overcome the shortage of hydraulic measurements in this regional system we use the available chemical and isotopic data to constrain our model and to quantitatively evaluate whether mountain topography indeed operates as the first order driving force for regional meteoric water circulation 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the 57 km long gotthard rail base tunnel crosses the central alps at a base level of ca 500 m a s l the construction was simultaneously carried out in five individual sections which was enabled by drilling vertical access shafts our study exclusively deals with the amsteg section of the tunnel corresponding to a 11 5 km long section in the northern part of the tunnel fig 1 because only for this tunnel section groundwater inflows were systemically sampled with a high spatial resolution during construction the construction took place between 2003 and 2006 using a 400 m long tunnel boring machine the geology and hydrogeology along the amsteg section of the tunnel have been previously described in detail and are summarized in the following the section crosscuts the crystalline basement of the aar massif which represents a major ne sw striking complex of the variscan basement 120 20 km in size the aar massif was overprinted by alpine greenshist type metamorphism and associated deformation abrecht 1994 schaltegger 1994 labhart 1999 the different geological units exposed along the amsteg section are made of granites gneisses and volcanic rocks e g metarhyolites bucher et al 2012 mineralogically these rocks have similar compositions and are dominated by quartz albite k feldspar and chlorite minor amounts of biotite and muscovite and accessory pyrite and calcite bucher et al 2012 the thickness of the rock column above the tunnel is between 300 and 2200 m fig 2 north south compression during the alpine orogeny resulted in steeply dipping geological units and e w trending foliation steck and hunziker 1994 brittle deformation caused by exhumation of the aar massif and subsequent cooling formed shear fractures and joint systems choukroune and gapais 1983 laws et al 2003 high deformation zones currently strike parallel to the geological units and steeply dip to the s or n laws et al 2003 thus the tunnel crosscuts the steeply dipping units and the nearly vertical fracture system at an angle close to 90 fig 2 based on a hydraulic test performed in a zone with major water inflows in the nearby sedrun section of the tunnel fig 1 the hydraulic conductivity in such highly deformed zones may be as high as 10 6 m s 1 bucher et al 2012 in contrast the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity across the entire sedrun section ranges from 3 to 6 10 9 m s 1 masset and loew 2013 during drilling of the amsteg section 122 groundwater samples were collected from water conducting fractures before these were permanently sealed with concrete owing to the induced pressure drop the water inflow rate from individual fractures ranged from 0 0004 to 6 l s 1 full chemical analyses were performed on all 122 groundwater samples with the results being reported in bucher et al 2012 groundwater from the various inflows range from freshwater to strongly mineralized water tds 171 3231 mg l 1 their chemical composition varies from the general na co3 and na so4 chemical types up to about 700 mg l 1 total mineralization to the general na cl chemical type at elevated mineralization 700 mg l 1 all samples are characterized by an alkaline ph ranging from 8 3 to 10 4 in their chemical characteristics the groundwater samples from the gotthard railway tunnel thus resemble many other crystalline groundwaters of similar total mineralization e g nordstrom et al 1989 pearson et al 1991 waber et al 2017 schneeberger et al 2019 the chemical composition is inherited from water rock interaction reactions between infiltrating meteoric water and the granitic mineralogy of the crystalline basement beside such advective reactive transport along interconnected fracture networks i e the fracture porosity there are strong indications for a diffusive uptake of mainly cl na so4 li and br from porewater present in the intact non fractured and low permeable rock matrix i e the matrix porosity this porewater presumably constitutes a remnant of a hydrothermal fluid that evolved during alpine metamorphism seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 the important role of matrix porewater on the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater in crystalline settings originates from strong concentration gradients between fracture groundwater and matrix porewater that are continuously balanced by mainly diffusion over time waber et al 2012 the surface hydrology above the amsteg section of the tunnel is controlled by the catchment of the maderaner valley including the etzli side valley fig 1 at the town of amsteg the two valleys drain into the reuss a major alpine river in switzerland at an average annual discharge of 9 m3 s 1 foen 2015 the average annual precipitation rate in the catchment is altitude dependent and ranges from 1200 mm at 500 m a s l to 1500 mm at 2000 m a s l meteoswiss 2019 3 constraints from geochemical data among the numerous physical and chemical parameters reported for groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section bucher et al 2012 the temperature ph as well as the concentrations of cl and si are particularly useful to constrain our thc simulations as described below in addition to the published chemical analyses in this study we carried out analyses of the stable isotopes of the water molecule on 30 out of the 122 groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section all these geochemical constraints contribute to establishing a conceptual model of the hydrodynamic functioning of the pre tunnel stage of the studied crystalline massif and they serve to constrain our thc model as described below 3 1 stable water isotopes stable isotopes of water expressed as δ18o and δ2h in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow were analyzed at the institute of geological sciences university of bern by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris using a picarro l2120 i cavity ring down spectrometer crds with vaporization module v1102 i coupled to an htc pal auto sampler ctc analytics post run correction of oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope measurements was conducted according to van geldern and barth 2012 the analytical error 1σ was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h based on multiple measurements of internal and iaea standards duplicate analyses agreed well within this error in contrast to the immediately conducted chemical analyses bucher et al 2012 those of the stable water isotopes was performed up to 10 years after the samples were collected during construction of the amsteg section 2003 2006 to test whether evaporation occurred during sample storage the concentrations of major cations and anions cl na and so4 2 were re measured at the institute of geological sciences university of bern by ion chromatography using a metrohm profic ancat mcs ic system the analytical uncertainty was better than 5 based on multiple measurements of high grade commercial standard solutions since evaporation was identified measured δ18o and δ2h values were corrected as described in the supporting information measured and evaporation corrected values are both listed in table s1 supporting information together with the re measured ion concentrations compared to the ion concentrations reported in bucher et al 2012 our groundwater samples showed an increase of up to 15 corresponding to the evaporated fraction of the original sample volume the corrected δ18o and δ2h values plot on the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 3 demonstrating that all groundwater samples originate from meteoric water that has infiltrated at the surface along the amsteg section δ18o and δ2h values of our groundwater samples do not show any particular spatial trend fig 2b this is likely due to the fact that they represent a homogenized i e averaged isotope signature of meteoric water infiltrated at different altitudes and different times in the past the latter is relevant because the residence time of meteoric water circulating in the aar massif is substantial and may reach several 10 k years such as demonstrated by the lack of detectable 14c in meteoric water penetrating up to 10 km deep before discharging as thermal springs below grimsel pass also located within the aar massif waber et al 2017 diamond et al 2018 thus the main constraint from stable isotope analyses for our model is that all groundwater samples discharging at the tunnel level originate from meteoric water that has infiltrated at the surface at some point in the past moreover given that our groundwater δ18o and δ2h values are well within the range of current precipitation in the aar massif e g meteorological stations grimsel and guttannen foen 2014 fig 3 infiltration has mainly occurred during times where the average climatic conditions were similar to those in the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka in turn infiltration was limited or even absent during cold temperature periods and the glacial cycles because this would have likely resulted in δ18o and δ2h values at the lower limit or even outside the range of current precipitation fig 3 this is consistent with recent hydrogeological investigations of similar crystalline massifs in france for which it was suggested that infiltration at high altitude mainly occurred during the holocene interglacial period while it was much lower during the preceding glaciation period maréchal et al 1999 thiebaud et al 2010 dzikowski et al 2016 hence the subsurface residence time of meteoric water in our model is constrained to holocene times 11 5 ka or similar interglacial periods in the past such as the eemian interglacial dated at 130 115 ka preusser et al 2011 3 2 physico chemical evolution of tunnel inflows along the amsteg section 3 2 1 saturation state of chalcedony and quartz bucher et al 2012 have suggested that for low ph tunnel inflows ph 9 the dissolved silica concentration is mainly controlled by the solubility of chalcedony whereas above ph 9 5 it is controlled by quartz calculating the saturation state of chalcedony in groundwater samples of ph 9 5 and of quartz in those of ph 9 5 using toughreact v3 xu et al 2014 in combination with the soltherm h06 database reed and palandri 2006 demonstrates that most groundwater samples are near saturation or slightly under saturated with respect to the silica controlling phase saturation index s i 0 4 to 0 1 fig 2c the only exception is observed for tunnel inflows collected beneath the only major valley along the amsteg section the maderaner valley at ca 9 km along the tunnel which show a significant supersaturation s i 0 1 with respect to chalcedony fig 2a c owing to the lower solubility of quartz this would also be the case if these samples were solubility controlled by quartz instead of chalcedony despite showing ph values below 9 5 supersaturation with respect to quartz and or chalcedony is a common feature of thermal waters and it is observed due to i the solubility decrease associated with the decrease in temperature upon ascent and cooling of thermal fluids and ii slow precipitation kinetics of quartz and chalcedony in combination with fast upflow wanner et al 2014 diamond et al 2018 thus based on the observed supersaturation there is strong geochemical evidence that the groundwater samples collected beneath the maderaner valley have experienced temperatures above the discharge temperature and hence have infiltrated into the tunnel from below fig 2a while we do not attempt to reconstruct the calculated saturation indices the upflow directed flow zone proposed to occur below the maderaner valley serves as important constraint for our model 3 2 2 cl concentration profile the cl concentration profile along the amsteg section shows a distinct peak with a maximum concentration of 1300 mg l 1 at about 10 km along the tunnel where it intersects a volcanoclastic unit called intschi zone fig 2a d the peak is located roughly 1 km south of the lowest point of the maderaner valley where the cl concentration in the groundwater is around 400 mg l 1 plotting cl concentrations against discharge temperatures fig 4 a demonstrates that groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section fall into two distinct groups with the exception of two outliers the first group consists of all samples collected up to a distance of 11 5 km along the tunnel in these samples cl and the discharge temperature are linearly correlated and include all samples forming the cl peak discussed above the second group includes the samples at a distance greater than 11 5 km along the tunnel these samples are characterized by generally low cl concentrations 200 mg l 1 that are not correlated with the discharge temperature since elevated cl concentrations such as in case of the first group 11 5 km are consistent with longer flow paths and continuous uptake of solutes from the postulated ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 bucher et al 2012 wanner et al 2017 we suggest that all groundwater samples of the first group 11 5 km have infiltrated from below although only the ones collected beneath the lowest point of the maderaner valley show evidence for temperatures above the discharge temperature based on the calculated silica phase saturation indices fig 2c for groundwater samples with low cl concentrations such as in case of the second group we suggest that they have infiltrated into the tunnel from above this is consistent with results from reactive transport modeling wanner et al 2017 showing that the composition of groundwater samples collected at about 15 km beneath the highest peak of the amsteg section the chrüzlistock and showing very low cl concentrations 3 mg l can be explained by a rather simple 1d reactive transport model considering the reaction of infiltrating meteoric water with the granitic mineralogy only wanner et al 2017 consequently these particular samples have likely infiltrated into the tunnel from above consistent with shorter residence times and essentially no uptake of cl from the postulated ancient porewater source owing to their low cl concentrations and based on the temperature vs cl plot fig 4a the same downward directed flow may apply for all groundwater samples belonging to the second group of samples 11 5 km the upflow and downflow directed flow zones identified from geochemical constraints fig 2 will serve as calibration target for our model moreover since cl likely originates from an ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 cl is used as a residence time tracer in our model and the cl concentration profile recorded along the amsteg section fig 2d will also serve as constraint for our model 3 2 3 temperature profile the temperature of the groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section closely follows the surface topography fig 2a e in fact the correlation between temperature and overburden is strongly linear and nearly perfect fig 4b taking into account the supersaturation with respect to chalcedony and quartz calculated for groundwater samples collected beneath the maderaner valley fig 2c this observation suggests that the upflow rate of the proposed upward directed flow zone is too low to generate any temperature anomaly i e temperatures above those predicted by the local geothermal gradient together with the observed tunnel inflow rates the recorded temperature profile will serve as constraint for our model 3 3 correlations in groundwater samples collected along the bristen granite groundwater samples collected where the tunnel intersects the bristen granite beneath the maderaner valley ca 9 km along the tunnel show strong linear correlations between major as well as minor solutes and cl and between δ18o and cl fig 5 such correlations are typical manifestations of binary fluid mixtures elevated cl na so4 li and br concentrations wanner et al 2017 as well as the small tunnel overburden of about 300 m fig 2a indicating elevated permeability fig 6 suggest that these groundwaters represent a binary mixture between an ascending highly mineralized fluid endmember and dilute meteoric water originating from the surface such as demonstrated for other locations within the aar massif diamond et al 2018 significant admixture of dilute meteoric water to the ascending fluid endmember is consistent with the observation that the maximum tunnel inflow rate 6 l s 1 inherited from a major water ingress of shallow water from the surface was recorded at this particular segment of the tunnel moreover it is consistent with the negative linear correlation observed between δ18o and cl fig 5c suggesting that the diluting meteoric water low cl high δ18o has infiltrated at a low altitude for instance at the bottom of the maderaner valley at about 800 m a s l in turn this correlation fig 5c implies that the ascending fluid endmember high cl low δ18o has originally infiltrated at an altitude that is above the maderaner valley before eventually discharging into the tunnel from below this results in longer residence times and more cl uptake from the proposed porewater source yielding elevated cl concentrations eventually fig 2d the cl uptake however is not accompanied by a shift of δ18o values away from the gmwl towards less negative values despite that matrix porewater collected within the aar massif as well as ancient metamorphic fluids trapped in fluid inclusions show elevated δ18o and δ2h values mullis et al 1994 schneeberger et al 2019 fig 3 compared to cl the shift in δ18o and likewise δ2h is limited because i infiltrating meteoric water has a very high h2o concentration of 55 6 mol l 1 i e h2o 1 kg l 1 at t 4 c ii the isotopic signature of infiltrating meteoric water covers a large range that does not substantially differ from the range of expected porewater fig 3 and iii the concentration gradient controlling diffusive uptake of heavy δ18o is given by the gradient of the 1h2 18o and 1h2 16o isotopologues i e same molecule but different mass which are in the per mil range per distant unit only in case of cl the low concentrations of infiltrating meteoric water μm range as well as the strong concentration gradient m range per distant unit result in a significantly higher uptake from the ancient porewater source while fully assessing the causes for the missing δ18o shift is beyond the scope of the present work its absence is consistent with analyses of mineralized thermal springs collected within the aar massif diamond et al 2018 and groundwater samples collected from the nearby gotthard highway tunnel pastorelli et al 2001 in any case the absence of observable δ18o shifts during meteoric water circulation forms an important constraint for our model the identified admixture of cold meteoric water implies that the cl and si concentrations and hence the silica supersaturation of the deep fluid endmember ascending where the tunnel intersects the bristner granite beneath the maderaner valley at about 9 km along the tunnel is actually higher than the obtained values fig 2c d thus without dilution with meteoric water possibly caused by the tunnel construction work the peak in the cl profile fig 2d might have actually occurred there and not as currently observed at about 10 km where the tunnel intersects the volcanoclastic intschi zone fig 2a the correlations identified for the bristen granite groundwaters samples however fail to match the corresponding parameters of the intschi zone fig 5 this demonstrates that the two units are not directly linked hydrologically although they both lie within the upward directed flow zone postulated to occur at a distance 11 5 km along the tunnel fig 2a the absence of a direct flow connection between the two units serves as additional constraint for our model 4 model setup our forward thermal hydraulic chemical simulations aim to assess the role of surface topography on controlling regional meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements therefore simulations were performed for a large 3d domain 20 10 9 km including the entire amsteg section of the gotthard railbase tunnel and by explicitly considering the surface topography combined with stable water isotopes 4 1 numerical model all simulations were performed using toughreact v3 xu et al 2014 a well established integral finite difference code for modeling coupled thermo hydrodynamic chemical processes in geothermal and volcanic systems e g wanner et al 2014 all simulations were performed using equation of state eos1 which simulates water and coupled heat flow in the single phase state according to the

water properties e g density specific enthalpy and viscosity from the steam table equations given by the international formulation committee 1967 4 2 model geometry along the amsteg section the surface topography is mainly shaped by the maderaner valley and the surrounding mountain peaks therefore the horizontal extent of the model was constrained by the catchment of the valley covering an area of about 20 10 km figs 1 and 7 this means that the southernmost part of the amsteg section was not simulated the upper model boundary was defined by numerically shaping an initially regular mesh with a digital elevation model dem of the area using the fit surface pytough method croucher 2015 such approach eventually created an irregular mesh with a horizontal resolution of 250 250 m the altitude of the lower model boundary was somewhat arbitrarily set to 5400 m a s l to allow fluid circulation below the tunnel the vertical extent of the grid blocks gradually increased from 150 m near the surface to a maximum extent of 600 m at altitudes below 0 m a s l yielding a total of about 82 000 grid blocks in the absence of transmissivity as well as fracture connectivity spacing and aperture data and under consideration of the large model domain 20 10 9 km the complex interconnected hydraulically active fracture network was conceptionalized as a single i e homogenously fractured rock continuum where the assigned porosity refers to the fracture porosity of the entire rock volume this means that our simulations do not explicitly distinguish between advective flow along the hydraulically active fracture network of the aar massif and the diffusive and conductive interaction with the adjacent intact rock matrix similarly since our model aims at unraveling the regional flow system the model does not explicitly include the tunnel as such the model neglects the pressure drop induced by the tunnel and simulation results refer to the pre tunnel stage of the system 4 3 simulating stable water isotopes and the continuous uptake of cl the main benefits of using a fully coupled thc simulator such as toughreact are i to include the transport of stable water isotopes in terms of a water source tracer in our simulations and ii to adopt the continuous uptake of cl from the proposed porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 the fate of the three most abundant stable water isotopologues 1h2 16o 1h2 18o 1h2h16o corresponding to a cumulative abundance of 99 9 was simulated following the approach described by singleton et al 2005 to do so 1h2 18o and 1h2h16o were defined as primary species with distinct total concentrations in addition to the 1h2 16o species used by default this allows calculating δ2h and δ18o values from the modeled 1h2h16o 1h2 16o and 1h2 18o 1h2 16o total concentration ratios rmodeled 6 δ r modeled r v smow 1 1000 where rvsmov refers to the corresponding ratios in vsmow for our simulations δ2h and δ18o values were fixed at the upper model boundary to define altitude dependent values for the infiltrating meteoric water and to use them as water source tracer in the absence of historical rainwater data the actual δ18o values were constrained by the long term δ18o monitoring of current rainwater collected along the nearby grimsel transect yielding an average value of 13 25 at 1980 m a s l i e at the grimsel station and an altitude effect on δ18o of 0 2 per 100 m elevation gain schotterer et al 2010 the corresponding δ2h values were defined by assuming that they lie on the gmwl i e δ2h 8 δ18o 10 schotterer et al 2010 which is consistent with our stable water isotope analyses fig 3 except for the upper model boundary δ18o and δ2h values were initially set to arbitrary values of 10 and 70 respectively table 1 since the model was defined as a single fractured rock continuum the uptake of cl from the proposed ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 to the initially cl free meteoric water was abstracted by specifying the kinetic release of na and cl from a generic solid nacl source nacl s na cl with a fixed dissolution rate of 3 10 14 mol kgh2o 1 s 1 0 03 mg kgh2o 1 a 1 this rate was numerically estimated by approximating the cl concentration profile observed along the amsteg section fig 2d the calibrated rate agrees well with fracture area normalized cl uptake rates of 0 07 0 12 mg m 2 a 1 estimated for groundwater circulating in the granitic basement in the region of laxemar sweden waber et al 2012 in waber et al 2012 the uptake of cl from such porewater source was associated with a shift of δ18o and δ2h values away from the gmwl towards higher values which was not observed for our samples fig 3 therefore the uptake of water with significantly less negative δ18o and δ2h values than meteoric water from the proposed porewater source was neglected in our model 4 4 initial and boundary conditions at the upper model boundary the temperature and pressure were prescribed to 1 bar and 4 c respectively in doing so we neglect the unsaturated zone and assume that the entire basement is fully saturated which means that the water table is constrained by the topographic surface and that infiltration and exfiltration is allowed through the entire upper model boundary multiple studies have shown that this approximation is valid for the simulation of regional flow problems in orogenic crystalline settings tiedeman et al 1998 bossong et al 2003 caine et al 2006 taillefer et al 2018 for our study it is particularly justified by the lack of detailed information on the local water table and the rather large vertical model extent 9 km for which the regional flow field is only weakly affected by the extent of the unsaturated zone by allowing the flux of meteoric water through the upper model boundary during the entire course of our simulations we assume i that the hüfi glacier located 3200 m a s l in the n e part of the model domain fig 1 represents a hydrological active warm based glacier and ii that the meteoric water infiltration rate during past glaciation periods remained constant while assumption i is justified given that in the alps evidence for hydraulically active warm based glaciers up to an altitude of 2600 m a s l has been reported even during the last glacial maximum 18 ka ago when the mean annual temperature was 12 3 c lower than today peyron et al 1998 wirsig et al 2016 ii represent an important model simplification of which the implications will be discussed together with the model results initially a hydrostatic pressure distribution and a typical regional conductive geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 vernon et al 2008 were defined throughout the model domain fig 7 the lateral and lower model boundaries were defined as no flux boundaries with respect to fluid flow whereas the lateral boundaries were defined as no flux boundaries for heat transport as well the definition of the later model boundaries as no flux boundaries is justified by the absence of heat sources other than the one responsible for the regional geothermal gradient and because cross catchment flow i e across the horizontal boundaries is likely negligible across the lower model boundary conductive heat transport was allowed by fixing the temperature to 186 c which is consistent with the mean surface altitude of 1850 m a s l within the model domain and a geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 the permeability of the fractured rock continuum k was defined as a function of depth according to the relation derived from hydraulic tests performed in similar settings worldwide stober and bucher 2007 stober and bucher 2015 7 log k 1 38 log z 15 4 where z refers to the depth km below the surface and k is the intrinsic vertical permeability m2 fig 6 shows that this relation is able to match the permeability recorded along the nearby sedrun section of the tunnel masset and loew 2013 to account for the steeply dipping units fig 2a and nearly vertical fracture systems suggesting that flow is directed vertically a permeability anisotropy factor of 10 was considered between horizontal and vertical direction with higher values associated with the orientation of factures consequently the specified permeability in x and y direction was 10 times lower than the one defined by equation 7 in analogy to the permeability the porosity was also specified as a function of depth in the absence of any information on the porosity permeability relationship our simulations consider a linear fracture porosity decrease with depth fig 6 the maximum and minimum values 2 1 and 0 1 were taken from hg porosity measurements performed on gneisses and granites of a water conducting shear zone exposed in the nearby grimsel test site bossart and mazurek 1991 other physical and thermal properties e g density thermal conductivity were defined according to measurements performed in the nearby grimsel test site keusen et al 1989 kuhlman and gaus 2014 all model parameter are listed in table 1 initial and boundary conditions for simulating the fate of cl and stable water isotopes were defined as described above in detail and the corresponding values are listed in table 1 5 model results and discussion 5 1 general flow system selected results for the full model domain are shown in figs 8 and 9 computed average linear vertical flow velocities fig 8a demonstrate that meteoric water infiltration occurs at high altitude vz 0 lower limit of color scale whereas upward directed flow zones are found beneath major valleys such as the maderaner valley vz 0 the temporal evolution of δ18o values displays plumes of water with low δ18o values originating from the infiltration at high altitude fig 9 these plumes reach the lower model boundary 5 4 km a s l after a few 10 k years and then migrate laterally before ascending towards the surface of major valleys where they yield isotopically light values as well because our model considers continuous uptake of cl along flow paths these regional circulation systems are also expressed by the simulated cl concentration distribution at chemical steady state fig 8b which is achieved after about 150 ka during the course of the simulation fig 10 downward directed flow is indicated by the increase of cl along the flow path towards greater depth fig 8b in turn upward directed flow below major valleys is manifested by elevated cl concentrations indicating maximum residence times despite the infiltration of cold water at the surface t 4 c and the upflow of heated water from the lower model boundary t 186 c these flow zones only yield minor temperature anomalies compared to the initially specified conductive temperature distribution fig 8 vs fig 7 this is because flow velocities and hence water fluxes are rather small and heat transport is dominated by conduction rather than by advection below the maderaner valley for instance the computed upflow velocity is about 2 m year 1 whereas the model predicts a downflow velocity below the chrüzlistock of less than 0 5 m year 1 fig 2f 5 2 model results vs geochemical constraints the comparison between parameter profiles observed along the amsteg section of the tunnel and the corresponding simulation results is given in fig 2 despite that the tunnel was not explicitly considered in our model the agreement is quite good first our model predicts positive z velocities and thus ascending water up to a distance of about 12 5 km along the tunnel and negative z velocities indicating downflow for the remainder of the amsteg section fig 2f these flow zones are consistent with the interpretation of the spatial distribution of the silica phase saturation state fig 2c the cl concentrations fig 2d and the cl vs temperature correlation observed in groundwater exfiltrating into the tunnel fig 4a although the computed upflow zone extends up to 12 5 along the tunnel while fig 4a suggests that the first i e ascending group of groundwater samples extends up to 11 5 km only the maximum upflow velocity was computed for the segment where the tunnel crosscuts the bristen granite beneath the maderaner valley at ca 9 km fig 2f this is the only segment along the tunnel where the collected groundwater was supersaturated with respect to quartz and chalcedony fig 2c which is indicative of an ascending fluid wanner et al 2014 the simulated coupled thermal hydraulic processes further yield a temperature profile that matches the observed profile within reasonable uncertainty fig 2e the total flux of ascending water computed for the entire bristen granite segment was 0 008 l s 1 which is ca 850 times lower than the total discharge recorded along this particular segment 6 97 l s 1 because the tunnel was not explicitly considered in our model however it is challenging to directly compare computed flow rates to those measured in the tunnel the strong discrepancy is likely related to the facts that the construction of the tunnel induced a strong pressure drop of likely more than 100 bar masset and loew 2013 and that with the chosen model setup e g discretization resolution not considering the tunnel shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface is not fully captured by the model second the model is capable of reconstructing the shape of the observed cl concentration profile fig 2d although it over and underestimates the cl concentration along the bristen granite and the intschi zone respectively in analogy to the flow rate discrepancy the overestimation of the cl concentration along the bristen granite at ca 9 km is due to the fact that shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface as identified from the corresponding correlations fig 5 is not fully captured with the chosen model setup in contrast the underestimation along the intschi zone at ca 10 km along the tunnel is likely due to a different chemical composition of the porewater in the differently composed lithologies which was not considered by the model differences in the composition of the porewater serving as an important cl source is suggested by the lack of correlations between groundwater samples from the bristen granite and the intschi zone fig 5 the model is consistent with such explanation in the sense that the computed origin of meteoric water discharging along the bristner granite and the intschi zone strongly differs computed streamlines fig 11 suggest that groundwater discharging along the bristen granite originates to the south west near the bristen peak whereas groundwater samples ascending beneath the intschi zone originate to the south east in the vicinity of the chrüzlistock third the simulated δ18o values along the amsteg section fall within the range observed for groundwater samples fig 2b although simulations yield smaller δ18o variations along the tunnel and a slightly lower mean δ18o value 14 6 vs 13 9 this is because i with the chosen model setup shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface is not fully captured by the model and ii the δ18o and δ2h values assigned to infiltrating meteoric water were kept constant at the modern altitude dependent rainwater values schotterer et al 2010 the fact that our model is able to approximate the δ18o profile observed at the tunnel level confirms that infiltration of meteoric water must have mainly occurred at a period of time with climatic conditions similar to those of the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka 5 3 timing of meteoric water infiltration along the tunnel the mean residence times inferred from the simulated steady state cl concentration profile and the specified constant cl uptake rate of 3 10 14 mol kgh2o 1 s 1 taverage cl cluptake rate range from 3000 years below the chrüzlistock to about 28 000 years beneath the maderaner valley fig 2d since groundwater at the tunnel level represent mixtures of different flow paths the actual travel time of a single water molecule or dissolved species can be much higher such as inferred from the cl breakthrough curves computed for these two locations fig 10 for the upward directed flow zone below the maderaner valley the cl breakthrough curve fig 10b demonstrates that it takes more than 100 k years of simulation time until meteoric water that has infiltrated near the bristen peak reaches the tunnel level after having penetrated down to several kilometers below the tunnel fig 11 in contrast beneath the chrüzlistock computed cl breakthrough curves fig 10a are consistent with the average residence times inferred from the cl concentration profile fig 2d suggesting that meteoric water reaches the tunnel level after about 3000 years it should be noted however that these travel times represent rough estimations only this is because they are proportional to the poorly constrained porosity and permeability distribution fig 6 and because the infiltration rate of meteoric water was likely reduced during the last glaciation period and was certainly not constant over the past 150 ka such as assumed for our simulations nevertheless since our model predicts travel times much less than 10 ka for groundwater samples collected along the postulated downward directed flow zone beneath the chrüzlistock fig 10a it is evident that they must have infiltrated into the aar massif during the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka in contrast travel times much longer than 10 ka obtained for groundwater samples collected along the postulated upward directed flow zone below the maderaner valley fig 10b implies that these samples must have mostly infiltrated during similar but past climatic periods possible candidates are the eemian 115 130 ka or the meikirch interglacial 200 185 ka of which the former is surprisingly consistent with the computed breakthrough curve 6 implication for the circulation of meteoric water in orogenic crystalline basements despite the comparatively simple nature of our model and the absence of any calibration work in addition to estimating the cl uptake rate the model is able to reasonably match all constraints identified from the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section fig 2 we consider this result as a strong quantitative confirmation that mountain topography operates as the most important driving force for meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements our simulations also confirm that in such settings meteoric water can easily penetrate down to several kilometer depth into the brittle continental crust for the simulated domain the topographic driving force is large enough for meteoric water to penetrate down to a depth of 9 km below the surface where the background permeability estimated for granitic basement rocks is less than 3 10 17 m2 fig 6 accordingly penetration down to several kilometer depth does not seem to be restricted by the presence of major fault zones with elevated permeability similarly the topographic driving force was sufficient to push the infiltrated meteoric water horizontally before it ascends beneath major valleys despite that the specified horizontal permeability was one order of magnitude lower than the vertical one 3 10 18 m2 at 9 km depth this means that topography driven flow can be sustained at a low horizontal permeability and does not necessary rely on regional fault zones in terms of practical applications our simulations are in agreement with recent studies showing that in orogenic crystalline basements thermal anomalies predominantly occur where major fault zones with permeabilities significantly above the background values considered in our model are exposed at valley floors taillefer et al 2018 wanner et al 2019 this is because for such settings the combination of hydraulic and structural driving forces is optimal thus such settings represent ideal targets for the exploitation of orogenic geothermal systems such as proposed recently wanner et al 2019 in the central alps promising examples are found within fault hosted settings of the western part of the aar massif at brigerbad and of the aiguilles rouges massif at lavey les bains sonney and vuataz 2009 valla et al 2016 both sites are i located at the valley floor of the rhone valley ii characterized by the occurrence of thermal springs discharging at temperatures up to 65 c and iii currently used as thermal spas moreover pastorelli et al 2001 have shown that thermal anomalies also occur in the gotthard region such as in the nearby highway tunnel and in an adjacent 500 m deep exploration borehole 28 c in 450 m depth interestingly these anomalies are also found beneath a major valley about 3 km south of the town of andermatt hence they are fully consistent with our model results and further demonstrate that orogenic geothermal systems are promising plays for geothermal power production finally our simulations confirm that circulation of meteoric water in orogenic crystalline basements is slow and that significant infiltration of meteoric water may have occurred during past interglacial periods dating back more than 100 ka this reinforces that groundwater and or porewater in crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations waber et al 2012 in terms of groundwater resources the low tunnel inflow rate computed for the most prominent upward directed flow zone beneath the maderaner valley 0 008 l s 1 suggest that deep circulation of meteoric water does not play a major role on the regional water cycle at least under the prevailing alpine climatic conditions with atmospheric precipitation well above 1000 mm year 1 meteoswiss 2019 however for drier climatic conditions such as on the tibet plateau with annual precipitation rates below 200 mm year 1 such rates might be significant for sustaining river baseflow and spring discharge ge et al 2008 7 summary and conclusions detailed knowledge about the circulation of meteoric water in non magmatic orogenic belts is fundamental for assessing the potential of such settings for geothermal power production wanner et al 2019 as well as their use as potential groundwater resources ge et al 2008 to get more general insight into such regional hydrogeological processes and to particularly test the hypothesis that mountain topography operates as a first order driving force for meteoric water circulation we have conducted regional 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical simulations of meteoric water circulation in the orogenic crystalline basement of the aar massif in the central alps switzerland in the absence of detailed hydraulic and structural data the simulations were constrained by 122 chemical analyses of groundwater samples collected during drilling of the world s longest and deepest tunnel the gotthard railbase tunnel explicitly considering the surface topography in combination with a previously published depth dependent permeability distribution for fractured crystalline rocks in our model was sufficient to reproduce key features of the chemical analyses e g salinity and temperature distribution and up and downward directed flow zones inferred from geochemical constraints to do so the only parameter that had to be calibrated in the model was the cl uptake rate along the flow path performing additional stable water isotope measurements and including their fate in the numerical simulations allowed gaining further insights into the timing of meteoric water infiltration and subsequent circulation the main conclusions of this study are despite the lack of detailed structural and hydraulic data 3d thermal hydraulic chemical simulations constrained by geochemical data allows assessing regional and long term topography driven flow in orogenic crystalline basements simulation results quantitatively confirm that the surface topography indeed operates as a very strong driving force for meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements owing to the induced hydraulic head gradient meteoric water infiltration occurs at high altitude whereas upward directed flow zones i e exfiltration are found along major valleys down to 9 km depth penetration of meteoric water is not limited by the decrease in permeability typical of granitic basement rocks suggesting that advective fluid transport down to the brittle ductile transition zone is likely occurring in such systems without the occurrence of permeability anomalies i e major fault zones however the permeability and hence the flow rates are too low for the formation of major thermal anomalies despite that in case of the studied system meteoric water may attain temperatures well above 150 c during such deep infiltration based on the upward directed flow zones predicted along major valleys our simulations suggest that positive temperature anomalies do occur if fluid upflow is promoted by the presence of major faults zones with elevated permeability within the aar and other crystalline alpine massifs such conditions are found frequently as manifested by the occurrence of multiple hot springs currently used as thermal spas thus we consider orogenic geothermal systems as promising plays for geothermal power production due to the low permeability circulation of meteoric water is slow 2 m year 1 and average groundwater residence times may strongly exceed the time period of the current interglacial stage 11 5 ka this further underlines that groundwater and or porewater in orogenic crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations during past interglacial

5871,detailed knowledge about the circulation of meteoric water in non magmatic orogenic belts is fundamental for assessing the potential of such settings for geothermal power production as well as their use as potential groundwater resources to get more general insight into these hydrological processes we have conducted regional 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical thc simulations of meteoric water circulation in the orogenic crystalline basement of the aar massif in the central alps switzerland model results were compared to numerous geochemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater discharging into the longest and deepest tunnel of the world the gotthard railbase tunnel located within the model domain explicitly considering the surface topography in our model was sufficient to reproduce all key characteristics of the tunnel inflows salinity temperature δ18o values and up and downward directed flow zones inferred from geochemical constraints this quantitatively confirms that surface topography operates as the governing control on fluid flow in orogenic crystalline basements with meteoric water infiltration occurring at high altitude and resulting upward directed flow zones along major valleys owing to low flow rates below 2 m year 1 computed residence times of the longest flow paths were above 100 k years confirming that groundwater and or porewater in orogenic crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations moreover simulation results show that down to the lower model boundary at 9 km depth penetration of meteoric water is not limited by the decrease in permeability with depth that is typically observed in granitic rocks this suggests that advective fluid transport in orogenic crystalline basements may reach the brittle ductile transition zone and that infiltrating meteoric water can attain temperatures well above 150 c we conclude that orogenic geothermal systems are promising plays for geothermal power production

ago recognized as key driver for meteoric water circulation in non magmatic orogenic belts e g hubbert 1940 forster and smith 1988 ge et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 direct observations linking downward and upward directed flow zones are still sparse on the one hand numerous studies have described the ascent of meteoric water along deep reaching faults i e along permeability anomalies based on the occurrence of thermal springs and their chemical and isotopic composition examples include sites in the canadian rocky mountains grasby et al 2016 the southern alps of new zealand reyes et al 2010 the central european alps pfeifer et al 1992 sonney and vuataz 2008 diamond et al 2018 the black forest stober et al 1999 stober and bucher 2015 the pyrenees taillefer et al 2018 the himalayas craw et al 2005 and locations in china bucher et al 2009 stober et al 2016 other manifestations of ascending fluids include fossil hydrothermal breccias hofmann et al 2004 and positive temperature anomalies i e above those predicted by the local geothermal gradient recorded along tunnels and boreholes pastorelli et al 2001 valla et al 2016 on the other hand shallow 2 km infiltration of meteoric water into crystalline rocks is evidenced by the occasional occurrence of large inflows 100 l s 1 of cold meteoric water into highway or railway tunnels associated with negative temperature anomalies hunziker et al 1990 maréchal et al 1999 pastorelli et al 2001 the maximum penetration of meteoric water however is still under debate and suggested depths range from 5 to 23 km diamond et al 2018 and references therein the rheology of the continental crust changes with increasing depth from brittle to ductile deformation behavior below the brittle ductile transition zone located in a depth of about 12 14 km at a typical crustal geothermal gradient of 25 30 c km 1 wintsch et al 1995 stober and bucher 2007 darcy flow is not possible stober and bucher 2015 and other transport mechanisms are responsible for fluid transfer through the ductile crust connolly and podladchikov 2015 thus the studies reporting the greatest depths invoke penetration of meteoric water below the brittle ductile transition zone wickham et al 1993 cartwright and buick 1999 the large range in postulated penetration depths however may also be inherited from a variation in methodology ranging from stable water isotope analyses of minerals and fluid inclusions in hydrothermal rocks to solute geothermometry and geochemical modeling applied to thermal springs and does not necessary imply penetration below the brittle ductile transition zone see diamond et al 2018 and references therein in any case it reflects the limited knowledge about structural controls on meteoric water infiltration into crystalline basements and on how infiltration zones are actually connected to deep reaching fault zones along which meteoric water can again reach the surface and discharge as thermal springs eventually belgrano et al 2016 this forms a particular challenge for assessing orogenic crystalline basements as potential groundwater resources ge et al 2008 and for evaluating their potential for geothermal power production wanner et al 2019 here we present results from regional 3d 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical thc simulations of fluid flow in the aar massif in the central alps switzerland the study area constitutes an ideal site to get more insight into regional hydrogeological processes in orogenic crystalline basements because i numerous chemical and isotopic analyses of water inflows along the world s longest and deepest tunnel the gotthard railbase tunnel bucher et al 2012 provide a unique opportunity to study such processes ii the area includes both major valleys as well as mountain peaks which appear to correlate with distinct upward and downward directed flow zones at the tunnel level and iii major i e regional structural and thermal anomalies are absent to overcome the shortage of hydraulic measurements in this regional system we use the available chemical and isotopic data to constrain our model and to quantitatively evaluate whether mountain topography indeed operates as the first order driving force for regional meteoric water circulation 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the 57 km long gotthard rail base tunnel crosses the central alps at a base level of ca 500 m a s l the construction was simultaneously carried out in five individual sections which was enabled by drilling vertical access shafts our study exclusively deals with the amsteg section of the tunnel corresponding to a 11 5 km long section in the northern part of the tunnel fig 1 because only for this tunnel section groundwater inflows were systemically sampled with a high spatial resolution during construction the construction took place between 2003 and 2006 using a 400 m long tunnel boring machine the geology and hydrogeology along the amsteg section of the tunnel have been previously described in detail and are summarized in the following the section crosscuts the crystalline basement of the aar massif which represents a major ne sw striking complex of the variscan basement 120 20 km in size the aar massif was overprinted by alpine greenshist type metamorphism and associated deformation abrecht 1994 schaltegger 1994 labhart 1999 the different geological units exposed along the amsteg section are made of granites gneisses and volcanic rocks e g metarhyolites bucher et al 2012 mineralogically these rocks have similar compositions and are dominated by quartz albite k feldspar and chlorite minor amounts of biotite and muscovite and accessory pyrite and calcite bucher et al 2012 the thickness of the rock column above the tunnel is between 300 and 2200 m fig 2 north south compression during the alpine orogeny resulted in steeply dipping geological units and e w trending foliation steck and hunziker 1994 brittle deformation caused by exhumation of the aar massif and subsequent cooling formed shear fractures and joint systems choukroune and gapais 1983 laws et al 2003 high deformation zones currently strike parallel to the geological units and steeply dip to the s or n laws et al 2003 thus the tunnel crosscuts the steeply dipping units and the nearly vertical fracture system at an angle close to 90 fig 2 based on a hydraulic test performed in a zone with major water inflows in the nearby sedrun section of the tunnel fig 1 the hydraulic conductivity in such highly deformed zones may be as high as 10 6 m s 1 bucher et al 2012 in contrast the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity across the entire sedrun section ranges from 3 to 6 10 9 m s 1 masset and loew 2013 during drilling of the amsteg section 122 groundwater samples were collected from water conducting fractures before these were permanently sealed with concrete owing to the induced pressure drop the water inflow rate from individual fractures ranged from 0 0004 to 6 l s 1 full chemical analyses were performed on all 122 groundwater samples with the results being reported in bucher et al 2012 groundwater from the various inflows range from freshwater to strongly mineralized water tds 171 3231 mg l 1 their chemical composition varies from the general na co3 and na so4 chemical types up to about 700 mg l 1 total mineralization to the general na cl chemical type at elevated mineralization 700 mg l 1 all samples are characterized by an alkaline ph ranging from 8 3 to 10 4 in their chemical characteristics the groundwater samples from the gotthard railway tunnel thus resemble many other crystalline groundwaters of similar total mineralization e g nordstrom et al 1989 pearson et al 1991 waber et al 2017 schneeberger et al 2019 the chemical composition is inherited from water rock interaction reactions between infiltrating meteoric water and the granitic mineralogy of the crystalline basement beside such advective reactive transport along interconnected fracture networks i e the fracture porosity there are strong indications for a diffusive uptake of mainly cl na so4 li and br from porewater present in the intact non fractured and low permeable rock matrix i e the matrix porosity this porewater presumably constitutes a remnant of a hydrothermal fluid that evolved during alpine metamorphism seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 the important role of matrix porewater on the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater in crystalline settings originates from strong concentration gradients between fracture groundwater and matrix porewater that are continuously balanced by mainly diffusion over time waber et al 2012 the surface hydrology above the amsteg section of the tunnel is controlled by the catchment of the maderaner valley including the etzli side valley fig 1 at the town of amsteg the two valleys drain into the reuss a major alpine river in switzerland at an average annual discharge of 9 m3 s 1 foen 2015 the average annual precipitation rate in the catchment is altitude dependent and ranges from 1200 mm at 500 m a s l to 1500 mm at 2000 m a s l meteoswiss 2019 3 constraints from geochemical data among the numerous physical and chemical parameters reported for groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section bucher et al 2012 the temperature ph as well as the concentrations of cl and si are particularly useful to constrain our thc simulations as described below in addition to the published chemical analyses in this study we carried out analyses of the stable isotopes of the water molecule on 30 out of the 122 groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section all these geochemical constraints contribute to establishing a conceptual model of the hydrodynamic functioning of the pre tunnel stage of the studied crystalline massif and they serve to constrain our thc model as described below 3 1 stable water isotopes stable isotopes of water expressed as δ18o and δ2h in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow were analyzed at the institute of geological sciences university of bern by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris using a picarro l2120 i cavity ring down spectrometer crds with vaporization module v1102 i coupled to an htc pal auto sampler ctc analytics post run correction of oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope measurements was conducted according to van geldern and barth 2012 the analytical error 1σ was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h based on multiple measurements of internal and iaea standards duplicate analyses agreed well within this error in contrast to the immediately conducted chemical analyses bucher et al 2012 those of the stable water isotopes was performed up to 10 years after the samples were collected during construction of the amsteg section 2003 2006 to test whether evaporation occurred during sample storage the concentrations of major cations and anions cl na and so4 2 were re measured at the institute of geological sciences university of bern by ion chromatography using a metrohm profic ancat mcs ic system the analytical uncertainty was better than 5 based on multiple measurements of high grade commercial standard solutions since evaporation was identified measured δ18o and δ2h values were corrected as described in the supporting information measured and evaporation corrected values are both listed in table s1 supporting information together with the re measured ion concentrations compared to the ion concentrations reported in bucher et al 2012 our groundwater samples showed an increase of up to 15 corresponding to the evaporated fraction of the original sample volume the corrected δ18o and δ2h values plot on the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 3 demonstrating that all groundwater samples originate from meteoric water that has infiltrated at the surface along the amsteg section δ18o and δ2h values of our groundwater samples do not show any particular spatial trend fig 2b this is likely due to the fact that they represent a homogenized i e averaged isotope signature of meteoric water infiltrated at different altitudes and different times in the past the latter is relevant because the residence time of meteoric water circulating in the aar massif is substantial and may reach several 10 k years such as demonstrated by the lack of detectable 14c in meteoric water penetrating up to 10 km deep before discharging as thermal springs below grimsel pass also located within the aar massif waber et al 2017 diamond et al 2018 thus the main constraint from stable isotope analyses for our model is that all groundwater samples discharging at the tunnel level originate from meteoric water that has infiltrated at the surface at some point in the past moreover given that our groundwater δ18o and δ2h values are well within the range of current precipitation in the aar massif e g meteorological stations grimsel and guttannen foen 2014 fig 3 infiltration has mainly occurred during times where the average climatic conditions were similar to those in the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka in turn infiltration was limited or even absent during cold temperature periods and the glacial cycles because this would have likely resulted in δ18o and δ2h values at the lower limit or even outside the range of current precipitation fig 3 this is consistent with recent hydrogeological investigations of similar crystalline massifs in france for which it was suggested that infiltration at high altitude mainly occurred during the holocene interglacial period while it was much lower during the preceding glaciation period maréchal et al 1999 thiebaud et al 2010 dzikowski et al 2016 hence the subsurface residence time of meteoric water in our model is constrained to holocene times 11 5 ka or similar interglacial periods in the past such as the eemian interglacial dated at 130 115 ka preusser et al 2011 3 2 physico chemical evolution of tunnel inflows along the amsteg section 3 2 1 saturation state of chalcedony and quartz bucher et al 2012 have suggested that for low ph tunnel inflows ph 9 the dissolved silica concentration is mainly controlled by the solubility of chalcedony whereas above ph 9 5 it is controlled by quartz calculating the saturation state of chalcedony in groundwater samples of ph 9 5 and of quartz in those of ph 9 5 using toughreact v3 xu et al 2014 in combination with the soltherm h06 database reed and palandri 2006 demonstrates that most groundwater samples are near saturation or slightly under saturated with respect to the silica controlling phase saturation index s i 0 4 to 0 1 fig 2c the only exception is observed for tunnel inflows collected beneath the only major valley along the amsteg section the maderaner valley at ca 9 km along the tunnel which show a significant supersaturation s i 0 1 with respect to chalcedony fig 2a c owing to the lower solubility of quartz this would also be the case if these samples were solubility controlled by quartz instead of chalcedony despite showing ph values below 9 5 supersaturation with respect to quartz and or chalcedony is a common feature of thermal waters and it is observed due to i the solubility decrease associated with the decrease in temperature upon ascent and cooling of thermal fluids and ii slow precipitation kinetics of quartz and chalcedony in combination with fast upflow wanner et al 2014 diamond et al 2018 thus based on the observed supersaturation there is strong geochemical evidence that the groundwater samples collected beneath the maderaner valley have experienced temperatures above the discharge temperature and hence have infiltrated into the tunnel from below fig 2a while we do not attempt to reconstruct the calculated saturation indices the upflow directed flow zone proposed to occur below the maderaner valley serves as important constraint for our model 3 2 2 cl concentration profile the cl concentration profile along the amsteg section shows a distinct peak with a maximum concentration of 1300 mg l 1 at about 10 km along the tunnel where it intersects a volcanoclastic unit called intschi zone fig 2a d the peak is located roughly 1 km south of the lowest point of the maderaner valley where the cl concentration in the groundwater is around 400 mg l 1 plotting cl concentrations against discharge temperatures fig 4 a demonstrates that groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section fall into two distinct groups with the exception of two outliers the first group consists of all samples collected up to a distance of 11 5 km along the tunnel in these samples cl and the discharge temperature are linearly correlated and include all samples forming the cl peak discussed above the second group includes the samples at a distance greater than 11 5 km along the tunnel these samples are characterized by generally low cl concentrations 200 mg l 1 that are not correlated with the discharge temperature since elevated cl concentrations such as in case of the first group 11 5 km are consistent with longer flow paths and continuous uptake of solutes from the postulated ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 bucher et al 2012 wanner et al 2017 we suggest that all groundwater samples of the first group 11 5 km have infiltrated from below although only the ones collected beneath the lowest point of the maderaner valley show evidence for temperatures above the discharge temperature based on the calculated silica phase saturation indices fig 2c for groundwater samples with low cl concentrations such as in case of the second group we suggest that they have infiltrated into the tunnel from above this is consistent with results from reactive transport modeling wanner et al 2017 showing that the composition of groundwater samples collected at about 15 km beneath the highest peak of the amsteg section the chrüzlistock and showing very low cl concentrations 3 mg l can be explained by a rather simple 1d reactive transport model considering the reaction of infiltrating meteoric water with the granitic mineralogy only wanner et al 2017 consequently these particular samples have likely infiltrated into the tunnel from above consistent with shorter residence times and essentially no uptake of cl from the postulated ancient porewater source owing to their low cl concentrations and based on the temperature vs cl plot fig 4a the same downward directed flow may apply for all groundwater samples belonging to the second group of samples 11 5 km the upflow and downflow directed flow zones identified from geochemical constraints fig 2 will serve as calibration target for our model moreover since cl likely originates from an ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 cl is used as a residence time tracer in our model and the cl concentration profile recorded along the amsteg section fig 2d will also serve as constraint for our model 3 2 3 temperature profile the temperature of the groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section closely follows the surface topography fig 2a e in fact the correlation between temperature and overburden is strongly linear and nearly perfect fig 4b taking into account the supersaturation with respect to chalcedony and quartz calculated for groundwater samples collected beneath the maderaner valley fig 2c this observation suggests that the upflow rate of the proposed upward directed flow zone is too low to generate any temperature anomaly i e temperatures above those predicted by the local geothermal gradient together with the observed tunnel inflow rates the recorded temperature profile will serve as constraint for our model 3 3 correlations in groundwater samples collected along the bristen granite groundwater samples collected where the tunnel intersects the bristen granite beneath the maderaner valley ca 9 km along the tunnel show strong linear correlations between major as well as minor solutes and cl and between δ18o and cl fig 5 such correlations are typical manifestations of binary fluid mixtures elevated cl na so4 li and br concentrations wanner et al 2017 as well as the small tunnel overburden of about 300 m fig 2a indicating elevated permeability fig 6 suggest that these groundwaters represent a binary mixture between an ascending highly mineralized fluid endmember and dilute meteoric water originating from the surface such as demonstrated for other locations within the aar massif diamond et al 2018 significant admixture of dilute meteoric water to the ascending fluid endmember is consistent with the observation that the maximum tunnel inflow rate 6 l s 1 inherited from a major water ingress of shallow water from the surface was recorded at this particular segment of the tunnel moreover it is consistent with the negative linear correlation observed between δ18o and cl fig 5c suggesting that the diluting meteoric water low cl high δ18o has infiltrated at a low altitude for instance at the bottom of the maderaner valley at about 800 m a s l in turn this correlation fig 5c implies that the ascending fluid endmember high cl low δ18o has originally infiltrated at an altitude that is above the maderaner valley before eventually discharging into the tunnel from below this results in longer residence times and more cl uptake from the proposed porewater source yielding elevated cl concentrations eventually fig 2d the cl uptake however is not accompanied by a shift of δ18o values away from the gmwl towards less negative values despite that matrix porewater collected within the aar massif as well as ancient metamorphic fluids trapped in fluid inclusions show elevated δ18o and δ2h values mullis et al 1994 schneeberger et al 2019 fig 3 compared to cl the shift in δ18o and likewise δ2h is limited because i infiltrating meteoric water has a very high h2o concentration of 55 6 mol l 1 i e h2o 1 kg l 1 at t 4 c ii the isotopic signature of infiltrating meteoric water covers a large range that does not substantially differ from the range of expected porewater fig 3 and iii the concentration gradient controlling diffusive uptake of heavy δ18o is given by the gradient of the 1h2 18o and 1h2 16o isotopologues i e same molecule but different mass which are in the per mil range per distant unit only in case of cl the low concentrations of infiltrating meteoric water μm range as well as the strong concentration gradient m range per distant unit result in a significantly higher uptake from the ancient porewater source while fully assessing the causes for the missing δ18o shift is beyond the scope of the present work its absence is consistent with analyses of mineralized thermal springs collected within the aar massif diamond et al 2018 and groundwater samples collected from the nearby gotthard highway tunnel pastorelli et al 2001 in any case the absence of observable δ18o shifts during meteoric water circulation forms an important constraint for our model the identified admixture of cold meteoric water implies that the cl and si concentrations and hence the silica supersaturation of the deep fluid endmember ascending where the tunnel intersects the bristner granite beneath the maderaner valley at about 9 km along the tunnel is actually higher than the obtained values fig 2c d thus without dilution with meteoric water possibly caused by the tunnel construction work the peak in the cl profile fig 2d might have actually occurred there and not as currently observed at about 10 km where the tunnel intersects the volcanoclastic intschi zone fig 2a the correlations identified for the bristen granite groundwaters samples however fail to match the corresponding parameters of the intschi zone fig 5 this demonstrates that the two units are not directly linked hydrologically although they both lie within the upward directed flow zone postulated to occur at a distance 11 5 km along the tunnel fig 2a the absence of a direct flow connection between the two units serves as additional constraint for our model 4 model setup our forward thermal hydraulic chemical simulations aim to assess the role of surface topography on controlling regional meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements therefore simulations were performed for a large 3d domain 20 10 9 km including the entire amsteg section of the gotthard railbase tunnel and by explicitly considering the surface topography combined with stable water isotopes 4 1 numerical model all simulations were performed using toughreact v3 xu et al 2014 a well established integral finite difference code for modeling coupled thermo hydrodynamic chemical processes in geothermal and volcanic systems e g wanner et al 2014 all simulations were performed using equation of state eos1 which simulates water and coupled heat flow in the single phase state according to the mass balance equation 1 m w h t f w h q w h where mw h is the accumulation term for water mw kg m 3 or heat mh j m 3 qw h are water or heat sinks or sources and fw h refers to the water flux fw kg m 2

water properties e g density specific enthalpy and viscosity from the steam table equations given by the international formulation committee 1967 4 2 model geometry along the amsteg section the surface topography is mainly shaped by the maderaner valley and the surrounding mountain peaks therefore the horizontal extent of the model was constrained by the catchment of the valley covering an area of about 20 10 km figs 1 and 7 this means that the southernmost part of the amsteg section was not simulated the upper model boundary was defined by numerically shaping an initially regular mesh with a digital elevation model dem of the area using the fit surface pytough method croucher 2015 such approach eventually created an irregular mesh with a horizontal resolution of 250 250 m the altitude of the lower model boundary was somewhat arbitrarily set to 5400 m a s l to allow fluid circulation below the tunnel the vertical extent of the grid blocks gradually increased from 150 m near the surface to a maximum extent of 600 m at altitudes below 0 m a s l yielding a total of about 82 000 grid blocks in the absence of transmissivity as well as fracture connectivity spacing and aperture data and under consideration of the large model domain 20 10 9 km the complex interconnected hydraulically active fracture network was conceptionalized as a single i e homogenously fractured rock continuum where the assigned porosity refers to the fracture porosity of the entire rock volume this means that our simulations do not explicitly distinguish between advective flow along the hydraulically active fracture network of the aar massif and the diffusive and conductive interaction with the adjacent intact rock matrix similarly since our model aims at unraveling the regional flow system the model does not explicitly include the tunnel as such the model neglects the pressure drop induced by the tunnel and simulation results refer to the pre tunnel stage of the system 4 3 simulating stable water isotopes and the continuous uptake of cl the main benefits of using a fully coupled thc simulator such as toughreact are i to include the transport of stable water isotopes in terms of a water source tracer in our simulations and ii to adopt the continuous uptake of cl from the proposed porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 the fate of the three most abundant stable water isotopologues 1h2 16o 1h2 18o 1h2h16o corresponding to a cumulative abundance of 99 9 was simulated following the approach described by singleton et al 2005 to do so 1h2 18o and 1h2h16o were defined as primary species with distinct total concentrations in addition to the 1h2 16o species used by default this allows calculating δ2h and δ18o values from the modeled 1h2h16o 1h2 16o and 1h2 18o 1h2 16o total concentration ratios rmodeled 6 δ r modeled r v smow 1 1000 where rvsmov refers to the corresponding ratios in vsmow for our simulations δ2h and δ18o values were fixed at the upper model boundary to define altitude dependent values for the infiltrating meteoric water and to use them as water source tracer in the absence of historical rainwater data the actual δ18o values were constrained by the long term δ18o monitoring of current rainwater collected along the nearby grimsel transect yielding an average value of 13 25 at 1980 m a s l i e at the grimsel station and an altitude effect on δ18o of 0 2 per 100 m elevation gain schotterer et al 2010 the corresponding δ2h values were defined by assuming that they lie on the gmwl i e δ2h 8 δ18o 10 schotterer et al 2010 which is consistent with our stable water isotope analyses fig 3 except for the upper model boundary δ18o and δ2h values were initially set to arbitrary values of 10 and 70 respectively table 1 since the model was defined as a single fractured rock continuum the uptake of cl from the proposed ancient porewater source seelig and bucher 2010 wanner et al 2017 to the initially cl free meteoric water was abstracted by specifying the kinetic release of na and cl from a generic solid nacl source nacl s na cl with a fixed dissolution rate of 3 10 14 mol kgh2o 1 s 1 0 03 mg kgh2o 1 a 1 this rate was numerically estimated by approximating the cl concentration profile observed along the amsteg section fig 2d the calibrated rate agrees well with fracture area normalized cl uptake rates of 0 07 0 12 mg m 2 a 1 estimated for groundwater circulating in the granitic basement in the region of laxemar sweden waber et al 2012 in waber et al 2012 the uptake of cl from such porewater source was associated with a shift of δ18o and δ2h values away from the gmwl towards higher values which was not observed for our samples fig 3 therefore the uptake of water with significantly less negative δ18o and δ2h values than meteoric water from the proposed porewater source was neglected in our model 4 4 initial and boundary conditions at the upper model boundary the temperature and pressure were prescribed to 1 bar and 4 c respectively in doing so we neglect the unsaturated zone and assume that the entire basement is fully saturated which means that the water table is constrained by the topographic surface and that infiltration and exfiltration is allowed through the entire upper model boundary multiple studies have shown that this approximation is valid for the simulation of regional flow problems in orogenic crystalline settings tiedeman et al 1998 bossong et al 2003 caine et al 2006 taillefer et al 2018 for our study it is particularly justified by the lack of detailed information on the local water table and the rather large vertical model extent 9 km for which the regional flow field is only weakly affected by the extent of the unsaturated zone by allowing the flux of meteoric water through the upper model boundary during the entire course of our simulations we assume i that the hüfi glacier located 3200 m a s l in the n e part of the model domain fig 1 represents a hydrological active warm based glacier and ii that the meteoric water infiltration rate during past glaciation periods remained constant while assumption i is justified given that in the alps evidence for hydraulically active warm based glaciers up to an altitude of 2600 m a s l has been reported even during the last glacial maximum 18 ka ago when the mean annual temperature was 12 3 c lower than today peyron et al 1998 wirsig et al 2016 ii represent an important model simplification of which the implications will be discussed together with the model results initially a hydrostatic pressure distribution and a typical regional conductive geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 vernon et al 2008 were defined throughout the model domain fig 7 the lateral and lower model boundaries were defined as no flux boundaries with respect to fluid flow whereas the lateral boundaries were defined as no flux boundaries for heat transport as well the definition of the later model boundaries as no flux boundaries is justified by the absence of heat sources other than the one responsible for the regional geothermal gradient and because cross catchment flow i e across the horizontal boundaries is likely negligible across the lower model boundary conductive heat transport was allowed by fixing the temperature to 186 c which is consistent with the mean surface altitude of 1850 m a s l within the model domain and a geothermal gradient of 25 c km 1 the permeability of the fractured rock continuum k was defined as a function of depth according to the relation derived from hydraulic tests performed in similar settings worldwide stober and bucher 2007 stober and bucher 2015 7 log k 1 38 log z 15 4 where z refers to the depth km below the surface and k is the intrinsic vertical permeability m2 fig 6 shows that this relation is able to match the permeability recorded along the nearby sedrun section of the tunnel masset and loew 2013 to account for the steeply dipping units fig 2a and nearly vertical fracture systems suggesting that flow is directed vertically a permeability anisotropy factor of 10 was considered between horizontal and vertical direction with higher values associated with the orientation of factures consequently the specified permeability in x and y direction was 10 times lower than the one defined by equation 7 in analogy to the permeability the porosity was also specified as a function of depth in the absence of any information on the porosity permeability relationship our simulations consider a linear fracture porosity decrease with depth fig 6 the maximum and minimum values 2 1 and 0 1 were taken from hg porosity measurements performed on gneisses and granites of a water conducting shear zone exposed in the nearby grimsel test site bossart and mazurek 1991 other physical and thermal properties e g density thermal conductivity were defined according to measurements performed in the nearby grimsel test site keusen et al 1989 kuhlman and gaus 2014 all model parameter are listed in table 1 initial and boundary conditions for simulating the fate of cl and stable water isotopes were defined as described above in detail and the corresponding values are listed in table 1 5 model results and discussion 5 1 general flow system selected results for the full model domain are shown in figs 8 and 9 computed average linear vertical flow velocities fig 8a demonstrate that meteoric water infiltration occurs at high altitude vz 0 lower limit of color scale whereas upward directed flow zones are found beneath major valleys such as the maderaner valley vz 0 the temporal evolution of δ18o values displays plumes of water with low δ18o values originating from the infiltration at high altitude fig 9 these plumes reach the lower model boundary 5 4 km a s l after a few 10 k years and then migrate laterally before ascending towards the surface of major valleys where they yield isotopically light values as well because our model considers continuous uptake of cl along flow paths these regional circulation systems are also expressed by the simulated cl concentration distribution at chemical steady state fig 8b which is achieved after about 150 ka during the course of the simulation fig 10 downward directed flow is indicated by the increase of cl along the flow path towards greater depth fig 8b in turn upward directed flow below major valleys is manifested by elevated cl concentrations indicating maximum residence times despite the infiltration of cold water at the surface t 4 c and the upflow of heated water from the lower model boundary t 186 c these flow zones only yield minor temperature anomalies compared to the initially specified conductive temperature distribution fig 8 vs fig 7 this is because flow velocities and hence water fluxes are rather small and heat transport is dominated by conduction rather than by advection below the maderaner valley for instance the computed upflow velocity is about 2 m year 1 whereas the model predicts a downflow velocity below the chrüzlistock of less than 0 5 m year 1 fig 2f 5 2 model results vs geochemical constraints the comparison between parameter profiles observed along the amsteg section of the tunnel and the corresponding simulation results is given in fig 2 despite that the tunnel was not explicitly considered in our model the agreement is quite good first our model predicts positive z velocities and thus ascending water up to a distance of about 12 5 km along the tunnel and negative z velocities indicating downflow for the remainder of the amsteg section fig 2f these flow zones are consistent with the interpretation of the spatial distribution of the silica phase saturation state fig 2c the cl concentrations fig 2d and the cl vs temperature correlation observed in groundwater exfiltrating into the tunnel fig 4a although the computed upflow zone extends up to 12 5 along the tunnel while fig 4a suggests that the first i e ascending group of groundwater samples extends up to 11 5 km only the maximum upflow velocity was computed for the segment where the tunnel crosscuts the bristen granite beneath the maderaner valley at ca 9 km fig 2f this is the only segment along the tunnel where the collected groundwater was supersaturated with respect to quartz and chalcedony fig 2c which is indicative of an ascending fluid wanner et al 2014 the simulated coupled thermal hydraulic processes further yield a temperature profile that matches the observed profile within reasonable uncertainty fig 2e the total flux of ascending water computed for the entire bristen granite segment was 0 008 l s 1 which is ca 850 times lower than the total discharge recorded along this particular segment 6 97 l s 1 because the tunnel was not explicitly considered in our model however it is challenging to directly compare computed flow rates to those measured in the tunnel the strong discrepancy is likely related to the facts that the construction of the tunnel induced a strong pressure drop of likely more than 100 bar masset and loew 2013 and that with the chosen model setup e g discretization resolution not considering the tunnel shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface is not fully captured by the model second the model is capable of reconstructing the shape of the observed cl concentration profile fig 2d although it over and underestimates the cl concentration along the bristen granite and the intschi zone respectively in analogy to the flow rate discrepancy the overestimation of the cl concentration along the bristen granite at ca 9 km is due to the fact that shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface as identified from the corresponding correlations fig 5 is not fully captured with the chosen model setup in contrast the underestimation along the intschi zone at ca 10 km along the tunnel is likely due to a different chemical composition of the porewater in the differently composed lithologies which was not considered by the model differences in the composition of the porewater serving as an important cl source is suggested by the lack of correlations between groundwater samples from the bristen granite and the intschi zone fig 5 the model is consistent with such explanation in the sense that the computed origin of meteoric water discharging along the bristner granite and the intschi zone strongly differs computed streamlines fig 11 suggest that groundwater discharging along the bristen granite originates to the south west near the bristen peak whereas groundwater samples ascending beneath the intschi zone originate to the south east in the vicinity of the chrüzlistock third the simulated δ18o values along the amsteg section fall within the range observed for groundwater samples fig 2b although simulations yield smaller δ18o variations along the tunnel and a slightly lower mean δ18o value 14 6 vs 13 9 this is because i with the chosen model setup shallow mixing with dilute meteoric water from the surface is not fully captured by the model and ii the δ18o and δ2h values assigned to infiltrating meteoric water were kept constant at the modern altitude dependent rainwater values schotterer et al 2010 the fact that our model is able to approximate the δ18o profile observed at the tunnel level confirms that infiltration of meteoric water must have mainly occurred at a period of time with climatic conditions similar to those of the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka 5 3 timing of meteoric water infiltration along the tunnel the mean residence times inferred from the simulated steady state cl concentration profile and the specified constant cl uptake rate of 3 10 14 mol kgh2o 1 s 1 taverage cl cluptake rate range from 3000 years below the chrüzlistock to about 28 000 years beneath the maderaner valley fig 2d since groundwater at the tunnel level represent mixtures of different flow paths the actual travel time of a single water molecule or dissolved species can be much higher such as inferred from the cl breakthrough curves computed for these two locations fig 10 for the upward directed flow zone below the maderaner valley the cl breakthrough curve fig 10b demonstrates that it takes more than 100 k years of simulation time until meteoric water that has infiltrated near the bristen peak reaches the tunnel level after having penetrated down to several kilometers below the tunnel fig 11 in contrast beneath the chrüzlistock computed cl breakthrough curves fig 10a are consistent with the average residence times inferred from the cl concentration profile fig 2d suggesting that meteoric water reaches the tunnel level after about 3000 years it should be noted however that these travel times represent rough estimations only this is because they are proportional to the poorly constrained porosity and permeability distribution fig 6 and because the infiltration rate of meteoric water was likely reduced during the last glaciation period and was certainly not constant over the past 150 ka such as assumed for our simulations nevertheless since our model predicts travel times much less than 10 ka for groundwater samples collected along the postulated downward directed flow zone beneath the chrüzlistock fig 10a it is evident that they must have infiltrated into the aar massif during the current holocene interglacial period 11 5 ka in contrast travel times much longer than 10 ka obtained for groundwater samples collected along the postulated upward directed flow zone below the maderaner valley fig 10b implies that these samples must have mostly infiltrated during similar but past climatic periods possible candidates are the eemian 115 130 ka or the meikirch interglacial 200 185 ka of which the former is surprisingly consistent with the computed breakthrough curve 6 implication for the circulation of meteoric water in orogenic crystalline basements despite the comparatively simple nature of our model and the absence of any calibration work in addition to estimating the cl uptake rate the model is able to reasonably match all constraints identified from the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater samples collected along the amsteg section fig 2 we consider this result as a strong quantitative confirmation that mountain topography operates as the most important driving force for meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements our simulations also confirm that in such settings meteoric water can easily penetrate down to several kilometer depth into the brittle continental crust for the simulated domain the topographic driving force is large enough for meteoric water to penetrate down to a depth of 9 km below the surface where the background permeability estimated for granitic basement rocks is less than 3 10 17 m2 fig 6 accordingly penetration down to several kilometer depth does not seem to be restricted by the presence of major fault zones with elevated permeability similarly the topographic driving force was sufficient to push the infiltrated meteoric water horizontally before it ascends beneath major valleys despite that the specified horizontal permeability was one order of magnitude lower than the vertical one 3 10 18 m2 at 9 km depth this means that topography driven flow can be sustained at a low horizontal permeability and does not necessary rely on regional fault zones in terms of practical applications our simulations are in agreement with recent studies showing that in orogenic crystalline basements thermal anomalies predominantly occur where major fault zones with permeabilities significantly above the background values considered in our model are exposed at valley floors taillefer et al 2018 wanner et al 2019 this is because for such settings the combination of hydraulic and structural driving forces is optimal thus such settings represent ideal targets for the exploitation of orogenic geothermal systems such as proposed recently wanner et al 2019 in the central alps promising examples are found within fault hosted settings of the western part of the aar massif at brigerbad and of the aiguilles rouges massif at lavey les bains sonney and vuataz 2009 valla et al 2016 both sites are i located at the valley floor of the rhone valley ii characterized by the occurrence of thermal springs discharging at temperatures up to 65 c and iii currently used as thermal spas moreover pastorelli et al 2001 have shown that thermal anomalies also occur in the gotthard region such as in the nearby highway tunnel and in an adjacent 500 m deep exploration borehole 28 c in 450 m depth interestingly these anomalies are also found beneath a major valley about 3 km south of the town of andermatt hence they are fully consistent with our model results and further demonstrate that orogenic geothermal systems are promising plays for geothermal power production finally our simulations confirm that circulation of meteoric water in orogenic crystalline basements is slow and that significant infiltration of meteoric water may have occurred during past interglacial periods dating back more than 100 ka this reinforces that groundwater and or porewater in crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations waber et al 2012 in terms of groundwater resources the low tunnel inflow rate computed for the most prominent upward directed flow zone beneath the maderaner valley 0 008 l s 1 suggest that deep circulation of meteoric water does not play a major role on the regional water cycle at least under the prevailing alpine climatic conditions with atmospheric precipitation well above 1000 mm year 1 meteoswiss 2019 however for drier climatic conditions such as on the tibet plateau with annual precipitation rates below 200 mm year 1 such rates might be significant for sustaining river baseflow and spring discharge ge et al 2008 7 summary and conclusions detailed knowledge about the circulation of meteoric water in non magmatic orogenic belts is fundamental for assessing the potential of such settings for geothermal power production wanner et al 2019 as well as their use as potential groundwater resources ge et al 2008 to get more general insight into such regional hydrogeological processes and to particularly test the hypothesis that mountain topography operates as a first order driving force for meteoric water circulation we have conducted regional 20 10 9 km thermal hydraulic chemical simulations of meteoric water circulation in the orogenic crystalline basement of the aar massif in the central alps switzerland in the absence of detailed hydraulic and structural data the simulations were constrained by 122 chemical analyses of groundwater samples collected during drilling of the world s longest and deepest tunnel the gotthard railbase tunnel explicitly considering the surface topography in combination with a previously published depth dependent permeability distribution for fractured crystalline rocks in our model was sufficient to reproduce key features of the chemical analyses e g salinity and temperature distribution and up and downward directed flow zones inferred from geochemical constraints to do so the only parameter that had to be calibrated in the model was the cl uptake rate along the flow path performing additional stable water isotope measurements and including their fate in the numerical simulations allowed gaining further insights into the timing of meteoric water infiltration and subsequent circulation the main conclusions of this study are despite the lack of detailed structural and hydraulic data 3d thermal hydraulic chemical simulations constrained by geochemical data allows assessing regional and long term topography driven flow in orogenic crystalline basements simulation results quantitatively confirm that the surface topography indeed operates as a very strong driving force for meteoric water circulation in orogenic crystalline basements owing to the induced hydraulic head gradient meteoric water infiltration occurs at high altitude whereas upward directed flow zones i e exfiltration are found along major valleys down to 9 km depth penetration of meteoric water is not limited by the decrease in permeability typical of granitic basement rocks suggesting that advective fluid transport down to the brittle ductile transition zone is likely occurring in such systems without the occurrence of permeability anomalies i e major fault zones however the permeability and hence the flow rates are too low for the formation of major thermal anomalies despite that in case of the studied system meteoric water may attain temperatures well above 150 c during such deep infiltration based on the upward directed flow zones predicted along major valleys our simulations suggest that positive temperature anomalies do occur if fluid upflow is promoted by the presence of major faults zones with elevated permeability within the aar and other crystalline alpine massifs such conditions are found frequently as manifested by the occurrence of multiple hot springs currently used as thermal spas thus we consider orogenic geothermal systems as promising plays for geothermal power production due to the low permeability circulation of meteoric water is slow 2 m year 1 and average groundwater residence times may strongly exceed the time period of the current interglacial stage 11 5 ka this further underlines that groundwater and or porewater in orogenic crystalline basements may act as an archive for palaeohydrologic variations during past interglacial

5872,we executed a comprehensive evaluation and intercomparison between six purely satellite derived precipitation estimates i e imerg late imerg early gsmap nrt gsmap mvk tmpa rt and persiann ccs at global and regional scales for the period from february 2017 to january 2019 the results show that imerg late exhibits the best performance among six evaluated products while the worst performance was found in gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk the root mean squared error rmse has a power function to the logarithm of precipitation intensity in all six satellite products on the basis of our findings the rmse of all products in rainfall events with intensity exceeding 32 mm day or 8 mm h accounts for beyond 30 of the corresponding precipitation intensity which might result in a significant impact on the detectability and forecast of flash floods simulated by satellite precipitation additionally both imerg and gsmap overestimate the proportions of light rainfall occurrences and also display relatively larger errors in light precipitation 0 2 0 4 mm h or 1 2 mm day with the rmse values exceeding 0 5 mm or 2 mm at hourly or daily time scale as for the error analysis we decomposed the total bias of each product into hits misses and false biases at hourly and 0 1 resolution over mainland china except for tmpa rt we found that the false bias is the dominated error sources for these five products in cold season over semi humid areas despite that the hit bias accounts for a non negligible proportion for gsmap suite the missed precipitation is the dominated error sources of persiann ccs both in two seasons over most of humid regions and meanwhile is one of major error sources for other four products we expect that the findings of this study not only provide some valuable feedbacks for algorithm developers to improve the gpm based satellite precipitation retrievals but also provide some guidance for data users across the world keywords satellite only precipitation products light rainfall rmse error source mainland china 1 introduction precipitation is one of the important variables coupling the water and energy cycles and it is also one of the conundrums to estimate due to its strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity hou et al 2014 chen et al 2019b since the development of satellite techniques and retrieval algorithms a growing number of satellite based precipitation datasets have been released to the public in the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm era there are four widely used satellite precipitation products including trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the global precipitation measurement gpm core observatory satellite was launched on february 28 2014 which means that satellite precipitation has entered the gpm era hou et al 2014 in this era satellite based precipitation datasets mainly include imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm huffman et al 2019 and gsmap which have been widely used in the hydrometeorological field these operational satellite precipitation products aforementioned above have played an important role in the research community flood and drought prediction water source management at local regional and even global scales hou et al 2014 yong et al 2015 maggioni et al 2016 chen et al 2019a compared with gauge adjusted satellite precipitation datasets satellite only precipitation products spps without correction from ground based observations have the advantage of near real time which have been widely used in near real time applications such as crop forecasting flood forecasting drought monitoring and landslides detection etc however the performance of spps normally performed worse than that of gauge adjusted satellite precipitation datasets over most regions previous studies indicate that spps are prone to generate larger random errors and systematic errors especially for light or heavy rainfall events which can lead to some negative impacts on various near real time applications tapiador et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 deng et al 2018 hong et al 2019 currently many researchers have done a great deal of assessments for revealing the error structure and error characteristics of spps in order to help data developers improving the quality of spps it has been found that several global evaluation studies e g tian and peters lidard 2010 yong et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 liu 2016 beck et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and considerable number of regional evaluation e g yang and luo 2014 yong et al 2010 2013 2014 2016 tang et al 2016 guo et al 2016 xu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 deng et al 2018 su et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 beck et al 2019 wu et al 2019 have executed to examine and understand the error characteristics of satellite based precipitation datasets for data users and algorithm developers however many of these studies did not use the latest satellite based precipitation datasets e g tian and peters lidard 2010 yang and luo 2014 yong et al 2010 2013 2014 2015 gehne et al 2016 beck et al 2017 or evaluated only one or two types of datasets e g yong et al 2016 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 deng et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 zhao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 with the emerge of new products and versions the advantages and limitations of these spps have been widely concerned by users and developers consequently it is necessary and timely to comprehensive analyze these latest satellite only products and versions at global and regional scales a larger number of studies have examined the relationship between the performance of spps and precipitation intensity most of these studies attempted to analyze the potential links between systematic bias e g xie and xiong 2011 deng et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 or detection capability e g guo et al 2016 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 manz et al 2017 and precipitation intensity however they couldn t reflect the accuracy of spps under different precipitation intensity in particular it is important for data users to clearly understand the accuracy of spps in estimating the heavy rainfall events based on empirical function models before using spps to force the flood monitoring and forecasting systems in the recent gpm era the retrievals of light rainfall also attracted the interests of many researchers because the dual frequency phased array precipitation radar and a multichannel gpm microwave imager dpr and gmi carried the gpm core observatory satellite can provide more accurate estimation for light rainfall and snow although some previous studies utilized probability of density function pdf to detect the estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity for spps e g kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 su et al 2018 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 few studies focused on the gpm based purely satellite derived products furthermore the accuracy of spps in retrieving the light rainfall was often neglected in these studies separating the total errors into components is a meaningful effort that can help data developers better tracing the error sources and reducing them tian et al 2009 several reported works have provided some valuable information on error sources for real time tmpa tmpa rt gauge calibrated imerg and gauge calibrated gsmap over mainland china e g yong et al 2016 su et al 2018 however a systematic study aiming to the latest satellite only precipitation products in operation over mainland china is still lacking in this study the current popular satellite only precipitation products including imerg late imerg early global satellite mapping of precipitation microwave ir combined product gsmap mvk global satellite mapping of precipitation in near real time gsmap nrt tmpa rt and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs are statistically investigated over the globe and mainland china our aim is mainly to answer four key questions as follows 1 with the emerge of new products and versions how do these spps perform especially for light precipitation 2 what is the relationship between retrieval accuracy and precipitation intensity 3 what is the major error source for these mainstream spps in mainland china 4 are imerg products satisfactory enough to support tmpa rt stopping 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area in global analysis the study areas of all spps cover the latitude band 60 n s except for tmpa rt 50 n s fig 1 a presents the spatial distribution of mean daily precipitation for climate prediction center cpc unified it is seen that the heavy precipitation mainly distributed in the countries closest to the equator and in regions controlled by the monsoon climate such as malaysia indonesia columbia japan southeastern china india and bangladesh and so on liu 2016 wang et al 2018 of regional analysis mainland china is chosen as regional study areas the reason is that mainland china has multiple types of climate features and complex topography which may expose more potential issues of spps the spatial distribution of mean hourly precipitation for merged precipitation analysis mpa over mainland china is presented in fig 1 b overall the precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest in mainland china tang et al 2016 chen et al 2019b in addition mainland china can be divided into four climatic regions namely the humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions refer to chen et al 2019b as shown in fig 1b it is obvious that humid regions have a large amount of precipitation because of the impacts of subtropical monsoon climate and those continental domains mainly include pearl river basin the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river and huaihe river basin the semi humid controlled by the monsoon in middle latitudes covers the yellow river basin and the eastern tibetan plateau the semi arid with a relatively complex topography includes the tianshan mountains and middle part of the tibetan plateau finally the residual parts belong to arid regions mainly including the tarim basin and the western tibetan plateau 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets in this study six spps are employed in the evaluation i e imerg late v6 imerg early v6 gsmap mvk v7 gsmap nrt v7 tmpa 3b42 rt v7 and persiann ccs the parameters of these six spps are listed in table 1 the imerg suite including imerg late v6 hereafter referred to imerg late and imerg early v6 hereafter referred to imerg early which merged available data from gpm constellation satellites for getting accurate precipitation estimates hou et al 2014 firstly the dpr and gmi data are applied to intercalibrate and merge precipitation estimates from several passive microwave pmw satellites then the persiann ccs algorithm is applied to compute microwave calibrated infrared ir precipitation rates further the morphing technique using motion vectors computed from goddard earth observing system model geos forward processing fp data to forward backward propagate microwave maps is applied to produce global gridded precipitation estimates at fine resolution finally a kalman filter is used to combine these morphing based estimates and the microwave calibrated ir estimates into a weighted estimate note that the imerg early is forward only in morphing process the gsmap suite including gsmap mvk v7 hereafter referred to gsmap mvk and gsmap nrt v7 hereafter referred to gsmap nrt is used in our study gsmap mvk integrates pmw data with ir data in order to produce high spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 1 h global precipitation estimates similarly it also uses a kalman filter to refine the precipitation rate propagated based on the atmospheric moving vector derived from two successive ir images unlike imerg system the gsmap system propagates and applies the kalman filter only for the precipitation estimates identified by the pmw algorithms it indicates that the kalman filter used in gsmap system strongly depend on the pmw based precipitation estimates ushio et al 2009 also this reflects that the ir based information is not fully utilized in gsmap system another difference between imerg and gsmap is that the ir data is not calibrated by pmw data using pertinent algorithms besides the gsmap system only uses dpr data as a calibration standard for pmw retrievals not including gmi data as for gsmap nrt the precipitation estimates of this near real time product are based on the gsmap mvk algorithm but some processes are simplified in order to keep operability and latency in near real time the major differences between gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk in processing are as follows 1 japan meteorological agency jma forecast data is used as atmospheric information 2 latest available jma merged satellite and in situ data global daily sea surface temperature mgdsst data is used as sea surface temperature information 3 forward only cloud movement is used in algorithm real time tmpa 3b42 v7 hereafter referred to tmpa rt estimates integrates most pmw data available from low earth orbit satellites and ir measurements from geostationary platforms this near real time product mainly uses ir based retrievals to fill the pmw coverage gaps unlike imerg tmpa is calibrated to the trmm combined instrument i e precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi until the demise of trmm satellite after that tmpa rt uses climatological satellite calibrations so continue despite the loss of quality for tmpa estimates huffman 2018 as for persiann ccs this product mainly uses persian ccs algorithm to estimate global rainfall in near real time and at higher spatial resolution 0 04â despite using ir data as the sole input sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 since its release persiann ccs has been widely used in the research flood and drought prediction and more nguyen et al 2019 due to the data period of gsmap nrt v7 starting from january 2017 these six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets from february 2017 to january 2019 2 years are selected to evaluate for obtaining new insights for data users and algorithm developers 2 2 2 two ground reference precipitation datasets in our study cpc unified and gauge satellite merged gridded hourly mpa product are regarded as the benchmarks in the evaluation over the globe and mainland china respectively cpc unified developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center was used as ground truth in global evaluation which combines gauge based observations from more than 17 000 gauges over the globe the optimal interpolation oi with orographic consideration is applied to produce a real time gauge based precipitation product xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 however cpc unified shows poor performance in tropical africa and antartica meanwhile its quality varies with the gauge network density despite that this dataset performed the best performance by intercomparing among the 22 precipitation datasets over the globe beck et al 2017 the spatial distribution of gauge density for cpc unified is presented in fig 1c another reference data is gauge satellite merged mpa which developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration and is used in the evaluation over mainland china mpa combines the gauge based observations from more than 30 000 automatic weather stations aws with cmorph firstly the rain gauge observations go through strict quality control refer to ren et al 2010 then the cmorph estimates are corrected by using the probability density function to reduce the systematic errors finally the oi method is applied to combine quality controlled gauge observations and gauge corrected cmorph producing the final gauge satellite merged mpa dataset shen et al 2014 overall mpa has lower bias which is less than 10 and outperforms other gauge based precipitation products over mainland china shen et al 2013 additionally the aws used in mpa are mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid areas see fig 1d note that only liquid rainfall occurrences are investigated in the evaluation over mainland china because of the aws observations used in mpa only suiting for liquid rainfall events thus we use the flag information of gauge numbers within one grid cell in the mpa system to strictly match the satellite estimates and liquid rainfall occurrences detected by aws to exclude the snowfall events to ensure the robustness of the evaluation results only grid cells with at least one gauge in these two reference datasets are chosen to execute evaluation 2 3 methodology the performance of spps is basically behaved in detection capability and accuracy the evaluation metrics used in this study are listed in table 2 probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are used to examine the detection capability of spps pod gives how often the satellite correctly detects precipitation while far gives how often the satellite detects precipitation when the rain gauge does not detect precipitation the correlation coefficient cc shows the degree of linear correlation between the reference values and satellite estimates and it is able to reflect the capability of reproducing the temporal variations wang et al 2018 while relative bias bias describes the systematic bias of satellite only precipitation estimates and it is able to reflect the underestimation bias 0 or overestimation bias 0 of ones tian et al 2009 proposed an error decomposition scheme to decompose the bias also known as total bias t into hit bias h miss bias m and false bias f the relationship between total bias and its three error components can be defined by t h m f the detailed calculation formulas of total bias and its three independent components are shown in table 2 as for rmse this metric describes the errors of spps and it reflects the accuracy of spps because it is used to measure the deviation between the estimates and the observations it is worth noting that the rain no rain threshold is set to 0 2 mm for hourly time scale and 1 mm for daily time scale 3 results 3 1 global evaluation and intercomparison between six spps the results of our global analysis associated with six spps are organized into two parts in this section general analysis of six spps over the whole globe and the spatial analysis of six spps over the globe these two aspects will show a relatively comprehensive picture of the performance for each spp note that all spps are aggregated precipitation estimates to cpc unified scales 0 5â and daily before the evaluation metrics calculated 3 1 1 global general analysis table 3 presents the summary of evaluation metrics for six spps at 0 5â and daily resolution over the whole globe almost all results of evaluation metrics indicate that imerg late is slightly better than the other five spps over the globe one can see that imerg suite including imerg early and imerg late shows the best performance in detection capability over the whole globe with higher pod value of 0 75 while the persiann ccs and tmpa rt reveal inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns relative to other spps in terms of cc imerg suite has higher cc value of exceeding 0 6 performs better than other four spps suggesting that imerg suite can better reproduce the temporal dynamics over the globe in the bias column we found that all spps overestimate precipitation over the whole globe except for tmpa rt obviously the gsmap suite dramatically overestimates precipitation with higher bias values of exceeding 34 over the whole globe conversely the tmpa rt underestimates precipitation with the bias value of 13 16 lastly the accuracy of imerg suite outperforms that of other four spps over the whole globe with lower rmse values of less than 7 25 mm the evaluation results show that the imerg suite estimates have been slightly improved building upon the success of the tmpa rt ones especially for detectability 3 1 2 global view of spatial analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of pod and far for six spps at 0 5 and daily resolution over the globe it is seen that the comparable spatial distribution patterns of pod and far are found between these four spps except for tmpa rt and persiann ccs overall the worse performance in detecting capability for six spps is found in the western conterminous united states couns southern canada eastern brazil southwestern mongolia western china southeastern australia andean mountains in south america etc our results are consistent with previous studies e g tang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 su et al 2018 beck et al 2019 chen et al 2019b evidently persiann ccs and tmpa rt perform relatively worse detection capability over most parts of the world the error feature of six spps is another research target fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of bias and rmse for six spps at 0 5 and daily resolution over the globe as shown in fig 3a f the negative and positive bias values of six spps are scattered over the globe overall imerg suite and tmpa rt perform relatively well with slight underestimation or overestimation over the globe while gsmap suite and persiann ccs perform relatively worse dramatically overestimate precipitation with their bias over 100 in the most of couns western china mongolia japan india kazakhstan etc finally the spatial distribution of rmse values for six spps are presented in fig 3g l obviously these six spps share the considerable similarities in spatial distribution the most remarkable common feature is that higher rmse values are distributed in these areas which have ample medium and heavy rainfall events see fig 1a such as eastern couns most of south america japan southeastern china india bangladesh etc it seems that the rmse values are related to the precipitation intensity 3 2 evaluation of five spps in mainland china as is known to all that tmpa rt will be stopped when imerg products are satisfactory huffman 2018 on the basis of the global analysis the performance of imerg suite is generally better than that of tmpa rt over the globe thus the five spps except for tmpa rt will be evaluated at finer spatial resolution 0 1 over mainland china to essentially reveal their error features 3 2 1 routine analysis table 4 presents the summary of evaluation metrics for five spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china almost all results of metrics indicate that imerg suite shows relatively better performance than other three spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china it is worth noting that gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk have fairly good performance in detection capability however they have the highest bias and rmse values both at hourly and daily time scales suggesting that gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk can better detect the rainfall events correctly but their precipitation amount is not accurate enough in contrast persiann ccs performs relatively worse performance in detection capability but better in accuracy of precipitation amount the spatial analysis of five spps in mainland china is given fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of pod and far for five spps at hourly and daily time scales the comparable spatial distribution patterns appear in most spps except for persiann ccs both at hourly and daily time scales compare with other spps persiann ccs has lower pod values less than 0 5 in most mainland china at hourly time scale and its far values are exceeding 0 5 fig 4q and s thus not surprisingly its pod value is as low as 0 20 while its far value is up to 0 73 over the whole mainland china table 4 meanwhile all spps are relatively good at detecting the heavy precipitation because of their higher or lower pod or far values appearing in these regions which have ample heavy precipitation though fig 4 reveals the detection capability of five spps it couldn t reflect the error feature for each spp the spatial distribution of bias and rmse for five spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china is presented in fig 5 in terms of bias gsmap suite exhibits significant overestimates over semi humid and northern humid areas fig 5c d and h i compared with other three spps in addition persiann ccs have remarkable underestimates in humid areas and overestimates the precipitation in the residual parts of mainland china fig 5e and j for the rmse gsmap suite has higher rmse values in humid areas relative to other three spps both at hourly and daily time scales it is clear that the rmse values of imerg suite and persiann ccs gradually decrease from southeast to northwest also five spps have relatively higher rmse values in humid regions both at hourly and daily time scales it seems that the rmse is related to the precipitation intensity this further confirms the necessity of investigating the relationship between rmse and precipitation intensity 3 2 2 tracing the error sources for five spps in mainland china firstly we decomposed the total bias of each spp into hit bias miss bias and false bias at hourly time scale over mainland china and then accumulated the total bias and three hourly error components i e hit bias miss bias and false bias into cold season including these months of two year study period from november to december and january to april and warm season including these months of two year study period from may to october respectively in this section our analysis is mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid areas because of having dense rain gauge networks over these areas the figs 6 and 7 show the spatial distribution patterns of the total bias and its three error components for the cold and warm seasons respectively for cold season fig 6 the spatial distribution patterns of five spps in total bias and three error components share considerable similarities the most obvious common feature is that the total biases of five spps is exceeding 150 in most semi humid regions one can see that the false error is the dominant error components causing the overestimates for imerg suite and persiann ccs over these areas while gsmap suite s overestimates are attributed primarily to the false biases but the hit biases cannot be neglected over these areas also it cannot be ignored that the miss error is one of major error components for persiann ccs over these areas on the other hand we also found that some differences exist between these five spps gsmap suite and persiann ccs overestimate precipitation in the northern humid regions because of the larger false biases 150 in addition persiann ccs seriously underestimates precipitation in the southern humid regions this is due primarily to missed precipitation 80 over these areas for warm season fig 7 all spps display lower biases relative to the cold season which is consistent with previous results e g yong et al 2016 guo et al 2016 chen et al 2019b imerg early and imerg late or gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk almost show a high degree of consistency in spatial distribution patterns of the total bias and three error components except for the miss error however imerg late has lower miss biases than imerg early over the large areas of semi humid and humid regions correspondingly gsmap mvk shows lower miss biases than gsmap nrt but only for the large areas of semi humid regions meanwhile imerg suite and gsmap suite exhibit slight underestimates or overestimates over humid regions these underestimates or overestimates can be traced to miss or false biases additionally the main error sources for gsmap suite in semi humid come from false and hit biases differing from imerg suite for their error sources coming from misses and false biases finally the total errors of persiann ccs are dominated by the miss errors 60 in the large areas of mainland china 3 3 evaluation of estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity the pdf is a metric used to evaluate and compare different spps in terms of estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity and it is also a good method to describe the performance of spps to measure light precipitation kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 fig 8 displays the variations of pdf values for six spps with precipitation intensity both at daily and hourly time scales in global analysis it is obvious that more than 75 precipitation is under 1 mm day as shown in fig 8a b the majority of spps display slight underestimation in detecting precipitation with intensity less than 1 mm day except for tmpa rt the significant differences of pdf exist between these six spps in the precipitation intensity range 1 mm day persiann ccs shows poorer performance with overestimating rainfall events in the precipitation intensity range 1 40 mm day there are some differences between imerg early and imerg late or gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk which is possibly caused by the different retrieval algorithms and input sources overall tmpa rt exhibit better detecting rainfall events than other five spps in most precipitation intensities the variations of pdf values for five spps with precipitation intensity share considerable similarities in regional and global analyzes see fig 8a d the most significant common feature is that the pdf values of five spps have a clear decreasing tendency with precipitation intensity just as a coin has two sides some significant differences exist between these two spatial scale analyses for example compared with global analysis five spps in regional analysis overestimate more proportions in the precipitation intensity range 1 mm day and reduce proportions in precipitation with intensity less than 1 mm day for the hourly scenario imerg suite shows evident overestimates in most precipitation intensities while gsmap suite significantly overestimates rainfall events in the precipitation intensity range 1 5 mm h surprisingly persiann ccs have similar proportions with mpa dataset in most precipitation intensities 4 discussion based on global and regional results it seems that the rmse accuracy is related to the precipitation intensity additionally the accuracy of these spps in heavy precipitation is closely associated with the detectability and prediction for flood events kucera et al 2013 hou et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus it is a meaningful effort that investigating the relationship between rmse and precipitation intensity which is helpful for data users to understand the accuracy of spps under different rainfall events overall there is a power function relationship between rmse and logarithm of precipitation intensity which implies the errors of six spps having a stronger dependency on precipitation intensity as shown in fig 9 furthermore we found that all spps display better detectability in flood prone areas which have ample heavy precipitation see figs 1a b 2 and 4 however spps in these areas are unsatisfactory because of their higher rmse values see figs 3g l and 5k t it can be seen that the rmse of six spps in precipitation with intensity exceeding 32 mm day 8 mm h accounts for more than 30 of corresponding precipitation intensity see fig 9 the poor accuracy of these six spps in such rainfall events may produce a negative impact in hydrologic studies to predict flood events as is known to all that spps have been widely applied in flood detection and prediction khan 2011 hong et al 2019 for example two important global flood systems i e global hydrological prediction system ghps wang et al 2011 and global flood monitoring system gfms wu et al 2014 are all driven by the tmpa and gpm products obviously the power function relationship can provide a method to quickly obtain the rmse values of different rainfall events for spps which is helpful for data users knowing the accuracy of spps when using spps to force the flood prediction system the two more advanced instruments including dpr and gmi are aim to more accurate instantaneous precipitation estimates particularly for light and solid precipitation in particular the precipitation sensitivity of spaceborne radar increased from 0 5 mm h for pr to 0 2 mm h for dpr the performance of spps in light rainfall events in gpm era has attracted wide attention of algorithm developers and data users the majority of these six spps overestimate the proportions of light rainfall events 1 2 mm day across the globe especially for imerg suite see fig 8b in regional analysis the proportions of light rainfall events 0 2 0 4 mm h for imerg suite show more significant overestimates with the bias of exceeding 68 at hourly time scale see fig 8f the similar phenomenon also appears at daily time scale see fig 8d we noted that there are some studies investigating the performance of light precipitation for satellite precipitation products for example chen et al 2013 found that the tmpa rt underdetects light rainfall also gauge corrected imerg v3 and v5 underestimate the proportions in light rainfall while gauge corrected imerg v4 overestimates ones wang et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 even found that the proportions of light precipitation were underestimated in the gauge corrected imerg v3 and gsmap products on the other hand investigating the accuracy of light precipitation for spps is still lacking in previous studies in our study results all six spps have large rmse values greater than 2 mm or 0 5 mm at daily or hourly time scale in the light rainfall events it means that the current satellite precipitation retrievals in light rainfall still exhibit poor performance in estimation despite introducing dpr data to improve retrievals consequently we suggested that future efforts for algorithm developers still need to be focused on the detectability and estimation of light rainfall the uncertainty of results is an issue in the evaluation we have examined the rmse as a function of different rain gauge density over humid regions of mainland china as shown in fig 10 overall there are having a decreasing trend of rmse values with the increased rain gauge density indicating that using a sparse rain gauge network might underestimate the performance of spp for example the bad performance of the spps appears in the most areas of africa central australia western china and so on where the rain gauges for cpc unified or mpa are sparsely and unevenly distributed in these areas we though that the bad performance of the spps in these areas with sparse rain gauges is not actual performance of spps but of the evaluation approach itself also previous studies have confirmed that the uncertainty of the evaluation for spps is associate with rain gauge density e g tian et al 2018 tang et al 2018 prakash et al 2019 all these studies revealed that a dense rain gauge density network used in the evaluation can better reflect the actual performance of spps besides the reference data including satellite information is one of sources for the uncertainty of the evaluation one can see that the input sources of reference data mpa are overlapping with those of these six spps to some extent which might cause some potential uncertainties in the evaluation the data developers hope that tmpa rt stops when imerg products are satisfactory huffman 2018 our evaluation results show that the imerg suite including imerg early and imerg late generally outperforms tmpa rt especially for detectability however the performance of imerg suite is still unsatisfactory in some areas such as western and northern couns western china central australia etc the cause is primary contributable to the impacts of complex topography and bad climate situations on the precipitation structure and associated challenges with satellite retrievals from space daly et al 2008 guo et al 2017 chen et al 2019b generally speaking the equivalent imerg suite outperforms the tmpa rt and is satisfactory at this time we expect that our study results can provide a feedback for data developers to decide whether tmpa rt can stop or not on the basis of our findings we proposed some valuable suggestions for data developers and data users 1 overall imerg late should be given priority in near real time applications because of its excellent performance among the six satellite only precipitation products in addition data users should give priority to using imerg early in the applications with strong timeliness due to its 4 h date latency 2 though gsmap suite also uses a kaman filter to combine the forward and backward estimates into a weighted estimate its accuracy is obviously worse than imerg suite s we speculate that one reason is that the kalman filter used in gsmap retrieval system only combines the precipitation estimates identified by the pmw algorithms another reason may be that the weights used in kalman filter are not precise enough thus we suggested that the data developers should further improve the gsmap retrieval system in determining the weights and making full use of ir based information finally separating the errors into components is helpful for algorithm developers to trace error and reduce them tian et al 2009 we revealed the error sources for these mainstream spps over mainland china however whether the evaluation results for cold and warm seasons from mainland china can be extended to other regions of the world still needs to be further investigated 5 conclusion this study is to comprehensively evaluate and compare the performance of six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets i e imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt gsmap mvk tmpa rt and persiann ccs on the basis of global and regional evaluation results we answered four questions that both users and developers widely concerned for satellite precipitation estimates our major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 generally speaking imerg late is the best one of six satellite only precipitation data sets over the globe while the gsmap suite including gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk shows the worst performance with relatively larger values of bias 28 and rmse 1 39 mm at hourly time scale and 9 41 mm at daily time scale compared with trmm based tmpa rt the gpm based imerg estimates including both imerg early and imerg late significantly reduce the precipitation underestimates over the most parts of the world although imerg generally seems superior to tmpa its performance is still unsatisfactory in some specific regions particularly over complex topography such as western and northern couns western china etc 2 the rmse has a power function to the logarithm of precipitation intensity in all six purely satellite derived precipitation data sets on the basis of this functional relationship we found that the rmse values of six satellite only precipitation data sets account for over 30 of corresponding precipitation intensity in rainfall events exceeding 32 mm day or 8 mm h it is predictable that these spps with lower precision in heavy rainfall events may produce the negative impacts in hydrologic studies to predict flood events when using these spps to force the flood monitoring and forecasting system 3 the imerg suite overestimates the proportions of light rainfall events 1 2 mm day over the globe furthermore imerg and gsmap display more significant overestimates over mainland china especially for imerg with bias over 68 at hourly time scale as for the accuracy all spps in light precipitation is poor with the rmse values exceeding 2 mm and 0 5 mm for daily and hourly time scales respectively 4 the five purely satellite derived precipitation products including imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and persiann ccs share some similarities and differences in spatial distribution patterns of total bias and its three components in cold and warm seasons for the similarity these products display the large overestimates in semi humid areas in cold season and these overestimates are primarily attributed to the false errors 150 on the other hand some remarkable differences exist between these five satellite only precipitation products persiann ccs shows serious underestimates in southern humid regions both in two seasons which is primarily attributed to missed precipitation while gsmap suite evidently overestimates the precipitation in semi humid areas in warm season relative to other three spps these overestimates mainly come from the hits and false biases over these areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

5872,we executed a comprehensive evaluation and intercomparison between six purely satellite derived precipitation estimates i e imerg late imerg early gsmap nrt gsmap mvk tmpa rt and persiann ccs at global and regional scales for the period from february 2017 to january 2019 the results show that imerg late exhibits the best performance among six evaluated products while the worst performance was found in gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk the root mean squared error rmse has a power function to the logarithm of precipitation intensity in all six satellite products on the basis of our findings the rmse of all products in rainfall events with intensity exceeding 32 mm day or 8 mm h accounts for beyond 30 of the corresponding precipitation intensity which might result in a significant impact on the detectability and forecast of flash floods simulated by satellite precipitation additionally both imerg and gsmap overestimate the proportions of light rainfall occurrences and also display relatively larger errors in light precipitation 0 2 0 4 mm h or 1 2 mm day with the rmse values exceeding 0 5 mm or 2 mm at hourly or daily time scale as for the error analysis we decomposed the total bias of each product into hits misses and false biases at hourly and 0 1 resolution over mainland china except for tmpa rt we found that the false bias is the dominated error sources for these five products in cold season over semi humid areas despite that the hit bias accounts for a non negligible proportion for gsmap suite the missed precipitation is the dominated error sources of persiann ccs both in two seasons over most of humid regions and meanwhile is one of major error sources for other four products we expect that the findings of this study not only provide some valuable feedbacks for algorithm developers to improve the gpm based satellite precipitation retrievals but also provide some guidance for data users across the world keywords satellite only precipitation products light rainfall rmse error source mainland china 1 introduction precipitation is one of the important variables coupling the water and energy cycles and it is also one of the conundrums to estimate due to its strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity hou et al 2014 chen et al 2019b since the development of satellite techniques and retrieval algorithms a growing number of satellite based precipitation datasets have been released to the public in the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm era there are four widely used satellite precipitation products including trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the global precipitation measurement gpm core observatory satellite was launched on february 28 2014 which means that satellite precipitation has entered the gpm era hou et al 2014 in this era satellite based precipitation datasets mainly include imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm huffman et al 2019 and gsmap which have been widely used in the hydrometeorological field these operational satellite precipitation products aforementioned above have played an important role in the research community flood and drought prediction water source management at local regional and even global scales hou et al 2014 yong et al 2015 maggioni et al 2016 chen et al 2019a compared with gauge adjusted satellite precipitation datasets satellite only precipitation products spps without correction from ground based observations have the advantage of near real time which have been widely used in near real time applications such as crop forecasting flood forecasting drought monitoring and landslides detection etc however the performance of spps normally performed worse than that of gauge adjusted satellite precipitation datasets over most regions previous studies indicate that spps are prone to generate larger random errors and systematic errors especially for light or heavy rainfall events which can lead to some negative impacts on various near real time applications tapiador et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 deng et al 2018 hong et al 2019 currently many researchers have done a great deal of assessments for revealing the error structure and error characteristics of spps in order to help data developers improving the quality of spps it has been found that several global evaluation studies e g tian and peters lidard 2010 yong et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 liu 2016 beck et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and considerable number of regional evaluation e g yang and luo 2014 yong et al 2010 2013 2014 2016 tang et al 2016 guo et al 2016 xu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 deng et al 2018 su et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 beck et al 2019 wu et al 2019 have executed to examine and understand the error characteristics of satellite based precipitation datasets for data users and algorithm developers however many of these studies did not use the latest satellite based precipitation datasets e g tian and peters lidard 2010 yang and luo 2014 yong et al 2010 2013 2014 2015 gehne et al 2016 beck et al 2017 or evaluated only one or two types of datasets e g yong et al 2016 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 deng et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 zhao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 with the emerge of new products and versions the advantages and limitations of these spps have been widely concerned by users and developers consequently it is necessary and timely to comprehensive analyze these latest satellite only products and versions at global and regional scales a larger number of studies have examined the relationship between the performance of spps and precipitation intensity most of these studies attempted to analyze the potential links between systematic bias e g xie and xiong 2011 deng et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 or detection capability e g guo et al 2016 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 manz et al 2017 and precipitation intensity however they couldn t reflect the accuracy of spps under different precipitation intensity in particular it is important for data users to clearly understand the accuracy of spps in estimating the heavy rainfall events based on empirical function models before using spps to force the flood monitoring and forecasting systems in the recent gpm era the retrievals of light rainfall also attracted the interests of many researchers because the dual frequency phased array precipitation radar and a multichannel gpm microwave imager dpr and gmi carried the gpm core observatory satellite can provide more accurate estimation for light rainfall and snow although some previous studies utilized probability of density function pdf to detect the estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity for spps e g kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 su et al 2018 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 few studies focused on the gpm based purely satellite derived products furthermore the accuracy of spps in retrieving the light rainfall was often neglected in these studies separating the total errors into components is a meaningful effort that can help data developers better tracing the error sources and reducing them tian et al 2009 several reported works have provided some valuable information on error sources for real time tmpa tmpa rt gauge calibrated imerg and gauge calibrated gsmap over mainland china e g yong et al 2016 su et al 2018 however a systematic study aiming to the latest satellite only precipitation products in operation over mainland china is still lacking in this study the current popular satellite only precipitation products including imerg late imerg early global satellite mapping of precipitation microwave ir combined product gsmap mvk global satellite mapping of precipitation in near real time gsmap nrt tmpa rt and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs are statistically investigated over the globe and mainland china our aim is mainly to answer four key questions as follows 1 with the emerge of new products and versions how do these spps perform especially for light precipitation 2 what is the relationship between retrieval accuracy and precipitation intensity 3 what is the major error source for these mainstream spps in mainland china 4 are imerg products satisfactory enough to support tmpa rt stopping 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area in global analysis the study areas of all spps cover the latitude band 60 n s except for tmpa rt 50 n s fig 1 a presents the spatial distribution of mean daily precipitation for climate prediction center cpc unified it is seen that the heavy precipitation mainly distributed in the countries closest to the equator and in regions controlled by the monsoon climate such as malaysia indonesia columbia japan southeastern china india and bangladesh and so on liu 2016 wang et al 2018 of regional analysis mainland china is chosen as regional study areas the reason is that mainland china has multiple types of climate features and complex topography which may expose more potential issues of spps the spatial distribution of mean hourly precipitation for merged precipitation analysis mpa over mainland china is presented in fig 1 b overall the precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest in mainland china tang et al 2016 chen et al 2019b in addition mainland china can be divided into four climatic regions namely the humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions refer to chen et al 2019b as shown in fig 1b it is obvious that humid regions have a large amount of precipitation because of the impacts of subtropical monsoon climate and those continental domains mainly include pearl river basin the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river and huaihe river basin the semi humid controlled by the monsoon in middle latitudes covers the yellow river basin and the eastern tibetan plateau the semi arid with a relatively complex topography includes the tianshan mountains and middle part of the tibetan plateau finally the residual parts belong to arid regions mainly including the tarim basin and the western tibetan plateau 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets in this study six spps are employed in the evaluation i e imerg late v6 imerg early v6 gsmap mvk v7 gsmap nrt v7 tmpa 3b42 rt v7 and persiann ccs the parameters of these six spps are listed in table 1 the imerg suite including imerg late v6 hereafter referred to imerg late and imerg early v6 hereafter referred to imerg early which merged available data from gpm constellation satellites for getting accurate precipitation estimates hou et al 2014 firstly the dpr and gmi data are applied to intercalibrate and merge precipitation estimates from several passive microwave pmw satellites then the persiann ccs algorithm is applied to compute microwave calibrated infrared ir precipitation rates further the morphing technique using motion vectors computed from goddard earth observing system model geos forward processing fp data to forward backward propagate microwave maps is applied to produce global gridded precipitation estimates at fine resolution finally a kalman filter is used to combine these morphing based estimates and the microwave calibrated ir estimates into a weighted estimate note that the imerg early is forward only in morphing process the gsmap suite including gsmap mvk v7 hereafter referred to gsmap mvk and gsmap nrt v7 hereafter referred to gsmap nrt is used in our study gsmap mvk integrates pmw data with ir data in order to produce high spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 1 h global precipitation estimates similarly it also uses a kalman filter to refine the precipitation rate propagated based on the atmospheric moving vector derived from two successive ir images unlike imerg system the gsmap system propagates and applies the kalman filter only for the precipitation estimates identified by the pmw algorithms it indicates that the kalman filter used in gsmap system strongly depend on the pmw based precipitation estimates ushio et al 2009 also this reflects that the ir based information is not fully utilized in gsmap system another difference between imerg and gsmap is that the ir data is not calibrated by pmw data using pertinent algorithms besides the gsmap system only uses dpr data as a calibration standard for pmw retrievals not including gmi data as for gsmap nrt the precipitation estimates of this near real time product are based on the gsmap mvk algorithm but some processes are simplified in order to keep operability and latency in near real time the major differences between gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk in processing are as follows 1 japan meteorological agency jma forecast data is used as atmospheric information 2 latest available jma merged satellite and in situ data global daily sea surface temperature mgdsst data is used as sea surface temperature information 3 forward only cloud movement is used in algorithm real time tmpa 3b42 v7 hereafter referred to tmpa rt estimates integrates most pmw data available from low earth orbit satellites and ir measurements from geostationary platforms this near real time product mainly uses ir based retrievals to fill the pmw coverage gaps unlike imerg tmpa is calibrated to the trmm combined instrument i e precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi until the demise of trmm satellite after that tmpa rt uses climatological satellite calibrations so continue despite the loss of quality for tmpa estimates huffman 2018 as for persiann ccs this product mainly uses persian ccs algorithm to estimate global rainfall in near real time and at higher spatial resolution 0 04â despite using ir data as the sole input sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 since its release persiann ccs has been widely used in the research flood and drought prediction and more nguyen et al 2019 due to the data period of gsmap nrt v7 starting from january 2017 these six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets from february 2017 to january 2019 2 years are selected to evaluate for obtaining new insights for data users and algorithm developers 2 2 2 two ground reference precipitation datasets in our study cpc unified and gauge satellite merged gridded hourly mpa product are regarded as the benchmarks in the evaluation over the globe and mainland china respectively cpc unified developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center was used as ground truth in global evaluation which combines gauge based observations from more than 17 000 gauges over the globe the optimal interpolation oi with orographic consideration is applied to produce a real time gauge based precipitation product xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 however cpc unified shows poor performance in tropical africa and antartica meanwhile its quality varies with the gauge network density despite that this dataset performed the best performance by intercomparing among the 22 precipitation datasets over the globe beck et al 2017 the spatial distribution of gauge density for cpc unified is presented in fig 1c another reference data is gauge satellite merged mpa which developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration and is used in the evaluation over mainland china mpa combines the gauge based observations from more than 30 000 automatic weather stations aws with cmorph firstly the rain gauge observations go through strict quality control refer to ren et al 2010 then the cmorph estimates are corrected by using the probability density function to reduce the systematic errors finally the oi method is applied to combine quality controlled gauge observations and gauge corrected cmorph producing the final gauge satellite merged mpa dataset shen et al 2014 overall mpa has lower bias which is less than 10 and outperforms other gauge based precipitation products over mainland china shen et al 2013 additionally the aws used in mpa are mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid areas see fig 1d note that only liquid rainfall occurrences are investigated in the evaluation over mainland china because of the aws observations used in mpa only suiting for liquid rainfall events thus we use the flag information of gauge numbers within one grid cell in the mpa system to strictly match the satellite estimates and liquid rainfall occurrences detected by aws to exclude the snowfall events to ensure the robustness of the evaluation results only grid cells with at least one gauge in these two reference datasets are chosen to execute evaluation 2 3 methodology the performance of spps is basically behaved in detection capability and accuracy the evaluation metrics used in this study are listed in table 2 probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are used to examine the detection capability of spps pod gives how often the satellite correctly detects precipitation while far gives how often the satellite detects precipitation when the rain gauge does not detect precipitation the correlation coefficient cc shows the degree of linear correlation between the reference values and satellite estimates and it is able to reflect the capability of reproducing the temporal variations wang et al 2018 while relative bias bias describes the systematic bias of satellite only precipitation estimates and it is able to reflect the underestimation bias 0 or overestimation bias 0 of ones tian et al 2009 proposed an error decomposition scheme to decompose the bias also known as total bias t into hit bias h miss bias m and false bias f the relationship between total bias and its three error components can be defined by t h m f the detailed calculation formulas of total bias and its three independent components are shown in table 2 as for rmse this metric describes the errors of spps and it reflects the accuracy of spps because it is used to measure the deviation between the estimates and the observations it is worth noting that the rain no rain threshold is set to 0 2 mm for hourly time scale and 1 mm for daily time scale 3 results 3 1 global evaluation and intercomparison between six spps the results of our global analysis associated with six spps are organized into two parts in this section general analysis of six spps over the whole globe and the spatial analysis of six spps over the globe these two aspects will show a relatively comprehensive picture of the performance for each spp note that all spps are aggregated precipitation estimates to cpc unified scales 0 5â and daily before the evaluation metrics calculated 3 1 1 global general analysis table 3 presents the summary of evaluation metrics for six spps at 0 5â and daily resolution over the whole globe almost all results of evaluation metrics indicate that imerg late is slightly better than the other five spps over the globe one can see that imerg suite including imerg early and imerg late shows the best performance in detection capability over the whole globe with higher pod value of 0 75 while the persiann ccs and tmpa rt reveal inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns relative to other spps in terms of cc imerg suite has higher cc value of exceeding 0 6 performs better than other four spps suggesting that imerg suite can better reproduce the temporal dynamics over the globe in the bias column we found that all spps overestimate precipitation over the whole globe except for tmpa rt obviously the gsmap suite dramatically overestimates precipitation with higher bias values of exceeding 34 over the whole globe conversely the tmpa rt underestimates precipitation with the bias value of 13 16 lastly the accuracy of imerg suite outperforms that of other four spps over the whole globe with lower rmse values of less than 7 25 mm the evaluation results show that the imerg suite estimates have been slightly improved building upon the success of the tmpa rt ones especially for detectability 3 1 2 global view of spatial analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of pod and far for six spps at 0 5 and daily resolution over the globe it is seen that the comparable spatial distribution patterns of pod and far are found between these four spps except for tmpa rt and persiann ccs overall the worse performance in detecting capability for six spps is found in the western conterminous united states couns southern canada eastern brazil southwestern mongolia western china southeastern australia andean mountains in south america etc our results are consistent with previous studies e g tang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 lu and yong 2018 su et al 2018 beck et al 2019 chen et al 2019b evidently persiann ccs and tmpa rt perform relatively worse detection capability over most parts of the world the error feature of six spps is another research target fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of bias and rmse for six spps at 0 5 and daily resolution over the globe as shown in fig 3a f the negative and positive bias values of six spps are scattered over the globe overall imerg suite and tmpa rt perform relatively well with slight underestimation or overestimation over the globe while gsmap suite and persiann ccs perform relatively worse dramatically overestimate precipitation with their bias over 100 in the most of couns western china mongolia japan india kazakhstan etc finally the spatial distribution of rmse values for six spps are presented in fig 3g l obviously these six spps share the considerable similarities in spatial distribution the most remarkable common feature is that higher rmse values are distributed in these areas which have ample medium and heavy rainfall events see fig 1a such as eastern couns most of south america japan southeastern china india bangladesh etc it seems that the rmse values are related to the precipitation intensity 3 2 evaluation of five spps in mainland china as is known to all that tmpa rt will be stopped when imerg products are satisfactory huffman 2018 on the basis of the global analysis the performance of imerg suite is generally better than that of tmpa rt over the globe thus the five spps except for tmpa rt will be evaluated at finer spatial resolution 0 1 over mainland china to essentially reveal their error features 3 2 1 routine analysis table 4 presents the summary of evaluation metrics for five spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china almost all results of metrics indicate that imerg suite shows relatively better performance than other three spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china it is worth noting that gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk have fairly good performance in detection capability however they have the highest bias and rmse values both at hourly and daily time scales suggesting that gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk can better detect the rainfall events correctly but their precipitation amount is not accurate enough in contrast persiann ccs performs relatively worse performance in detection capability but better in accuracy of precipitation amount the spatial analysis of five spps in mainland china is given fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of pod and far for five spps at hourly and daily time scales the comparable spatial distribution patterns appear in most spps except for persiann ccs both at hourly and daily time scales compare with other spps persiann ccs has lower pod values less than 0 5 in most mainland china at hourly time scale and its far values are exceeding 0 5 fig 4q and s thus not surprisingly its pod value is as low as 0 20 while its far value is up to 0 73 over the whole mainland china table 4 meanwhile all spps are relatively good at detecting the heavy precipitation because of their higher or lower pod or far values appearing in these regions which have ample heavy precipitation though fig 4 reveals the detection capability of five spps it couldn t reflect the error feature for each spp the spatial distribution of bias and rmse for five spps at hourly and daily time scales over mainland china is presented in fig 5 in terms of bias gsmap suite exhibits significant overestimates over semi humid and northern humid areas fig 5c d and h i compared with other three spps in addition persiann ccs have remarkable underestimates in humid areas and overestimates the precipitation in the residual parts of mainland china fig 5e and j for the rmse gsmap suite has higher rmse values in humid areas relative to other three spps both at hourly and daily time scales it is clear that the rmse values of imerg suite and persiann ccs gradually decrease from southeast to northwest also five spps have relatively higher rmse values in humid regions both at hourly and daily time scales it seems that the rmse is related to the precipitation intensity this further confirms the necessity of investigating the relationship between rmse and precipitation intensity 3 2 2 tracing the error sources for five spps in mainland china firstly we decomposed the total bias of each spp into hit bias miss bias and false bias at hourly time scale over mainland china and then accumulated the total bias and three hourly error components i e hit bias miss bias and false bias into cold season including these months of two year study period from november to december and january to april and warm season including these months of two year study period from may to october respectively in this section our analysis is mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid areas because of having dense rain gauge networks over these areas the figs 6 and 7 show the spatial distribution patterns of the total bias and its three error components for the cold and warm seasons respectively for cold season fig 6 the spatial distribution patterns of five spps in total bias and three error components share considerable similarities the most obvious common feature is that the total biases of five spps is exceeding 150 in most semi humid regions one can see that the false error is the dominant error components causing the overestimates for imerg suite and persiann ccs over these areas while gsmap suite s overestimates are attributed primarily to the false biases but the hit biases cannot be neglected over these areas also it cannot be ignored that the miss error is one of major error components for persiann ccs over these areas on the other hand we also found that some differences exist between these five spps gsmap suite and persiann ccs overestimate precipitation in the northern humid regions because of the larger false biases 150 in addition persiann ccs seriously underestimates precipitation in the southern humid regions this is due primarily to missed precipitation 80 over these areas for warm season fig 7 all spps display lower biases relative to the cold season which is consistent with previous results e g yong et al 2016 guo et al 2016 chen et al 2019b imerg early and imerg late or gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk almost show a high degree of consistency in spatial distribution patterns of the total bias and three error components except for the miss error however imerg late has lower miss biases than imerg early over the large areas of semi humid and humid regions correspondingly gsmap mvk shows lower miss biases than gsmap nrt but only for the large areas of semi humid regions meanwhile imerg suite and gsmap suite exhibit slight underestimates or overestimates over humid regions these underestimates or overestimates can be traced to miss or false biases additionally the main error sources for gsmap suite in semi humid come from false and hit biases differing from imerg suite for their error sources coming from misses and false biases finally the total errors of persiann ccs are dominated by the miss errors 60 in the large areas of mainland china 3 3 evaluation of estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity the pdf is a metric used to evaluate and compare different spps in terms of estimation sensitivity and precipitation intensity and it is also a good method to describe the performance of spps to measure light precipitation kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 fig 8 displays the variations of pdf values for six spps with precipitation intensity both at daily and hourly time scales in global analysis it is obvious that more than 75 precipitation is under 1 mm day as shown in fig 8a b the majority of spps display slight underestimation in detecting precipitation with intensity less than 1 mm day except for tmpa rt the significant differences of pdf exist between these six spps in the precipitation intensity range 1 mm day persiann ccs shows poorer performance with overestimating rainfall events in the precipitation intensity range 1 40 mm day there are some differences between imerg early and imerg late or gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk which is possibly caused by the different retrieval algorithms and input sources overall tmpa rt exhibit better detecting rainfall events than other five spps in most precipitation intensities the variations of pdf values for five spps with precipitation intensity share considerable similarities in regional and global analyzes see fig 8a d the most significant common feature is that the pdf values of five spps have a clear decreasing tendency with precipitation intensity just as a coin has two sides some significant differences exist between these two spatial scale analyses for example compared with global analysis five spps in regional analysis overestimate more proportions in the precipitation intensity range 1 mm day and reduce proportions in precipitation with intensity less than 1 mm day for the hourly scenario imerg suite shows evident overestimates in most precipitation intensities while gsmap suite significantly overestimates rainfall events in the precipitation intensity range 1 5 mm h surprisingly persiann ccs have similar proportions with mpa dataset in most precipitation intensities 4 discussion based on global and regional results it seems that the rmse accuracy is related to the precipitation intensity additionally the accuracy of these spps in heavy precipitation is closely associated with the detectability and prediction for flood events kucera et al 2013 hou et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus it is a meaningful effort that investigating the relationship between rmse and precipitation intensity which is helpful for data users to understand the accuracy of spps under different rainfall events overall there is a power function relationship between rmse and logarithm of precipitation intensity which implies the errors of six spps having a stronger dependency on precipitation intensity as shown in fig 9 furthermore we found that all spps display better detectability in flood prone areas which have ample heavy precipitation see figs 1a b 2 and 4 however spps in these areas are unsatisfactory because of their higher rmse values see figs 3g l and 5k t it can be seen that the rmse of six spps in precipitation with intensity exceeding 32 mm day 8 mm h accounts for more than 30 of corresponding precipitation intensity see fig 9 the poor accuracy of these six spps in such rainfall events may produce a negative impact in hydrologic studies to predict flood events as is known to all that spps have been widely applied in flood detection and prediction khan 2011 hong et al 2019 for example two important global flood systems i e global hydrological prediction system ghps wang et al 2011 and global flood monitoring system gfms wu et al 2014 are all driven by the tmpa and gpm products obviously the power function relationship can provide a method to quickly obtain the rmse values of different rainfall events for spps which is helpful for data users knowing the accuracy of spps when using spps to force the flood prediction system the two more advanced instruments including dpr and gmi are aim to more accurate instantaneous precipitation estimates particularly for light and solid precipitation in particular the precipitation sensitivity of spaceborne radar increased from 0 5 mm h for pr to 0 2 mm h for dpr the performance of spps in light rainfall events in gpm era has attracted wide attention of algorithm developers and data users the majority of these six spps overestimate the proportions of light rainfall events 1 2 mm day across the globe especially for imerg suite see fig 8b in regional analysis the proportions of light rainfall events 0 2 0 4 mm h for imerg suite show more significant overestimates with the bias of exceeding 68 at hourly time scale see fig 8f the similar phenomenon also appears at daily time scale see fig 8d we noted that there are some studies investigating the performance of light precipitation for satellite precipitation products for example chen et al 2013 found that the tmpa rt underdetects light rainfall also gauge corrected imerg v3 and v5 underestimate the proportions in light rainfall while gauge corrected imerg v4 overestimates ones wang et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 even found that the proportions of light precipitation were underestimated in the gauge corrected imerg v3 and gsmap products on the other hand investigating the accuracy of light precipitation for spps is still lacking in previous studies in our study results all six spps have large rmse values greater than 2 mm or 0 5 mm at daily or hourly time scale in the light rainfall events it means that the current satellite precipitation retrievals in light rainfall still exhibit poor performance in estimation despite introducing dpr data to improve retrievals consequently we suggested that future efforts for algorithm developers still need to be focused on the detectability and estimation of light rainfall the uncertainty of results is an issue in the evaluation we have examined the rmse as a function of different rain gauge density over humid regions of mainland china as shown in fig 10 overall there are having a decreasing trend of rmse values with the increased rain gauge density indicating that using a sparse rain gauge network might underestimate the performance of spp for example the bad performance of the spps appears in the most areas of africa central australia western china and so on where the rain gauges for cpc unified or mpa are sparsely and unevenly distributed in these areas we though that the bad performance of the spps in these areas with sparse rain gauges is not actual performance of spps but of the evaluation approach itself also previous studies have confirmed that the uncertainty of the evaluation for spps is associate with rain gauge density e g tian et al 2018 tang et al 2018 prakash et al 2019 all these studies revealed that a dense rain gauge density network used in the evaluation can better reflect the actual performance of spps besides the reference data including satellite information is one of sources for the uncertainty of the evaluation one can see that the input sources of reference data mpa are overlapping with those of these six spps to some extent which might cause some potential uncertainties in the evaluation the data developers hope that tmpa rt stops when imerg products are satisfactory huffman 2018 our evaluation results show that the imerg suite including imerg early and imerg late generally outperforms tmpa rt especially for detectability however the performance of imerg suite is still unsatisfactory in some areas such as western and northern couns western china central australia etc the cause is primary contributable to the impacts of complex topography and bad climate situations on the precipitation structure and associated challenges with satellite retrievals from space daly et al 2008 guo et al 2017 chen et al 2019b generally speaking the equivalent imerg suite outperforms the tmpa rt and is satisfactory at this time we expect that our study results can provide a feedback for data developers to decide whether tmpa rt can stop or not on the basis of our findings we proposed some valuable suggestions for data developers and data users 1 overall imerg late should be given priority in near real time applications because of its excellent performance among the six satellite only precipitation products in addition data users should give priority to using imerg early in the applications with strong timeliness due to its 4 h date latency 2 though gsmap suite also uses a kaman filter to combine the forward and backward estimates into a weighted estimate its accuracy is obviously worse than imerg suite s we speculate that one reason is that the kalman filter used in gsmap retrieval system only combines the precipitation estimates identified by the pmw algorithms another reason may be that the weights used in kalman filter are not precise enough thus we suggested that the data developers should further improve the gsmap retrieval system in determining the weights and making full use of ir based information finally separating the errors into components is helpful for algorithm developers to trace error and reduce them tian et al 2009 we revealed the error sources for these mainstream spps over mainland china however whether the evaluation results for cold and warm seasons from mainland china can be extended to other regions of the world still needs to be further investigated 5 conclusion this study is to comprehensively evaluate and compare the performance of six purely satellite derived precipitation datasets i e imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt gsmap mvk tmpa rt and persiann ccs on the basis of global and regional evaluation results we answered four questions that both users and developers widely concerned for satellite precipitation estimates our major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 generally speaking imerg late is the best one of six satellite only precipitation data sets over the globe while the gsmap suite including gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk shows the worst performance with relatively larger values of bias 28 and rmse 1 39 mm at hourly time scale and 9 41 mm at daily time scale compared with trmm based tmpa rt the gpm based imerg estimates including both imerg early and imerg late significantly reduce the precipitation underestimates over the most parts of the world although imerg generally seems superior to tmpa its performance is still unsatisfactory in some specific regions particularly over complex topography such as western and northern couns western china etc 2 the rmse has a power function to the logarithm of precipitation intensity in all six purely satellite derived precipitation data sets on the basis of this functional relationship we found that the rmse values of six satellite only precipitation data sets account for over 30 of corresponding precipitation intensity in rainfall events exceeding 32 mm day or 8 mm h it is predictable that these spps with lower precision in heavy rainfall events may produce the negative impacts in hydrologic studies to predict flood events when using these spps to force the flood monitoring and forecasting system 3 the imerg suite overestimates the proportions of light rainfall events 1 2 mm day over the globe furthermore imerg and gsmap display more significant overestimates over mainland china especially for imerg with bias over 68 at hourly time scale as for the accuracy all spps in light precipitation is poor with the rmse values exceeding 2 mm and 0 5 mm for daily and hourly time scales respectively 4 the five purely satellite derived precipitation products including imerg early imerg late gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and persiann ccs share some similarities and differences in spatial distribution patterns of total bias and its three components in cold and warm seasons for the similarity these products display the large overestimates in semi humid areas in cold season and these overestimates are primarily attributed to the false errors 150 on the other hand some remarkable differences exist between these five satellite only precipitation products persiann ccs shows serious underestimates in southern humid regions both in two seasons which is primarily attributed to missed precipitation while gsmap suite evidently overestimates the precipitation in semi humid areas in warm season relative to other three spps these overestimates mainly come from the hits and false biases over these areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

5873,analysis of the long term variability of terrestrial streamflow is important for a wide range of studies in hydroclimatology and environment however the common practice of detecting only the monotonic trend cannot actually reflect the long term variability and change in streamflow thus resulting in an insufficient or biased understanding this study focuses on the non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial variability across the continental united states us annual streamflow data observed during 1951 2002 at 530 stations across the continental us are studied the discrete wavelet spectrum dws is used to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance the results indicate significant non monotonic trends in annual streamflow at 172 stations in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone in the regions east of 100 w however considering only the monotonic trends being significant at only 38 stations causes a biased understanding of the long term variability of streamflow in the northeast zone the results also reveal that the non monotonic trend of streamflow in the continental us was mainly controlled by the climatic conditions and that the effects of landscape conditions were weak the average aridity index ai of 0 86 1 35 and its dws based significance level 0 1 can indicate the significant non monotonic trend of streamflow at 95 confidence level the regions that can meet the above two conditions account for 16 of the global terrestrial surfaces by considering non monotonic trends the change ratio of streamflow is found to be double of that of ai while similar change ratios are obtained from the monotonic trend results as the reason of significant underestimation due to the partly equal roles of low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend identification of the non monotonic trend should be more desirable for the detection and attribution of the long term variability and change in streamflow keywords streamflow long term variability nonstationarity trend significance discrete wavelet spectrum 1 introduction a good understanding of the long term variability of the hydrological cycle hc which usually depends on the observation period is important for a wide range of studies in hydroclimatology and environment for instance the trends of dominant hydrological variables are of great interest serinaldi et al 2018 as it is generally accepted that climate change would accelerate the hc resulting in an increase in the water vapor content wvc of the atmosphere roads et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2011 terai et al 2017 however it has long been realized that changes in global hc differ significantly from that of wvc milly and dunne 1994 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 as the change ratio only 1 3 k of global mean precipitation is much lower than that nearly 7 k of wvc fläschner et al 2016 more importantly if one concerns streamflow as a primary variable characterizing the variability and changes in hc for hydrology and water resources studies its variability is controlled by the water balance and thus significantly differs from that of wvc precipitation and evaporation niemann and eltahir 2005 trenberth 2011 due to the inevitable effects of terrestrial conditions the streamflow variability mainly determines the quantity of available water resources and its changes fang and shen 2017 however an acceleration in precipitation and evaporation processes does not always mean an increase in streamflow and its significant trend harman and troch 2013 mcgregor 2017 generally under the controls of both climatic and landscape conditions the water balance and its variability are governed by the relative availability of water precipitation p and energy potential evaporation e0 and also modulated by physical processes flow generation and convergence of the landscape surface carmona et al 2014 which can be quantitatively described by the budyko framework budyko 1974 however the mechanisms of water balance have large differences across multi time scales zhang et al 2008 with more effects from landscape conditions at short timescales but more effects from climatic conditions at decadal and larger timescales bloschl et al 2013 greve et al 2015 following the budyko framework many studies have examined the mean water balance and its long term changes in individual catchments wang et al 2016 and also the space time symmetry for investigating the similarity between spatial between catchments and temporal between years variability sivapalan et al 2011 despite these studies and advances our understanding of the long term variability and change in terrestrial streamflow and especially its spatial variability and physical causes gudmundsson et al 2019 remains largely inadequate due to two causes the first is that human activities specifically referencing the water conservancy projects reservoir construction etc significantly influence the natural variability of streamflow processes ficklin et al 2018 especially in developing countries and with short data lengths which hinders the possibility of detecting the natural variability and trends of streamflow the other is that monotonic trends in streamflow ahn and palmer 2015 are usually detected rice et al 2016 yeh and wu 2018 however they cannot actually reflect the long term variability and change of streamflow as they may be related to climate variability rather than persistent changes in time blöschl et al 2019 comparatively non monotonic trend or low frequency variability is more prevalent in the long term variability of streamflow sang et al 2018 due to the influences of global climatic patterns such as the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo sagarika et al 2015 nalley et al 2019 even though the long term variability of streamflow for short data records would tend to be monotonic the relative attributions of climatic patterns and human activities are not easily distinguished in many situations only considering the monotonic trend cannot verifiably describe the long term variability of hydrological variables and its detection would inevitably underestimate the statistical significance and cause biased understanding in the present study we aim to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and its spatial variability in the continental united states us we use the streamflow data observed over the period 1951 2002 at 530 stations with little influences from human activities across the continental us the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method is used to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance many previous studies have analyzed the streamflow data in the continental us over different periods however such studies have reported significant monotonic trends only in the local midwest regions but insignificant monotonic trends in other large regions across the continental us lins and slack 1999 sagarika et al 2015 by considering the non monotonic trends we address two specific issues here 1 is the long term variability of streamflow across the continental us actually insignificant or is it just underestimated and 2 what causes the spatial heterogeneity in the significance of the long term variability of streamflow the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the study area and data section 3 describes the discrete wavelet spectrum method the analysis and results of the long term variability of streamflow are presented in section 4 a discussion of the results is made in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 study area and data in this study the annual and seasonal i e winter spring and summer streamflow records from the us geological survey usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn are used to detect the non monotonic trends of annual and seasonal streamflow the hcdn dataset contains streamflow observations from the usgs stream gages that are considered to be relatively unaffected by anthropogenic effects land use changes measurement changes and measurement error streamflow data in the us are commonly expressed in water years which commence in october based on data availability the data considered in this study are those observed over a period of 52 years 1951 2002 starting in october 1950 and ending in september 2002 two criteria are considered for selecting the streamflow stations 1 the variability of streamflow is natural and little influenced by anthropogenic effects such as reservoirs and 2 nested catchments are not considered based on these a total of 530 streamflow stations are selected for this study fig 1 shows the locations of these stations the 530 streamflow stations and the observed streamflow data exhibit tremendous variations in their characteristics with basin drainage area ranging from 48 90 km2 to 2060 km2 and monthly mean flow ranging from 0 14 m3 s to 125 75 m3 s it is relevant to note that many studies have used this data set from the hcdn as well as subsets larger sets of streamflow from hcdn for different purposes using different methods e g sivakumar 2003 sivakumar and singh 2012 vignesh et al 2015 agarwal et al 2016 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 especially in the context of studying streamflow complexity variability and connections using modern concepts wavelet theory chaos theory and complex networks in time and or space however they did not report the long term variability especially the non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial variability as the key target of this study for investigating the water balance and its influence on the long term variability of streamflow the dem digital elevation model data with a spatial resolution of 30 m are used to draw the watershed boundary corresponding to each of the 530 stations see fig 1 the precipitation and evaporation data are collected from the cru climatic research unit data set with a 0 25 spatial resolution based on these the areal precipitation p and potential evaporation e0 at each watershed are calculated these three datasets streamflow precipitation and evaporation form the basis for analyzing the influence of climatic variability on the long term variability of streamflow in the continental us 3 methodology discrete wavelet spectrum the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method is used in this study to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance here the non monotonic trend emphasizes the continuous and slow variation corresponding to the largest timescale which is determined by the length of the data records it tends to be non monotonic rather than monotonic due to the natural variability of hydrological processes differing from those methods that are used for detecting monotonic trends such as the widely used mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1948 the advantage of the dws method is that it first separates the non monotonic trend through the discrete wavelet decomposition and then quantify its weight quantified by its variance in the original time series which determines its statistical significance although separation of the non monotonic trend can also be achieved by the empirical mode decomposition emd method and perhaps others its significance evaluation in the method is unreasonable due to its deficiencies e g spectral leakage problems and the low frequency oscillation and monotonic trends cannot be accurately distinguished sometimes sang et al 2012 thus it is not used for this study the detection of the non monotonic trend by the dws method is explained as follows the discrete wavelet transform dwt of a time series f t is performed as wickerhauser 1994 1 w f j k f t ψ j k t d t w i t h ψ j k t a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j t b 0 k where ψ t is the given mother wavelet with its complex conjugate ψ t strang nguyen 1996 a 0 and b 0 are constants that define the shape of ψ t and wf j k is the discrete wavelet coefficient under the decomposition level j i e timescale a 0 j and time order k the dyadic dwt with a 0 2 and b 0 1 in eq 1 is widely used for hydroclimatic time series analysis agarwal et al 2017 the highest decomposition level m depends on the data length l of time series f t m log 2 l the component fj t under each level j j 1 2 m is reconstructed as 2 f j t k w f j k ψ 2 j t k there are totally m 1 components for the original time series f t with two components of fm d t and fm a t at the highest decomposition level m obtained from the detail d and approximation a coefficient sets respectively the component fm a t tends to be monotonic but the non monotonic component fm d t is also a part of the long term variability of f t at the highest level m therefore the sum of fm d t and fm a t is called as non monotonic trend in this study denoted as fm t fm d t fm a t and distinguished from the monotonic trend fm a t fig 2 presents a schematic to illustrate the difference among the non monotonic trend concerned in this study and the monotonic trend and linear trend 3 e j var f j t some previous studies have indicated that the dws of diverse noise types strictly follow the same exponentially declining rule as the timescale increases with an exponential base of 2 sang 2012 and that it can be defined as the reference dws whose uncertainty can be evaluated by the monte carlo method and quantified by a confidence interval at the significance level concerned by comparing the dws of the hydrological time series to be analyzed with the reference dws the statistical significance of the non monotonic trend in the former can be evaluated specifically if the dws of the non monotonic trend is above the confidence interval estimated it is significant otherwise it is insignificant at the significance level concerned in this study the dws method is used to detect and evaluate the statistical significance of the non monotonic trends in streamflow data also including the areal p and e0 data besides monotonic trends of all these data are also analyzed by the mann kendall mk test for comparison 4 analysis and results 4 1 significance of the non monotonic trends in streamflow according to the results from the dws analysis about 70 of the total 530 time series of annual streamflow data indicate non monotonic trends against the 30 of monotonic trends identified by the mk test fig s1 without considering the statistical significance the monotonic decreasing trend dark blue circles in fig s1 appears only in some regions in the pacific northwest zone northeast zone and southeast zone while the monotonic increasing trend red circles in fig s1 mainly appears in the middle region of the midwest zone by evaluating their significance at 95 confidence level it is identified that the monotonic trends of annual streamflow are significant at only 38 stations in the midwest zone fig 3 a the variations in the trend s significance with data length increases are further investigated to check their stability and the starting year since when the streamflow kept its significant trend is determined the results indicate that in the midwest zone the monotonic trends of streamflow are not significant until to the 2000s i e close to the data end in fig s2a it implies that the monotonic trends cannot keep their significance but change with data length meaning that the direction of the monotonic trends alternates between increase and decrease as the data length increases as a result the direction tends to be non monotonic rather than monotonic similar results have been reported in tamaddun et al 2016 differing from the monotonic trends significant non monotonic trends in annual streamflow are detected at 172 stations using the dws method especially in the regions east of 100 w fig 3b and the longitudinal break may be associated with the elevation effects of the rocky mountains and the low level jet climatology over there brunsell 2010 moreover the non monotonic trends of annual streamflow kept their significance since the 1970s in the midwest zone in fig s2b being much earlier than that of the monotonic trends similar results can also be found in the winter spring streamflow from january to may fig s3 in wet seasons which accounted for a high proportion of annual streamflow for the summer from july to september streamflow in dry seasons its significant variability can only be detected at about 30 stations no matter considering the monotonic or non monotonic trends fig s4 overall the results obtained here indicate that the annual streamflow processes present significant non monotonic trends in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone which are underestimated if only considering the monotonic trend based on the results of the monotonic trends it is reasonable to conclude that the significant variability of streamflow in the whole period in many regions especially in the midwest zone in the continental us would be overlooked 4 2 physical causes of the non monotonic trends in streamflow to explore the physical causes of the non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial variability the major factors that are widely known to influence the water balance are considered here following the physical mechanisms of the hydrological cycle the variability of streamflow is mainly determined by the degrees of water surplus and deficit and the transformation between them based on the budyko framework it is known that the variability of water balance is governed by the relative availability of water precipitation and energy potential evaporation and also modulated by the physical land surface conditions runoff generation and conflux mechanisms therefore two types of factors are considered here the first type mainly reflects the influences of the underlying surface conditions including the watershed area streamflow magnitude q the index of streamflow depth versus e0 and the index of runoff ratio q p the second type mainly reflects the influence of climatic variability including the precipitation magnitude p potential evaporation magnitude e0 aridity index p e0 and the significance of the non monotonic trends of p e0 and p e0 the index of elevation and the parameter α in the budyko method mainly determine the composition through water or energy control of streamflow and have close relationship with the index of runoff ratio q p and aridity index p e0 however they have weak influences on the long term variability of streamflow carmona et al 2014 thus they are not considered here overall there is a total of ten factors fig 4 presents the relationship between the significance of the non monotonic trends of streamflow and each of the above ten factors the plots clearly indicate the weak influences of watershed area and streamflow magnitude with the values in the range of 48 90 2060 km2 and 0 14 125 75 m3 s respectively for the 530 stations considered in this study interestingly it is found that there are three factors that correspond to the significant non monotonic trends of streamflow in certain range of values about 1000 mm for p and e0 and about 1 0 for p e0 however the results also reveal that the chosen range of value of each factor cannot always ensure the significant non monotonic trends of streamflow implying more contribution or combined effects from other factors moreover the significance of non monotonic trends of p e0 keeps good a positive relationship with that of streamflow by comparing the significant variability of p and e0 it is further found that the significant variability of p e0 is determined more by p than by e0 this is mainly due to the much less variability of e0 versus p at inter annual and larger timescales as explained in duan et al 2006 besides fig 5 presents the relationship between the significance of the monotonic trends of streamflow and each of the above ten factors it indicates that the variables p e0 p and e0 do not indicate significant monotonic trends in most of the 530 basins which may be the causes of the insignificant monotonic trends of streamflow fig 5 also shows that the monotonic trend of streamflow has good linear relationship with only those of p e0 p and e0 and has weak relation with those of the other seven factors to be more specific the monotonic increase in p and p e0 but decrease in e0 will cause the monotonic increase in streamflow with similar change ratios among the three variables it has a significant difference from that obtained from the non monotonic trend results in fig 4 with a nearly double the variability ratio of streamflow compared with that of p and p e0 similar results were also documented by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 and chiew 2006 who reported that 1 change in precipitation results in 1 5 2 5 or even larger change in watershed runoff depending upon the degree of buffering by the storage processes and other factors this could be the reason for the significant underestimation in the detection of the monotonic trend from the above results it may be construed that the long term variability of streamflow across the continental us is mainly controlled by the climatic conditions and that the effects of land surface conditions are weak it should be noted however that the land surface conditions would control the runoff generation and conflux mechanisms and thus would have a large influence on the water balance of the streamflow variability at annual seasonal and smaller timescales moreover the effect of p is much higher than that of e0 due to the less variability of the latter to further determine the climatic conditions that may contribute to significant non trend of streamflow i e dws q the index of ai i e p e0 and its dws based significance i e dws p e0 which have close relationship with dws q are chosen fig 6 a presents their scatter diagram it clearly shows that on the condition of the average p e0 value 1 02 with a range of value of 0 86 1 35 at 95 confidence level being coupled with the dws p e0 0 1 the non monotonic trend of streamflow can keep its statistical significance at 95 confidence level to further clarify the difference between the non monotonic and monotonic trends their statistical significance described by the index of variance is compared to this end fig 6 b shows two relationships the first is simply a positive relationship indicating that more significant monotonic trend can ensure more significant non monotonic trend the other relationship is for the insignificant monotonic trends with the variance smaller than 0 1 a part of their corresponding non monotonic trends has the variance values bigger than 0 2 and thus significant which would be overlooked if considering only the monotonic trend in addition the variance relationship between the low frequency oscillation i e fm d t in eq 2 versus the monotonic trend i e fm a t in eq 2 indicates their equal roles for describing the long term variability of streamflow thus the detection of non monotonic trends should be more desirable 5 discussion from the above results it may be interpreted that in the semi arid and semi humid regions ai 0 86 1 35 the balanced level of water precipitation and energy potential evaporation is the prerequisite that more likely causes the significant long term variability of streamflow however in the arid or humid regions the dominant role of water or energy compared with energy or water tends to generate smooth variation of streamflow but not its significant variability as for the ai the significance of its variability especially its spatial heterogeneity may be connected to the climatic patterns pdo amo etc which may be examined by considering atmospheric circulation and its effects tootle et al 2005 we will look into this further in the future the gridded cru data are used again to analyze the variability of p and e0 and the regions that meet the condition of p e0 0 86 1 35 and dws p e0 0 1 are identified and drawn at the global scale accounting for 16 of the global terrestrial surfaces as shown in fig 7 it may be speculated that the non monotonic trends of streamflow in these regions are significant however more observed hydroclimatic data with weak anthropogenic effects are needed to further confirm the above speculation at regional scales generally it is known that the variability of rainfall extremes has good connection with that of the total precipitation magnitude therefore following the above speculation it may be interpreted that the long term variability of rainfall extremes at large timescales in the regions identified in fig 7 should be significant and not only the anthropogenic effect but also the natural climatic variability need to be considered to attribute their variability and changes further as for the flooding which is generated from rainfall extremes its variability at large timescales would be more complex due to the influence of human activities including water conservancy projects reservoir construction urbanization and others therefore more underlying surface data are needed for the detection and attribution in addition to the above three issues deserve to be noted first the recharge from ice snow melt to streamflow pathak et al 2018 with the q p values larger than 1 0 as shown in fig 4 would increase the complexity of streamflow variability however this factor has only weak influence on the overall results obtained in the present study as the ice snow related stations only have a small proportion in the total 530 stations second the results obtained in the present study are based on the basin areas in the range of 48 90 2060 km2 although larger basins are not considered in this study and so there is no way to verify as of now it is reasonable to assume that the variability of streamflow at larger timescales would be smoother due to their stronger storage and regulation abilities compared with that in smaller basins third the long term variability depends on the length of streamflow data records and corresponds to the timescales of 50 years in this study even in the case of longer data records of streamflow its long term variability always includes both low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend and both of them need to be considered to obtain good understanding therefore these three issues could not influence the reliability of the results obtained in this study 6 conclusions in this study the non monotonic trend of streamflow observed during 1951 2002 across the continental us was detected using the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method distinguishing the study from the common practice of detecting monotonic trend the results indicated non monotonic trends in the whole period in about 70 of the total 530 streamflow time series studied while 30 of the streamflow time series exhibited monotonic trends by further carrying out a statistical significance test the significant non monotonic trends in annual streamflow were identified in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone in the regions east of 100 w while only considering monotonic trends being significant at only 38 stations causes the biased understanding of the long term variability of streamflow in the northeast zone a total of ten influencing factors of climatic variability and landscape conditions was considered to explore the causes of the significance of non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial heterogeneity it was found that the non monotonic trend of streamflow across the continental us was mainly controlled by the climatic conditions and that the effects of land surface conditions were weak furthermore the combined effects of the aridity index ai magnitude reflecting the relative balance between water and energy and its variability determine the significance of long term variability of streamflow especially the average ai value of 0 86 1 35 and dws ai 0 1 can ensure the significant non monotonic trend of streamflow at 95 confidence level considering non monotonic trends the change ratio of streamflow was double of that of ai while their similar change ratios were obtained from the monotonic trend results as the reason of understanding the long term variability of streamflow in summary detection of non monotonic trend rather than monotonic trend is more helpful to understand the long term variability of streamflow as both the low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend play equal roles in describing it this was attempted in this study and the outcomes are encouraging however more studies are needed to further

5873,analysis of the long term variability of terrestrial streamflow is important for a wide range of studies in hydroclimatology and environment however the common practice of detecting only the monotonic trend cannot actually reflect the long term variability and change in streamflow thus resulting in an insufficient or biased understanding this study focuses on the non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial variability across the continental united states us annual streamflow data observed during 1951 2002 at 530 stations across the continental us are studied the discrete wavelet spectrum dws is used to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance the results indicate significant non monotonic trends in annual streamflow at 172 stations in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone in the regions east of 100 w however considering only the monotonic trends being significant at only 38 stations causes a biased understanding of the long term variability of streamflow in the northeast zone the results also reveal that the non monotonic trend of streamflow in the continental us was mainly controlled by the climatic conditions and that the effects of landscape conditions were weak the average aridity index ai of 0 86 1 35 and its dws based significance level 0 1 can indicate the significant non monotonic trend of streamflow at 95 confidence level the regions that can meet the above two conditions account for 16 of the global terrestrial surfaces by considering non monotonic trends the change ratio of streamflow is found to be double of that of ai while similar change ratios are obtained from the monotonic trend results as the reason of significant underestimation due to the partly equal roles of low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend identification of the non monotonic trend should be more desirable for the detection and attribution of the long term variability and change in streamflow keywords streamflow long term variability nonstationarity trend significance discrete wavelet spectrum 1 introduction a good understanding of the long term variability of the hydrological cycle hc which usually depends on the observation period is important for a wide range of studies in hydroclimatology and environment for instance the trends of dominant hydrological variables are of great interest serinaldi et al 2018 as it is generally accepted that climate change would accelerate the hc resulting in an increase in the water vapor content wvc of the atmosphere roads et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2011 terai et al 2017 however it has long been realized that changes in global hc differ significantly from that of wvc milly and dunne 1994 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 as the change ratio only 1 3 k of global mean precipitation is much lower than that nearly 7 k of wvc fläschner et al 2016 more importantly if one concerns streamflow as a primary variable characterizing the variability and changes in hc for hydrology and water resources studies its variability is controlled by the water balance and thus significantly differs from that of wvc precipitation and evaporation niemann and eltahir 2005 trenberth 2011 due to the inevitable effects of terrestrial conditions the streamflow variability mainly determines the quantity of available water resources and its changes fang and shen 2017 however an acceleration in precipitation and evaporation processes does not always mean an increase in streamflow and its significant trend harman and troch 2013 mcgregor 2017 generally under the controls of both climatic and landscape conditions the water balance and its variability are governed by the relative availability of water precipitation p and energy potential evaporation e0 and also modulated by physical processes flow generation and convergence of the landscape surface carmona et al 2014 which can be quantitatively described by the budyko framework budyko 1974 however the mechanisms of water balance have large differences across multi time scales zhang et al 2008 with more effects from landscape conditions at short timescales but more effects from climatic conditions at decadal and larger timescales bloschl et al 2013 greve et al 2015 following the budyko framework many studies have examined the mean water balance and its long term changes in individual catchments wang et al 2016 and also the space time symmetry for investigating the similarity between spatial between catchments and temporal between years variability sivapalan et al 2011 despite these studies and advances our understanding of the long term variability and change in terrestrial streamflow and especially its spatial variability and physical causes gudmundsson et al 2019 remains largely inadequate due to two causes the first is that human activities specifically referencing the water conservancy projects reservoir construction etc significantly influence the natural variability of streamflow processes ficklin et al 2018 especially in developing countries and with short data lengths which hinders the possibility of detecting the natural variability and trends of streamflow the other is that monotonic trends in streamflow ahn and palmer 2015 are usually detected rice et al 2016 yeh and wu 2018 however they cannot actually reflect the long term variability and change of streamflow as they may be related to climate variability rather than persistent changes in time blöschl et al 2019 comparatively non monotonic trend or low frequency variability is more prevalent in the long term variability of streamflow sang et al 2018 due to the influences of global climatic patterns such as the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo sagarika et al 2015 nalley et al 2019 even though the long term variability of streamflow for short data records would tend to be monotonic the relative attributions of climatic patterns and human activities are not easily distinguished in many situations only considering the monotonic trend cannot verifiably describe the long term variability of hydrological variables and its detection would inevitably underestimate the statistical significance and cause biased understanding in the present study we aim to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and its spatial variability in the continental united states us we use the streamflow data observed over the period 1951 2002 at 530 stations with little influences from human activities across the continental us the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method is used to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance many previous studies have analyzed the streamflow data in the continental us over different periods however such studies have reported significant monotonic trends only in the local midwest regions but insignificant monotonic trends in other large regions across the continental us lins and slack 1999 sagarika et al 2015 by considering the non monotonic trends we address two specific issues here 1 is the long term variability of streamflow across the continental us actually insignificant or is it just underestimated and 2 what causes the spatial heterogeneity in the significance of the long term variability of streamflow the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the study area and data section 3 describes the discrete wavelet spectrum method the analysis and results of the long term variability of streamflow are presented in section 4 a discussion of the results is made in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 study area and data in this study the annual and seasonal i e winter spring and summer streamflow records from the us geological survey usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn are used to detect the non monotonic trends of annual and seasonal streamflow the hcdn dataset contains streamflow observations from the usgs stream gages that are considered to be relatively unaffected by anthropogenic effects land use changes measurement changes and measurement error streamflow data in the us are commonly expressed in water years which commence in october based on data availability the data considered in this study are those observed over a period of 52 years 1951 2002 starting in october 1950 and ending in september 2002 two criteria are considered for selecting the streamflow stations 1 the variability of streamflow is natural and little influenced by anthropogenic effects such as reservoirs and 2 nested catchments are not considered based on these a total of 530 streamflow stations are selected for this study fig 1 shows the locations of these stations the 530 streamflow stations and the observed streamflow data exhibit tremendous variations in their characteristics with basin drainage area ranging from 48 90 km2 to 2060 km2 and monthly mean flow ranging from 0 14 m3 s to 125 75 m3 s it is relevant to note that many studies have used this data set from the hcdn as well as subsets larger sets of streamflow from hcdn for different purposes using different methods e g sivakumar 2003 sivakumar and singh 2012 vignesh et al 2015 agarwal et al 2016 yasmin and sivakumar 2018 especially in the context of studying streamflow complexity variability and connections using modern concepts wavelet theory chaos theory and complex networks in time and or space however they did not report the long term variability especially the non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial variability as the key target of this study for investigating the water balance and its influence on the long term variability of streamflow the dem digital elevation model data with a spatial resolution of 30 m are used to draw the watershed boundary corresponding to each of the 530 stations see fig 1 the precipitation and evaporation data are collected from the cru climatic research unit data set with a 0 25 spatial resolution based on these the areal precipitation p and potential evaporation e0 at each watershed are calculated these three datasets streamflow precipitation and evaporation form the basis for analyzing the influence of climatic variability on the long term variability of streamflow in the continental us 3 methodology discrete wavelet spectrum the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method is used in this study to detect the non monotonic trend of streamflow and evaluate its statistical significance here the non monotonic trend emphasizes the continuous and slow variation corresponding to the largest timescale which is determined by the length of the data records it tends to be non monotonic rather than monotonic due to the natural variability of hydrological processes differing from those methods that are used for detecting monotonic trends such as the widely used mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1948 the advantage of the dws method is that it first separates the non monotonic trend through the discrete wavelet decomposition and then quantify its weight quantified by its variance in the original time series which determines its statistical significance although separation of the non monotonic trend can also be achieved by the empirical mode decomposition emd method and perhaps others its significance evaluation in the method is unreasonable due to its deficiencies e g spectral leakage problems and the low frequency oscillation and monotonic trends cannot be accurately distinguished sometimes sang et al 2012 thus it is not used for this study the detection of the non monotonic trend by the dws method is explained as follows the discrete wavelet transform dwt of a time series f t is performed as wickerhauser 1994 1 w f j k f t ψ j k t d t w i t h ψ j k t a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j t b 0 k where ψ t is the given mother wavelet with its complex conjugate ψ t strang nguyen 1996 a 0 and b 0 are constants that define the shape of ψ t and wf j k is the discrete wavelet coefficient under the decomposition level j i e timescale a 0 j and time order k the dyadic dwt with a 0 2 and b 0 1 in eq 1 is widely used for hydroclimatic time series analysis agarwal et al 2017 the highest decomposition level m depends on the data length l of time series f t m log 2 l the component fj t under each level j j 1 2 m is reconstructed as 2 f j t k w f j k ψ 2 j t k there are totally m 1 components for the original time series f t with two components of fm d t and fm a t at the highest decomposition level m obtained from the detail d and approximation a coefficient sets respectively the component fm a t tends to be monotonic but the non monotonic component fm d t is also a part of the long term variability of f t at the highest level m therefore the sum of fm d t and fm a t is called as non monotonic trend in this study denoted as fm t fm d t fm a t and distinguished from the monotonic trend fm a t fig 2 presents a schematic to illustrate the difference among the non monotonic trend concerned in this study and the monotonic trend and linear trend 3 e j var f j t some previous studies have indicated that the dws of diverse noise types strictly follow the same exponentially declining rule as the timescale increases with an exponential base of 2 sang 2012 and that it can be defined as the reference

detected at 172 stations using the dws method especially in the regions east of 100 w fig 3b and the longitudinal break may be associated with the elevation effects of the rocky mountains and the low level jet climatology over there brunsell 2010 moreover the non monotonic trends of annual streamflow kept their significance since the 1970s in the midwest zone in fig s2b being much earlier than that of the monotonic trends similar results can also be found in the winter spring streamflow from january to may fig s3 in wet seasons which accounted for a high proportion of annual streamflow for the summer from july to september streamflow in dry seasons its significant variability can only be detected at about 30 stations no matter considering the monotonic or non monotonic trends fig s4 overall the results obtained here indicate that the annual streamflow processes present significant non monotonic trends in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone which are underestimated if only considering the monotonic trend based on the results of the monotonic trends it is reasonable to conclude that the significant variability of streamflow in the whole period in many regions especially in the midwest zone in the continental us would be overlooked 4 2 physical causes of the non monotonic trends in streamflow to explore the physical causes of the non monotonic

the monotonic trend i e fm a t in eq 2 indicates their equal roles for describing the long term variability of streamflow thus the detection of non monotonic trends should be more desirable 5 discussion from the above results it may be interpreted that in the semi arid and semi humid regions ai 0 86 1 35 the balanced level of water precipitation and energy potential evaporation is the prerequisite that more likely causes the significant long term variability of streamflow however in the arid or humid regions the dominant role of water or energy compared with energy or water tends to generate smooth variation of streamflow but not its significant variability as for the ai the significance of its variability especially its spatial heterogeneity may be connected to the climatic patterns pdo amo etc which may be examined by considering atmospheric circulation and its effects tootle et al 2005 we will look into this further in the future the gridded cru data are used again to analyze the variability of p and e0 and the regions that meet the condition of p e0 0 86 1 35 and dws p e0 0 1 are identified and drawn at the global scale accounting for 16 of the global terrestrial surfaces as shown in fig 7 it may be speculated that the non monotonic trends of streamflow in these regions are significant however more observed hydroclimatic data with weak anthropogenic effects are needed to further confirm the above speculation at regional scales generally it is known that the variability of rainfall extremes has good connection with that of the total precipitation magnitude therefore following the above speculation it may be interpreted that the long term variability of rainfall extremes at large timescales in the regions identified in fig 7 should be significant and not only the anthropogenic effect but also the natural climatic variability need to be considered to attribute their variability and changes further as for the flooding which is generated from rainfall extremes its variability at large timescales would be more complex due to the influence of human activities including water conservancy projects reservoir construction urbanization and others therefore more underlying surface data are needed for the detection and attribution in addition to the above three issues deserve to be noted first the recharge from ice snow melt to streamflow pathak et al 2018 with the q p values larger than 1 0 as shown in fig 4 would increase the complexity of streamflow variability however this factor has only weak influence on the overall results obtained in the present study as the ice snow related stations only have a small proportion in the total 530 stations second the results obtained in the present study are based on the basin areas in the range of 48 90 2060 km2 although larger basins are not considered in this study and so there is no way to verify as of now it is reasonable to assume that the variability of streamflow at larger timescales would be smoother due to their stronger storage and regulation abilities compared with that in smaller basins third the long term variability depends on the length of streamflow data records and corresponds to the timescales of 50 years in this study even in the case of longer data records of streamflow its long term variability always includes both low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend and both of them need to be considered to obtain good understanding therefore these three issues could not influence the reliability of the results obtained in this study 6 conclusions in this study the non monotonic trend of streamflow observed during 1951 2002 across the continental us was detected using the discrete wavelet spectrum dws method distinguishing the study from the common practice of detecting monotonic trend the results indicated non monotonic trends in the whole period in about 70 of the total 530 streamflow time series studied while 30 of the streamflow time series exhibited monotonic trends by further carrying out a statistical significance test the significant non monotonic trends in annual streamflow were identified in the northeast zone and the northern part of the southeast zone in the regions east of 100 w while only considering monotonic trends being significant at only 38 stations causes the biased understanding of the long term variability of streamflow in the northeast zone a total of ten influencing factors of climatic variability and landscape conditions was considered to explore the causes of the significance of non monotonic trends of streamflow and its spatial heterogeneity it was found that the non monotonic trend of streamflow across the continental us was mainly controlled by the climatic conditions and that the effects of land surface conditions were weak furthermore the combined effects of the aridity index ai magnitude reflecting the relative balance between water and energy and its variability determine the significance of long term variability of streamflow especially the average ai value of 0 86 1 35 and dws ai 0 1 can ensure the significant non monotonic trend of streamflow at 95 confidence level considering non monotonic trends the change ratio of streamflow was double of that of ai while their similar change ratios were obtained from the monotonic trend results as the reason of understanding the long term variability of streamflow in summary detection of non monotonic trend rather than monotonic trend is more helpful to understand the long term variability of streamflow as both the low frequency oscillation and monotonic trend play equal roles in describing it this was attempted in this study and the outcomes are encouraging however more studies are needed to further verify the results obtained from this study especially about the significance of non monotonic trends of streamflow at the global scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

5874,nowcasting of surface precipitation from radar data typically relies on algorithms that calculate advection such as the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple this method offers high spatial and temporal resolution but it cannot represent the growth decay of precipitation and non stationary advection vector fields in this study we propose some nowcasting rainfall models based on advection diffusion equation with non stationary motion vectors the diffusion term of this equation gives to smoother rainfall predictions for lead times and increased skill scores the motion vectors are updated in each time step by solving a system of two dimensional 2d burgers equation the proposed forecasting models use the following three steps first an initial motion vector field is approximated using the variational echo tracking vet algorithm second a forecast is obtained for each time step by solving a time dependent advection or advection diffusion equation in this step the motion vectors are updated by solving burgers equation lastly forecasts are evaluated with lead times from 2 5 min to 3 h and forecasts are compared with rain rate observations for six events over a 250 250 km2 region in southeastern south korea to observe the effects of the diffusion term and burgers equation four variants of the proposed modeling methods are considered depending on the equations advection equation type 1 advection and burgers equations type 2 advection diffusion equation type 3 and combination of the advection diffusion and burgers equations type 4 the forecasts from the type 1 method are very similar to those of maple the other models type 2 4 yielded clearly better skill scores and correlation on average with up to 3 h lead time models that use burgers equation type 2 and type 4 give much better scores than other methods using fixed motion vectors when the temporal variation of the motion vectors is large keywords nowcasting maple advection diffusion burgers equation motion vectors 1 introduction precipitation is extremely difficult to forecast because of the chaotic and non linear nature of meteorological system as a result numerical weather predictions nwp are very sensitive to small perturbations in initial conditions boundary conditions and round off errors the most successful nowcasting of precipitation uses weather radar which can provide good areal coverage with high resolution many radar based nowcasting techniques have been developed over the years bellon and austin 1978 browning et al 1982 dixon and wiener 1993 handwerker 2002 seed 2003 rasmussen et al 2003 mueller et al 2003 turner et al 2004 fox and wikle 2005 ruzanski et al 2011 nowcasting of precipitation fields commonly involves lagrangian extrapolations of advection mechanisms from radar data mueller et al 2003 bowler et al 2004 li and lai 2004 this method can provide high resolution forecasts using a simpler algorithm than nwp models the lagrangian extrapolation model is formally stated as 1 r t 0 τ x r t 0 x α where r t 0 x α is the observed precipitation field at the starting time t 0 and location x α and r t 0 τ x is the forecast precipitation field after lead time τ at t 0 τ and position x the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple was developed by germann and zawadzki 2002 they studied the scale dependence of predictability for spatial resolution of 4 km over a 2720 km 2720 km domain using fourier low pass filtering by assuming the lagrangian dynamics u x y u x y v x y dx dt dy dt eq 1 is obtained from the conservation equation for r 2 dr dt r t dx dt r x dy dt r y 0 where x x y is the position of precipitation pattern and u u v is the advection vector that depends on spatial coordinates alone then the solution of 2 satisfies the persistence model in eq 1 maple uses a variational echo tracking vet algorithm that minimizes a cost function to determine the advection vector u u v see section 3 the vet algorithm provides motion vectors at multiple scales and can account for changes in the size and intensity of precipitation over the forecasting period however lagrangian persistence fails when the source sink term or non stationary terms in the motion field are dominant over the advection term hence better prediction require a model that accurately predicts the source sink term and non stationary features of the motion field germann and zawadzki 2002 prediction of the source sink term is related to predictions of growth or decay of a precipitation system several researchers have attempted to consider growth and decay terms in forecasting models tsonis and austin 1981 mueller et al 2003 radhakrishna et al 2012 tang and matyas 2018 however it is found that these are rather difficult task and the results were not much successful most recent research efforts have tried to account for growth and decay of precipitation systems using orographic forcing foresti et al 2018 or the diurnal cycle atencia et al 2017 in bechini and chandrasekar 2017 doppler wind information is used to enhance the extrapolation technique bowler et al 2006 analyze the relative importance of the evolution of advection fields and concluded that uncertainties due to the advection fields are less important than uncertainties in the evolution of the precipitation field this conclusion is likely only valid if the advection vectors of the precipitation field are stationary the present study questions whether the nature of advection vector affects the forecasts see section 5 4 as for the non stationarity of the motion vectors which also presents challenges when using the lagrangian persistence model the present research addresses this problem by generating a time dependent advection vector that is updated at each time step of the forecasting process as an alternative to maple the proposed method solves advection or an advection diffusion equations directly without relying on the assumption of lagrangian persistence 1 the two dimensional 2d burgers equation see section 4 and the advection diffusion equation are solved simultaneously to resolve non stationary vector field the present paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the rainfall events and data used in this study section 3 provides a brief description of the maple algorithm that was developed by the radar group at mcgill university the forecasting methods developed in the present study are given in section 4 forecasts obtained from proposed methods are compared with those of maple in section 5 the final section summarizes our results 2 data setup and evaluation methods recordings of six rainfall events in a southeastern 312 312 km2 area of south korea were selected for analysis fig 1 the data used in the study are rainfall intensity r fields converted from the composite radar reflectivity z using the relationship z 300 r 1 4 all the computations discussed below deal with fields of rainfall rate with units of mm h 1 and any pixels with magnitude 0 1 mm h 1 are considered as not having rain the computation ranges over 1248 2 pixels with resolution of 0 25 km the initial motion vector is computed using vet with resolution of 10 km over 250 250 km2 which is the common area shared by three radars within the domain in this rectangular region bilinear interpolation or extrapolation is applied to vectors when they are used in semi lagrangian schemes and our equation based schemes we choose continuous and categorical verification strategies to evaluate the different forecasts the correlation coefficient and mean absolute error mae are used as continuous indicators the correlation coefficient is calculated with the following equation germann and zawadzki 2002 3 r t n t r 0 t r f t n t r 0 2 n t r f 2 1 2 where r t is the correlation coefficient at time t n t is the number of pixels in the quality mask region and r 0 and r f are the observed and forecast rain rate fields in mm h 1 respectively the quality mask chooses all pixels with non negative values at time t inside the area marked with a heavy red line 250 250 km2 in fig 1 the number of pixels n t will change over time but n 1 t n 3 t and n 2 t n 4 t where n i t is the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t of a forecast calculated with method type i i 1 2 3 4 see section 4 to verify the forecasts delivered by the methods we tested binary rain no rain events were classified by applying thresholds all pixels with rain rate values r above a certain threshold r t were considered rainy and all other pixels were considered to be without rain for each tested lead time we applied this threshold to the forecast and observed the rain fields in the quality mask using these binary forecasting images the following symbols are defined to describe the number of forecast pixels falling into each class a hits b misses c false alarms d correct negatives we also selected skill scores for evaluating the forecasting methods including the probability of detection pod the false alarm rate far the critical success index csi and the equitable threat or gilbert score ets they are defined using the counters a b c and d as pod a a b far c a c csi a a b c and ets a w a b c w where w a b a c a b c d for continuous verification indices the mean absolute error mae is defined as follows mae t 1 n t n t r f t r o t where n t is the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t 3 overview of maple algorithm before introducing our methods we will briefly summarize the standard maple algorithm maple s two main steps are finding the motion vector field using vet and extrapolating radar echoes using constant a motion vector in a semi lagrangian scheme note that the our schemes and maple both use the vet algorithm to determine the initial motion vector 3 1 variational echo tracking the vet algorithm germann and zawadzki 2002 is used to obtain an initial motion vector from rain rate data this technique minimize the following cost function 4 j vet u j 1 j 2 the first term j 1 in 4 is the sum of the squares of the residuals of conservation eq 2 and is calculated using an upstream semi lagrangian scheme j 1 ω β x r t 0 x r t 0 δ t x u δ t 2 dxdy where β is a weighting factor that presents the quality of the data the second term in 4 j 2 is a smoothness penalty function j 2 γ ω 2 u x 2 2 2 u y 2 2 2 2 u x y 2 2 v x 2 2 2 v y 2 2 2 2 v x y 2 dxdy where γ is a constant weight the conjugate gradient algorithm is used to find the global minimization solution of the cost function 4 u u v to avoid convergence toward secondary minima a scaling guess procedure is used we adopt the motion vector fields starting with a coarse resolution of one vector in 250 250 km 2 then move to a resolution of 5 5 vectors and finally 25 25 vectors spatial resolution of 10 10 km 2 3 2 semi lagrangian scheme we employ the semi lagrangian backward scheme in germann and zawadzki 2002 to generate forecast the semi lagrangian scheme is obviously preferable over a constant vector scheme since it allows for rotation and nearly conserves mass the lead time τ is divided into n time steps of length δ t with τ n δ t and α is iteratively calculated as α u t 0 x α 2 δ t where the motion vector u t 0 x is obtained from the vet algorithm at time t 0 in this scheme the origins of precipitation echoes follow upstream streamlines and will end up at a particular grid point in the forecast field with longer lead times however the origin may not be located at the grid point in the current rain field or it may be outside the domain in the former case bilinear interpolation is used to force the origin onto a grid point in the latter case we impose a negative value on the grid point and label the pixel as a no data point recall that the quality mask region is the common area inside 250 250 km2 without any negative valued pixels for all lead times verification scores were computed with data taken from only this quality mask region 4 forecast models based on partial differential equations pdes the four types of nowcasting methods that we have developed are based on time dependent pdes the vet algorithm is used to find the initial motion vector and then the motion vector can be used in calculations of four types of pdes advection equation type 1 advection equation and burgers equation type 2 advection diffusion equation type 3 and advection diffusion equation and burgers equation type 4 the four methods share the following common steps 1 find the motion vector field u u v at t 0 by vet 2 solve time dependent pdes to derive forecasts 3 compare the forecasts with observations a more detailed explanation of four types of forecasts follows 4 1 type 1 advection equation the first method is based on the simple advection equation rainfall intensities r x y t are advected by motion vector u which is stationary in time instead of the lagrangian persistence relation 1 the following pde is solved in type 1 with the initial observation field r x y t 0 and the initial vector u x y t 0 generated by the vet algorithm at time t t 0 5 r x y t t u x y t 0 r x y t x v x y t 0 r x y t y to approximate the partial derivative terms x r or y r the centered difference formula wendroff 1968 r x i y j t x r x i δ x y j t r x i δ x y j t 2 δ x i j 2 n 1 is used in the computation domain and the conditions r x 0 y j r x 1 y j and r x n 1 y j r x n y j are assumed for the boundary pixels where δ x 0 25 km the type 1 method gives forecasts that are similar to those of maple s semi lagrangian extrapolation this result is expected because the semi lagrangian persistence eq 1 is the analytical solution of the advection eq 5 used in the type 1 forecast building on the type 1 equation precipitation models can be updated by adding a diffusion term or coupling the equation to other pdes the type 2 3 and 4 forecasting schemes represent the main results of this study 4 2 type 2 moving motion vectors using burgers equation maple and type 1 assume that the motion vector field is stationary for lead times however real motion vector fields will change over time we assume that the motion vector field can be advected itself and changes over time and follows a physically meaningful equation including a diffusion term that is we assume that the motion vector field follows a fluid equation such as the 2d burgers equation 6 u t u u x v u y μ 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v t u v x v v y μ 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where μ is a kinematic viscosity burgers equation is one of the fundamental equation in fluid mechanics involving both nonlinear propagation and diffusion effects with the pressure term removed in navier stokes n s equations 2d burgers equation is used for natural application such as modeling of gas mechanics brio and hunter 1992 and shallow water wave investigation bartuccelli et al 1985 in meteorology burgers equation is primarily used for data assimilation for instance the kalman filter from burgers equation was used in menard 1994 to investigate problems related to atmospheric data assimilation and meteorological forecasting in stahl and morten aamo 2011 this equation is also used as a constraint equation to obtain the desired image vector from image sequences for image motion estimation this process is similar to estimate motion vector to generate forecasting rain fields from observed precipitation images although this equation is not perfect for modeling the motion of precipitation fields it is the simplest equation that includes the minimum conditions advected itself changes over time and includes diffusion term we want to assume we apply the eq 6 to the initial vector u x y t 0 obtained from the vet algorithm to update the motion vector at each time step from the eq 6 the motion vector u x y t k can be updated at each time t k t 0 k δ t k 1 2 with 10 10 km2 resolution 25 25 vectors the motion vector u x y t k updated at each time is interpolated and extrapolated and is then substituted into the motion vector term of eq 5 to generate the forecasting field r x y t k the same first derivative formula from the type 1 forecast is used and for the second derivative term in 6 the centered difference quotient wendroff 1968 is used 2 u x i y j t x 2 u x i δ x y j t 2 u x i y j t u x i δ x y j t δ x 2 where i j 2 n 1 and δ x 10 km the constant coefficient μ in eq 6 is related to the smoothness of the motion vector field u the larger the value of μ the smoother the motion vector u x y t i here μ is used as a fixed value such as 0 2 3 3 m s 1 and is determined empirically 4 3 type 3 advection diffusion equation in nature fluid transport is governed by a combination of advection and diffusion the type 1 forecast assumes that only advection acts on a rain cell in jinno et al 1993 and kawamura et al 1997 they showed that 2d advection diffusion equation is able to describe the observed rainfall intensity at ground level this model assumes that over a short time period the main forces driving a rain cell are advection and diffusion in the type 3 scheme diffusion term is added as the main forcing term in eq 5 if the flow has a constant diffusion coefficient and is incompressible without sink or source the equation can be simplified to 7 r t u r x v r y ν 2 r x 2 2 r y 2 where ν is the diffusion coefficient or mass diffusivity of particle motion in rainfall forecasts this term plays a filtering or a smoothing role for longer forecast lead times in this work the value ν is varied in the ranges 0 ν 0 1 1 67 ms 1 when ν 0 the type 3 scheme is the same as type 1 but if ν 0 the smoothing effect will increase some of the skill scores 4 4 type 4 advection diffusion equation with burgers equation the last scheme is combination of the type 2 and type 3 schemes the non zero diffusion coefficients ν and μ smooth the rain intensity field r x y t and motion vector u x y t respectively the type 4 scheme solves eq 7 using the updated motion vector u x y t from eq 6 the motion vectors in the type 4 scheme are the same as those in type 2 that is in the type 4 scheme forecasting results are smoothed by the diffusion term while using the vector updated by burgers equation 4 5 time steps for numerical computations time dependent pdes are solved with the explicit runge kutta order 4 rk4 method and the finite difference method fdm throughout this paper note that according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1967 when solving a pde using an explicit time integration scheme one must select time steps δ t that are small enough relative to the magnitude of the motion vector u the space intervals δ x δ y and the viscosity of the fluid to ensure the convergence of numerical methods for pdes we use min and km as units of time and distance respectively if no diffusion term ν 0 is included in the model eq 7 explicit iteration method will converge only for δ t 0 4 min however smaller δ t is desired for lager ν so we use δ t 0 1 min with the range 0 ν 0 1 1 67 ms 1 for all methods based on pdes when using the time iterative algorithm rk4 the time intervals δ t do not need to be the same when forecasting the rain rate r in eqs 5 or 7 and motion vector u in eq 6 since the spatial resolution of 0 25 km and 10 km are different we use different updating time steps of δ t 0 1 min and δ t 2 5 min for the precipitation field r and motion vector u respectively 5 forecast evaluation results 5 1 examples of nowcasting fig 2 shows forecasts generated by maple type 1 and type 3 the type 1 forecasts are almost the identical to those of maple in the type 3 results the shape of forecast is similar to that of type 1 and only the smoothing effect is added the three vectors in the first row of fig 3 are those obtained from the vet algorithm using the three consecutive rain rate maps r x y t 0 r x y t 0 δ t and r x y t 0 2 δ t with time step δ t 2 5 min the bottom motion vectors are predicted by burgers eq 6 using the starting vector at 0300 top left in fig 3 for diffusion coefficient μ 0 2 3 33 ms 1 in the vectors in the first row of the fig 3 the northeast arrows in the red or green circle move from left to right in the bottom row the motion vectors move in the same direction in fig 4 the correlation functions show the average correlations or cosine angles between two vectors using 3 note that the correlation value of two vectors in 3 is cos θ where θ is the angle formed by the two vectors an average correlation coefficient of 0 9 means that the average angle between two vectors is about cos 1 0 9 25 8 in fig 4 u vet t 0 and u vet t represent the motion vectors obtained from the vet at time t 0 and each subsequent time t respectively and u sim t motion vector simulated by burgers equation at time t using the initial vector u vet t 0 fig 4 a shows the correlations between u vet t 0 and u vet t and between u sim t and u vet t in the quality mask region see section 2 the same correlations are presented similarly in the overlap region precipitation area andthe quality mask region in fig 4 a the correlation coefficient of u sim t is slightly higher than that of u vet t 0 in fig 4 b the difference between two correlations is much larger than that of fig 4 a thus the predicted motion vector u sim t from the type 2 scheme is more similar to the vector derived from the vet algorithm that uses the observed rainfall over time than the initial vector u vet t 0 since the predicted motion vector u sim t changes over time the type 2 forecasts are different from those of type 1 or maple as shown in fig 5 in particular a large difference appears at the western edge of the area and this difference is moved east by the motion vector u type 4 forecasts are smoother than type 2 forecasts as shown in fig 5 in the binary verification shown in fig 6 the type 4 forecast has a larger count a hits and smaller b misses than maple for the lead time of 3 h in this event the type 4 forecast shows much better performance than does maple 5 2 average skill scores of six events by comparing the average skill scores of the six events we compare the performance of maple against that of the four proposed methods in fig 7 one can see that the average skill scores of maple such as pod csi and ets are lower than those of type 2 and type 4 for a lead time of 3 h and with threshold of r t 0 1 1 and 2 mm h 1 for r t 0 1 the difference in pod between type 2 and type 4 is large but as r t increases this difference is reduced thus the smoothing effect increases the skill score for predicting weak precipitation in fig 8 the averaged correlation coefficient r t and the mae between the forecast and observed fields are shown the shapes of r t for all methods are not exponential functions so the corresponding life time l 0 r t dt is not easy to find instead the integrated values 0 3 r t dt are considered and they are ordered as follows type 4 1 58 type 3 1 48 type 2 1 42 maple type 1 1 33 where the numbers in parentheses are the integrating values for 3 h lead time in fig 8 since type 4 has the best correlation function we conclude that burger equation and the non zero smoothing coefficient ν improve the forecast the mae values are not significantly different between the methods and are slightly reduced by the smoothing effect as for maes types 2 4 are lower than maple for 1 7 h lead time but for type 2 and type 4 the maes are slightly larger than maple after 1 7 h this difference may have been due to the difference in n t the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t between maple and the proposed methods type 2 or type 4 5 3 dependence on diffusion coefficients turner et al 2004 applied forecast filters that reduce the root mean square error rmse optimal forecast filters off and operationally useful near optimal forecast filters noff have been developed using wavelet transforms and are applied in maple these filters grant improved precipitation forecasts in terms of correlation and rmse however improvements in skill scores such as csi were not noticeable in the present work filtering or smoothing effects are obtained by adding a diffusion term to pdes such as eq 7 this diffusion term allows the forecasts or solutions to be smoothed as time progresses the skill scores can be improved with this term and the intensity of smoothing can be controlled by altering the diffusion coefficients ν fig 9 shows correlation coefficients and csi scores for type 3 and type 4 forecasts calculated with ν 0 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 note that when ν 0 type 3 reduces to type 1 and type 4 reduces to type 2 for ν 0 1 type 4 gives the best correlation and csi scores the orders of integrating values of r t for 3 h lead time are type 4 0 1 1 64 type 4 0 05 1 58 type 3 0 1 1 54 type 4 0 01 type 3 0 05 1 48 type 4 0 1 42 type 3 0 01 1 39 type 1 maple 1 33 where the superscripts and numbers in parentheses indicate the corresponding ν and integrating values respectively larger ν values may lead to better validation scores but very large ν values are less realistic and offer only limited improvement in smoothing in the csi score shown in fig 9 the score does not increase significantly even if ν increases from 0 05 to 0 1 in addition the scores are affected more by the type of forecast than the value of ν 5 4 dependence on events note that temporal variation of vectors is critical to the accuracy of a forecast thus the forecast can be improved by improving the accuracy of the motion vectors the difference between the prediction results of type 2 and maple depends on the kind of event that is to be predicted if the difference can be attributed to temporal variation of motion vectors we need to find a measure of the state of the motion vector to measure the degree of non stationarity of the vector fields u x y t we estimate the rate of change of the motion vector over time u t as u u which is the advection term in eq 7 the hourly averages of spatial mean values for u u are listed in table 1 for each event for motion vectors u x y t the vet algorithm is used for each event up to 3 h lead times every 10 min if the motion vector in eq 7 is stationary the shape of the vector will not change significantly over time and the magnitude of u t will be close to zero in this case the type 2 forecasts will likely resemble those of maple and type 1 on the other hand if the motion vector fields are strongly non stationary type 2 will produce different forecasts from maple based on the mean values in table 1 we classify the six events into two classes of stationarity with the threshold of 0 001 ms 2 the temporal variation of the vectors can be evaluated quantitatively by calculating the correlation coefficient with the initial vector u vet 0 from vet in the top row of fig 10 when u u 0 001 mm s 2 the correlation scores decrease faster than the steady state cases of the bottom row the predicted vectors u sim t from burgers equation also have much higher correlations with u vet t than the initial vector does in the steady state cases of the bottom row in fig 10 the gaps between the two correlations are not much more than those of non stationary precipitation events the top row in fig 10 similarly the upper row in fig 11 shows the average verification scores for events with thresholds greater than 0 001 ms 2 and the bottom row shows the average scores for the remaining three events in this figure the type2 and type 4 methods using burgers equation yield much better skill scores than the other methods when u u is relatively large whereas the other cases does not show significant improvement in the skill scores this finding implies burgers equation improves prediction when the motion vector varies greatly in time 5 5 relative computational costs the computational costs of the pdes based methods type 1 4 depend mainly on the number of iteration needed to solve the pdes thus the four methods should take longer to compute than maple if we take δ t 0 1 min 1800 iterations should be performed for 3 h of forecasting under these conditions type 1 and type 3 took 1 9 times longer than maple and type 2 or type 4 took about 2 25 times longer than maple for the 3h forecasting the pde based methods naturally smooth forecasting through the diffusion parameter but they require greater computational costs and complexity than semi lagrangian methods alternatively a backward semi lagrangian scheme can be applied with burgers equation for motion vector updating semi lagrangian algorithms that use burgers equation which are not considered in this study could be a simple and low cost solution and we plan to study this approach in future work 6 conclusions and discussion this paper has presented forecasting models that use advection diffusion equations with non stationary motion vectors the presented methods solve pdes with initial conditions of the rain field and motion vectors obtained from the vet algorithm to test performance all four proposed methods were tested with radar rain field data with high spatial resolution and the resulting evaluation scores were compared with those of the maple algorithm the type 1 method uses simple advection equation and its forecasts are very similar to those of maple type 2 uses the same advection equation as type 1 but also solves a 2d system of burgers equations and updates the motion vector in each time step this scheme provides distinctly different forecasts from the type 1 and maple whose the motion vector is not updated after the initial motion vector the type 3 algorithm uses the same motion vector as type 1 but is based on the advection diffusion equation adding the diffusion term improves both the correlation and skill scores of the forecast the diffusion term is implemented with a filter or smoothing to eliminate the increased dissipation of numerical errors and small scale characteristics this filtering effectively increases the correlation coefficient and skill score at the small threshold r t the smoothness of the image can also be controlled easily by changing the diffusion coefficient ν the type 4 algorithm combines the features of type 2 and type 3 and it is the best method for smoothing the prediction since it updates the motion vectors in every time step type 4 forecasts are generally better than those if maple and the other methods we find that the type 2 and type 2 methods for updating motion vectors are superior to maple especially when the motion vector changes dramatically in a short time to measure the change of u over time we estimate the magnitude of t u using the vector obtained from the vet algorithm we expect that our new forecasting method using motion vectors that can be updated every time from the initial vector will overcome some of the weaknesses of semi lagrangian persistence for systems in which non stationarity is more important than advection author contributions s ryu and g w lee conceived of the models and wrote the manuscript

5874,nowcasting of surface precipitation from radar data typically relies on algorithms that calculate advection such as the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple this method offers high spatial and temporal resolution but it cannot represent the growth decay of precipitation and non stationary advection vector fields in this study we propose some nowcasting rainfall models based on advection diffusion equation with non stationary motion vectors the diffusion term of this equation gives to smoother rainfall predictions for lead times and increased skill scores the motion vectors are updated in each time step by solving a system of two dimensional 2d burgers equation the proposed forecasting models use the following three steps first an initial motion vector field is approximated using the variational echo tracking vet algorithm second a forecast is obtained for each time step by solving a time dependent advection or advection diffusion equation in this step the motion vectors are updated by solving burgers equation lastly forecasts are evaluated with lead times from 2 5 min to 3 h and forecasts are compared with rain rate observations for six events over a 250 250 km2 region in southeastern south korea to observe the effects of the diffusion term and burgers equation four variants of the proposed modeling methods are considered depending on the equations advection equation type 1 advection and burgers equations type 2 advection diffusion equation type 3 and combination of the advection diffusion and burgers equations type 4 the forecasts from the type 1 method are very similar to those of maple the other models type 2 4 yielded clearly better skill scores and correlation on average with up to 3 h lead time models that use burgers equation type 2 and type 4 give much better scores than other methods using fixed motion vectors when the temporal variation of the motion vectors is large keywords nowcasting maple advection diffusion burgers equation motion vectors 1 introduction precipitation is extremely difficult to forecast because of the chaotic and non linear nature of meteorological system as a result numerical weather predictions nwp are very sensitive to small perturbations in initial conditions boundary conditions and round off errors the most successful nowcasting of precipitation uses weather radar which can provide good areal coverage with high resolution many radar based nowcasting techniques have been developed over the years bellon and austin 1978 browning et al 1982 dixon and wiener 1993 handwerker 2002 seed 2003 rasmussen et al 2003 mueller et al 2003 turner et al 2004 fox and wikle 2005 ruzanski et al 2011 nowcasting of precipitation fields commonly involves lagrangian extrapolations of advection mechanisms from radar data mueller et al 2003 bowler et al 2004 li and lai 2004 this method can provide high resolution forecasts using a simpler algorithm than nwp models the lagrangian extrapolation model is formally stated as 1 r t 0 τ x r t 0 x α where r t 0 x α is the observed precipitation field at the starting time t 0 and location x α and r t 0 τ x is the forecast precipitation field after lead time τ at t 0 τ and position x the mcgill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by lagrangian extrapolation maple was developed by germann and zawadzki 2002 they studied the scale dependence of predictability for spatial resolution of 4 km over a 2720 km 2720 km domain using fourier low pass filtering by assuming the lagrangian dynamics u x y u x y v x y dx dt dy dt eq 1 is obtained from the conservation equation for r 2 dr dt r t dx dt r x dy dt r y 0 where x x y is the position of precipitation pattern and u u v is the advection vector that depends on spatial coordinates alone then the solution of 2 satisfies the persistence model in eq 1 maple uses a variational echo tracking vet algorithm that minimizes a cost function to determine the advection vector u u v see section 3 the vet algorithm provides motion vectors at multiple scales and can account for changes in the size and intensity of precipitation over the forecasting period however lagrangian persistence fails when the source sink term or non stationary terms in the motion field are dominant over the advection term hence better prediction require a model that accurately predicts the source sink term and non stationary features of the motion field germann and zawadzki 2002 prediction of the source sink term is related to predictions of growth or decay of a precipitation system several researchers have attempted to consider growth and decay terms in forecasting models tsonis and austin 1981 mueller et al 2003 radhakrishna et al 2012 tang and matyas 2018 however it is found that these are rather difficult task and the results were not much successful most recent research efforts have tried to account for growth and decay of precipitation systems using orographic forcing foresti et al 2018 or the diurnal cycle atencia et al 2017 in bechini and chandrasekar 2017 doppler wind information is used to enhance the extrapolation technique bowler et al 2006 analyze the relative importance of the evolution of advection fields and concluded that uncertainties due to the advection fields are less important than uncertainties in the evolution of the precipitation field this conclusion is likely only valid if the advection vectors of the precipitation field are stationary the present study questions whether the nature of advection vector affects the forecasts see section 5 4 as for the non stationarity of the motion vectors which also presents challenges when using the lagrangian persistence model the present research addresses this problem by generating a time dependent advection vector that is updated at each time step of the forecasting process as an alternative to maple the proposed method solves advection or an advection diffusion equations directly without relying on the assumption of lagrangian persistence 1 the two dimensional 2d burgers equation see section 4 and the advection diffusion equation are solved simultaneously to resolve non stationary vector field the present paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the rainfall events and data used in this study section 3 provides a brief description of the maple algorithm that was developed by the radar group at mcgill university the forecasting methods developed in the present study are given in section 4 forecasts obtained from proposed methods are compared with those of maple in section 5 the final section summarizes our results 2 data setup and evaluation methods recordings of six rainfall events in a southeastern 312 312 km2 area of south korea were selected for analysis fig 1 the data used in the study are rainfall intensity r fields converted from the composite radar reflectivity z using the relationship z 300 r 1 4 all the computations discussed below deal with fields of rainfall rate with units of mm h 1 and any pixels with magnitude 0 1 mm h 1 are considered as not having rain the computation ranges over 1248 2 pixels with resolution of 0 25 km the initial motion vector is computed using vet with resolution of 10 km over 250 250 km2 which is the common area shared by three radars within the domain in this rectangular region bilinear interpolation or extrapolation is applied to vectors when they are used in semi lagrangian schemes and our equation based schemes we choose continuous and categorical verification strategies to evaluate the different forecasts the correlation coefficient and mean absolute error mae are used as continuous indicators the correlation coefficient is calculated with the following equation germann and zawadzki 2002 3 r t n t r 0 t r f t n t r 0 2 n t r f 2 1 2 where r t is the correlation coefficient at time t n t is the number of pixels in the quality mask region and r 0 and r f are the observed and forecast rain rate fields in mm h 1 respectively the quality mask chooses all pixels with non negative values at time t inside the area marked with a heavy red line 250 250 km2 in fig 1 the number of pixels n t will change over time but n 1 t n 3 t and n 2 t n 4 t where n i t is the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t of a forecast calculated with method type i i 1 2 3 4 see section 4 to verify the forecasts delivered by the methods we tested binary rain no rain events were classified by applying thresholds all pixels with rain rate values r above a certain threshold r t were considered rainy and all other pixels were considered to be without rain for each tested lead time we applied this threshold to the forecast and observed the rain fields in the quality mask using these binary forecasting images the following symbols are defined to describe the number of forecast pixels falling into each class a hits b misses c false alarms d correct negatives we also selected skill scores for evaluating the forecasting methods including the probability of detection pod the false alarm rate far the critical success index csi and the equitable threat or gilbert score ets they are defined using the counters a b c and d as pod a a b far c a c csi a a b c and ets a w a b c w where w a b a c a b c d for continuous verification indices the mean absolute error mae is defined as follows mae t 1 n t n t r f t r o t where n t is the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t 3 overview of maple algorithm before introducing our methods we will briefly summarize the standard maple algorithm maple s two main steps are finding the motion vector field using vet and extrapolating radar echoes using constant a motion vector in a semi lagrangian scheme note that the our schemes and maple both use the vet algorithm to determine the initial motion vector 3 1 variational echo tracking the vet algorithm germann and zawadzki 2002 is used to obtain an initial motion vector from rain rate data this technique minimize the following cost function 4 j vet u j 1 j 2 the first term j 1 in 4 is the sum of the squares of the residuals of conservation eq 2 and is calculated using an upstream semi lagrangian scheme j 1 ω β x r t 0 x r t 0 δ t x u δ t 2 dxdy where β is a weighting factor that presents the quality of the data the second term in 4 j 2 is a smoothness penalty function j 2 γ ω 2 u x 2 2 2 u y 2 2 2 2 u x y 2 2 v x 2 2 2 v y 2 2 2 2 v x y 2 dxdy where γ is a constant weight the conjugate gradient algorithm is used to find the global minimization solution of the cost function 4 u u v to avoid convergence toward secondary minima a scaling guess procedure is used we adopt the motion vector fields starting with a coarse resolution of one vector in 250 250 km 2 then move to a resolution of 5 5 vectors and finally 25 25 vectors spatial resolution of 10 10 km 2 3 2 semi lagrangian scheme we employ the semi lagrangian backward scheme in germann and zawadzki 2002 to generate forecast the semi lagrangian scheme is obviously preferable over a constant vector scheme since it allows for rotation and nearly conserves mass the lead time τ is divided into n time steps of length δ t with τ n δ t and α is iteratively calculated as α u t 0 x α 2 δ t where the motion vector u t 0 x is obtained from the vet algorithm at time t 0 in this scheme the origins of precipitation echoes follow upstream streamlines and will end up at a particular grid point in the forecast field with longer lead times however the origin may not be located at the grid point in the current rain field or it may be outside the domain in the former case bilinear interpolation is used to force the origin onto a grid point in the latter case we impose a negative value on the grid point and label the pixel as a no data point recall that the quality mask region is the common area inside 250 250 km2 without any negative valued pixels for all lead times verification scores were computed with data taken from only this quality mask region 4 forecast models based on partial differential equations pdes the four types of nowcasting methods that we have developed are based on time dependent pdes the vet algorithm is used to find the initial motion vector and then the motion vector can be used in calculations of four types of pdes advection equation type 1 advection equation and burgers equation type 2 advection diffusion equation type 3 and advection diffusion equation and burgers equation type 4 the four methods share the following common steps 1 find the motion vector field u u v at t 0 by vet 2 solve time dependent pdes to derive forecasts 3 compare the forecasts with observations a more detailed explanation of four types of forecasts follows 4 1 type 1 advection equation the first method is based on the simple advection equation rainfall intensities r x y t are advected by motion vector u which is stationary in time instead of the lagrangian persistence relation 1 the following pde is solved in type 1 with the initial observation field r x y t 0 and the initial vector u x y t 0 generated by the vet algorithm at time t t 0 5 r x y t t u x y t 0 r x y t x v x y t 0 r x y t y to approximate the partial derivative terms x r or y r the centered difference formula wendroff 1968 r x i y j t x r x i δ x y j t r x i δ x y j t 2 δ x i j 2 n 1 is used in the computation domain and the conditions r x 0 y j r x 1 y j and r x n 1 y j r x n y j are assumed for the boundary pixels where δ x 0 25 km the type 1 method gives forecasts that are similar to those of maple s semi lagrangian extrapolation this result is expected because the semi lagrangian persistence eq 1 is the analytical solution of the advection eq 5 used in the type 1 forecast building on the type 1 equation precipitation models can be updated by adding a diffusion term or coupling the equation to other pdes the type 2 3 and 4 forecasting schemes represent the main results of this study 4 2 type 2 moving motion vectors using burgers equation maple and type 1 assume that the motion vector field is stationary for lead times however real motion vector fields will change over time we assume that the motion vector field can be advected itself and changes over time and follows a physically meaningful equation including a diffusion term that is we assume that the motion vector field follows a fluid equation such as the 2d burgers equation 6 u t u u x v u y μ 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v t u v x v v y μ 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where μ is a kinematic viscosity burgers equation is one of the fundamental equation in fluid mechanics involving both nonlinear propagation and diffusion effects with the pressure term removed in navier stokes n s equations 2d burgers equation is used for natural application such as modeling of gas mechanics brio and hunter 1992 and shallow water wave investigation bartuccelli et al 1985 in meteorology burgers equation is primarily used for data assimilation for instance the kalman filter from burgers equation was used in menard 1994 to investigate problems related to atmospheric data assimilation and meteorological forecasting in stahl and morten aamo 2011 this equation is also used as a constraint equation to obtain the desired image vector from image sequences for image motion estimation this process is similar to estimate motion vector to generate forecasting rain fields from observed precipitation images although this equation is not perfect for modeling the motion of precipitation fields it is the simplest equation that includes the minimum conditions advected itself changes over time and includes diffusion term we want to assume we apply the eq 6 to the initial vector u x y t 0 obtained from the vet algorithm to update the motion vector at each time step from the eq 6 the motion vector u x y t k can be updated at each time t k t 0 k δ t k 1 2 with 10 10 km2 resolution 25 25 vectors the motion vector u x y t k updated at each time is interpolated and extrapolated and is then substituted into the motion vector term of eq 5 to generate the forecasting field r x y t k the same first derivative formula from the type 1 forecast is used and for the second derivative term in 6 the centered difference quotient wendroff 1968 is used 2 u x i y j t x 2 u x i δ x y j t 2 u x i y j t u x i δ x y j t δ x 2 where i j 2 n 1 and δ x 10 km the constant coefficient μ in eq 6 is related to the smoothness of the motion vector field u the larger the value of μ the smoother the motion vector u x y t i here μ is used as a fixed value such as 0 2 3 3 m s 1 and is determined empirically 4 3 type 3 advection diffusion equation in nature fluid transport is governed by a combination of advection and diffusion the type 1 forecast assumes that only advection acts on a rain cell in jinno et al 1993 and kawamura et al 1997 they showed that 2d advection diffusion equation is able to describe the observed rainfall intensity at ground level this model assumes that over a short time period the main forces driving a rain cell are advection and diffusion in the type 3 scheme diffusion term is added as the main forcing term in eq 5 if the flow has a constant diffusion coefficient and is incompressible without sink or source the equation can be simplified to 7 r t u r x v r y ν 2 r x 2 2 r y 2 where ν is the diffusion coefficient or mass diffusivity of particle motion in rainfall forecasts this term plays a filtering or a smoothing role for longer forecast lead times in this work the value ν is varied in the ranges 0 ν 0 1 1 67 ms 1 when ν 0 the type 3 scheme is the same as type 1 but if ν 0 the smoothing effect will increase some of the skill scores 4 4 type 4 advection diffusion equation with burgers equation the last scheme is combination of the type 2 and type 3 schemes the non zero diffusion coefficients ν and μ smooth the rain intensity field r x y t and motion vector u x y t respectively the type 4 scheme solves eq 7 using the updated motion vector u x y t from eq 6 the motion vectors in the type 4 scheme are the same as those in type 2 that is in the type 4 scheme forecasting results are smoothed by the diffusion term while using the vector updated by burgers equation 4 5 time steps for numerical computations time dependent pdes are solved with the explicit runge kutta order 4 rk4 method and the finite difference method fdm throughout this paper note that according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1967 when solving a pde using an explicit time integration scheme one must select time steps δ t that are small enough relative to the magnitude of the motion vector u the space intervals δ x δ y and the viscosity of the fluid to ensure the convergence of numerical methods for pdes we use min and km as units of time and distance respectively if no diffusion term ν 0 is included in the model eq 7 explicit iteration method will converge only for δ t 0 4 min however smaller δ t is desired for lager ν so we use δ t 0 1 min with the range 0 ν 0 1 1 67 ms 1 for all methods based on pdes when using the time iterative algorithm rk4 the time intervals δ t do not need to be the same when forecasting the rain rate r in eqs 5 or 7 and motion vector u in eq 6 since the spatial resolution of 0 25 km and 10 km are different we use different updating time steps of δ t 0 1 min and δ t 2 5 min for the precipitation field r and motion vector u respectively 5 forecast evaluation results 5 1 examples of nowcasting fig 2 shows forecasts generated by maple type 1 and type 3 the type 1 forecasts are almost the identical to those of maple in the type 3 results the shape of forecast is similar to that of type 1 and only the smoothing effect is added the three vectors in the first row of fig 3 are those obtained from the vet algorithm using the three consecutive rain rate maps r x y t 0 r x y t 0 δ t and r x y t 0 2 δ t with time step δ t 2 5 min the bottom motion vectors are predicted by burgers eq 6 using the starting vector at 0300 top left in fig 3 for diffusion coefficient μ 0 2 3 33 ms 1 in the vectors in the first row of the fig 3 the northeast arrows in the red or green circle move from left to right in the bottom row the motion vectors move in the same direction in fig 4 the correlation functions show the average correlations or cosine angles between two vectors using 3 note that the correlation value of two vectors in 3 is cos θ where θ is the angle formed by the two vectors an average correlation coefficient of 0 9 means that the average angle between two vectors is about cos 1 0 9 25 8 in fig 4 u vet t 0 and u vet t represent the motion vectors obtained from the vet at time t 0 and each subsequent time t respectively and u sim t motion vector simulated by burgers equation at time t using the initial vector u vet t 0 fig 4 a shows the correlations between u vet t 0 and u vet t and between u sim t and u vet t in the quality mask region see section 2 the same correlations are presented similarly in the overlap region precipitation area andthe quality mask region in fig 4 a the correlation coefficient of u sim t is slightly higher than that of u vet t 0 in fig 4 b the difference between two correlations is much larger than that of fig 4 a thus the predicted motion vector u sim t from the type 2 scheme is more similar to the vector derived from the vet algorithm that uses the observed rainfall over time than the initial vector u vet t 0 since the predicted motion vector u sim t changes over time the type 2 forecasts are different from those of type 1 or maple as shown in fig 5 in particular a large difference appears at the western edge of the area and this difference is moved east by the motion vector u type 4 forecasts are smoother than type 2 forecasts as shown in fig 5 in the binary verification shown in fig 6 the type 4 forecast has a larger count a hits and smaller b misses than maple for the lead time of 3 h in this event the type 4 forecast shows much better performance than does maple 5 2 average skill scores of six events by comparing the average skill scores of the six events we compare the performance of maple against that of the four proposed methods in fig 7 one can see that the average skill scores of maple such as pod csi and ets are lower than those of type 2 and type 4 for a lead time of 3 h and with threshold of r t 0 1 1 and 2 mm h 1 for r t 0 1 the difference in pod between type 2 and type 4 is large but as r t increases this difference is reduced thus the smoothing effect increases the skill score for predicting weak precipitation in fig 8 the averaged correlation coefficient r t and the mae between the forecast and observed fields are shown the shapes of r t for all methods are not exponential functions so the corresponding life time l 0 r t dt is not easy to find instead the integrated values 0 3 r t dt are considered and they are ordered as follows type 4 1 58 type 3 1 48 type 2 1 42 maple type 1 1 33 where the numbers in parentheses are the integrating values for 3 h lead time in fig 8 since type 4 has the best correlation function we conclude that burger equation and the non zero smoothing coefficient ν improve the forecast the mae values are not significantly different between the methods and are slightly reduced by the smoothing effect as for maes types 2 4 are lower than maple for 1 7 h lead time but for type 2 and type 4 the maes are slightly larger than maple after 1 7 h this difference may have been due to the difference in n t the number of pixels in the quality mask at time t between maple and the proposed methods type 2 or type 4 5 3 dependence on diffusion coefficients turner et al 2004 applied forecast filters that reduce the root mean square error rmse optimal forecast filters off and operationally useful near optimal forecast filters noff have been developed using wavelet transforms and are applied in maple these filters grant improved precipitation forecasts in terms of correlation and rmse however improvements in skill scores such as csi were not noticeable in the present work filtering or smoothing effects are obtained by adding a diffusion term to pdes such as eq 7 this diffusion term allows the forecasts or solutions to be smoothed as time progresses the skill scores can be improved with this term and the intensity of smoothing can be controlled by altering the diffusion coefficients ν fig 9 shows correlation coefficients and csi scores for type 3 and type 4 forecasts calculated with ν 0 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 note that when ν 0 type 3 reduces to type 1 and type 4 reduces to type 2 for ν 0 1 type 4 gives the best correlation and csi scores the orders of integrating values of r t for 3 h lead time are type 4 0 1 1 64 type 4 0 05 1 58 type 3 0 1 1 54 type 4 0 01 type 3 0 05 1 48 type 4 0 1 42 type 3 0 01 1 39 type 1 maple 1 33 where the superscripts and numbers in parentheses indicate the corresponding ν and integrating values respectively larger ν values may lead to better validation scores but very large ν values are less realistic and offer only limited improvement in smoothing in the csi score shown in fig 9 the score does not increase significantly even if ν increases from 0 05 to 0 1 in addition the scores are affected more by the type of forecast than the value of ν 5 4 dependence on events note that temporal variation of vectors is critical to the accuracy of a forecast thus the forecast can be improved by improving the accuracy of the motion vectors the difference between the prediction results of type 2 and maple depends on the kind of event that is to be predicted if the difference can be attributed to temporal variation of motion vectors we need to find a measure of the state of the motion vector to measure the degree of non stationarity of the vector fields u x y t we estimate the rate of change of the motion vector over time u t as u u which is the advection term in eq 7 the hourly averages of spatial mean values for u u are listed in table 1 for each event for motion vectors u x y t the vet algorithm is used for each event up to 3 h lead times every 10 min if the motion vector in eq 7 is stationary the shape of the vector will not change significantly over time and the magnitude of u t will be close to zero in this case the type 2 forecasts will likely resemble those of maple and type 1 on the other hand if the motion vector fields are strongly non stationary type 2 will produce different forecasts from maple based on the mean values in table 1 we classify the six events into two classes of stationarity with the threshold of 0 001 ms 2 the temporal variation of the vectors can be evaluated quantitatively by calculating the correlation coefficient with the initial vector u vet 0 from vet in the top row of fig 10 when u u 0 001 mm s 2 the correlation scores decrease faster than the steady state cases of the bottom row the predicted vectors u sim t from burgers equation also have much higher correlations with u vet t than the initial vector does in the steady state cases of the bottom row in fig 10 the gaps between the two correlations are not much more than those of non stationary precipitation events the top row in fig 10 similarly the upper row in fig 11 shows the average verification scores for events with thresholds greater than 0 001 ms 2 and the bottom row shows the average scores for the remaining three events in this figure the type2 and type 4 methods using burgers equation yield much better skill scores than the other methods when u u is relatively large whereas the other cases does not show significant improvement in the skill scores this finding implies burgers equation improves prediction when the motion vector varies greatly in time 5 5 relative computational costs the computational costs of the pdes based methods type 1 4 depend mainly on the number of iteration needed to solve the pdes thus the four methods should take longer to compute than maple if we take δ t 0 1 min 1800 iterations should be performed for 3 h of forecasting under these conditions type 1 and type 3 took 1 9 times longer than maple and type 2 or type 4 took about 2 25 times longer than maple for the 3h forecasting the pde based methods naturally smooth forecasting through the diffusion parameter but they require greater computational costs and complexity than semi lagrangian methods alternatively a backward semi lagrangian scheme can be applied with burgers equation for motion vector updating semi lagrangian algorithms that use burgers equation which are not considered in this study could be a simple and low cost solution and we plan to study this approach in future work 6 conclusions and discussion this paper has presented forecasting models that use advection diffusion equations with non stationary motion vectors the presented methods solve pdes with initial conditions of the rain field and motion vectors obtained from the vet algorithm to test performance all four proposed methods were tested with radar rain field data with high spatial resolution and the resulting evaluation scores were compared with those of the maple algorithm the type 1 method uses simple advection equation and its forecasts are very similar to those of maple type 2 uses the same advection equation as type 1 but also solves a 2d system of burgers equations and updates the motion vector in each time step this scheme provides distinctly different forecasts from the type 1 and maple whose the motion vector is not updated after the initial motion vector the type 3 algorithm uses the same motion vector as type 1 but is based on the advection diffusion equation adding the diffusion term improves both the correlation and skill scores of the forecast the diffusion term is implemented with a filter or smoothing to eliminate the increased dissipation of numerical errors and small scale characteristics this filtering effectively increases the correlation coefficient and skill score at the small threshold r t the smoothness of the image can also be controlled easily by changing the diffusion coefficient ν the type 4 algorithm combines the features of type 2 and type 3 and it is the best method for smoothing the prediction since it updates the motion vectors in every time step type 4 forecasts are generally better than those if maple and the other methods we find that the type 2 and type 2 methods for updating motion vectors are superior to maple especially when the motion vector changes dramatically in a short time to measure the change of u over time we estimate the magnitude of t u using the vector obtained from the vet algorithm we expect that our new forecasting method using motion vectors that can be updated every time from the initial vector will overcome some of the weaknesses of semi lagrangian persistence for systems in which non stationarity is more important than advection author contributions s ryu and g w lee conceived of the models and wrote the manuscript
