1880,urban flood is a serious challenge that increasingly affects the residents simulation of urban flood is becoming increasingly relevant in the world however how to improve the simulation accuracy is still a challenge in the field this paper is developed to propose a novel model of swtm swmm model and telemac 2d model coupling d8 flow direction and backflow effect improving the simulation accuracy of inundation area inundation depth and inundation duration the model is organized into three parts one dimensional pipe network model establishment two dimensional surface inundation model

waterlogging in fangzhuang area beijing it shows that swtm model can simulate the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration more accurately comparing with the traditional model keywords flooding process coupled model subcatchment division simulation accuracy data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent years climate change has led to a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in urban areas and urban flooding has become a growing concern quesada román 2022 wei et al 2021 balaguru et al 2016 asadi zarch et al 2015 haasnoot et al 2012 according to statistics the losses caused by floods account for 40 of the global total losses caused by various natural disasters zhou et al 2019 china is one of the regions that frequently experiences rainstorms and floods in 2016 1508 counties in 28 provinces in china were hit by urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall therefore seeking precise and efficient methods for simulating urban floods is crucial for preventing and mitigating the impacts of floods high precision simulation results can also provide critical assistance for urban management skilodimou and bathrellos 2021 bathrellos et al 2016 numerical simulation is an important method for studying the formation mechanism and evolution of urban waterlogging improving simulation accuracy has become one of the most important parts in the field chenlei 2021 wu et al 2017 the urban storm flood management model swmm is widely used among many numerical simulation tools the subcatchment area division of swmm uses tyson s polygon method which has achieved good results in fact the accuracy of the model is greatly influenced by different methods used for subcatchment area division qiuling et al 2022 xiaojie et al 2022 bai et al 2021 wu et al 2020 warsta et al 2017 lai et al 2016 scholars have done a lot of work on improving the accuracy of models wu et al 2020 proposed a new method to calculate parameters that considers the three dimensional structure of the study area the results revealed that a more reasonable division of the catchment area can greatly improve the model s accuracy feature width and feature slope are the two most sensitive parameters of swmm model and their accuracy and rationality have a huge impact on the model s accuracy feature width profoundly affects the process of runoff production in the model xiaohua 2020 and its solution using computational formula as width area flow length is reasonable however the flow length solving process is relatively difficult gironás et al 2009 feature slope has a huge impact on runoff time and its solution mainly uses the average slope within the subwatershed but this method cannot accurately describe the slope of the runoff path it is well known that swmm has one dimensional hydrodynamic calculation ability but lacks two dimensional hydrodynamic calculation ability some researchers considered coupling a two dimensional hydrodynamic model with swmm such as lisflood fp wca2d telemac 2d etc guoyi et al 2022a guoyi et al 2022b omar et al 2021 guidolin et al 2016 vu et al 2015 bates et al 2010 for urban flood simulation in fact it is difficult to accurately characterize the underlying surface in the model due to the complexity of the built up area the lisflood fp and wca2d models adopted dem pixels as the computational grid which has a good simulation effect for areas with simple shapes and regular building arrangements however for built up areas with complex shapes and irregular building arrangements the simulation effect may be relatively poor simulating two dimensional flooding results can be achieved through solving the complete or simplified two dimensional shallow water equations using an irregular grid in theory this can lead to more accurate flooding results ruo nan et al 2019 telemac 2d model has been used to simulate the hydrodynamic process of rivers estuaries coasts and floodplains due to its open source and stable two dimensional hydrodynamic computing ability guoyi et al 2022a guoyi et al 2022b pinel et al 2020 smith et al 2005 horritt and bates 2002 at present the application of this model in urban waterlogging simulation is relatively limited li et al 2019 used telemac 2d models to simulate urban flooding and analyzed the effects around flood buildings guoyi et al 2022b established an urban flood simulation model through telemac 2d they discussed the waterlogging situation under different return periods and rainfall peak coefficients rui et al 2022 analyzed the impact of different flood scenarios on urban emergency response time based on telemac 2d however above studies do not couple the one dimensional pipe network model missing the calculation process of the flow movement process in pipe network which is quite different from the actual situation and the simulation accuracy is often difficult to achieve the desired effect zhaoli et al 2022 combined the telemac 2d and swmm models to study waterlogging and demonstrated its advantages in simulation accuracy however the researchers only considered the flooding situation caused by overflow from drainage wells without taking into account the backflow from inspection wells according to the author s literature review previous studies that combined telemac 2d and swmm models have almost never considered the impact of backflow from inspection wells in this paper we propose a novel model called swtm which couples swmm and telemac 2d models to consider the reasonable delineation of subcatchment areas and the backflow effect of inspection wells our work is developed as follows firstly swtm model is proposed including one dimensional model building two dimensional model building coupling model construction secondly the model is applied to the research field to analyze the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration under different rainstorm scenarios thirdly the advantages of the swtm model have been proven by comparing it with traditional methods finally the limitations of our work are discussed 2 urban flood simulation model development our study is developed to propose a novel urban flood simulation model for a better simulation accuracy coupling with d8 flow direction and backflow effect the model is divided into three phases firstly the subcatchment area is divided using the d8 algorithm which proposed a novel method for feature width calculation and a rapid modeling scheme is developed to build a one dimensional pipe network model efficiently secondly the overflow and backflow process of inspection well are simulated in the two dimensional surface inundation model which makes the model more accurate and the simulation results are closer to the actual situation thirdly the coupled model swtm is applied to simulate the rainfall runoff and inundation processes making the results of inundation area inundation depth and inundation duration the whole framework is introduced as fig 1 2 1 one dimensional pipe network model the establishment of one dimensional pipe network model is mainly composed of three parts step1 basic data generalization the data of study area is generalized based on arcgis platform including the information of inspection wells pipelines water outlets and rain measuring stations step2 subcatchment area division and key parameter calculation d8 algorithm is a single flow algorithm commonly used in hydrology this algorithm can determine a unique flow direction for each grid and there are 8 possible directions as shown in fig 2 a the algorithm uses the steepest slope method to analyze the flow direction of each grid according to analyzing the flow direction the flow direction of each grid has corresponding digital identification the subcatchment area division method studied in this paper is based on the statistical analysis of pixel based flow direction of d8 flow to the grid and its analysis steps are shown in fig 2 b the flow direction of the grid is traced upward from the outlet point to determine the extent of the subcatchment area shown by the dark blue grid with a streamline indicated by the red arrow in order to obtain better flow direction analysis results a dem with a smaller grid scale is needed by using linear interpolation the accuracy of dem flow direction analysis can be improved the conceptual diagram of the method is shown in fig 3 taking grid a as an example we first assign the values of each grid to the center point of them then by using points a b c and e we can linearly interpolate the value of point a1 similarly a2 a3 and a4 can also be obtained in this way by dividing grid a into four grids a1 a2 a3 and a4 this method can further refine the grid size of the dem and to some extent improve the accuracy of watershed division for example a grid in fig 3 has only one direction of flow while it will account for four directions when a grid is refined into 4 parts having a significant impact on the statistics of the catchment area in the traditional feature width division empirical formula like w 2 29a0 4 is usually adopted or is generalized into regular shapes such as circle and w a π is used to solve the feature width cronshey et al 1985 in fact these regular sub catchment areas do not exist the feature length is calculated by counting the length of all streamlines in the sub catchment area and using the path length weighted average method which ensures that the arrival time of the peak flow falls within a relatively reasonable range the calculation method for the feature width is as follows 1 w a i 1 n l i w i 2 w i l i i 1 n l i in the formula a represents the area of the sub catchment m 3 li represents the length of each streamline m and wi represents the path length weighting of each streamline in traditional feature slope division the average slope of the sub catchment area is commonly used to replace the actual slope which affects the arrival time of peak flow in the model similarly the weighted average method is used to calculate the feature slope the calculation method as follows 3 s i 1 n s i w i in the formula si represents the average slope of each streamline the subdivision of sub watersheds and the calculation of key parameters are based on the statistical analysis of pixel flow directions in d8 flow direction raster and they are implemented using the python programming language the basic steps are as follows 1 create a two dimensional array with the same number of rows and columns as the elevation map 2 add an id number to each well point 3 calculate and record the row and column position of each well point in the grid according to the dem 4 traverse each row of the flow direction grid from the upper left to the lower right and record the coordinates of the flow line then assign the id value of the target well point to the grid when the flow direction points to the target well point the grids with the same id value form a catchment area meanwhile save the flow line as text for analysis of feature width and slope 5 read all the processes of each sub watershed from the flow text file then calculate the length and slope of each flow line according to the dem finally use the weighted average method to calculate the feature width and slope step3 rapid modeling scheme python code is applied to realize the rapid modeling and calibration main functions include the following four features 1 by utilizing the functions of the pyshp library the attribute and geometric data from arcgis can be read directly and automatically written into the swmm model 2 by utilizing the functions of the pyswmm library swmm can be easily executed and the simulated depth for a node or flow velocity for a pipeline can be directly read the simulated value and the measured value are put into the nash coefficient formula and the nash coefficient of multiple nodes and pipelines can be directly calculated making the process fast and accurate 3 by calling the function of matplotlib library the simulated values read from pyswmm library and the measured values read from pyswmm library were substituted into the same line chart for comparison and the calculated nash coefficient was included the nash sutcliffeefficiency coefficient nse is usually used to verify the quality of hydrological model simulation results 4 e 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t is the observed value at time t m3 s q m t is the simulated value at time t m3 s and q 0 is the total average of the observed values m3 s the value of e is from minus infinity to 1 the closer the parameter is to 1 the better the simulation result will be it is generally believed that a value exceeding 0 5 for this parameter indicates good model simulation result 4 to optimize the model the parameters are manually adjusted by referring to a line chart comparing the results of each checkpoint and the nash coefficient 2 2 two dimensional surface inundation model the telemac 2d is introduced to simulate the two dimensional surface inundation mainly including geometry file boundary file and parameter file step4 point source parameter file the grid points corresponding to all inspection well points are extracted and they are written into the keywords in the parameter file the wellpoint backflow and overflow process is divided into the following three parts 1 the real time backflow capacity of well point is calculated by combining manning formula and pipeline real time state manning s formula is as follows 5 v k n r h 2 3 s 1 2 where v is the velocity m s k is the conversion constant with the si international system of units median value of 1 n is roughness which is a coefficient that comprehensively reflects the influence of the roughness of the pipe and canal wall on the flow rh is the hydraulic radius which is the ratio of the fluid cross sectional area to the wet perimeter s indicates the slope of the canal 2 the wellpoint backflow capacity is determined by the difference between the maximum backflow capacity and the flow velocity flowing out of the downstream section in real time the calculation formula is as follows 6 v h v max v a where vh is the wellpoint backflow capacity m s v max is the maximum backflow capacity of the well point m s v a is the real time outflow capacity of the downstream pipe segment m s 3 the swmm model wellpoint real time overflow was extracted through the code and the wellpoint real time backflow in equation 6 was finally written into the source file of telemac 2d model step5 geometry file and boundary file the mesh files generated by sms surface watermodeling system were converted into a format that could be recognized by bluekenue software boundary files and geometry files are generated based on grid files in bluekenue where geometry files elevation and manning coefficients were prepared by 2d interpolators 2 3 coupling model result analysis step6 analysis of urban flood inundation simulation in previous study the inundation depth inundation area and inundation duration are usually referred to the maximum results within a fixed simulation time rarely considering the backflow effect of the inspection well during the simulation simulation results that do not consider the backflow effect often make larger values for maximum inundation depth flow velocity and duration time than those considering it therefore it is necessary to consider backflow effects in flood simulations python language is applied to process the simulation results of inundation area inundation depth and inundation time taking the extraction of inundation depth as an example the steps are as follows 1 firstly the depth process line of each grid point was extracted through python code the grid point coordinates were retained and the maximum water depth value of the grid point was extracted 2 through the python code the maximum water depth value of each grid point is rendered into the grid and displayed in the figure 3 the maximum inundation depth can be obtained by comparing the maximum water depth of all grids similarly the inundation area and duration analysis can be carried out through the extracted bathymetric process lines of grid points 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area fig 4 is located near fangzhuang subway station in beijing china where is a highly urbanized area with higher terrain in the northwest and lower terrain in the southeast the drainage system here is a complete diversion system and the outlet of the system drains into the downstream liangshui river this area is prone to waterlogging so it is necessary to conduct flood simulation here the inundation simulation in this area serves as a case study for the application of swtm model development 3 2 establishment of one dimensional pipe network model 3 2 1 data preparation a total of 902 inspection wells were constructed in the one dimensional pipe network model including 3 downhole water level detection points 907 pipe sections and 6 drainage outlets the length of the main pipe section is 29 69 km of which 24 40 km is round pipe with diameters ranging from 200 to 2600 mm the total length of square channels is 5 29 km with sizes ranging from 1400 1200 to 4400 2500 mm through actual investigations of the region s underlying surface attributes it can be divided into six categories such as road surface housing surface hardened pavement vegetation bare soil and water surface basic data are shown in table 1 3 2 2 model building the dem of the study area is analyzed by the d8 algorithm and the flow direction grid pixel map is obtained the subcatchment area is delineated by the python code the scope of each subcatchment area is shown in fig 5 fig a is the general drawing of subcatchment division based on d8 algorithm fig b and fig c are local enlarged view of subcatchment division based on d8 algorithm there are three downhole water level detection points in the model which are used for model calibration and verification the pre processing of basic data is mainly carried out in arcgis software finally the processed basic files are merged into swmm model files through the self programming program the infiltration model adopts horton model 3 3 establishment of two dimensional surface inundation model considering the water resistance of the building the contour of the building is taken as the internal hard boundary and the mesh free island is generated to ensure the continuity of the grid it is necessary to resample the building contour the default maximum side length of the grid is 20 m and the local grids are refined according to the distance based on the resampling of the building contour there are 294 521 nodes and 164 944 grids in the processed grid the elevation information grid is obtained by interpolating the elevation data similarly the roughness field grid is obtained by interpolating the roughness value according to the land use type in the study area the elevation information grid and roughness information grid are shown in fig 6 the roughness value is assigned according to the land use type specified in table 2 since the terrain of the study area is high in the north and low in the south the bottom boundary of the study area is set as an open boundary to allow free outflow building boundaries and other boundaries are set as closed boundaries considering their water resistance based on the grid file and one dimensional model result file the point source parameter file is obtained by step 4 operation of the self programming tool 3 4 results of swtm 3 4 1 model calibration and verification the downhole water level of three monitoring points is used to calibrate and verify the model from two measured rainfall data like no 2 015 718 and no 2015626 rainfall data is recorded every 5 min and is shown in fig 7 the model parameters are adjusted through the rapid modeling scheme developed and the main parameters of the adjusted model are shown in table 2 the no 2 015 718 rainfall scenario was used for the calibration of the model the results of calibration evaluation parameters are shown in table 3 the nash coefficients of the three monitoring points are 0 74 0 82 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the model calibration effect is reliable the difference between the simulated peak time and the actual peak time of water level is less than 3 min showing that the model can simulate the water level of each inspection well the simulated values of the three monitoring points are shown in fig 8 the simulated trends of water rise and water retreat processes at the three monitoring sites are consistent with the actual results therefore it is well proved that the quality of the drainage pipe model of fangzhuang is good from nash efficiency coefficient peak time of water level and the trend of rising and falling water process the no 2 015 626 was used for the validation of the model because the pipeline has a certain initial water level coupled with the ups and downs of terrain the initial water level of each inspection well is different therefore the first 1 h was used as the hot start of the model the simulated water level values of the three monitoring points are shown in fig 9 the results of verification and evaluation parameters are shown in table 4 the nash efficiency coefficients are 0 74 0 82 and 0 94 indicating good model quality in terms of peak time of water level the difference between the simulated value and the measured value is less than 3 min for the rising and retreating water trends of the three monitoring points the simulated values are highly consistent with the measured values according to the model verification results the model can simulate the water level condition of the inspection well and the overall quality of the model is high 3 4 2 analysis of inundation results in different scenarios in order to simulate the inundation conditions under different rainstorm return periods the rainstorm formula issued by beijing municipal water bureau was used to calculate the rainstorm intensity under six different return periods the chicago rain pattern was used as the design rain pattern to calculate the three hour rainfall process under different return periods the design rainfall process is shown in fig 10 3 4 2 1 analysis of overflow points in different rainfall scenarios according to the simulation results of one dimensional model the proportion of the number of flooded well points under different rainfall scenarios is shown in table 5 and the location distribution is shown in fig 11 table 5 shows that the number of flooded well points increases rapidly as the intensity of rainstorm increases under the scenario of rainstorm occurred every five years the proportion of flooded well points has reached 47 2 which proves that the drainage capacity of the pipe network drainage system in this area is poor fig 11 shows that the overflow well points are mainly distributed in the north of the study area under the scenario of rainstorm occurred once a year with the increase of rainstorm intensity some well points in the middle of the study area also begin to overflow 3 4 2 2 analysis of inundation area in different rainfall scenarios the inundation area results under different rainstorm scenarios are shown in table 6 and the inundation location distribution diagram is shown in fig 12 with the intensification of the rainstorm scenario the flooded area is increasing from 42350 265 m2 to 434085 079 m2 combined with fig 12 it can be seen that only the northwest part of the study area is flooded under the scenario of once a year with the intensification of the rainstorm intensity the inundation area increases in the middle and upper part of the study area to varying degrees 3 4 2 3 analysis of inundation depth in different rainfall scenarios after analyzing the results of the model we compiled a table table 7 showing the maximum inundation depth in the study area for different rainstorm scenarios the data reveals that the maximum inundation depth increases progressively as the rainstorm intensity increases it indicates that the drainage capacity of the pipe network system in the study area is insufficient to handle heavy rainstorms further measures should be taken to improve the drainage system for reducing the risk of flooding 3 4 2 4 analysis of inundation duration in different rainfall scenarios table 8 shows the inundation time of the study area for different rainstorm scenarios as the rainstorm intensity increases the time for water to accumulate becomes earlier and the time for water to disappear becomes later it lead to a longer overall duration of water accumulation although the range of variation becomes smaller 4 discussion 4 1 advantage analysis of swtm model simulation with d8 algorithm this article demonstrates that reasonable methods for dividing sub catchment areas and determining key model parameters can effectively improve the accuracy of swmm models by comparing the differences in results of three different swmm models in order to make the comparison between the results obtained by d8 algorithm and tyson s polygon method more reasonable we first modify the model boundary according to the catchment area boundary obtained by d8 algorithm to ensure the consistency of the models in a large range fig 13 shows the conceptual diagrams of the three swmm models a sub catchment areas were divided using the tyson s polygon method b sub catchment areas were divided using the d8 algorithm combined with a 10 10 m dem and c sub catchment areas were divided using the d8 algorithm combined with a 5 5m interpolated dem by comparing fig 13 b and fig 13 c it can be found that the ranges of most sub catchment areas in fig 13 c are more detailed and the shapes of some sub catchment areas differ greatly due to differences in raster size the reason is that a 100 square meter grid has only one direction of flow but after refinement it is divided into 4 grids of 25 square meters each which can account for four directions of flow having a significant impact on the statistics of the catchment area in terms of setting parameters of above three models the feature width and slope of fig 13 a and fig 13 b are determined by traditional empirical formulas while those of fig 13 c are obtained using formulas 1 3 the three models are carried out under the same conditions for other parameters two sets of measured rainfall data in fig 7 are used for the simulation the water level results in three monitoring wells are applied to compare the models the results of the two methods are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 and the comparison results of the nash coefficient are shown in tables 9 and 10 by comparing the results it was found that the nash coefficients obtained by the model using the d8 algorithm were all higher than those calculated by the model using the tyson s polygon method this indicates that the model using the d8 algorithm has higher accuracy than that by the tyson s polygon method in addition it is easy to find that nash coefficients obtained by the d8 algorithm coupling linear interpolation method and the path weighted average method are highest of all the three models which demonstrating that a reasonable method for dividing sub watersheds and determining key model parameters feature width and slope can effectively improve model accuracy 4 2 advantage analysis of swtm model considering backflow effect the advantages of the swtm model developed are discussed from inundation area inundation depth and inundation duration comparing with the traditional 2d model in terms of inundation area the results of the two models are shown in table 11 it can be seen that the inundation area result by the model without considering backflow effect is larger than that with considering it the error is even more than 90 which is far different from the actual inundate area what is more with the increase of rainstorm intensity the error shows a tendency to increase and then decrease in terms of maximum inundation depth table 12 compares the differences in results with or without considering backflow effect it can be seen that the maximum inundation depth results obtained by the model without backflow effect is larger than that indicated by the model considering backflow effect the maximum water depth difference is 0 11 m and the maximum error is 10 39 as the intensity of the storm increases the error will show a tendency to increase and then decrease in terms of inundate duration inundate duration statistics cannot be carried out without backflow effect therefore the difference of inundate duration under different methods is no longer compared here it needs to be emphasized or stated is that the model considering backflow effect proposed can not only the count the inundation duration of the study area but also the peak inundation time which is the advantage of the model in this paper 4 3 limitation and future work through the above comparative analysis it is not difficult to see that this paper lacks a comparison between actual inundation and simulation results in the two dimensional model part which is due to the difficulty in obtaining monitoring data here in fact the swtm model developed in this study with high integrity and accuracy requires high precision data to produce more reliable results as a result it may not be suitable for areas with insufficient or low accuracy data in fact some scholars have studied the coupling of swmm with a 2d hydraulic model considering backflow effects but they are all not open source software in this study two open source software is used for autonomous coupling which can provide more convenient simulation tools for researchers in the future 5 conclusion in this paper a novel urban flood simulation model swtm is developed based on d8 algorithm and backflow effect the main conclusions are as follows 1 a new coupling method between the swmm model and the telemac 2d model is proposed with high accuracy 2 d8 algorithm is used to propose a new sub catchment area division method which greatly improves the accuracy of the model 3 the simulation of rainfall runoff processes is characterized more accurate by using the path weighted average method for the calculation of the feature width and feature slope in sub catchment 4 using the rapid modeling scheme greatly improves the efficiency of model establishment model parameter adjustment and model result processing 5 the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration under different rainstorm scenarios were analyzed considering backflow effect 6 by comparing with the traditional model it is proved that the swtm model has higher accuracy and advantage credit authorship contribution statement weichao yang conceptualization methodology chuanxing zheng software methodology

are both considered to simulate the flood inundation in the two dimensional surface inundation model which can obtain the maximum inundation depth and inundation area more accurately in the coupled model the overflow and backflow process of inspection wells are used as the input condition of the two dimensional model to simulate the flooding process the new model is applied to rainstorm waterlogging in fangzhuang area beijing it shows that swtm model can simulate the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration more accurately comparing with the traditional model keywords flooding process coupled model subcatchment division simulation accuracy data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent years climate change has led to a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in urban areas and urban flooding has become a growing concern quesada román 2022 wei et al 2021 balaguru et

china is one of the regions that frequently experiences rainstorms and floods in 2016 1508 counties in 28 provinces in china were hit by urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall therefore seeking precise and efficient methods for simulating urban floods is crucial for preventing and mitigating the impacts of floods high precision simulation results can also provide critical assistance for urban management skilodimou and bathrellos 2021 bathrellos et al 2016 numerical simulation is an important method for studying the formation mechanism and evolution of urban waterlogging improving simulation accuracy has become one of the most important parts in the field chenlei 2021 wu et al 2017 the urban storm flood management model swmm is widely used among many numerical simulation tools the subcatchment area division of swmm uses tyson s polygon method which has achieved good results in fact the accuracy of the model is greatly influenced by different methods used for subcatchment area division qiuling et al 2022 xiaojie et al 2022 bai et al 2021 wu et al 2020 warsta et al 2017 lai et al 2016 scholars have done a lot of work on improving the accuracy of models wu et al 2020 proposed a new method to calculate parameters that considers the three dimensional structure of the study area the results revealed that a more reasonable division of the catchment area can greatly improve the model s accuracy feature width and feature slope are the two most sensitive parameters of swmm model and their accuracy and rationality have a huge impact on the model s accuracy feature width profoundly affects the process of runoff production in the model xiaohua 2020 and its solution using computational formula as width area flow length is reasonable however the flow length solving process is relatively difficult gironás et al 2009 feature slope has a huge impact on runoff time and its solution mainly uses the average slope within the subwatershed but this method cannot accurately describe the slope of the runoff path it is well known that swmm has one dimensional hydrodynamic calculation ability but lacks two dimensional hydrodynamic calculation ability some researchers considered coupling a two dimensional hydrodynamic model with swmm such as lisflood fp wca2d telemac 2d etc guoyi et al 2022a guoyi et al 2022b omar et al 2021 guidolin et al 2016 vu et al 2015 bates et al 2010 for urban flood simulation in fact it is difficult to accurately characterize the underlying surface in the model due to the complexity of the built up area the lisflood fp and wca2d models adopted dem pixels as the computational grid which has a good simulation effect for areas with simple shapes and regular building arrangements however for built up areas with complex shapes and irregular building arrangements the simulation effect may be relatively poor simulating two dimensional flooding results can be achieved through solving the complete or simplified two dimensional shallow water equations using an irregular grid in theory this can lead to more accurate flooding results ruo nan et al 2019 telemac 2d model has been used to simulate the hydrodynamic process of rivers estuaries coasts and floodplains due to its open source and stable two dimensional hydrodynamic computing ability guoyi et al 2022a guoyi et al 2022b pinel et al 2020 smith et al

the effects around flood buildings guoyi et al 2022b established an urban flood simulation model through telemac 2d they discussed the waterlogging situation under different return periods and rainfall peak coefficients rui et al 2022 analyzed the impact of different flood scenarios on urban emergency response time based on telemac 2d however above studies do not couple the one dimensional pipe network model missing the calculation process of the flow movement process in pipe network which is quite different from the actual situation and the simulation accuracy is often difficult to achieve the desired effect zhaoli et al 2022 combined the telemac 2d and swmm models to study waterlogging and demonstrated its advantages in simulation accuracy however the researchers only considered the flooding situation caused by overflow from drainage wells without taking into account the backflow from inspection wells according to the author s literature review previous studies that combined telemac 2d and swmm models have almost never considered the impact of backflow from inspection wells in this paper we propose a novel model called swtm which couples swmm and telemac 2d models to consider the reasonable delineation of subcatchment areas and the backflow effect of inspection wells our work is developed as follows firstly swtm model is proposed including one dimensional model building two dimensional model building coupling model construction secondly the model is applied to the research field to analyze the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration under different rainstorm scenarios thirdly the advantages of the swtm model have been proven by comparing it with traditional methods finally the limitations of our work are discussed 2 urban flood simulation model development our study is developed to propose a novel urban flood simulation model for a better simulation accuracy coupling with d8 flow direction and backflow effect the model is divided into three phases firstly the subcatchment area is divided using the d8 algorithm which proposed a novel method for feature width calculation and a rapid modeling scheme is developed to build a one dimensional pipe network model efficiently secondly the overflow and backflow process of inspection well are simulated in the two dimensional surface inundation model which makes the model more accurate and the simulation results are closer to the actual situation thirdly the coupled model swtm is applied to simulate the rainfall runoff and inundation processes making the results of inundation area inundation depth and inundation duration the whole framework is introduced as fig 1 2 1 one dimensional pipe network model the establishment of one dimensional pipe network model is mainly composed of three parts step1 basic data generalization the data of study area is generalized based on arcgis platform including the information of inspection wells pipelines water outlets and rain measuring stations step2 subcatchment area division and key parameter calculation d8 algorithm is a single flow algorithm commonly used in hydrology this algorithm can determine a unique flow direction for each grid and there are 8 possible directions as shown in fig 2 a the algorithm uses the steepest slope method to analyze the flow direction of each grid according to analyzing the flow direction the flow direction of each grid has corresponding digital identification the subcatchment area division method studied in this paper is based on the statistical analysis of pixel based flow direction of d8 flow to the grid and its analysis steps are shown in fig 2 b the flow direction of the grid is traced upward from the outlet point to determine the extent of the subcatchment area shown by the dark blue grid with a streamline indicated by the red arrow in order to obtain better flow direction analysis results a dem with a smaller grid scale is needed by using linear interpolation the accuracy of dem flow direction analysis can be improved the conceptual diagram of the method is shown in fig 3 taking grid a as an example we first assign the values of each grid to the center point of them then by using points a b c and e we can linearly interpolate the value of point a1 similarly a2 a3 and a4 can also be obtained in this way by dividing grid a into four grids a1 a2 a3 and a4 this method can further refine the grid size of the dem and to some extent improve the accuracy of watershed division for example a grid in fig 3 has only one direction of flow while it will account for four directions when a grid is refined into 4 parts having a significant impact on the statistics of the catchment area in the traditional feature width division empirical formula like w 2 29a0 4 is usually adopted or is generalized into regular shapes such as circle and w a π is used to solve the feature width cronshey et al 1985 in fact these regular sub catchment areas do not exist the feature length is calculated by counting the length of all streamlines in the sub catchment area and using the path length weighted average method which ensures that the arrival time of the peak flow falls within a relatively reasonable range the calculation method for the feature width is as follows 1 w a i 1 n l i w i 2 w i l i i 1 n l i in the formula a represents the area of the sub catchment m 3 li represents the length of each streamline m and wi represents the path length weighting of each streamline in traditional feature slope division the average slope of the sub catchment area is commonly used to replace the actual slope which affects the arrival time of peak flow in the model similarly the weighted average method is used to calculate the feature slope the calculation method as follows 3 s i 1 n s i w i in the formula si represents the average slope of each streamline the subdivision of sub watersheds and the calculation of key parameters are based on the statistical analysis of pixel flow directions in d8 flow direction raster and they are implemented using the python programming language the basic steps are as follows 1 create a two dimensional array with the same number of rows and columns as the elevation map 2 add an id number to each well point 3 calculate and record the row and column position of each well point in the grid according to the dem 4 traverse each row of the flow direction grid from the upper left to the lower right and record the coordinates of the flow line then assign the id value of the target well point to the grid when the flow direction points to the target well point the grids with the same id value form a catchment area meanwhile save the flow line as text for analysis of feature width and slope 5 read all the processes of each sub watershed from the flow text file then calculate the length and slope of each flow line according to the dem finally use the weighted average method to calculate the feature width and slope step3 rapid modeling scheme python code is applied to realize the rapid modeling and calibration main functions include the following four features 1 by utilizing the functions of the pyshp library the attribute and geometric data from arcgis can be read directly and automatically written into the swmm model 2 by utilizing the functions of the pyswmm library swmm can be easily executed and the simulated depth for a node or flow velocity for a pipeline can be directly read the simulated value and the measured value are put into the nash coefficient formula and the nash coefficient of multiple nodes and pipelines can be directly calculated making the process fast and accurate 3 by calling the function of matplotlib library the simulated values read from pyswmm library and the measured values read from pyswmm library were substituted into the same line chart for comparison and the calculated nash coefficient was included the nash sutcliffeefficiency coefficient nse is usually used to verify the quality of hydrological model simulation results 4 e 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t is the observed value at time t m3 s q m t is the simulated value at time t m3 s and q 0 is the total average of the observed values m3 s the value of e is from minus infinity to 1 the closer the parameter is to 1 the better the simulation result will be it is generally believed that a value exceeding 0 5 for this parameter indicates good model simulation result 4 to optimize the model the parameters are manually adjusted by referring to a line chart comparing the results of each checkpoint and the nash coefficient 2 2 two dimensional surface inundation model the telemac 2d is introduced to simulate the two dimensional surface inundation mainly including geometry file boundary file and parameter file step4 point source parameter file the grid points corresponding to all inspection well points are extracted and they are written into the keywords in the parameter file the wellpoint backflow and overflow process is divided into the following three parts 1 the real time backflow capacity of well point is calculated by combining manning formula and pipeline real time state manning s formula is as follows 5 v k n r h 2 3 s 1 2 where v is the velocity m s k is the conversion constant with the si international system of units median value of 1 n is roughness which is a coefficient that comprehensively reflects the influence of the roughness of the pipe and canal wall on the flow rh is the hydraulic radius which is the ratio of the fluid cross sectional area to the wet perimeter s indicates the slope of the canal 2 the wellpoint backflow capacity is determined by the difference between the maximum backflow capacity and the flow velocity flowing out of the downstream section in real time the calculation formula is as follows 6 v h v max v a where vh is the wellpoint backflow capacity m s v max is the maximum backflow capacity of the well point m s v a is the real time outflow capacity of the downstream pipe segment m s 3 the swmm model wellpoint real time overflow was extracted through the code and the wellpoint real time backflow in equation 6 was finally written into the source file of telemac 2d model step5 geometry file and boundary file the mesh files generated by sms surface watermodeling system were converted into a format that could be recognized by bluekenue software boundary files and geometry files are generated based on grid files in bluekenue where geometry files elevation and manning coefficients were prepared by 2d interpolators 2 3 coupling model result analysis step6 analysis of urban flood inundation simulation in previous study the inundation depth inundation area and inundation duration are usually referred to the maximum results within a fixed simulation time rarely considering the backflow effect of the inspection well during the simulation simulation results that do not consider the backflow effect often make larger values for maximum inundation depth flow velocity and duration time than those considering it therefore it is necessary to consider backflow effects in flood simulations python language is applied to process the simulation results of inundation area inundation depth and inundation time taking the extraction of inundation depth as an example the steps are as follows 1 firstly the depth process line of each grid point was extracted through python code the grid point coordinates were retained and the maximum water depth value of the grid point was extracted 2 through the python code the maximum water depth value of each grid point is rendered into the grid and displayed in the figure 3 the maximum inundation depth can be obtained by comparing the maximum water depth of all grids similarly the inundation area and duration analysis can be carried out through the extracted bathymetric process lines of grid points 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area fig 4 is located near fangzhuang subway station in beijing china where is a highly urbanized area with higher terrain in the northwest and lower terrain in the southeast the drainage system here is a complete diversion system and the outlet of the system drains into the downstream liangshui river this area is prone to waterlogging so it is necessary to conduct flood simulation here the inundation simulation in this area serves as a case study for the application of swtm model development 3 2 establishment of one dimensional pipe network model 3 2 1 data preparation a total of 902 inspection wells were constructed in the one dimensional pipe network model including 3 downhole water level detection points 907 pipe sections and 6 drainage outlets the length of the main pipe section is 29 69 km of which 24 40 km is round pipe with diameters ranging from 200 to 2600 mm the total length of square channels is 5 29 km with sizes ranging from 1400 1200 to 4400 2500 mm through actual investigations of the region s underlying surface attributes it can be divided into six categories such as road surface housing surface hardened pavement vegetation bare soil and water surface basic data are shown in table 1 3 2 2 model building the dem of the study area is analyzed by the d8 algorithm and the flow direction grid pixel map is obtained the subcatchment area is delineated by the python code the scope of each subcatchment area is shown in fig 5 fig a is the general drawing of subcatchment division based on d8 algorithm fig b and fig c are local enlarged view of subcatchment division based on d8 algorithm there are three downhole water level detection points in the model which are used for model calibration and verification the pre processing of basic data is mainly carried out in arcgis software finally the processed basic files are merged into swmm model files through the self programming program the infiltration model adopts horton model 3 3 establishment of two dimensional surface inundation model considering the water resistance of the building the contour of the building is taken as the internal hard boundary and the mesh free island is generated to ensure the continuity of the grid it is necessary to resample the building contour the default maximum side length of the grid is 20 m and the local grids are refined according to the distance based on the resampling of the building contour there are 294 521 nodes and 164 944 grids in the processed grid the elevation information grid is obtained by interpolating the elevation data similarly the roughness field grid is obtained by interpolating the roughness value according to the land use type in the study area the elevation information grid and roughness information grid are shown in fig 6 the roughness value is assigned according to the land use type specified in table 2 since the terrain of the study area is high in the north and low in the south the bottom boundary of the study area is set as an open boundary to allow free outflow building boundaries and other boundaries are set as closed boundaries considering their water resistance based on the grid file and one dimensional model result file the point source parameter file is obtained by step 4 operation of the self programming tool 3 4 results of swtm 3 4 1 model calibration and verification the downhole water level of three monitoring points is used to calibrate and verify the model from two measured rainfall data like no 2 015 718 and no 2015626 rainfall data is recorded every 5 min and is shown in fig 7 the model parameters are adjusted through the rapid modeling scheme developed and the main parameters of the adjusted model are shown in table 2 the no 2 015 718 rainfall scenario was used for the calibration of the model the results of calibration evaluation parameters are shown in table 3 the nash coefficients of the three monitoring points are 0 74 0 82 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the model calibration effect is reliable the difference between the simulated peak time and the actual peak time of water level is less than 3 min showing that the model can simulate the water level of each inspection well the simulated values of the three monitoring points are shown in fig 8 the simulated trends of water rise and water retreat processes at the three monitoring sites are consistent with the actual results therefore it is well proved that the quality of the drainage pipe model of fangzhuang is good from nash efficiency coefficient peak time of water level and the trend of rising and falling water process the no 2 015 626 was used for the validation of the model because the pipeline has a certain initial water level coupled with the ups and downs of terrain the initial water level of each inspection well is different therefore the first 1 h was used as the hot start of the model the simulated water level values of the three monitoring points are shown in fig 9 the results of verification and evaluation parameters are shown in table 4 the nash efficiency coefficients are 0 74 0 82 and 0 94 indicating good model quality in terms of peak time of water level the difference between the simulated value and the measured value is less than 3 min for the rising and retreating water trends of the three monitoring points the simulated values are highly consistent with the measured values according to the model verification results the model can simulate the water level condition of the inspection well and the overall quality of the model is high 3 4 2 analysis of inundation results in different scenarios in order to simulate the inundation conditions under different rainstorm return periods the rainstorm formula issued by beijing municipal water bureau was used to calculate the rainstorm intensity under six different return periods the chicago rain pattern was used as the design rain pattern to calculate the three hour rainfall process under different return periods the design rainfall process is shown in fig 10 3 4 2 1 analysis of overflow points in different rainfall scenarios according to the simulation results of one dimensional model the proportion of the number of flooded well points under different rainfall scenarios is shown in table 5 and the location distribution is shown in fig 11 table 5 shows that the number of flooded well points increases rapidly as the intensity of rainstorm increases under the scenario of rainstorm occurred every five years the proportion of flooded well points has reached 47 2 which proves that the drainage capacity of the pipe network drainage system in this area is poor fig 11 shows that the overflow well points are mainly distributed in the north of the study area under the scenario of rainstorm occurred once a year with the increase of rainstorm intensity some well points in the middle of the study area also begin to overflow 3 4 2 2 analysis of inundation area in different rainfall scenarios the inundation area results under different rainstorm scenarios are shown in table 6 and the inundation location distribution diagram is shown in fig 12 with the intensification of the rainstorm scenario the flooded area is increasing from 42350 265 m2 to 434085 079 m2 combined with fig 12 it can be seen that only the northwest part of the study area is flooded under the scenario of once a year with the intensification of the rainstorm intensity the inundation area increases in the middle and upper part of the study area to varying degrees 3 4 2 3 analysis of inundation depth in different rainfall scenarios after analyzing the results of the model we compiled a table table 7 showing the maximum inundation depth in the study area for different rainstorm scenarios the data reveals that the maximum inundation depth increases progressively as the rainstorm intensity increases it indicates that the drainage capacity of the pipe network system in the study area is insufficient to handle heavy rainstorms further measures should be taken to improve the drainage system for reducing the risk of flooding 3 4 2 4 analysis of inundation duration in different rainfall scenarios table 8 shows the inundation time of the study area for different rainstorm scenarios as the rainstorm intensity increases the time for water to accumulate becomes earlier and the time for water to disappear becomes later it lead to a longer overall duration of water accumulation although the range of variation becomes smaller 4 discussion 4 1 advantage analysis of swtm model simulation with d8 algorithm this article demonstrates that reasonable methods for dividing sub catchment areas and determining key model parameters can effectively improve the accuracy of swmm models by comparing the differences in results of three different swmm models in order to make the comparison between the results obtained by d8 algorithm and tyson s polygon method more reasonable we first modify the model boundary according to the catchment area boundary obtained by d8 algorithm to ensure the consistency of the models in a large range fig 13 shows the conceptual diagrams of the three swmm models a sub catchment areas were divided using the tyson s polygon method b sub catchment areas were divided using the d8 algorithm combined with a 10 10 m dem and c sub catchment areas were divided using the d8 algorithm combined with a 5 5m interpolated dem by comparing fig 13 b and fig 13 c it can be found that the ranges of most sub catchment areas in fig 13 c are more detailed and the shapes of some sub catchment areas differ greatly due to differences in raster size the reason is that a 100 square meter grid has only one direction of flow but after refinement it is divided into 4 grids of 25 square meters each which can account for four directions of flow having a significant impact on the statistics of the catchment area in terms of setting parameters of above three models the feature width and slope of fig 13 a and fig 13 b are determined by traditional empirical formulas while those of fig 13 c are obtained using formulas 1 3 the three models are carried out under the same conditions for other parameters two sets of measured rainfall data in fig 7 are used for the simulation the water level results in three monitoring wells are applied to compare the models the results of the two methods are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 and the comparison results of the nash coefficient are shown in tables 9 and 10 by comparing the results it was found that the nash coefficients obtained by the model using the d8 algorithm were all higher than those calculated by the model using the tyson s polygon method this indicates that the model using the d8 algorithm has higher accuracy than that by the tyson s polygon method in addition it is easy to find that nash coefficients obtained by the d8 algorithm coupling linear interpolation method and the path weighted average method are highest of all the three models which demonstrating that a reasonable method for dividing sub watersheds and determining key model parameters feature width and slope can effectively improve model accuracy 4 2 advantage analysis of swtm model considering backflow effect the advantages of the swtm model developed are discussed from inundation area inundation depth and inundation duration comparing with the traditional 2d model in terms of inundation area the results of the two models are shown in table 11 it can be seen that the inundation area result by the model without considering backflow effect is larger than that with considering it the error is even more than 90 which is far different from the actual inundate area what is more with the increase of rainstorm intensity the error shows a tendency to increase and then decrease in terms of maximum inundation depth table 12 compares the differences in results with or without considering backflow effect it can be seen that the maximum inundation depth results obtained by the model without backflow effect is larger than that indicated by the model considering backflow effect the maximum water depth difference is 0 11 m and the maximum error is 10 39 as the intensity of the storm increases the error will show a tendency to increase and then decrease in terms of inundate duration inundate duration statistics cannot be carried out without backflow effect therefore the difference of inundate duration under different methods is no longer compared here it needs to be emphasized or stated is that the model considering backflow effect proposed can not only the count the inundation duration of the study area but also the peak inundation time which is the advantage of the model in this paper 4 3 limitation and future work through the above comparative analysis it is not difficult to see that this paper lacks a comparison between actual inundation and simulation results in the two dimensional model part which is due to the difficulty in obtaining monitoring data here in fact the swtm model developed in this study with high integrity and accuracy requires high precision data to produce more reliable results as a result it may not be suitable for areas with insufficient or low accuracy data in fact some scholars have studied the coupling of swmm with a 2d hydraulic model considering backflow effects but they are all not open source software in this study two open source software is used for autonomous coupling which can provide more convenient simulation tools for researchers in the future 5 conclusion in this paper a novel urban flood simulation model swtm is developed based on d8 algorithm and backflow effect the main conclusions are as follows 1 a new coupling method between the swmm model and the telemac 2d model is proposed with high accuracy 2 d8 algorithm is used to propose a new sub catchment area division method which greatly improves the accuracy of the model 3 the simulation of rainfall runoff processes is characterized more accurate by using the path weighted average method for the calculation of the feature width and feature slope in sub catchment 4 using the rapid modeling scheme greatly improves the efficiency of model establishment model parameter adjustment and model result processing 5 the changes of inundation range inundation depth and inundation duration under different rainstorm scenarios were analyzed considering backflow effect 6 by comparing with the traditional model it is proved that the swtm model has higher accuracy and advantage credit authorship contribution statement weichao yang conceptualization methodology chuanxing zheng software methodology

1881,the glaciated himalayan region is the third largest storehouse of freshwater in its frozen form that feeds several mega river systems especially the north eastern himalayas where the snow and glacial stock depend on various moisture sources this study presents a detailed investigation of water sources in the teesta watershed in terms of oxygen δ18o and deuterium δd δ2h values the study helped understand the spatio temporal variability in the isotopic composition of water and moisture sources progressive depletion of δ18o values in the stream water as moving towards the non renewable glacial source indicates orographic ascent attributed to cooling and subsequent rainout this effect is profound in the case of the western tributary above chungthang the lachen chu river the computed d excess values suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies in the high altitude perennial streams of the west and north sikkim also a deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model is developed to quantify the contribution of source endmembers such as snowmelt rainfall and glacial melt in the river streams and waterfalls of the rathong river as well as lachen chu and lachung chu rivers above their confluence at chungthang with the model being iterated 10 000 times for each waterfall and stream sample the results have been obtained at the mean 25th 75th and 95th percentiles the model results in the mean glacial ice melt contribution between 40 and 47 in different seasons with the standard deviation between 3 5 and 10 keywords himalaya teesta watershed isotope mixing model stable isotope indian summer monsoon mid latitude westerlies data availability data used in this study are given in tables 1 introduction the himalayan cryosphere is a source for several river systems including the ganges the indus the brahmaputra the mekong the yangtze the salween and the teesta it is critically important to understand the governing mechanism of such river systems in terms of their source and intermediate processes especially in the case of glacier fed rivers where fluctuations in the glacial melt influence the flow various researches over the past few decades claim the shrinking behavior of himalayan glaciers bolch et al 2012 shrestha et al 2015 this raises questions about the perennial access to fresh water for millions of people in southeast asia accounting for 8 58 of the world s population freshwater acts as an essential component in maintaining biodiversity on the terrestrial environment wanjui 2013 this becomes much more crucial for the indian subcontinent which is densely populated 12 5 of the world population coupled with extensive agrarian practices singh 2004 malhan and rao 2017 snow glacial melt and rainfall serve as the major components of freshwater for agriculture the south west monsoon also known as the indian summer monsoon ism is the major contributor to yearly precipitation in india accounting for 80 annamalai et al 2007 chevuturi et al 2019 the rest of the 20 precipitation is due to the north east monsoon during winter and the mid latitude westerlies kripalani and kumar 2004 dimri et al 2013 the winter precipitation occurs between december and february in the form of snowfall that provides melt contribution to the north indian rivers later in the early summer dai 1990 dimri et al 2016 studies suggest that the overall contribution of the winter monsoon is quite significant and requires attention lang and barros 2004 dimri 2014 yadav et al 2013 with the increase in the population within the subcontinent there is an exponential increment in the demand for freshwater supply okello et al 2015 liu et al 2017 monsoon can be defined as an atmospheric phenomenon an amalgamation of various atmospheric circulations on a regional scale governed by land air sea interactions and solar radiative cycle resulting in alterations in seasonal pressure systems therefore defining the climate of a region zhisheng et al 2015 over the past centuries its domain has shifted from a regional sub continental scale to a global scale that assimilates subtropics tropics vertically up to the stratosphere wang and ding 2008 chang 2011 in the context of the indian subcontinent variations in heat capacities of ocean and land especially the thar desert and the tibetan plateau create a low pressure zone that governs the migration of the equatorial convergence zone also known as the intertropical convergence zone itcz this leads to the reversal of seasonal winds delivering rainfall to different subcontinent regions charney 1968 chao and chen 2001 the 1500 mi long himalayan stretch is pivotal in the precipitation pattern over the indian landmass on the one hand where it hinders the icy winds from the north on the other hand it blocks the departure of moisture laden summer monsoon towards the north between october and february bulk of snowfall occurs in the himalayan ranges which helps maintain the perennial flow of some major river systems benn and owen 1998 however the contribution of the winter monsoon decreases as moving away from the east benn and owen 1998 ali et al 2019 moreover to understand the sustainability of himalayan glaciers researchers monitor snow cover patel et al 2019 mondal and bharti 2023 and quantify glacial mass loss on an annual basis where remote sensing is associated with melt modeling techniques such as the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat gardner et al 2013 space gravimetry data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite airborne laser altimetry kääb et al 2012 jacob et al 2012 digital elevation models dems gardelle et al 2013 and meteorological datasets accepting the fact that these techniques provide significant insight into the process of glacial recession and accumulation there exist possibilities of considerable disagreement boral and sen 2020 remote sensing techniques consider both accumulation mass gain and ablation mass loss over a balance year for estimating the glacial mass loss which cannot provide volumetric loss that flows into the perennial rivers as melt contributions such as glacial melt during summer that equals accumulation during winter indicates zero net mass loss however the glacial body might have delivered a substantial amount of melt contribution to its river network researchers have also developed cryospheric hydrological models lutz et al 2014 to quantify snow and ice meltwater contributions to himalayan river systems however such modeling derived melt water contribution shows considerable disagreement in the case of himalayan rivers also it becomes difficult to validate the results from other studies as consideration of source end members lack homogeneity boral and sen 2020 this necessitates new techniques to quantify various source endmembers to surface water flows this can help in developing a better understanding of perennial river systems of the himalayan region and their dependence on glacial melt a non renewable source moreover this would help improve our understanding of regional scale basin hydrology therefore to understand the complicated mechanism of himalayan hydrology and the origin of moisture sources it is crucial to investigate the isotopic characterization of meteoric precipitation which also explains the phase transition during the transportation of moisture henderson sellers et al 2004 ali et al 2020 geomorphic geographic and atmospheric factors such as evaporation relative humidity temperature elevation altitude and latitude govern the isotopic identity of precipitation qu et al 2018 studying the stable isotopic composition of deuterium δd δ2h and oxygen δ18o and d excess effectively provides valuable information about the moisture source within the surface water even though the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip provides detailed long term variations in δd and δ18o of a region studies in the himalayan region still face some challenges due to unfavorable weather and difficult topography data collection is minimal resulting in serious challenges in the quantitative study of surface water for its moisture source ali et al 2020 in the present study an attempt is made to investigate the isotopic composition of different water sources in the teesta river basin trace the moisture sources and quantify the percentage composition of primary sources such as glacial melt snow and rainfall in the headwaters of the lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river streams on a seasonal basis 2 study area sikkim is a north eastern state of india that encompasses the eastern himalayas sharing its geographical boundary with bhutan tibet and nepal in the east north and west respectively dubey et al 2019 the state s northern region is acquired by several glacial bodies accounting for 12 883 km2 of the state area aggarwal et al 2017 with the zemu glacier being the largest the transboundary catchment of the teesta river covers a total area of 12 159 sq km of which 10 155 sq km lies within india and the rest in bangladesh khan and ali 2019 the teesta basin experiences significant spatial variation in the mean annual rainfall that varies from 200 mm in the high altitude cold and arid regions to 5000 mm in the lower reaches of dense vegetation cover the river basin receives 80 2 of the annual precipitation during monsoon and the remaining 19 8 in other seasons 13 6 in summer 5 5 in post monsoon and 0 7 in winter ranade et al 2007 steep topography associated with heavy rainfall leads to higher surface runoff this results in soil erosion failure of channel walls and landslide episodes the average temperature of the watershed in summer season is 25 c which recedes to 3 c during winters provided the high altitude glaciated regions remain below freezing ali et al 2020 the relative humidity remains above the margin of 70 throughout the annual hydrological cycle the teesta river originates from the glacial bodies in the north sikkim district such as the zemu chamgme pahunri kangchengyao and khangse glaciers meetei et al 2007 goyal and goswami 2018 ali et al 2020 two primary glacier fed streams namely the lachen chu and lachung chu converge in the chungthang region of north sikkim forming the teesta river thereafter fig 1 other tributaries such as the rangpo chu talung chu rongni chu and rangeet join the teesta river at rangpo singhik singtam and the border between sikkim and west bengal respectively ali et al 2020 due to the topographical profile of the region and the contribution of various water sources to the discharge of the streams the teesta river has turbulent flow throughout sikkim carrying sediments and boulders along the continuous process of deposition and denudation results in newly formed landforms from existing land exhibiting large geographical variability n d m a 2013 landforms in the upper reaches are characterized by rock glaciers relict lake sediments glacial moraine deposits gravel terraces and talus fans whereas the middle and lower reaches of the watershed can be characterized by subdued relief and comparatively less steep terrain ali et al 2018 vegetation cover within the catchment varies from alpine type in the northern higher elevation to tropical deciduous type in the southern lower elevations 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples collection and analysis seasonal analysis of water samples for stable isotopes in the north eastern himalayan region is critically important to understand the contribution of non renewable sources glacial melt into the perennial streams the heavy runoff season culminates within the monsoon season after which the perennial river streams return to their base flow condition ali et al 2020 this investigation is focused on collecting water samples from various sources contributing to the discharge of the primary river streams of the teesta river namely the lachen chu and lachung chu of north sikkim the teesta watershed because of its altitudinal variations and geographic location experiences temperate tropical and alpine climatic scenarios the major seasons in a year are winter january march summer march april and monsoon april december the monsoon period can be further subdivided into beginning monsoon april may incessant monsoon may september and end monsoon september december the water samples were collected in three different periods between 18th 23rd jan 2021 winter 3rd 7th aug 2021 incessant monsoon and 15th 24th oct 2021 end monsoon as shown in fig 2 also a separate field investigation was dedicated to collecting water samples in west sikkim between 7th 10th april 2022 summer to study the rathong river originating from the rathong glacier fig 3 various sources of water such as snowfall rainfall glacial melt natural waterfalls river streams and glacial lakes were collected on a spatio temporal basis fig 4 a total of 102 water samples which includes forty one samples from streams main and tributaries of teesta river five from rathong river eight snow melt and six rainfall samples thirty seven waterfall samples one glacial lake samples and four glacial ice melt have been collected from various locations and different periods table 1 special precautions were taken during the collection of snow and glacial samples as melt water from a glacial body can be a mixture of both snowmelt and melting metamorphosed glacial ice glacial outcrops and calving zones were identified personally visited and samples were collected with utmost carefulness the water samples were collected in 30 ml pre cleaned high density polyethylene hdpe bottles to measure stable isotopes δ18o and δd before collection the bottles were rinsed thoroughly multiple times with sample water at the acquisition site the water samples were filled to the brim of the respective hdpe bottles and capped tightly to avoid exchanging with atmospheric moisture and evaporation later the samples were transferred to the nuclear hydrology laboratory national institute of hydrology for isotope analysis a dual inlet stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer disirms was used to quantify δd a continuous flow stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer cfsirms was used to measure the δ18o values of each sample the samples were equilibrated with h2 and co2 for the quantification of stable isotopes proportion with a precision range of 0 1 and 1 0 for δ18o and δd respectively by analyzing the international atomic energy agency iaea standards behera et al 2019 1 δ r sample r standard r standard x 10 3 here rsample and rstandard define the ratio of 2h 1h and 18o 16o isotopes for water samples collected from the field and standard water sample respectively the results are expressed in per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and expressed with δ as represented in eq 1 3 2 isotope mixing model the contributions of endmember sources such as glacial melt groundwater rainfall and snowfall to the river streams are considered fingerprints or excellent tracers to water sources in rivers as they are fractionated through natural hydrological processes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in the present study an attempt is made to quantify the percentage composition of glacial melt snow melt and rainfall in the headwaters of lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river streams using a season and basin specific three endmember isotope mixing model the model is developed using the δ18o and the deuterium excess d excess composition of water samples from various sources as shown in the equation below dansgaard 1964 2 d excess δ d 8 δ 18 o the model considers glacial melt snow melt and rainfall as the major contributors to the headwaters of river streams the intrusion of water from the hyporheic zone underground and minor water sources such as atmospheric depositions are assumed to be negligible another reason for excluding groundwater from the model lies behind the lack of possible groundwater sources for sampling in the lachen and lachung region above chungthang the data of stable isotopes δ18o and δd from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip and the global network of isotopes in rivers gnir follows the global meteoric water line gmwl halder et al 2015 so as our datasets as well fig 5 therefore insignificant alteration in isotopic composition of river streams due to evaporation can be considered it is to be noted that the model treats rain and snow as independent endmembers as rain samples were collected from comparatively lower elevation regions of north sikkim compared to the snow samples some differences exist in the isotopic compositions precipitation in the himalayan region shows altitudinal and seasonal variability in terms of δ18o and d excess boral and sen 2020 the two primary sources dual source of precipitation in the himalayan regions are the western disturbances between december and march that find their origin in the mediterranean sea and the south west monsoon between july and september that originates in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea precipitation due to western disturbances is characterized by greater d excess 20 as compared to south west monsoon 10 bershaw et al 2012 a seasonal sampling of end members has helped to capture the seasonal variations in the δ18o and d excess of snow and rainfall in the teesta watershed table 1 this has helped quantify seasonal snowmelt and rainfall contribution to the river streams this study uses season specific variations in δ18o and d excess of rainfall and snow as the best possible proxy for defining the composition of dual source precipitation components even though stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd are widely used as effective tracers in the hydrograph separation studies they are strongly correlated fig 5 however d excess eq 2 and δ18o are truly independent of each other fig 6 and therefore can be effectively used as independent tracers boral and sen 2020 the isotope mixing model is based on the following equations 3 δ 18 o snow f snow δ 18 o rain f rain δ 18 o glacier f glacier δ 18 o river 4 d e x c e s s snow f snow d e x c e s s rain f rain d e x c e s s glacier f glacier d e x c e s s river 5 f snow f rain f glacier 1 here δ 18 o snow and d e x c e s s snow represent the composition of snow meltwater δ 18 o rain and d e x c e s s rain are the rainfall composition and δ 18 o glacier and d e x c e s s glacier are the composition of glacial ice meltwater eq 5 is the mass balance equation where f snow f rain and f glacier represent the fractions of snowmelt rain and glacial melt contributing to the river stream respectively therefore the equations mentioned above can be written as eq 6 that can be solved to obtain the fractional contribution of snowmelt rain and glacial melt into the river streams δ 18 o snow dexcess snow 1 δ 18 o rain dexcess rain 1 δ 18 o glacier dexcess glacier 1 f snow f rain f glacier δ 18 o river dexcess river 1 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 variations of stable isotopes the composition of δ18o and δd in the water samples from various sources of the teesta watershed are shown in table 1 the δ18o values along river streams vary seasonally and deplete with altitude the maximum and minimum δ18o values on seasonal basis for the major river streams of north sikkim and west sikkim are shown in table 2 higher δ18o values are observed in the lower reaches lower altitude at the confluence of lachen chu and lachung chu near chungthang during winter 2021 or within the main teesta river at much lower elevations during monsoon the lower δ18o values are recorded in the upper reaches higher altitude closer to the river streams source glacial bodies throughout the year the lachen chu river has also been observed with minimum δ18o values along the upper reaches throughout the year that increases along the downstream similar observations have been made in the rathong river stream where the minimum δ18o values have been observed at upper reaches close to the glacial source that increases downstream of the river in precipitation maximum values of δ18o have been recorded for snow and rainfall during end monsoon oct 2021 whereas the least δ18o values have been observed during winter jan 2021 as shown in table 3 table 4 is informative to the δ18o values of three different glacial bodies contributing to the discharge of its daughter streams that finally meet the teesta river stream downstream a variation in the δ18o values can be observed in all three glacial melt samples collected from three different locations in sikkim these glacial bodies feed three major tributaries of the teesta river originating from north and west sikkim there exists a strong correlation between the behavioural pattern of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the teesta watershed the δd values of the teesta river streams fluctuate between 60 9 and 100 3 during winter 62 99 and 112 03 during peak monsoon and between 80 66 and 111 64 during end monsoon for the rathong river stream this range varies between 59 93 and 106 66 during winter the varying trend of δd along the course of the river streams shows good agreement with δ18o the d excess values of the river streams lie between 10 58 and 18 90 throughout the year 4 2 tracing δ18o and d excess of endmember sources on spatio temporal basis there exists large intra seasonal variability between d excess and δ18o of the river streams fig 6 as well as snow melt fig 7 and rainfall fig 8 variability of δ18o and d excess is also reflected with latitude longitude and altitude fig 10 naturally river water is a complex mixture of various source end members which undergo several processes during formation and contribution to the river streams for instance during the process of furnisation precipitated snow gets recrystallized which alters the composition of precipitated snow and is governed by various atmospheric parameters arnason 1981 again heavy rainfall episodes in the himalayas result in more depletion of the isotopic compositions than the equilibrium rainfall events gat 1996 the stable isotopic composition of rainfall is also affected due to intermittency intensity and evaporation of rainfall this results in a complex relationship between stable isotopes of oxygen hydrogen with lat long and elevation fig 9 4 3 tracing moisture sources and local climatic conditions of the teesta watershed the teesta watershed receives rainfall from the bay of bengal bob branch of the ism and is governed by the altitudinal gradient south north trajectory of the watershed the higher and trans himalayan region northern region experiences a steady decline in precipitation whereas the lesser himalayan region foothills or southern region remains humid dubey et al 2018 the high elevation northern region also receives precipitation during winters between december and march due to southern branches of mid latitude westerlies wei and gasse 1999 ali et al 2019 due to this reason mixed signals from two different moisture sources are anticipated in the northern region of the watershed moreover other processes such as local scale recycling of water evaporation of ambient precipitation and mixing of waters from different moisture sources occur along the himalayan ranges hren et al 2009 the westerlies move into the higher himalayan region and the qinghai tibetan plateau along the brahmaputra river this also applies to the teesta watershed ali et al 2020 during winter jan 2021 δ18o value of 9 5 has been observed in the southern low elevation region 250 m a s l along the main teesta river as moving toward the high elevation northern region towards the glacial source there is a progressive decline in the δ18o values to 13 9 3487 m a s l and 12 5 3374 m a s l towards upstream of lachen chu and lachung chu respectively during incessant monsoon aug 2021 δ18o values shift from 10 74 274 m a s l to 14 77 5158 m a s l and 12 85 3367 m a s l towards lachen chu and lachung chu respectively during end monsoon oct 2021 the δ18o values shift from 12 32 577 m a s l to 16 25 4427 m a s l and 13 90 4943 m a s l another interesting thing to note is the comparatively greater depletion of 18o isotope as moving towards the glacial source of lachen chu river than the lachung chu river stream this represents progressive depletion and distillation of 18o isotope in the clouds as it propagates towards elevated northern region from the low altitude southern region orographic ascent attributed to subsequent rainout and cooling hren et al 2009 this effect of orographic ascent is greater for teesta river s western tributary lachen chu above chungthang than the eastern tributary lachung chu in the case of the rathong river similar observations have been made during winter april 2022 with a greater δ18o value 9 62 at 1286 m a s l that reduces to 14 1 at 4069 m a s l a glacial lake situated at the rathong glacial snout at an elevation of 4620 m a s l shows δ18o value of 15 85 the d excess values are widely used to study the deviation of the regional scale isotopic composition of water from the gmwl as well as infer the moisture sources craig 1961 lai and ehleringer 2011 tian et al 2018 within the water samples d excess values are primarily governed by humidity and air temperature greater d excess values indicate lower relative humidity and vice versa dansgaard 1964 low latitude ocean surface evaporation infers high relative humidity and low d excess sub cloud evaporation or local evapotranspiration leads to decreased d excess values dansgaard 1964 the d excess values also help understand the atmospheric conditions and processes governing the spatio temporal transformation of water composition dalai et al 2002 researchers have found that d excess can be used independently to calibrate atmospheric general circulation models gcms joussaume et al 1984 jouzel et al 1987 hoffmann et al 1998 they can also be used to investigate the present as well as previous precipitation processes the d excess of water samples in the teesta watershed varies between 10 58 and 23 70 with an average d excess of 16 29 the d excess of teesta river tributaries ranges from 10 58 to 18 90 with a mean of 15 51 in the case of the rathong river d excess fluctuates between 14 69 and 17 03 with an average of 16 04 the difference between the overall mean of water samples and the mean of river samples indicates the mixing of water from rain snow and glacial melt cooper 1998 the seasonal mean d excess of 16 14 13 99 and 16 53 during winter incessant and end monsoon lie close to the overall mean except for incessant monsoon period the teesta watershed lies in the trajectory of the bob branch of ism due to which the southern part of the watershed experiences heavy precipitation and humid climatic condition with a steady decline of ism the northern region experiences winter precipitation contributed by the mid latitude westerlies yihui and zunya 2008 dubey et al 2018 the long term mean of d excess for the ism and mid latitude westerlies are 8 and 22 6 respectively iaea 1992 the d excess values presented in this study suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies in the northern region of the teesta watershed and tributaries such as lachen chu and lachung chu the progressive decline of 18o as moving toward the glacial source of the river streams agrees with other studies ali et al 2020 boral and sen 2020 that suggest mixing of moisture sources in the trans and higher himalayan catchments 4 4 quantification of source end members to river streams and waterfalls 4 4 1 model inputs and execution the input parameters of the isotope mixing model are the season dependent source endmembers δ18o and d excess of water samples from river streams in order to determine the relationship between δ18o and d excess of the river samples source δ18o and computed d excess are represented on a scatter plot as shown in fig 6 the scatter plot reveals large natural variability attributed to a lower degree of covariance which makes them fit to be used as independent tracers in the mixing model executing the model with the help of mean δ18o and d excess may unnecessarily deliver fractional estimates of endmembers sensitive to the adopted mean value khan et al 2017 therefore the mean μ isotopic composition has been calculated for the source endmembers seasonally and assigned a range from previous researches on himalayan regions kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2016 the range defined for precipitation snow and rain are μ 10 for d excess and μ 2 5 for δ18o whereas the range assigned for glacial ice melt water are μ 5 for d excess and μ 2 5 for δ18o since estimating the isotopic composition of glacial bodies in the sikkim himalayas has not been performed so far the range has been assigned as per research conducted over other himalayan glaciers ali et al 2020 boral and sen 2020 thus the source endmember ranges can be considered as the best possible estimates for seasonal apportionment of river streams in the teesta watershed the fractional composition of snow f snow rain f rain and glacial melt f glacier has been derived using eq 6 in which the obtained δ18o and computed d excess of the source endmembers have been randomly sampled from the defined ranges the d excess and δ18o of the river samples have been acquired from the database shown in table 1 as frequency distribution analyses a random sampling of d excess and δ18o for the endmembers snow rain and glacial melt has been performed this shows that d excess and δ18o of endmembers are evenly distributed within the defined range thus equally probable the season specific isotope mixing model has been deterministically executed through a monte carlo framework the model has been iterated 104 times for every river water sample retaining 104 iterations mean and standard deviation of all the iterations has been considered the best possible result moreover the 25th 75th and 95th percentile have also been calculated 4 4 2 model outputs the results from the deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model show large variability in source endmembers contributions to the river streams and waterfalls above the confluence of lachen chu and lachung chu at chungthang and the rathong river the percentage contribution of snowmelt rain and glacial ice melt water contributions to the headwaters of lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river has been shown in table 5 the average and standard deviation of snow rain and glacial melt contribution to the river streams and waterfalls are shown in table 6 precipitation contribution shows varying proportions for snow and rainfall separately during the incessant monsoon period precipitation accounts for 60 contribution to the river streams and waterfalls in the teesta watershed results show a consistency in the glacial melt contribution between 40 and 47 in all the seasons with some increment in the end monsoon period however with the conventional understanding of glacial melt water contributions to himalayan rivers it is expected to observe the highest glacial melt water contribution during summer or pre monsoon some anomalous observation has been made earlier in case of the indus and the ganges showing peak ice melt contribution during monsoon on the other hand river systems such as the brahmaputra and the yangtze show enhanced ice melt contribution during the pre and peak monsoon period boral and sen 2020 several mechanisms bring an understanding towards such anomaly such as obscuring snow cover over glacial bodies during the pre monsoon period might result in diminished glacial melting other possible reasons being time lag between glacial melt water production and transport process rain induced glacial melting during monsoon and volumetric effect between monsoon and pre monsoon boral and sen 2020 4 5 model limitations the three endmember mixing model used in this study is a basin specific model developed explicitly for the teesta watershed with certain assumptions such as negligible intrusion of underground water and hyporheic zone as well as atmospheric depositions the selection of source endmembers may also introduce some bias in the obtained results since the model is based on δ18o and d excess tracer equations the model is capable of segregating contributions from utmost three source endmembers however intra annual monthly basis study of isotopic composition incorporating new conservative tracers and contemporary datasets might help minimize the model s uncertainty and biases 5 conclusion glaciated himalayan region act as a storehouse of freshwater in its frozen state feeding several river systems of the indian subcontinent this necessitates studying the himalayan catchments and rivers for their moisture sources and the seasonal contribution of glaciers to the perennial streams in this study different water sources within the teesta watershed have been extensively studied for the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δd that helped in the outcomes mentioned below the spatio temporal analysis of stable isotopes on a seasonal basis reveals seasonally varying δ18o values of the river streams rain and snow three glacial bodies in three different locations in the teesta watershed show varying δ18o compositions these glaciers feed three major tributaries of the teesta river system a progressive decline in the δ18o values as moving towards the non renewable glacial source has been observed in the headwaters of two major tributaries lachen chu and lachung chu more significant depletion of δ18o isotope has been observed in the case of the lachen chu river this indicates progressive depletion and distillation of 18o isotope in the clouds orographic ascent attributed to cooling and subsequent rainout this is also observed in the rathong river stream in west sikkim there is a difference between the mean d excess of all the water samples 16 29 and river streams 15 51 indicating water mixing from precipitation and glacial melt for the rathong river the d excess 16 04 is comparatively close to the overall mean the d excess values suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies over ism in the high altitude northern region of the teesta watershed the deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model shows consistent mean glacial melt contribution in the teesta river stream that ranges between 40 and 47 in different seasons with a maximum glacial melt contribution in the end monsoon period such behavior disagrees with the conventional understanding of maximum glacial melt during summer or pre monsoon such anomalous behavior has also been observed

1881,the glaciated himalayan region is the third largest storehouse of freshwater in its frozen form that feeds several mega river systems especially the north eastern himalayas where the snow and glacial stock depend on various moisture sources this study presents a detailed investigation of water sources in the teesta watershed in terms of oxygen δ18o and deuterium δd δ2h values the study helped understand the spatio temporal variability in the isotopic composition of water and moisture sources progressive depletion of δ18o values in the stream water as moving towards the non renewable glacial source indicates orographic ascent attributed to cooling and subsequent rainout this effect is profound in the case of the western tributary above chungthang the lachen chu river the computed d excess values suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies in the high altitude perennial streams of the west and north sikkim also a deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model is developed to quantify the contribution of source endmembers such as snowmelt rainfall and glacial melt in the river streams and waterfalls of the rathong river as well as lachen chu and lachung chu rivers above their confluence at chungthang with the model being iterated 10 000 times for each waterfall and stream sample the results have been obtained at the mean 25th 75th and 95th percentiles the model results in the mean glacial ice melt contribution between 40 and 47 in different seasons with the standard deviation between 3 5 and 10 keywords himalaya teesta watershed isotope mixing model stable isotope indian summer monsoon mid latitude westerlies data availability data used in this study are given in tables 1 introduction the himalayan cryosphere is a source for several river systems including the ganges the indus the brahmaputra the mekong the yangtze the salween and the teesta it is critically important to understand the governing mechanism of such river systems in terms of their source and intermediate processes especially in the case of glacier fed rivers where fluctuations in the glacial melt influence the flow various researches over the past few decades claim the shrinking behavior of himalayan glaciers bolch et al 2012 shrestha et al 2015 this raises questions about the perennial access to fresh water for millions of people in southeast asia accounting for 8 58 of the world s population freshwater acts as an essential component in maintaining biodiversity on the terrestrial environment wanjui 2013 this becomes much more crucial for the indian subcontinent which is densely populated 12 5 of the world population coupled with extensive agrarian practices singh 2004 malhan and rao 2017 snow glacial melt and rainfall serve as the major components of freshwater for agriculture the south west monsoon also known as the indian summer monsoon ism is the major contributor to yearly precipitation in india accounting for 80 annamalai et al 2007 chevuturi et al 2019 the rest of the 20 precipitation is due to the north east monsoon during winter and the mid latitude westerlies kripalani and kumar 2004 dimri et al 2013 the winter precipitation occurs between december and february in the form of snowfall that provides melt contribution to the north indian rivers later in the early summer dai 1990 dimri et al 2016 studies suggest that the overall contribution of the winter monsoon is quite significant and requires attention lang and barros 2004 dimri 2014 yadav et al 2013 with the increase in the population within the subcontinent there is an exponential increment in the demand for freshwater supply okello et al 2015 liu et al 2017 monsoon can be defined as an atmospheric phenomenon an amalgamation of various atmospheric circulations on a regional scale governed by land air sea interactions and solar radiative cycle resulting in alterations in seasonal pressure systems therefore defining the climate of a region zhisheng et al 2015 over the past centuries its domain has shifted from a regional sub continental scale to a global scale that assimilates subtropics tropics vertically up to the stratosphere wang and ding 2008 chang 2011 in the context of the indian subcontinent variations in heat capacities of ocean and land especially the thar desert and the tibetan plateau create a low pressure zone that governs the migration of the equatorial convergence zone also known as the intertropical convergence zone itcz this leads to the reversal of seasonal winds delivering rainfall to different subcontinent regions charney 1968 chao and chen 2001 the 1500 mi long himalayan stretch is pivotal in the precipitation pattern over the indian landmass on the one hand where it hinders the icy winds from the north on the other hand it blocks the departure of moisture laden summer monsoon towards the north between october and february bulk of snowfall occurs in the himalayan ranges which helps maintain the perennial flow of some major river systems benn and owen 1998 however the contribution of the winter monsoon decreases as moving away from the east benn and owen 1998 ali et al 2019 moreover to understand the sustainability of himalayan glaciers researchers monitor snow cover patel et al 2019 mondal and bharti 2023 and quantify glacial mass loss on an annual basis where remote sensing is associated with melt modeling techniques such as the ice cloud and land elevation satellite icesat gardner et al 2013 space gravimetry data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite airborne laser altimetry kääb et al 2012 jacob et al 2012 digital elevation models dems gardelle et al 2013 and meteorological datasets accepting the fact that these techniques provide significant insight into the process of glacial recession and accumulation there exist possibilities of considerable disagreement boral and sen 2020 remote sensing techniques consider both accumulation mass gain and ablation mass loss over a balance year for estimating the glacial mass loss which cannot provide volumetric loss that flows into the perennial rivers as melt contributions such as glacial melt during summer that equals accumulation during winter indicates zero net mass loss however the glacial body might have delivered a substantial amount of melt contribution to its river network researchers have also developed cryospheric hydrological models lutz et al 2014 to quantify snow and ice meltwater contributions to himalayan river systems however such modeling derived melt water contribution shows considerable disagreement in the case of himalayan rivers also it becomes difficult to validate the results from other studies as consideration of source end members lack homogeneity boral and sen 2020 this necessitates new techniques to quantify various source endmembers to surface water flows this can help in developing a better understanding of perennial river systems of the himalayan region and their dependence on glacial melt a non renewable source moreover this would help improve our understanding of regional scale basin hydrology therefore to understand the complicated mechanism of himalayan hydrology and the origin of moisture sources it is crucial to investigate the isotopic characterization of meteoric precipitation which also explains the phase transition during the transportation of moisture henderson sellers et al 2004 ali et al 2020 geomorphic geographic and atmospheric factors such as evaporation relative humidity temperature elevation altitude and latitude govern the isotopic identity of precipitation qu et al 2018 studying the stable isotopic composition of deuterium δd δ2h and oxygen δ18o and d excess effectively provides valuable information about the moisture source within the surface water even though the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip provides detailed long term variations in δd and δ18o of a region studies in the himalayan region still face some challenges due to unfavorable weather and difficult topography data collection is minimal resulting in serious challenges in the quantitative study of surface water for its moisture source ali et al 2020 in the present study an attempt is made to investigate the isotopic composition of different water sources in the teesta river basin trace the moisture sources and quantify the percentage composition of primary sources such as glacial melt snow and rainfall in the headwaters of the lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river streams on a seasonal basis 2 study area sikkim is a north eastern state of india that encompasses the eastern himalayas sharing its geographical boundary with bhutan tibet and nepal in the east north and west respectively dubey et al 2019 the state s northern region is acquired by several glacial bodies accounting for 12 883 km2 of the state area aggarwal et al 2017 with the zemu glacier being the largest the transboundary catchment of the teesta river covers a total area of 12 159 sq km of which 10 155 sq km lies within india and the rest in bangladesh khan and ali 2019 the teesta basin experiences significant spatial variation in the mean annual rainfall that varies from 200 mm in the high altitude cold and arid regions to 5000 mm in the lower reaches of dense vegetation cover the river basin receives 80 2 of the annual precipitation during monsoon and the remaining 19 8 in other seasons 13 6 in summer 5 5 in post monsoon and 0 7 in winter ranade et al 2007 steep topography associated with heavy rainfall leads to higher surface runoff this results in soil erosion failure of channel walls and landslide episodes the average temperature of the watershed in summer season is 25 c which recedes to 3 c during winters provided the high altitude glaciated regions remain below freezing ali et al 2020 the relative humidity remains above the margin of 70 throughout the annual hydrological cycle the teesta river originates from the glacial bodies in the north sikkim district such as the zemu chamgme pahunri kangchengyao and khangse glaciers meetei et al 2007 goyal and goswami 2018 ali et al 2020 two primary glacier fed streams namely the lachen chu and lachung chu converge in the chungthang region of north sikkim forming the teesta river thereafter fig 1 other tributaries such as the rangpo chu talung chu rongni chu and rangeet join the teesta river at rangpo singhik singtam and the border between sikkim and west bengal respectively ali et al 2020 due to the topographical profile of the region and the contribution of various water sources to the discharge of the streams the teesta river has turbulent flow throughout sikkim carrying sediments and boulders along the continuous process of deposition and denudation results in newly formed landforms from existing land exhibiting large geographical variability n d m a 2013 landforms in the upper reaches are characterized by rock glaciers relict lake sediments glacial moraine deposits gravel terraces and talus fans whereas the middle and lower reaches of the watershed can be characterized by subdued relief and comparatively less steep terrain ali et al 2018 vegetation cover within the catchment varies from alpine type in the northern higher elevation to tropical deciduous type in the southern lower elevations 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples collection and analysis seasonal analysis of water samples for stable isotopes in the north eastern himalayan region is critically important to understand the contribution of non renewable sources glacial melt into the perennial streams the heavy runoff season culminates within the monsoon season after which the perennial river streams return to their base flow condition ali et al 2020 this investigation is focused on collecting water samples from various sources contributing to the discharge of the primary river streams of the teesta river namely the lachen chu and lachung chu of north sikkim the teesta watershed because of its altitudinal variations and geographic location experiences temperate tropical and alpine climatic scenarios the major seasons in a year are winter january march summer march april and monsoon april december the monsoon period can be further subdivided into beginning monsoon april may incessant monsoon may september and end monsoon september december the water samples were collected in three different periods between 18th 23rd jan 2021 winter 3rd 7th aug 2021 incessant monsoon and 15th 24th oct 2021 end monsoon as shown in fig 2 also a separate field investigation was dedicated to collecting water samples in west sikkim between 7th 10th april 2022 summer to study the rathong river originating from the rathong glacier fig 3 various sources of water such as snowfall rainfall glacial melt natural waterfalls river streams and glacial lakes were collected on a spatio temporal basis fig 4 a total of 102 water samples which includes forty one samples from streams main and tributaries of teesta river five from rathong river eight snow melt and six rainfall samples thirty seven waterfall samples one glacial lake samples and four glacial ice melt have been collected from various locations and different periods table 1 special precautions were taken during the collection of snow and glacial samples as melt water from a glacial body can be a mixture of both snowmelt and melting metamorphosed glacial ice glacial outcrops and calving zones were identified personally visited and samples were collected with utmost carefulness the water samples were collected in 30 ml pre cleaned high density polyethylene hdpe bottles to measure stable isotopes δ18o and δd before collection the bottles were rinsed thoroughly multiple times with sample water at the acquisition site the water samples were filled to the brim of the respective hdpe bottles and capped tightly to avoid exchanging with atmospheric moisture and evaporation later the samples were transferred to the nuclear hydrology laboratory national institute of hydrology for isotope analysis a dual inlet stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer disirms was used to quantify δd a continuous flow stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer cfsirms was used to measure the δ18o values of each sample the samples were equilibrated with h2 and co2 for the quantification of stable isotopes proportion with a precision range of 0 1 and 1 0 for δ18o and δd respectively by analyzing the international atomic energy agency iaea standards behera et al 2019 1 δ r sample r standard r standard x 10 3 here rsample and rstandard define the ratio of 2h 1h and 18o 16o isotopes for water samples collected from the field and standard water sample respectively the results are expressed in per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and expressed with δ as represented in eq 1 3 2 isotope mixing model the contributions of endmember sources such as glacial melt groundwater rainfall and snowfall to the river streams are considered fingerprints or excellent tracers to water sources in rivers as they are fractionated through natural hydrological processes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in the present study an attempt is made to quantify the percentage composition of glacial melt snow melt and rainfall in the headwaters of lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river streams using a season and basin specific three endmember isotope mixing model the model is developed using the δ18o and the deuterium excess d excess composition of water samples from various sources as shown in the equation below dansgaard 1964 2 d excess δ d 8 δ 18 o the model considers glacial melt snow melt and rainfall as the major contributors to the headwaters of river streams the intrusion of water from the hyporheic zone underground and minor water sources such as atmospheric depositions are assumed to be negligible another reason for excluding groundwater from the model lies behind the lack of possible groundwater sources for sampling in the lachen and lachung region above chungthang the data of stable isotopes δ18o and δd from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip and the global network of isotopes in rivers gnir follows the global meteoric water line gmwl halder et al 2015 so as our datasets as well fig 5 therefore insignificant alteration in isotopic composition of river streams due to evaporation can be considered it is to be noted that the model treats rain and snow as independent endmembers as rain samples were collected from comparatively lower elevation regions of north sikkim compared to the snow samples some differences exist in the isotopic compositions precipitation in the himalayan region shows altitudinal and seasonal variability in terms of δ18o and d excess boral and sen 2020 the two primary sources dual source of precipitation in the himalayan regions are the western disturbances between december and march that find their origin in the mediterranean sea and the south west monsoon between july and september that originates in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea precipitation due to western disturbances is characterized by greater d excess 20 as compared to south west monsoon 10 bershaw et al 2012 a seasonal sampling of end members has helped to capture the seasonal variations in the δ18o and d excess of snow and rainfall in the teesta watershed table 1 this has helped quantify seasonal snowmelt and rainfall contribution to the river streams this study uses season specific variations in δ18o and d excess of rainfall and snow as the best possible proxy for defining the composition of dual source precipitation components even though stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd are widely used as effective tracers in the hydrograph separation studies they are strongly correlated fig 5 however d excess eq 2 and δ18o are truly independent of each other fig 6 and therefore can be effectively used as independent tracers boral and sen 2020 the isotope mixing model is based on the following equations 3 δ 18 o snow f snow δ 18 o rain f rain δ 18 o glacier f glacier δ 18 o river 4 d e x c e s s snow f snow d e x c e s s rain f rain d e x c e s s glacier f glacier d e x c e s s river 5 f snow f rain f glacier 1 here δ 18 o snow and d e x c e s s snow represent the composition of snow meltwater δ 18 o rain and d e x c e s s rain are the rainfall composition and δ 18 o glacier and d e x c e s s glacier are the composition of glacial ice meltwater eq 5 is the mass balance equation where f snow f rain and f glacier represent the fractions of snowmelt rain and glacial melt contributing to the river stream respectively therefore the equations mentioned above can be written as eq 6 that can be solved to obtain the fractional contribution of snowmelt rain and glacial melt into the river streams δ 18 o snow dexcess snow 1 δ 18 o rain dexcess rain 1 δ 18 o glacier dexcess glacier 1 f snow f rain f glacier δ 18 o river dexcess river 1 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 variations of stable isotopes the composition of δ18o and δd in the water samples from various sources of the teesta watershed are shown in table 1 the δ18o values along river streams vary seasonally and deplete with altitude the maximum and minimum δ18o values on seasonal basis for the major river streams of north sikkim and west sikkim are shown in table 2 higher δ18o values are observed in the lower reaches lower altitude at the confluence of lachen chu and lachung chu near chungthang during winter 2021 or within the main teesta river at much lower elevations during monsoon the lower δ18o values are recorded in the upper reaches higher altitude closer to the river streams source glacial bodies throughout the year the lachen chu river has also been observed with minimum δ18o values along the upper reaches throughout the year that increases along the downstream similar observations have been made in the rathong river stream where the minimum δ18o values have been observed at upper reaches close to the glacial source that increases downstream of the river in precipitation maximum values of δ18o have been recorded for snow and rainfall during end monsoon oct 2021 whereas the least δ18o values have been observed during winter jan 2021 as shown in table 3 table 4 is informative to the δ18o values of three different glacial bodies contributing to the discharge of its daughter streams that finally meet the teesta river stream downstream a variation in the δ18o values can be observed in all three glacial melt samples collected from three different locations in sikkim these glacial bodies feed three major tributaries of the teesta river originating from north and west sikkim there exists a strong correlation between the behavioural pattern of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the teesta watershed the δd values of the teesta river streams fluctuate between 60 9 and 100 3 during winter 62 99 and 112 03 during peak monsoon and between 80 66 and 111 64 during end monsoon for the rathong river stream this range varies between 59 93 and 106 66 during winter the varying trend of δd along the course of the river streams shows good agreement with δ18o the d excess values of the river streams lie between 10 58 and 18 90 throughout the year 4 2 tracing δ18o and d excess of endmember sources on spatio temporal basis there exists large intra seasonal variability between d excess and δ18o of the river streams fig 6 as well as snow melt fig 7 and rainfall fig 8 variability of δ18o and d excess is also reflected with latitude longitude and altitude fig 10 naturally river water is a complex mixture of various source end members which undergo several processes during formation and contribution to the river streams for instance during the process of furnisation precipitated snow gets recrystallized which alters the composition of precipitated snow and is governed by various atmospheric parameters arnason 1981 again heavy rainfall episodes in the himalayas result in more depletion of the isotopic compositions than the equilibrium rainfall events gat 1996 the stable isotopic composition of rainfall is also affected due to intermittency intensity and evaporation of rainfall this results in a complex relationship between stable isotopes of oxygen hydrogen with lat long and elevation fig 9 4 3 tracing moisture sources and local climatic conditions of the teesta watershed the teesta watershed receives rainfall from the bay of bengal bob branch of the ism and is governed by the altitudinal gradient south north trajectory of the watershed the higher and trans himalayan region northern region experiences a steady decline in precipitation whereas the lesser himalayan region foothills or southern region remains humid dubey et al 2018 the high elevation northern region also receives precipitation during winters between december and march due to southern branches of mid latitude westerlies wei and gasse 1999 ali et al 2019 due to this reason mixed signals from two different moisture sources are anticipated in the northern region of the watershed moreover other processes such as local scale recycling of water evaporation of ambient precipitation and mixing of waters from different moisture sources occur along the himalayan ranges hren et al 2009 the westerlies move into the higher himalayan region and the qinghai tibetan plateau along the brahmaputra river this also applies to the teesta watershed ali et al 2020 during winter jan 2021 δ18o value of 9 5 has been observed in the southern low elevation region 250 m a s l along the main teesta river as moving toward the high elevation northern region towards the glacial source there is a progressive decline in the δ18o values to 13 9 3487 m a s l and 12 5 3374 m a s l towards upstream of lachen chu and lachung chu respectively during incessant monsoon aug 2021 δ18o values shift from 10 74 274 m a s l to 14 77 5158 m a s l and 12 85 3367 m a s l towards lachen chu and lachung chu respectively during end monsoon oct 2021 the δ18o values shift from 12 32 577 m a s l to 16 25 4427 m a s l and 13 90 4943 m a s l another interesting thing to note is the comparatively greater depletion of 18o isotope as moving towards the glacial source of lachen chu river than the lachung chu river stream this represents progressive depletion and distillation of 18o isotope in the clouds as it propagates towards elevated northern region from the low altitude southern region orographic ascent attributed to subsequent rainout and cooling hren et al 2009 this effect of orographic ascent is greater for teesta river s western tributary lachen chu above chungthang than the eastern tributary lachung chu in the case of the rathong river similar observations have been made during winter april 2022 with a greater δ18o value 9 62 at 1286 m a s l that reduces to 14 1 at 4069 m a s l a glacial lake situated at the rathong glacial snout at an elevation of 4620 m a s l shows δ18o value of 15 85 the d excess values are widely used to study the deviation of the regional scale isotopic composition of water from the gmwl as well as infer the moisture sources craig 1961 lai and ehleringer 2011 tian et al 2018 within the water samples d excess values are primarily governed by humidity and air temperature greater d excess values indicate lower relative humidity and vice versa dansgaard 1964 low latitude ocean surface evaporation infers high relative humidity and low d excess sub cloud evaporation or local evapotranspiration leads to decreased d excess values dansgaard 1964 the d excess values also help understand the atmospheric conditions and processes governing the spatio temporal transformation of water composition dalai et al 2002 researchers have found that d excess can be used independently to calibrate atmospheric general circulation models gcms joussaume et al 1984 jouzel et al 1987 hoffmann et al 1998 they can also be used to investigate the present as well as previous precipitation processes the d excess of water samples in the teesta watershed varies between 10 58 and 23 70 with an average d excess of 16 29 the d excess of teesta river tributaries ranges from 10 58 to 18 90 with a mean of 15 51 in the case of the rathong river d excess fluctuates between 14 69 and 17 03 with an average of 16 04 the difference between the overall mean of water samples and the mean of river samples indicates the mixing of water from rain snow and glacial melt cooper 1998 the seasonal mean d excess of 16 14 13 99 and 16 53 during winter incessant and end monsoon lie close to the overall mean except for incessant monsoon period the teesta watershed lies in the trajectory of the bob branch of ism due to which the southern part of the watershed experiences heavy precipitation and humid climatic condition with a steady decline of ism the northern region experiences winter precipitation contributed by the mid latitude westerlies yihui and zunya 2008 dubey et al 2018 the long term mean of d excess for the ism and mid latitude westerlies are 8 and 22 6 respectively iaea 1992 the d excess values presented in this study suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies in the northern region of the teesta watershed and tributaries such as lachen chu and lachung chu the progressive decline of 18o as moving toward the glacial source of the river streams agrees with other studies ali et al 2020 boral and sen 2020 that suggest mixing of moisture sources in the trans and higher himalayan catchments 4 4 quantification of source end members to river streams and waterfalls 4 4 1 model inputs and execution the input parameters of the isotope mixing model are the season dependent source endmembers δ18o and d excess of water samples from river streams in order to determine the relationship between δ18o and d excess of the river samples source δ18o and computed d excess are represented on a scatter plot as shown in fig 6 the scatter plot reveals large natural variability attributed to a lower degree of covariance which makes them fit to be used as independent tracers in the mixing model executing the model with the help of mean δ18o and d excess may unnecessarily deliver fractional estimates of endmembers sensitive to the adopted mean value khan et al 2017 therefore the mean μ isotopic composition has been calculated for the source endmembers seasonally and assigned a range from previous researches on himalayan regions kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2016 the range defined for precipitation snow and rain are μ 10 for d excess and μ 2 5 for δ18o whereas the range assigned for glacial ice melt water are μ 5 for d excess and μ 2 5 for δ18o since estimating the isotopic composition of glacial bodies in the sikkim himalayas has not been performed so far the range has been assigned as per research conducted over other himalayan glaciers ali et al 2020 boral and sen 2020 thus the source endmember ranges can be considered as the best possible estimates for seasonal apportionment of river streams in the teesta watershed the fractional composition of snow f snow rain f rain and glacial melt f glacier has been derived using eq 6 in which the obtained δ18o and computed d excess of the source endmembers have been randomly sampled from the defined ranges the d excess and δ18o of the river samples have been acquired from the database shown in table 1 as frequency distribution analyses a random sampling of d excess and δ18o for the endmembers snow rain and glacial melt has been performed this shows that d excess and δ18o of endmembers are evenly distributed within the defined range thus equally probable the season specific isotope mixing model has been deterministically executed through a monte carlo framework the model has been iterated 104 times for every river water sample retaining 104 iterations mean and standard deviation of all the iterations has been considered the best possible result moreover the 25th 75th and 95th percentile have also been calculated 4 4 2 model outputs the results from the deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model show large variability in source endmembers contributions to the river streams and waterfalls above the confluence of lachen chu and lachung chu at chungthang and the rathong river the percentage contribution of snowmelt rain and glacial ice melt water contributions to the headwaters of lachen chu lachung chu and rathong river has been shown in table 5 the average and standard deviation of snow rain and glacial melt contribution to the river streams and waterfalls are shown in table 6 precipitation contribution shows varying proportions for snow and rainfall separately during the incessant monsoon period precipitation accounts for 60 contribution to the river streams and waterfalls in the teesta watershed results show a consistency in the glacial melt contribution between 40 and 47 in all the seasons with some increment in the end monsoon period however with the conventional understanding of glacial melt water contributions to himalayan rivers it is expected to observe the highest glacial melt water contribution during summer or pre monsoon some anomalous observation has been made earlier in case of the indus and the ganges showing peak ice melt contribution during monsoon on the other hand river systems such as the brahmaputra and the yangtze show enhanced ice melt contribution during the pre and peak monsoon period boral and sen 2020 several mechanisms bring an understanding towards such anomaly such as obscuring snow cover over glacial bodies during the pre monsoon period might result in diminished glacial melting other possible reasons being time lag between glacial melt water production and transport process rain induced glacial melting during monsoon and volumetric effect between monsoon and pre monsoon boral and sen 2020 4 5 model limitations the three endmember mixing model used in this study is a basin specific model developed explicitly for the teesta watershed with certain assumptions such as negligible intrusion of underground water and hyporheic zone as well as atmospheric depositions the selection of source endmembers may also introduce some bias in the obtained results since the model is based on δ18o and d excess tracer equations the model is capable of segregating contributions from utmost three source endmembers however intra annual monthly basis study of isotopic composition incorporating new conservative tracers and contemporary datasets might help minimize the model s uncertainty and biases 5 conclusion glaciated himalayan region act as a storehouse of freshwater in its frozen state feeding several river systems of the indian subcontinent this necessitates studying the himalayan catchments and rivers for their moisture sources and the seasonal contribution of glaciers to the perennial streams in this study different water sources within the teesta watershed have been extensively studied for the stable isotopic composition δ18o and δd that helped in the outcomes mentioned below the spatio temporal analysis of stable isotopes on a seasonal basis reveals seasonally varying δ18o values of the river streams rain and snow three glacial bodies in three different locations in the teesta watershed show varying δ18o compositions these glaciers feed three major tributaries of the teesta river system a progressive decline in the δ18o values as moving towards the non renewable glacial source has been observed in the headwaters of two major tributaries lachen chu and lachung chu more significant depletion of δ18o isotope has been observed in the case of the lachen chu river this indicates progressive depletion and distillation of 18o isotope in the clouds orographic ascent attributed to cooling and subsequent rainout this is also observed in the rathong river stream in west sikkim there is a difference between the mean d excess of all the water samples 16 29 and river streams 15 51 indicating water mixing from precipitation and glacial melt for the rathong river the d excess 16 04 is comparatively close to the overall mean the d excess values suggest the dominance of mid latitude westerlies over ism in the high altitude northern region of the teesta watershed the deterministic monte carlo based three endmember δ18o d excess mixing model shows consistent mean glacial melt contribution in the teesta river stream that ranges between 40 and 47 in different seasons with a maximum glacial melt contribution in the end monsoon period such behavior disagrees with the conventional understanding of maximum glacial melt during summer or pre monsoon such anomalous behavior has also been observed

1882,τhe absence of precipitation isotope stations in the wide flatland of the mongolian plateau mp hinders the analysis of precipitation processes for this reason a precipitation isotope station was established in erenhot in 2015 based on precipitation samples collected during all precipitation events between january 2015 and december 2019 we analyzed the temporal variations of stable isotopes δ2h δ18o in precipitation and their influencing factors including meteorological factors sub cloud evaporation and moisture sources oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in erenhot are richer than those in ulaanbaatar which is situated close to the mountains and depleted compared to e g baotou in erenhot oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are controlled by the temperature effect similarly to ulaanbaatar but also by the amount effect in summer the low slope of the local meteoric water line indicates that raindrops have undergone sub cloud evaporation the annual mean sub cloud evaporation fraction was 5 2 from 2015 to 2019 while sub cloud evaporation fraction was highest in summer 7 5 sub cloud evaporation is mainly correlated by relative humidity precipitation amount regional pan evaporation and air temperature relative humidity has the greatest effect and masks the effect of air temperature the study area is mainly controlled by the west wind and winter monsoon which brought 75 6 of the total precipitation with 7 75 δ18o during summer the pacific monsoon resulted in 13 5 precipitation with 10 34 δ18o in the study area while the indian monsoon had negligible impact except for moisture advection the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 11 1 of local precipitation with 10 32 δ18o this study compensates for the lack of global network of isotopes in

pacific monsoon in summer wang et al 2016c unfortunately there is only one gnip station in the entire mp located in ulaanbaatar and it involves a substantial amount of missing data data series from 1990 to 2001 half of the data in 1990 1999 are missing for this reason scholars have omitted data from this station when researching the distribution of precipitation isotope signatures in asia while the data from this station are not sufficiently representative of the precipitation isotope characteristics in the mp aragufis aragufis froehlich 1998 due to the lack of precipitation isotope stations there are few studies on the precipitation isotope characteristics in the mp many scholars have conducted studies on the precipitation isotope characteristics in northern china in which part of the mp belongs in northern china where precipitation is low and air temperature varies greatly oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly controlled by the temperature effect while the amount effect is not obvious zhang wang 2016 in addition due to the low relative humidity and precipitation amount the effect of sub cloud evaporation is relatively important and it results in δδ18o surface precipitation δ18o minus sub cloud precipitation δ18o ranging between 2 and 16 while it increases from east to west wang et al 2021a the sub cloud evaporation fraction accounted for 5 30 of local

winter with the corresponding moisture sources being the pacific and indian oceans and the inland wang et al 2016c northern china is located far from the ocean in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and is less affected by the summer monsoon compared to eastern china and the winter monsoon brings water vapor from eurasia which forms precipitation sun wang 2014 in this study a precipitation isotope station was established in erenhot which is located on the plain of the mp near the border between china and mongolia compared with stations in mountains the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in erenhot are more representative of the that in the mp as there are no high mountains blocking the interior of the plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze

hydrological station at 960 m above sea level a s l this station is situated on the flatlands of the southern mongolian plateau and is separated from the nearby gnip and chnip stations such as qiqihar

situated 1000 1000 and 300 km away respectively by the yin mountains elevation 1500 2300 m a s l in the south fig 1 erenhot is located in the arid semi arid area and is characterized by drought low precipitation and strong evaporation so that the relative humidity is low which ranged from 10 to 92 with mean values of 44 4 during 2015 2019 besides mean precipitation air temperature relative humidity and pan evaporation 20 cm caliber during the normal 1981 2010 period are shown in table 1 erenhot is characterized by a typical continental monsoon climate precipitation amount is high 66 of the total precipitation as are air temperature and evaporation in summer with low relative humidity in contrast precipitation amount temperature and pan evaporation are extremely low in winter erenhot is located in the westerly wind belt thereby experiencing the year round prevailing westerlies and is one of the windiest areas in china with 4 m s annual mean wind speed liu 2011 2 2 precipitation sampling and isotopic analysis a total of 125 precipitation samples 92 rain and 33 snow samples were collected at the erenhot hydrological station from january 2015 to december 2019 and the relevant meteorological data precipitation amount air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were measured according to specifications all samples were collected by fulltime meteorological observers using standard chinese precipitation gauges of which the rainfall gauge is a water storage bottle and a funnel with diameter of 20 cm and the snow gauge is a bottle 20 cm in diameter clean bottles with added mineral oil approximately 2 mm and funnels were installed in the gauges at the onset of precipitation and retrieved immediately afterward the rain samples were immediately sealed in 60 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles the bottles were tightly capped and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent evaporation after collection all snow samples were sealed in 1 l bottles and melted at room temperature before being placed in sealed sample bottles stable isotopes are expressed in delta notation δ value and normalized against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow value δ2h and δ18o analyses were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university all samples were filtered using cellulose filters 0 45 μm and subsequently pipetted into a septum capped vial 2 ml volume prior to testing stable isotopes were measured by a mat253 mass spectrometer with 1 2 and 0 20 0 30 standard deviations for δ2h and δ18o respectively during each set of sample measurements a suite of water standards three reference water samples was analyzed with the process being and repeated every 15 measured samples δ2h was tested through pyrolysis method each sample was reacted with carbon to form h2 and co at 1450 c before the two gases were separated and analyzed in terms of δ2h with a mass spectrometer to ensure the quality of data five injections were introduced into the analyzer cavity for direct measurement among them the first two injections were ignored to remove organic carbon contamination after pyrolysis while the last three injections were averaged to produce a raw isotope value δ18o was evaluated using the water balance method as this methodology is known for its high degree of precision we conducted these evaluations by first filling the sample bottle with 0 3 co2 gas for 10 min and then bringing the sample to equilibrium therewith 20 h at an ambient temperature of 25 c following this the samples were placed in a gasbench system and connected to a mass spectrometer for δ18o evaluation for the measurement of δ18o 10 injections were introduced into the analyzer cavity among them the first five injections were ignored to avoid potential memory effects while the last five injections were averaged to produce a raw isotope value 3 calculation 3 1 calculation of the effect of sub cloud

trajectory hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory arl draxler and hess 1998 tang et al 2017 the meteorological input for hysplit was the global reanalysis dataset gdas1 with 1 1 latitude longitude global grid the 240 h back trajectories are computed for every precipitation event at the erenhot station in 2015 2019 because the residence time of atmospheric water vapor is approximately 10 days over most parts of asia and europe gimeno et al 2021 trenberth 1998 4 results 4 1 seasonal precipitation isotope variability total precipitation in erenhot in 2015 2019 was 683 8 mm caused by 126 precipitation events precipitation is heavy in summer and low in winter 65 0 of the total precipitation and 46 8 of all precipitation events occurred in summer while spring and autumn accounted for 17 4 and 15 8 of the total precipitation respectively the least amount of precipitation occurred in winter 2 7 of the total precipitation δ2h and δ18o ranged from 243 13 to 3 54 and from 30 74 to 0 24 with weighted mean precipitation isotope values of 63 35 and 8 67 these values are enriched compared to those from qiqihar in the east 10 61 δ2h 79 5 δ18o and ulaanbaatar in the north 9 61 δ2h 72 5 δ18o but depleted compared to baotou in the south 7 78 δ2h 55 30 δ18o fig 2 δ2h and δ18o trends were well synchronized exhibiting a cyclic variation of isotope enrichment in summer and depletion in winter which is similar to the cyclic variation of air temperature the monthly stable isotopes of precipitation in erenhot were calculated using the weighted mean precipitation of all precipitation events in 2015 2019 fig 3 the stable isotopes were most enriched in may with 30 50 δ2h and 4 61 δ18o and were most depleted in december with 197 10 δ2h and 25 07 δ18o a bimodal pattern was evident throughout the year with rain in june and july appearing isotopically depleted compared to that in the adjacent months due to the amount effect since 44 of the annual total precipitation would fall in these months erenhot has approximately 137 mm year annual precipitation i e the least precipitation amount compared with the three nearest gnip stations qiqihar 581 mm year baotou 284 mm year ulaanbaatar 240 mm year fig 4 qiqihar is closer to the ocean than the other three stations with no high mountains blocking it and it is within the influence of the pacific monsoon thereby receiving higher precipitation amounts compared to the other three stations baotou is surrounded by the yin mountains and ulaanbaatar is close to the yablonov mountains these stations report higher precipitation than erenhot in the plain because the moisture is blocked by the mountains thereby producing precipitation all four stations reported heavy precipitation in summer and low in winter temperature variations were consistent among the four stations with high air temperatures in summer and low in winter the precipitation isotope variations were different at the four stations nevertheless all stations reported enrichment and depletion in the warm and cold seasons respectively while isotopes were depleted in summer compared to the adjacent months the isotope variation in erenhot was more consistent with that in baotou albeit with larger variation 4 2 local meteoric water line the local meteoric water line lmwl varies slightly among different places due to the influence of moisture sources and meteorological conditions such as air temperature and relative humidity during precipitation and topographic features such as elevation wang et al 2021a these evaluations revealed a good linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o r 0 97 p 0 0001 while δ18o was positively correlated with precipitation amount table 3 thus the lmwls obtained using different regression methods revealed little differences in output and the lmwls were defined by ordinary least squares regression fig 1 crawford et al 2014 the lmwl obtained based on monthly isotopes is different from that obtained based on isotopes of specific precipitation events and its slope ranges between 7 5 and 7 9 which is lower than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl proposed by craig fig 5 craig 1961 the lmwl slope reveals the contrasting relationship between h and o fractionation rates and is a function of the fractionation coefficient which is inversely proportional to air temperature when not considering sub cloud evaporation clark and fritz 1997 in addition as erenhot belongs to the arid semi arid area with low precipitation and relative humidity sub cloud evaporation was probably responsible for the lower slopes of the lmwl rather than those of the gmwl the lmwl obtained from monthly precipitation isotope data was δ2h 7 9δ18o 1 47 with the standard errors of its slope and intercept being 0 28 and 3 983 the lmwl at the sub cloud was δ2h 8 2 δ18o 10 99 r 0 98 p 0 0001 with its slope and intercept being increased after excluding the effect of sub cloud evaporation the slope of 8 2 was slightly higher than that of the gmwl fig 6 and related to the air temperature at the time of precipitation condensation majoube 1971 obtained the slope of the meteoric water line at different temperatures using a theoretical calculation 8 77 10 c 8 53 15 c 8 45 20 c 8 17 25 c 7 98 30 c 7 56 40 c and 7 33 50 c the above values show that as the air temperature increases the slope of the lmwl decreases the temperature in erenhot varies greatly from season to season ranging from 21 7 to 28 6 c hence the slope of the lmwl at the sub cloud should be higher than 7 98 sixty five percent of precipitation occurs in summer with a mean temperature of 21 4 c the slope of the lmwl at the sub cloud may be between 8 17 and 8 45 which is consistent with the actual slope 8 2 4 3 characteristics of sub cloud evaporation raindrops are affected by evaporation during falling which results in depleted isotopes of sub cloud precipitation compared to oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the surface wang et al 2021a in erenhot air temperature on a few days in autumn and especially in winter can be subfreezing below 0 c and precipitation occurs in the form of snowfall during snowfall sub cloud evaporation could be negligible thus oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the cloud base can be represented by those at the surface when air temperature is below 0 c while they are calculated for precipitation events with air temperature above 0 c sun et al 2020 δ2h and δ18o at the cloud base range from 243 13 to 15 57 and from 29 69 to 2 27 respectively the isotopes at the cloud base were slightly depleted compared to those at the surface and their trends were consistent with enrichment in summer and depletion in winter fig 3 the difference between oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the surface and at the cloud base δδ2h δδ18o indicates the evaporation of raindrops and stronger evaporation results in higher sub cloud evaporation fraction fevap fevap δδ2h and δδ18o of all precipitation events varied over a wide range from 0 1 to 68 6 0 11 to 113 73 and 0 03 to 31 19 respectively fig 7 among them the sub cloud evaporating fraction for 76 of all precipitation events was 20 and it was higher than 50 for only four precipitation events with low precipitation amounts 0 1 0 6 mm low relative humidity 28 58 and high evaporation 5 8 11 9 mm in 2015 2019 the trend of monthly mean isotopes at the cloud base was consistent with that at the surface which were enriched in spring and autumn and depleted in summer fig 3 the lowest raindrop evaporation occurred in october with 0 56 fevap 0 15 δδ2h and 0 6 δδ18o accordingly relative humidity was 83 the highest in all years the precipitation amount was 22 2 mm second only to july and the air temperature was 3 8 c hence this low raindrop evaporation was probably due to the combined effects of high relative humidity increased precipitation and low temperature sub cloud evaporation was higher in june and august with 9 96 and 8 83 fevap 8 89 and 8 01 δδ2h and 2 29 and 2 51 δδ18o respectively in general sub cloud evaporation was the highest in summer and the average δδ2h δδ18o and fevap values were 1 94 6 81 and 7 46 respectively which may be related to the high temperature 21 2 c increased evaporation 5 6 mm d and low relative humidity 60 5 in summer the low sub cloud evaporation in july may be related to the relatively heavier precipitation 48 2 mm the 2015 2019 average sub cloud evaporating fraction was 5 2 the weighted mean precipitation isotope values at the sub cloud were 9 66 for δ18o and 65 6 for δ2h indicating depletion compared to the values at the surface 8 67 for δ18o and 63 4 for δ2h given that the slope of the lmwl for the precipitation at the sub cloud was higher than that at the surface we inferred that the influence of sub cloud evaporation on local precipitation needed to be considered 5 discussion 5 1 effects of environmental parameters on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation pearson s correlation and significance tests were used to confirm the correlation between stable isotopes and precipitation amount or temperature in near the mp erenhot baotou qiqihar ulaanbaatar the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation were significantly positively correlated with temperature in erenhot r 0 78 p 0 001 the precipitation isotope trends from october to february the following year were consistent with those of the air temperature suggesting that the variations of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation were influenced by temperature hydrogen and oxygen isotopes fractionate during the condensation of water vapor into precipitation resulting in differences in the isotopic values of water vapor and precipitation mook 2000 the isotopic fractionation during the actual precipitation is close to the equilibrium fractionation thus it can be simulated by the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation mode during most precipitation hou et al 2003 using the vienna standard mean ocean water as standard based on the definition of isotopic composition δ 19 δ l r l r vsmow 1 where δ l refers to hydrogen oxygen isotope value r l and r v s m o w refer to the abundance ratio of the isotopic species i e 2h 1h or 18o 16o of precipitation and the vienna standard mean ocean water respectively because of isotopic fractionation 20 r l α l v r v where α l v refers to fractionation factor so that 21 δ l α l v r v r vsmow 1 22 δ l α l v δ v 1 1 during the condensation of water vapor and formation of precipitation temperature is the only factor affecting isotopic fractionation with the isotopic fractionation being inversely proportional to temperature i e the higher of the temperature the lower of isotopic fractionation therefore hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values are richer with temperature decrease temperature variations in the middle and high latitudes are large meanwhile the precipitation amount is low and the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly influenced by the temperature effect exhibiting the signature of enrichment in summer and depletion in winter gat et al 2001 the stable isotopic values of precipitation have good linear relationship with temperature in the north atlantic and european δ18o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 yurtsever 1975 the similar relationship between them was found in china which the temperature coefficients are 3 1 c r 0 81 p 0 01 for δ2h and 0 36 c r 0 80 p 0 01 for δ18o wang et al 1999 2000 erenhot is located in the semi arid mid latitude area where the precipitation amount is low therefore the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly dominated by the temperature effect rather than the precipitation amount effect the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation for the stations in near the mp were shown to be influenced primarily by air temperature they were enriched as temperatures increased table 3 qiqihar erenhot and ulaanbaatar which are located at higher latitudes were more affected by air temperature than baotou which is consistent with an earlier study showing that the effect of air temperature on isotope is more obvious at higher latitudes guo et al 2019 the effect of precipitation amount on the isotopes is lower relative to temperature but it varies widely for different stations in near the mp for example this effect is obvious in qiqihar and ulaanbaatar where enriched isotopes were correlated with increased precipitation amount this effect is typically reversed in both the tropics and coastal areas dansgaard 1964 thus precipitation amount may not affect oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation directly as a result of the seasonality of the precipitation and the significant positive correlation between air temperature and precipitation amount qiqihar r 0 65 p 0 01 ulaanbataar r 0 65 p 0 01 crawford et al 2014 temporal variations of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation also showed that the latter were influenced differently based on seasonal air temperatures and precipitation amount correlation between air temperature and stable isotopes in precipitation was strong in spring and autumn but weak in summer and winter indicating that air temperature has a strong weak influence on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in autumn and spring summer and winter for most stations in near mp for example air temperature varied considerably in spring rising by 9 1 c and autumn falling by 24 3 c relative to summer 1 6 c and winter 2 8 c in erenhot this was correlated with a more significant temperature effect in these areas there was some precipitation amount effect from erenhot and baotou in summer but the stable isotopes in precipitation from baotou were more strongly influenced by precipitation amount than those from erenhot the former was likely due to differences in sub cloud evaporation and moisture sources following different precipitation amount eastoe dettman 2016 cruz et al 2005 the monthly average δ18o and δ2h in erenhot were different from those of the surrounding stations the isotopic signatures in ulaanbaatar which is near the mountains were different from those in erenhot the mp consists primarily of wide flatlands and only few mountains thus erenhot representing the isotopic signatures of the mp is more reasonable overall the mp was mainly controlled by the temperature effect while the amount effect was evident only in summer 5 2 effects of sub cloud evaporation the effect of sub cloud evaporation on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation is not negligible when combined with low precipitation amount shi et al 2021 in addition sub cloud evaporation is the interactions of various factors and is often also controlled by other meteorological factors such as relative humidity and air temperature graf et al 2019 in erenhot the intensity of sub cloud evaporation increased with decreasing relative humidity and precipitation amount and increasing regional evaporation and temperature fig 3 table 4 these outcomes were consistent with the results of other studies in northern china chen et al 2020 crawford et al 2017 of these factors relative humidity was shown to have the greatest influence on sub cloud evaporation r 0 7 p 0 01 although the precipitation amount also had a significant influence r 0 4 p 0 01 besides regional evaporation had also a certain influence on sub cloud evaporation albeit smaller compared to those of relative humidity and precipitation amount r 0 2 0 3 p 0 01 finally the correlation between air temperature and sub cloud evaporation was low r 0 2 p 0 1 overall sub cloud evaporation was most influenced by relative humidity and least influenced by temperature in general for given relative humidity the sub cloud evaporation fraction is proportional to the air temperature salamalikis et al 2016 in erenhot 9 6 of the total precipitation events 13 precipitation events occurred at air temperatures between 0 and 10 c and fevap ranged between 0 1 and 33 5 with 2 6 mean value 35 of the total precipitation events occurred at air temperatures between 10 and 20 c and fevap ranged between 0 5 and 68 6 with 5 5 mean value and 28 of the total precipitation events occurred at air temperatures from 20 to 30 c and fevap ranged between 1 8 and 43 4 with 7 3 mean value in terms of temperature interval higher air temperature resulted in enhanced sub cloud evaporation but there was no consistent pattern among the precipitation events fig 8 the precipitation events were divided into different groups according to the relative humidity 60 60 70 70 80 80 in the groups with relative humidity 80 the correlation coefficients between air temperature and the degree of sub cloud evaporation were weak and did not pass the 90 significance test indicating that the effect of air temperature on sub cloud evaporation was not obvious at low relative humidity in the group with relative humidity 80 the correlation coefficient between air temperature and sub cloud evaporation was 0 7 and passed the 95 significance test indicating that the air temperature had a strong influence on the sub cloud evaporation at high relative humidity therefore when the relative humidity was 80 it was the main factor affecting sub cloud evaporation when the relative humidity was 80 its influence on the sub cloud evaporation was weak with the latter being mainly affected by air temperature since erenhot is situated in a semi arid area relative humidity is low with 90 of precipitation events occurring with relative humidity 80 hence overall the effect of air temperature on sub cloud evaporation is not obvious the same phenomenon is evident throughout china wang et al 2021a the sub cloud evaporating fraction varied greatly during all precipitation events the greatest variation occurred in spring when the precipitation amount was the lowest fig 8 the sub cloud evaporating fraction was highest in summer 7 5 with the lowest sub cloud evaporating fraction over the entire summer being recorded in july sub cloud evaporation is strongest in dry conditions and weakest in wet conditions wang et al 2021a in addition the differences in regional evaporation and relative humidity in july june and august were significantly smaller than other months meanwhile there was nearly twice as much precipitation amount in july as in june and august fig 3 fig 8 given this we suggest that changes in sub cloud evaporation during summer in erenhot is controlled primarily by the precipitation amount 5 3 quantitative assessment of moisture sources the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit was used for tracking the direction of air mass movements and determine the source and path of moisture in erenhot draxler and hess 1998 fig 9 shows the paths and sources of air masses for the 10 days preceding each precipitation event in erenhot from 2015 to 2019 moisture mainly originates from the western and northwestern parts of the study area with fewer moisture sources from the east compared with the entire semi arid steppe of northern china moisture in erenhot originates from the southern and eastern adjacent land areas local grasslands northwestern china central asia adjacent seas of china the mediterranean sea water areas surrounding the arabian peninsula red sea aden gulf western arabian sea and persian gulf and the north atlantic moisture from the western bay of bengal was not identified while india and the arctic ocean were identified as moisture sources sun wang 2014 the moisture paths are predominantly from west to east w e and northwest to southeast nw se moisture from north asia and the northern atlantic ocean was transported from the northwest supplying 49 0 of the total precipitation while moisture from northwest china central asia europe the mediterranean sea and the arabian peninsula followed w e paths supplying 28 4 of the total precipitation in addition the study area was under the combined control of westerlies and winter monsoons bringing 75 6 of total precipitation with δ18o values of precipitation at the cloud base and surface being 9 13 and 7 75 respectively table 5 a small amount of precipitation in summer and autumn was caused by moisture originating from southeastern china summer 6 7 autumn 4 3 and the seas adjacent to china summer 6 8 autumn 4 3 following e w and se nw paths this is consistent with the pacific monsoon season in china wang et al 2016b and suggests that 75 8 mm of precipitation was produced via the pacific summer monsoon and in autumn only one precipitation event was associated with the indian monsoon over this five year period and it deposited only 2 3 mm of precipitation and 0 24 δ18o of the total precipitation 11 1 was from recycled moisture from the local grassland producing 10 32 of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation on the surface of the land this is significantly depleted compared to the weighted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in precipitation 63 35 δ2h and 8 67 δ18o this suggests that the contribution of recycled moisture to isotopes in erenhot is lower than contributions from the loess plateau to the southwest of the study area 28 higher than that from southeastern china 1 4 and similar to that from the tianshan mountains 4 16 ma et al 2013 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2016a this is influenced by a variety of factors with large differences associated with regional meteorological factors such as subsurface conditions zhang and wang 2016 briefly the winter monsoon from north asia and the north atlantic ocean had the greatest influence on precipitation in the study area and supplied the highest precipitation amount 49 0 followed by the westerlies which was the main prevailing wind direction in the study area accounting for 28 4 of total precipitation and the pacific monsoon which affected precipitation only in summer and autumn also supplied relatively little precipitation 11 9 the indian monsoon had very little influence on precipitation in the study area causing only one precipitation event in 2015 2019 and supplying 1 of total precipitation overall approximately 76 5 of total precipitation originated from the evaporation terrestrial water and plant evapotranspiration while a small amount came directly from the ocean 24 5 mainly from the north atlantic 13 2 and the seas adjacent to china 9 1 this result differs from that in northern china where the moisture originates primarily from the ocean 75 4 with the pacific 30 9 and bay of bengal south china sea 33 8 jiang et al 2017 being the major contributors erenhot is located in the northern parts of north china where moisture is derived from the western part of the continent and precipitation is formed via the effects of westerlies and winter monsoons while most of north china is influenced by the pacific monsoon wang et al 2017 wang ho 2002 this means that the sources of moisture in erenhot is different from that of the rest of north china and thus cannot be generalized in addition the main moisture source for north asia is the north atlantic ocean for central asia eurasia is the dominant moisture source and moisture originating from the north atlantic ocean increases from south to north aragufis aragufis froehlich 1998 jiang et al 2020 thus the unique geographical location of erenhot means its primary moisture source is the eurasian continent and the moisture from ocean is mainly from the north atlantic ocean and affected by the adjacent seas of china 6 conclusions we analyzed the stable isotope variations and their main environmental drivers based on precipitation data collected in erenhot over five years from 2015 to 2019 our study improves the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation records and provides precipitation information for further research on water cycle processes in the mp stable isotopes of precipitation in erenhot were enriched in summer and depleted in winter the temperature effect on isotopes was most pronounced in spring and autumn when sharp temperature changes occurred the amount effect on isotopes was most pronounced in summer especially in june and july when heavy precipitation occurred the weighted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in precipitation were 63 35 and 8 67 for δ2h and δ18o respectively in 2015 2019 the local meteoric water line was calculated as δ2h 7 90δ18o 1 47 with the slope and intercept being lower than that of the global meteoric water line which was mainly due to sub cloud evaporation in arid semi arid areas the δ2h and δ18o isotope values increased by approximately 5 4 and 1 5 respectively from march to november because of sub cloud evaporation the annual mean of the sub cloud evaporation fraction was 5 2 in summer sub cloud evaporation fraction was 7 5 sub cloud evaporation was mainly influenced by the relative humidity precipitation amount and regional evaporation the low relative humidity decreased precipitation and high regional evaporation leading to heavy sub cloud evaporation and the effect of temperature on sub cloud evaporation were masked by other factors continental moisture sources accounted for 76 5 of total precipitation in contrast to north china due to the control of different monsoons these were mainly europe north and central asia while other sources included the arctic and north atlantic oceans about three quarters of total precipitation were due to moisture supplied by the winter monsoon and westerlies with 7 75 δ18osurface the pacific monsoon accounted for 13 5 of total precipitation with moisture originating from southeastern china and adjacent seas of china in summer with 10 34 δ18osurface in addition 11 1 of total precipitation was formed by recycled moisture from the local grassland with 10 32 δ18osurface while the indian monsoon had a negligible effect on precipitation in the study area causing only

1882,τhe absence of precipitation isotope stations in the wide flatland of the mongolian plateau mp hinders the analysis of precipitation processes for this reason a precipitation isotope station was established in erenhot in 2015 based on precipitation samples collected during all precipitation events between january 2015 and december 2019 we analyzed the temporal variations of stable isotopes δ2h δ18o in precipitation and their influencing factors including meteorological factors sub cloud evaporation and moisture sources oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in erenhot are richer than those in ulaanbaatar which is situated close to the mountains and depleted compared to e g baotou in erenhot oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are controlled by the temperature effect similarly to ulaanbaatar but also by the amount effect in summer the low slope of the local meteoric water line indicates that raindrops have undergone sub cloud evaporation the annual mean sub cloud evaporation fraction was 5 2 from 2015 to 2019 while sub cloud evaporation fraction was highest in summer 7 5 sub cloud evaporation is mainly correlated by relative humidity precipitation amount regional pan evaporation and air temperature relative humidity has the greatest effect and masks the effect of air temperature the study area is mainly controlled by the west wind and winter monsoon which brought 75 6 of the total precipitation with 7 75 δ18o during summer the pacific monsoon resulted in 13 5 precipitation with 10 34 δ18o in the study area while the indian monsoon had negligible impact except for moisture advection the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 11 1 of local precipitation with 10 32 δ18o this study compensates for the lack of global network of isotopes in

precipitation isotope monitoring has been performed ever since there are currently 1380 observation stations in 136 countries iaea 2013 on a global scale these stations are not evenly distributed they are mainly concentrated in developed countries and densely populated areas while they are rare in the vast plateaus gobi desert and polar areas because of constraints due to economic development war

established in china since 1983 precipitation has been sampled also at 29 chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip stations because of objective constraints the distribution of stations in china is mainly concentrated in the southeast and some densely populated areas in the north while there are fewer stations in areas with sparse populations such as deserts high mountains and grasslands liu et al 2014 in areas lacking gnip and chnip stations δ2h and δ18o in precipitation are represented by isotopes from neighboring gnip stations or the short term 1 2 year collection by authors guan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 yang et al 2011 however it is difficult to quantitatively calculate the relationship between different waters with these methods which may even misrepresent the local water cycle characteristics because of the large spatiotemporal variations of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation under the combined impacts of climate topography and monsoon regime jiao et al 2020 the mongolian plateau mp is surrounded by the greater khingan mountains in the east yin mountains in the south altai mountains in the west and siberia in the north it is a unique and highly significant plateau regarding moisture circulation and the southward flow of the siberian cold air masses weingartner et al 1999 precipitation in the mp is influenced to some extent by the pacific monsoon in summer wang et al 2016c unfortunately there is only one gnip station in the entire mp located in ulaanbaatar and it involves a substantial amount of missing data data series from 1990 to 2001 half of the data in 1990 1999 are missing for this reason scholars have omitted data from this station when researching the distribution of precipitation isotope signatures in asia while the data from this station are not sufficiently representative of the precipitation isotope characteristics in the mp aragufis aragufis froehlich 1998 due to the lack of precipitation isotope stations there are few studies on the precipitation isotope characteristics in the mp many scholars have conducted studies on the precipitation isotope characteristics in northern china in which part of the mp belongs in northern china where precipitation is low and air temperature varies greatly oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly controlled by the temperature effect while the amount effect is not obvious zhang wang 2016 in addition due to the low relative humidity and precipitation amount the effect of sub cloud evaporation is relatively important and it results in δδ18o surface precipitation δ18o minus sub cloud precipitation δ18o ranging between 2 and 16 while it increases from east to west wang et al 2021a the sub cloud evaporation fraction accounted for 5 30 of local precipitation in the tian shan region in the western part of northern china from august 2012 to september 2013 and 12 1 of local precipitation in the loess plateau in the middle of northern china in 2016 2017 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2016b northern china is mainly influenced by three monsoons namely the south asian and indian monsoons prevailing in summer and the winter monsoon prevailing in winter with the corresponding moisture sources being the pacific and indian oceans and the inland wang et al 2016c northern china is located far from the ocean in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and is less affected by the summer monsoon compared to eastern china and the winter monsoon brings water vapor from eurasia which forms precipitation sun wang 2014 in this study a precipitation isotope station was established in erenhot which is located on the plain of the mp near the border between china and mongolia compared with stations in mountains the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in erenhot are more representative of the that in the mp as there are no high mountains blocking the interior of the plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the regional climate control factors on the precipitation isotope signatures 2 reveal the influence of winter and summer monsoons and recycle moisture on precipitation as well as the characteristics of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation brought by different monsoons in the southern mp we provide precipitation isotope information for research regarding the origins of water bodies and geochemical processes therein as well as the relationships between different water bodies and the recharge flow patterns and discharge of groundwater in the southern mp overall our study supplements the available isotope information and facilitates research on the asian monsoon characteristics atmospheric circulation etc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area all samples were collected at erenhot hydrological station at 960 m above sea level a s l this station is situated on the flatlands of the southern mongolian plateau and is separated from the nearby gnip and chnip stations such as qiqihar and naiman stations situated 1000 and 700 km away respectively by the greater khingan mountains elevation 1100 1700 m a s l in the east it is also separated from the zhangye linze and baotou stations situated 1000 1000 and 300 km away respectively by the yin mountains elevation 1500 2300 m a s l in the south fig 1 erenhot is located in the arid semi arid area and is characterized by drought low precipitation and strong evaporation so that the relative humidity is low which ranged from 10 to 92 with mean values of 44 4 during 2015 2019 besides mean precipitation air temperature relative humidity and pan evaporation 20 cm caliber during the normal 1981 2010 period are shown in table 1 erenhot is characterized by a typical continental monsoon climate precipitation amount is high 66 of the total precipitation as are air temperature and evaporation in summer with low relative humidity in contrast precipitation amount temperature and pan evaporation are extremely low in winter erenhot is located in the westerly wind belt thereby experiencing the year round prevailing westerlies and is one of the windiest areas in china with 4 m s annual mean wind speed liu 2011 2 2 precipitation sampling and isotopic analysis a total of 125 precipitation samples 92 rain and 33 snow samples were collected at the erenhot hydrological station from january 2015 to december 2019 and the relevant meteorological data precipitation amount air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were measured according to specifications all samples were collected by fulltime meteorological observers using standard chinese precipitation gauges of which the rainfall gauge is a water storage bottle and a funnel with diameter of 20 cm and the snow gauge is a bottle 20 cm in diameter clean bottles with added mineral oil approximately 2 mm and funnels were installed in the gauges at the onset of precipitation and retrieved immediately afterward the rain samples were immediately sealed in 60 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles the bottles were tightly capped and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent evaporation after collection all snow samples were sealed in 1 l bottles and melted at room temperature before being placed in sealed sample bottles stable isotopes are expressed in delta notation δ value and normalized against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow value δ2h and δ18o analyses were performed at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university all samples were filtered using cellulose filters 0 45 μm and subsequently pipetted into a septum capped vial 2 ml volume prior to testing stable isotopes were measured by a mat253 mass spectrometer with 1 2 and 0 20 0 30 standard deviations for δ2h and δ18o respectively during each set of sample measurements a suite of water standards three reference water samples was analyzed with the process being and repeated every 15 measured samples δ2h was tested through pyrolysis method each sample was reacted with carbon to form h2 and co at 1450 c before the two gases were separated and analyzed in terms of δ2h with a mass spectrometer to ensure the quality of data five injections were introduced into the analyzer cavity for direct measurement among them the first two injections were ignored to remove organic carbon contamination after pyrolysis while the last three injections were averaged to produce a raw isotope value δ18o was evaluated using the water balance method as this methodology is known for its high degree of precision we conducted these evaluations by first filling the sample bottle with 0 3 co2 gas for 10 min and then bringing the sample to equilibrium therewith 20 h at an ambient temperature of 25 c following this the samples were placed in a gasbench system and connected to a mass spectrometer for δ18o evaluation for the measurement of δ18o 10 injections were introduced into the analyzer cavity among them the first five injections were ignored to avoid potential memory effects while the last five injections were averaged to produce a raw isotope value 3 calculation 3 1 calculation of the effect of sub cloud

trajectory hysplit model developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa air resources laboratory arl draxler and hess 1998 tang et al 2017 the meteorological input for hysplit was the global reanalysis dataset gdas1 with 1 1 latitude longitude global grid the 240 h back trajectories are computed for every precipitation event at the erenhot station in 2015 2019 because the residence time of atmospheric water vapor is approximately 10 days over most parts of asia and europe gimeno et al 2021 trenberth 1998 4 results 4 1 seasonal precipitation isotope variability total precipitation in erenhot in 2015 2019 was 683 8 mm caused by 126 precipitation events precipitation is heavy in summer and low in winter 65 0 of the total precipitation and 46 8 of all precipitation events occurred in summer while spring and autumn accounted for 17 4 and 15 8 of the total precipitation respectively the least amount of precipitation occurred in winter 2 7 of the total precipitation δ2h and δ18o ranged from 243 13 to 3 54 and from 30 74 to 0 24 with weighted mean precipitation isotope values of 63 35 and 8 67 these values are enriched compared to those from qiqihar in the east 10 61 δ2h 79 5 δ18o and ulaanbaatar in the north 9 61 δ2h 72 5 δ18o but depleted compared to baotou in the south 7 78 δ2h 55 30 δ18o fig 2 δ2h and δ18o trends were well synchronized exhibiting a cyclic variation of isotope enrichment in summer and depletion in winter which is similar to the cyclic variation of air temperature the monthly stable isotopes of precipitation in erenhot were calculated using the weighted mean precipitation of all precipitation events in 2015 2019 fig 3 the stable isotopes were most enriched in may with 30 50 δ2h and 4 61 δ18o and were most depleted in december with 197 10 δ2h and 25 07 δ18o a bimodal pattern was evident throughout the year with rain in june and july appearing isotopically depleted compared to that in the adjacent months due to the amount effect since 44 of the annual total precipitation would fall in these months erenhot has approximately 137 mm year annual precipitation i e the least precipitation amount compared with the three nearest gnip stations qiqihar 581 mm year baotou 284 mm year ulaanbaatar 240 mm year fig 4 qiqihar is closer to the ocean than the other three stations with no high mountains blocking it and it is within the influence of the pacific monsoon thereby receiving higher precipitation amounts compared to the other three stations baotou is surrounded by the yin mountains and ulaanbaatar is close to the yablonov mountains these stations report higher precipitation than erenhot in the plain because the moisture is blocked by the mountains thereby producing precipitation all four stations reported heavy precipitation in summer and low in winter temperature variations were consistent among the four stations with high air temperatures in summer and low in winter the precipitation isotope variations were different at the four stations nevertheless all stations reported enrichment and depletion in the warm and cold seasons respectively while isotopes were depleted in summer compared to the adjacent months the isotope variation in erenhot was more consistent with that in baotou albeit with larger variation 4 2 local meteoric water line the local meteoric water line lmwl varies slightly among different places due to the influence of moisture sources and meteorological conditions such as air temperature and relative humidity during precipitation and topographic features such as elevation wang et al 2021a these evaluations revealed a good linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o r 0 97 p 0 0001 while δ18o was positively correlated with precipitation amount table 3 thus the lmwls obtained using different regression methods revealed little differences in output and the lmwls were defined by ordinary least squares regression fig 1 crawford et al 2014 the lmwl obtained based on monthly isotopes is different from that obtained based on isotopes of specific precipitation events and its slope ranges between 7 5 and 7 9 which is lower than that of the global meteoric water line gmwl proposed by craig fig 5 craig 1961 the lmwl slope reveals the contrasting relationship between h and o fractionation rates and is a function of the fractionation coefficient which is inversely proportional to air temperature when not considering sub cloud evaporation clark and fritz 1997 in addition as erenhot belongs to the arid semi arid area with low precipitation and relative humidity sub cloud evaporation was probably responsible for the lower slopes of the lmwl rather than those of the gmwl the lmwl obtained from monthly precipitation isotope data was δ2h 7 9δ18o 1 47 with the standard errors of its slope and intercept being 0 28 and 3 983 the lmwl at the sub cloud was δ2h 8 2 δ18o 10 99 r 0 98 p 0 0001 with its slope and intercept being increased after excluding the effect of sub cloud evaporation the slope of 8 2 was slightly higher than that of the gmwl fig 6 and related to the air temperature at the time of precipitation condensation majoube 1971 obtained the slope of the meteoric water line at different temperatures using a theoretical calculation 8 77 10 c 8 53 15 c 8 45 20 c 8 17 25 c 7 98 30 c 7 56 40 c and 7 33 50 c the above values show that as the air temperature increases the slope of the lmwl decreases the temperature in erenhot varies greatly from season to season ranging from 21 7 to 28 6 c hence the slope of the lmwl at the sub cloud should be higher than 7 98 sixty five percent of precipitation occurs in summer with a mean temperature of 21 4 c the slope of the lmwl at the sub cloud may be between 8 17 and 8 45 which is consistent with the actual slope 8 2 4 3 characteristics of sub cloud evaporation raindrops are affected by evaporation during falling which results in depleted isotopes of sub cloud precipitation compared to oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the surface wang et al 2021a in erenhot air temperature on a few days in autumn and especially in winter can be subfreezing below 0 c and precipitation occurs in the form of snowfall during snowfall sub cloud evaporation could be negligible thus oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the cloud base can be represented by those at the surface when air temperature is below 0 c while they are calculated for precipitation events with air temperature above 0 c sun et al 2020 δ2h and δ18o at the cloud base range from 243 13 to 15 57 and from 29 69 to 2 27 respectively the isotopes at the cloud base were slightly depleted compared to those at the surface and their trends were consistent with enrichment in summer and depletion in winter fig 3 the difference between oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at the surface and at the cloud base δδ2h δδ18o indicates the evaporation of raindrops and stronger evaporation results in higher sub cloud evaporation fraction fevap fevap δδ2h and δδ18o of all precipitation events varied over a wide range from 0 1 to 68 6 0 11 to 113 73 and 0 03 to 31 19 respectively fig 7 among them the sub cloud evaporating fraction for 76 of all precipitation events was 20 and it was higher than 50 for only four precipitation events with low precipitation amounts 0 1 0 6 mm low relative humidity 28 58 and high evaporation 5 8 11 9 mm in 2015 2019 the trend of monthly mean isotopes at the cloud base was consistent with that at the surface which were enriched in spring and autumn and depleted in summer fig 3 the lowest raindrop evaporation occurred in october with 0 56 fevap 0 15 δδ2h and 0 6 δδ18o accordingly relative humidity was 83 the highest in all years the precipitation amount was 22 2 mm second only to july and the air temperature was 3 8 c hence this low raindrop evaporation was probably due to the combined effects of high relative humidity increased precipitation and low temperature sub cloud evaporation was higher in june and august with 9 96 and 8 83 fevap 8 89 and 8 01 δδ2h and 2 29 and 2 51 δδ18o respectively in general sub cloud evaporation was the highest in summer and the average δδ2h δδ18o and fevap values were 1 94 6 81 and 7 46 respectively which may be related to the high temperature 21 2 c increased evaporation 5 6 mm d and low relative humidity 60 5 in summer the low sub cloud evaporation in july may be related to the relatively heavier precipitation 48 2 mm the 2015 2019 average sub cloud evaporating fraction was 5 2 the weighted mean precipitation isotope values at the sub cloud were 9 66 for δ18o and 65 6 for δ2h indicating depletion compared to the values at the surface 8 67 for δ18o and 63 4 for δ2h given that the slope of the lmwl for the precipitation at the sub cloud was higher than that at the surface we inferred that the influence of sub cloud evaporation on local precipitation needed to be considered 5 discussion 5 1 effects of environmental parameters on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation pearson s correlation and significance tests were used to confirm the correlation between stable isotopes and precipitation amount or temperature in near the mp erenhot baotou qiqihar ulaanbaatar the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation were significantly positively correlated with temperature in erenhot r 0 78 p 0 001 the precipitation isotope trends from october to february the following year were consistent with those of the air temperature suggesting that the variations of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation were influenced by temperature hydrogen and oxygen isotopes fractionate during the condensation of water vapor into precipitation resulting in differences in the isotopic values of water vapor and precipitation mook 2000 the isotopic fractionation during the actual precipitation is close to the equilibrium fractionation thus it can be simulated by the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation mode during most precipitation hou et al 2003 using the vienna standard mean ocean water as standard based on the definition of isotopic composition δ 19 δ l r l r vsmow 1 where δ l refers to hydrogen oxygen isotope value r l and r v s m o w refer to the abundance ratio of the isotopic species i e 2h 1h or 18o 16o of precipitation and the vienna standard mean ocean water respectively because of isotopic fractionation 20 r l α l v r v where α l v refers to fractionation factor so that 21 δ l α l v r v r vsmow 1 22 δ l α l v δ v 1 1 during the condensation of water vapor and formation of precipitation temperature is the only factor affecting isotopic fractionation with the isotopic fractionation being inversely proportional to temperature i e the higher of the temperature the lower of isotopic fractionation therefore hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values are richer with temperature decrease temperature variations in the middle and high latitudes are large meanwhile the precipitation amount is low and the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly influenced by the temperature effect exhibiting the signature of enrichment in summer and depletion in winter gat et al 2001 the stable isotopic values of precipitation have good linear relationship with temperature in the north atlantic and european δ18o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 yurtsever 1975 the similar relationship between them was found in china which the temperature coefficients are 3 1 c r 0 81 p 0 01 for δ2h and 0 36 c r 0 80 p 0 01 for δ18o wang et al 1999 2000 erenhot is located in the semi arid mid latitude area where the precipitation amount is low therefore the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are mainly dominated by the temperature effect rather than the precipitation amount effect the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation for the stations in near the mp were shown to be influenced primarily by air temperature they were enriched as temperatures increased table 3 qiqihar erenhot and ulaanbaatar which are located at higher latitudes were more affected by air temperature than baotou which is consistent with an earlier study showing that the effect of air temperature on isotope is more obvious at higher latitudes guo et al 2019 the effect of precipitation amount on the isotopes is lower relative to temperature but it varies widely for different stations in near the mp for example this effect is obvious in qiqihar and ulaanbaatar where enriched isotopes were correlated with increased precipitation amount this effect is typically reversed in both the tropics and coastal areas dansgaard 1964 thus precipitation amount may not affect oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation directly as a result of the seasonality of the precipitation and the significant positive correlation between air temperature and precipitation amount qiqihar r 0 65 p 0 01 ulaanbataar r 0 65 p 0 01 crawford et al 2014 temporal variations of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation also showed that the latter were influenced differently based on seasonal air temperatures and precipitation amount correlation between air temperature and stable isotopes in precipitation was strong in spring and autumn but weak in summer and winter indicating that air temperature has a strong weak influence on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation in autumn and spring summer and winter for most stations in near mp for example air temperature varied considerably in spring rising by 9 1 c and autumn falling by 24 3 c relative to summer 1 6 c and winter 2 8 c in erenhot this was correlated with a more significant temperature effect in these areas there was some precipitation amount effect from erenhot and baotou in summer but the stable isotopes in precipitation from baotou were more strongly influenced by precipitation amount than those from erenhot the former was likely due to differences in sub cloud evaporation and moisture sources following different precipitation amount eastoe dettman 2016 cruz et al 2005 the monthly average δ18o and δ2h in erenhot were different from those of the surrounding stations the isotopic signatures in ulaanbaatar which is near the mountains were different from those in erenhot the mp consists primarily of wide flatlands and only few mountains thus erenhot representing the isotopic signatures of the mp is more reasonable overall the mp was mainly controlled by the temperature effect while the amount effect was evident only in summer 5 2 effects of sub cloud evaporation the effect of sub cloud evaporation on oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation is not negligible when combined with low precipitation amount shi et al 2021 in addition sub cloud evaporation is the interactions of various factors and is often also controlled by other meteorological factors such as relative humidity and air temperature graf et al 2019 in erenhot the intensity of sub cloud evaporation increased with decreasing relative humidity and precipitation amount and increasing regional evaporation and temperature fig 3 table 4 these outcomes were consistent with the results of other studies in northern china chen et al 2020 crawford et al 2017 of these factors relative humidity was shown to have the greatest influence on sub cloud evaporation r 0 7 p 0 01 although the precipitation amount also had a significant influence r 0 4 p 0 01 besides regional evaporation had also a certain influence on sub cloud evaporation albeit smaller compared to those of relative humidity and precipitation amount r 0 2 0 3 p 0 01 finally the correlation between air temperature and sub cloud evaporation was low r 0 2 p 0 1 overall sub cloud evaporation was most influenced by relative humidity and least influenced by temperature in general for given relative humidity the sub cloud evaporation fraction is proportional to the air temperature salamalikis et al 2016 in erenhot 9 6 of the total precipitation events 13 precipitation events occurred at air temperatures between 0 and 10 c and fevap ranged between 0 1 and 33 5 with 2 6 mean value 35 of the total precipitation events occurred at air temperatures between 10 and 20 c and fevap ranged between 0 5 and 68 6 with 5 5 mean value and 28 of the total precipitation events occurred at air temperatures from 20 to 30 c and fevap ranged between 1 8 and 43 4 with 7 3 mean value in terms of temperature interval higher air temperature resulted in enhanced sub cloud evaporation but there was no consistent pattern among the precipitation events fig 8 the precipitation events were divided into different groups according to the relative humidity 60 60 70 70 80 80 in the groups with relative humidity 80 the correlation coefficients between air temperature and the degree of sub cloud evaporation were weak and did not pass the 90 significance test indicating that the effect of air temperature on sub cloud evaporation was not obvious at low relative humidity in the group with relative humidity 80 the correlation coefficient between air temperature and sub cloud evaporation was 0 7 and passed the 95 significance test indicating that the air temperature had a strong influence on the sub cloud evaporation at high relative humidity therefore when the relative humidity was 80 it was the main factor affecting sub cloud evaporation when the relative humidity was 80 its influence on the sub cloud evaporation was weak with the latter being mainly affected by air temperature since erenhot is situated in a semi arid area relative humidity is low with 90 of precipitation events occurring with relative humidity 80 hence overall the effect of air temperature on sub cloud evaporation is not obvious the same phenomenon is evident throughout china wang et al 2021a the sub cloud evaporating fraction varied greatly during all precipitation events the greatest variation occurred in spring when the precipitation amount was the lowest fig 8 the sub cloud evaporating fraction was highest in summer 7 5 with the lowest sub cloud evaporating fraction over the entire summer being recorded in july sub cloud evaporation is strongest in dry conditions and weakest in wet conditions wang et al 2021a in addition the differences in regional evaporation and relative humidity in july june and august were significantly smaller than other months meanwhile there was nearly twice as much precipitation amount in july as in june and august fig 3 fig 8 given this we suggest that changes in sub cloud evaporation during summer in erenhot is controlled primarily by the precipitation amount 5 3 quantitative assessment of moisture sources the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit was used for tracking the direction of air mass movements and determine the source and path of moisture in erenhot draxler and hess 1998 fig 9 shows the paths and sources of air masses for the 10 days preceding each precipitation event in erenhot from 2015 to 2019 moisture mainly originates from the western and northwestern parts of the study area with fewer moisture sources from the east compared with the entire semi arid steppe of northern china moisture in erenhot originates from the southern and eastern adjacent land areas local grasslands northwestern china central asia adjacent seas of china the mediterranean sea water areas surrounding the arabian peninsula red sea aden gulf western arabian sea and persian gulf and the north atlantic moisture from the western bay of bengal was not identified while india and the arctic ocean were identified as moisture sources sun wang 2014 the moisture paths are predominantly from west to east w e and northwest to southeast nw se moisture from north asia and the northern atlantic ocean was transported from the northwest supplying 49 0 of the total precipitation while moisture from northwest china central asia europe the mediterranean sea and the arabian peninsula followed w e paths supplying 28 4 of the total precipitation in addition the study area was under the combined control of westerlies and winter monsoons bringing 75 6 of total precipitation with δ18o values of precipitation at the cloud base and surface being 9 13 and 7 75 respectively table 5 a small amount of precipitation in summer and autumn was caused by moisture originating from southeastern china summer 6 7 autumn 4 3 and the seas adjacent to china summer 6 8 autumn 4 3 following e w and se nw paths this is consistent with the pacific monsoon season in china wang et al 2016b and suggests that 75 8 mm of precipitation was produced via the pacific summer monsoon and in autumn only one precipitation event was associated with the indian monsoon over this five year period and it deposited only 2 3 mm of precipitation and 0 24 δ18o of the total precipitation 11 1 was from recycled moisture from the local grassland producing 10 32 of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation on the surface of the land this is significantly depleted compared to the weighted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in precipitation 63 35 δ2h and 8 67 δ18o this suggests that the contribution of recycled moisture to isotopes in erenhot is lower than contributions from the loess plateau to the southwest of the study area 28 higher than that from southeastern china 1 4 and similar to that from the tianshan mountains 4 16 ma et al 2013 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2016a this is influenced by a variety of factors with large differences associated with regional meteorological factors such as subsurface conditions zhang and wang 2016 briefly the winter monsoon from north asia and the north atlantic ocean had the greatest influence on precipitation in the study area and supplied the highest precipitation amount 49 0 followed by the westerlies which was the main prevailing wind direction in the study area accounting for 28 4 of total precipitation and the pacific monsoon which affected precipitation only in summer and autumn also supplied relatively little precipitation 11 9 the indian monsoon had very little influence on precipitation in the study area causing only one precipitation event in 2015 2019 and supplying 1 of total precipitation overall approximately 76 5 of total precipitation originated from the evaporation terrestrial water and plant evapotranspiration while a small amount came directly from the ocean 24 5 mainly from the north atlantic 13 2 and the seas adjacent to china 9 1 this result differs from that in northern china where the moisture originates primarily from the ocean 75 4 with the pacific 30 9 and bay of bengal south china sea 33 8 jiang et al 2017 being the major contributors erenhot is located in the northern parts of north china where moisture is derived from the western part of the continent and precipitation is formed via the effects of westerlies and winter monsoons while most of north china is influenced by the pacific monsoon wang et al 2017 wang ho 2002 this means that the sources of moisture in erenhot is different from that of the rest of north china and thus cannot be generalized in addition the main moisture source for north asia is the north atlantic ocean for central asia eurasia is the dominant moisture source and moisture originating from the north atlantic ocean increases from south to north aragufis aragufis froehlich 1998 jiang et al 2020 thus the unique geographical location of erenhot means its primary moisture source is the eurasian continent and the moisture from ocean is mainly from the north atlantic ocean and affected by the adjacent seas of china 6 conclusions we analyzed the stable isotope variations and their main environmental drivers based on precipitation data collected in erenhot over five years from 2015 to 2019 our study improves the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation records and provides precipitation information for further research on water cycle processes in the mp stable isotopes of precipitation in erenhot were enriched in summer and depleted in winter the temperature effect on isotopes was most pronounced in spring and autumn when sharp temperature changes occurred the amount effect on isotopes was most pronounced in summer especially in june and july when heavy precipitation occurred the weighted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotope values in precipitation were 63 35 and 8 67 for δ2h and δ18o respectively in 2015 2019 the local meteoric water line was calculated as δ2h 7 90δ18o 1 47 with the slope and intercept being lower than that of the global meteoric water line which was mainly due to sub cloud evaporation in arid semi arid areas the δ2h and δ18o isotope values increased by approximately 5 4 and 1 5 respectively from march to november because of sub cloud evaporation the annual mean of the sub cloud evaporation fraction was 5 2 in summer sub cloud evaporation fraction was 7 5 sub cloud evaporation was mainly influenced by the relative humidity precipitation amount and regional evaporation the low relative humidity decreased precipitation and high regional evaporation leading to heavy sub cloud evaporation and the effect of temperature on sub cloud evaporation were masked by other factors continental moisture sources accounted for 76 5 of total precipitation in contrast to north china due to the control of different monsoons these were mainly europe north and central asia while other sources included the arctic and north atlantic oceans about three quarters of total precipitation were due to moisture supplied by the winter monsoon and westerlies with 7 75 δ18osurface the pacific monsoon accounted for 13 5 of total precipitation with moisture originating from southeastern china and adjacent seas of china in summer with 10 34 δ18osurface in addition 11 1 of total precipitation was formed by recycled moisture from the local grassland with 10 32 δ18osurface while the indian monsoon had a negligible effect on precipitation in the study area causing only

1883,how to accurately predict water inflow and relevant groundwater influence of a tunnel are classical scientific issues in the field of hydrogeology which are also of great significance to the construction and operation of underground engineering this issue is usually investigated based on the assumption of the linear darcy s law however the tunnel inflow is usually featured by high velocities or high pressures especially in karst regions which allows the flow regime to easily develop into non darcian flow regime the impact of the non darcian effect on predicting water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel has not yet been systematically examined here we numerically investigated the prediction of stable water inflow and influence radius under non darcian flow regime by numerically solving the continuity equation of seepage flow incorporating the nonlinear forchheimer law a series of numerical simulations were conducted for stable water inflow into a tunnel by varying key controlling parameters the quantitative dependencies of stable water inflow on these parameters were figured out based on which a semi empirical stable water inflow model was developed considering the non darcian effect meanwhile the magnitude of the influence radius was investigated by statistical analysis of 59 actual engineering cases and estimated using existing empirical formulas based on these preliminary explorations a semi empirical model for estimating influence radius was concluded from massive simulations the validities of our proposed semi empirical models for stable water inflow and influence radius were further numerically verified comparative study and application in a real engineering case showed that compared with our proposed models most existing empirical methods predicted a larger stable water inflow and a smaller influence range of groundwater besides comparative results of proposed models with omitting non darcian term indicated that neglecting non darcian effect would overestimate both the stable water inflow and influence radius these findings and established models would be useful for assessing stable water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel under non darcian flow regime keywords water inflow influence radius tunnel non darcian flow semi empirical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water inflow into a tunnel is one of the most common geological problems in tunnel engineering activities which significantly affects the construction and operation of tunnels excessive and uncontrolled water inflow of a tunnel would lead to serious water and mud inrush disasters in tunnel engineering and even cause tunnel collapse apaydin et al 2019 font capó et al 2011 moreover the groundwater drawdown caused by water inflow of a tunnel results in groundwater resources loss and imbalance in the ecological environment which could bring about serious ecological and environmental disasters gokdemir et al 2022 lv et al 2020 preisig et al 2014 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2021a therefore accurate prediction of water inflow into a tunnel and the influence range of groundwater are crucial for ensuring construction safety and protecting the surrounding groundwater environment in tunnel projects practically the real water inflow into a tunnel is a dynamic process which can be divided into maximum water inflow and stable water inflow in horizontal water level and lowered water level respectively different from maximum water inflow with explicit water level boundaries the stable water inflow is harder to derive theoretically analytical solutions due to its dynamic boundary conditions in engineering practice much progress has been made over years in estimating stable water inflow into the tunnel including empirical analyses moon et al 2017 su et al 2017 vanarelli 2020 theoretical derivation el tani et al 2019 fernandez and moon 2010 liu et al 2018 perrochet 2004 wu et al 2020 xie et al 2019 and numerical simulation huang et al 2019 kaufmann and romanov 2020 nikvar hassani et al 2016 shahbazi et al 2021 among these methods numerical simulation is more suitable for solving complex hydrogeological conditions chen et al 2020 nikvar hassani et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 since the tunnel can be considered as a horizontal water collecting gallery the analytical model of irrigation ditch derived by dupuit 1863 was borrowed to predict the stable water inflow of the tunnel goodman et al 1964 first derived a steady state analytical model for predicting maximum water inflow into a circular tunnel sato and iizawa 1983 obtained an unsteady flow formula for predicting stable water inflow through laboratory model experiments according to the experience of various projects heuer 1995 found that real stable water inflow is around one eighth of the maximum inflow calculated by goodman s formula while el tani et al 2019 moon and fernandez 2010 su et al 2017 and wu et al 2020 proposed different methods to estimate or analyze stable water inflow by taking into account various factors on the other hand most models for estimating stable water inflow assume the flow regime follows the linear darcy s law which deviate the prediction of water inflow into the actual tunnels especially in fractured aquifers and fault zones with high flow rates or pressures chen et al 2020 moon and jeong 2011 su et al 2022 recently chen et al 2020 numerically investigated stable water inflow of a karst tunnel and confirmed the necessity of considering the non darcian effect for accurately assessing water inflow zhou et al 2021b proposed an analytical model to predict the non darcian water inflow into a tunnel by incorporating non linear flow law but only for the maximum water inflow thus these uncertain changes in groundwater level and the non darcian flow regimes due to high flow velocities make it difficult to accurately estimate stable water inflow which requires more efforts to investigate water inflow may also result in groundwater drawdown near the tunnel resulting in a conical groundwater depression with a minimum water level possibly reaching the bottom of the tunnel this influence range caused by groundwater drawdown is called the influence radius which is actually an index that reflects the degree of aquifer recharge by the tunnel the mathematical definition of the influence radius was first proposed by dupuit 1863 in well flow where the well model was located at the center of a circular area surrounded by a fixed water head boundary however this type of definition has limitations in the practice therefore based on a large amount of test data theim 1906 modified the dupuit formula to dupuit thiem formula by extending the model to infinite aquifers recently bresciani et al 2020 proposed a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition of influence radius depending on the model the influence radius of well flow can be extended to the pumping and drainage of foundation pits tunnels and horizontal corridors there are several methods commonly used to determine the influence radius of a tunnel including empirical estimation field tests observation and numerical simulation liu et al 2011 conducted a transient analysis to investigate the relationship between the influence radius and factors such as tunnel construction schedule hydrogeological conditions and rainfall infiltration wei and zhu 2021 proposed a dewatering funnel curve equation of the groundwater level surface which can further determine the influence radius among various estimating results the most recommended method is the numerical modeling method but this method was limited by the hydrogeological parameters complex geological structures and computational capabilities motyka and d obyrn 2022 besides analytical and empirical estimation are simple methods to approximate the influence radius of a tunnel but most of them ignore the possible nonlinear flow in tunnel drainage which remains an open issue previous researches have summarized and organized the analytical solutions of maximum water inflow into a tunnel farhadian and katibeh 2017 farhadian and nikvar hassani 2019 zhou et al 2021b here a summary of the state of the art for analytically predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel and corresponding influence radius is provided in table 1 based on a systematic literature review these analytical models involve different medium types homogeneous media and jointed rock mass and water level conditions groundwater level drawdown and excavation induced drawdown however the flow regime is seldom considered in these models which usually assume that the flow obeys the linear darcy s law as a result it is still an open question how much the non darcian effect affects the estimation of stable water inflow and influence radius the main purpose of this study is to establish analytical methods for estimating stable water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel under non darcian flow regime firstly a series of non dacian flows in a conceptual model of tunnel were simulated with different combinations of parameters by solving the seepage equations incorporating the nonlinear forchheimer law by analyzing quantitative dependencies on key parameters semi empirical models for predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel and influence radius were established by comparing with numerical results and previous empirical analytical methods the validity of these semi empirical models has been verified finally the performance of the proposed semi empirical models with existing empirical analytical methods was compared by applying them to a deep buried karst tunnel engineering 2 methodology 2 1 analytical methods for estimating stable water inflow and influence radius the conceptual model of stable water inflow into a tunnel with lowered water level is shown in fig 1 where the circular tunnel is excavated in a semi infinite isotropic and homogeneous aquifer and lowered water level is caused by tunnel drainage the vertical distance from initial water head of aquifer to the center of tunnel is defined as h r and r are the influence radius and tunnel radius respectively in practice r usually corresponds to the water level drawdown criterion h c which is subjectively defined according to different environmental impact requirements therefore r indicates a range beyond which the water level drop value will not exceed h c in the current practice analytical solutions are usually established to estimate the maximum water inflow into a tunnel with a constant water table and these solutions are generally based on assumptions of constant horizontal water head semi infinite homogenous aquifer as well as linear darcy s law one of the most classic theoretical formulas for estimating maximum water inflow into a tunnel is given as el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 1 q 0 2 π k λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where q 0 m2 s is the flux flowing into the tunnel per unit tunnel length k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer λ is a dimensionless parameter defined as h r h r 2 1 eq 1 is theoretically derived without simplifications and serves as the basis for deriving more complex models in this study based on this analytical equation several approximate solutions can be obtained with specific assumptions for example considering deep tunnels h r eq 1 can be simplified as the following equation 2 q 0 2 π k h ln 2 h r eq 2 is also widely used in estimating water inflow into a tunnel which was derived by well theory under a constant head boundary condition goodman et al 1964 the main controlled variable is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and water level condition it should be noted that eqs 1 2 assume that the water level remains at the initial horizontal condition so eqs 1 2 are used to calculate the maximum water inflow into the tunnel in extreme conditions thus modifications of eqs 1 2 are required for estimating stable water inflow into a tunnel where the water level drawdown occurs the water level drawdown during the process of water inflow into a tunnel can be directly observed from excavated test wells which allows for accurate determination of the influence radius through pumping tests and mapping methods however in the absence of excavated test wells empirical models are commonly used to estimate the influence radius without need for excavation in the application of practical engineering the following empirical formulas are recommended in the standard code for hydrogeological investigation of railway engineering tb 10049 2014 3 r 2 s hk where s m is the drawdown of underwater caused by tunnel drainage eq 3 is called as kusakin formula which works better for phreatic water well and sand layer notably in most cases h is greater than s however in the case of shallow buried tunnels or when the water level drops to the bottom of the tunnel the underwater level drawdown s is equal to h sichardt formula is shown as following which is commonly used for confined water well and large thickness aquifer 4 r 10 s k combined with practical engineering experience the standard recommends the following empirical formula 5 r 215 5 510 5 k eq 5 considered only a single correlation between hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and influence radius thus the form is more concise note that the unit of hydraulic conductivity k in eqs 3 5 is m d according to eqs 3 5 it can be found that k and s are the key parameters for all these empirical formulas 2 2 integration of non darcian effect into analytical estimation in the case of high seepage velocities or pressures the darcy s law is inadequate to describe the fluid flow which presents significant nonlinear characteristic due to inertial effects non darcian flow behavior often occurs in porous and fractured media moutsopoulos et al 2009 especially in karst rocks lenci et al 2022 and even under low reynolds number zhou et al 2015 this nonlinear flow can be quantified by the classical forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 as following 6 j 1 k v β g v 2 where j and v m s are the hydraulic gradient and average velocity respectively β 1 m is called the forchheimer coefficient and g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity the linear and nonlinear terms on the right side of eq 6 refer to the viscous and inertial effects respectively eq 6 is expected to apply to the entire range of flow regimes as it adaptively reduces to the darcy s law at low velocities where the quadratic term can be neglected while it can describe the fully developed turbulent regime at high velocities where the linear term can be neglected tzelepis et al 2015 besides compared with other non darcian flow equations such as the cubic polynomial and power law izbash 1931 zimmerman et al 2004 the coefficients in eq 6 have clear physical meanings and have been well characterized chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2019a the classic eq 1 assumes that fluid flow follows the linear darcy s law and constant initial water head for estimating maximum water inflow into a tunnel however during the drainage process of tunnel excavation the groundwater recharge may not be fast enough resulting in less groundwater recharge than tunnel discharge which would form a significant water level drawdown therefore the revision of eq 1 is needed for estimating stable water inflow when tunnel drainage occurs in order to avoid the complicated formula derivation we incorporated a correction coefficient f q into the classic analytical formula which would be calibrated by a series of simulations of non darcian flow into a tunnel the form of this model considering the correction factor for stable water inflow can thus be written as 7 q 2 π k f q k β h r d λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ factor f q is expected to describe the correction relation between stable and maximum water inflows into a tunnel in the framework of non darcian flow many parameters would impact the value of f q without loss of generality five key parameters have been chosen to shape the correction factor i e k and β reflecting the hydraulic properties of the surrounding aquifer h describing the groundwater condition r reflecting the drainage ability of the tunnel d representing boundary conditions in numerical simulations and hydrogeological barriers in actual engineering cases the practical significance of d has been addressed below these parameters were chosen based on their universality and typicality in determining stable water inflow into tunnels notably there is a semi analytical model for predicting maximum water inflow into a tunnel under non darcian flow regime zhou et al 2021b however this model is also a modification of eq 1 in order to avoid multiple corrections this study chose to establish the non darcian stable water inflow model by directly correcting the classical formula eq 1 rather than the semi analytical model proposed by zhou et al 2021b as shown in section 2 1 the influence radius r is usually empirically estimated as there is no theoretical analytical solution according to the existing methods r is closely related to the initial water head h similar to the strategy for stable water inflow we proposed a characterization factor f r of influence radius and multiplied it by h to estimate r f r will be calibrated and parameterized by a series of non darcian flow simulations the form of the equation is given as 8 r f r k β h r h c h factor f r is expected to describe the quantitative relationship between the influence radius of tunnel drainage and the initial groundwater water level under non darcian flow regime many parameters would impact the value of f r similar with f q five key parameters have been chosen to represent the characterization factor without loss of generality i e hydraulic parameters k and β initial groundwater level h tunnel size r and water level drawdown criterion h c 2 3 numerical simulations of stable water inflow into a tunnel a finite element model d 2000 m 10 m was developed in this study as shown in fig 2 noted that this quasi three dimensional model was extended 10 m along the y axis the lateral boundary was prescribed with a constant water hydraulic boundary and no boundary conditions were set for the top as a free surface while the bottom front and rear of the model were assumed to be impermeable the tunnel wall was set as the seepage boundary satisfying the signorini s complementary condition to make the tunnel drain the aquifer chen et al 2011 it is important to highlight that unlike the constant water boundary assumption of the classical theoretical formula mentioned in section 2 2 the top free surface boundary characterizes the water level drawdown due to tunnel drainage moreover this model domain with 8 node hexahedral element was divided into finite element meshes the total number of nodes and elements was more than 1 700 000 and 2000000 respectively tunnel surroundings were refined with small elements for simulating stable water inflow more precisely as shown in the partially enlarged drawing of fig 2 the forchheimer equation eq 6 is integrated into the continuity equation v 0 for the finite element seepage simulations considering the non darcian effect with this the governing equation of numerical simulation can be introduced 9 k 1 f o h 0 where fo is defined as kβ v g javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 when β 0 fo is zero and eq 9 can reduce to the classical governing equation of the darcy s flow the validity of this numerical simulated code was verified in previous study zhou et al 2021b to avoid entanglement the stable water inflow and influence radius were investigated separately in this study note that when shaping both f q and f r apart from other parameters having clear physical meanings the model width d is a bit tricky as its value would impact the function of fixed water head boundary condition applied to the model lateral boundary theoretically d should be large enough not to impact the water inflow into the tunnel and free surface drawdown nikvar hassani et al 2016 wu and zhou 2022 recommend a model extent of no less than 200 times of the tunnel radius here in order to save computational costs and ensure the accuracy of numerical results the model width was fixed as 5000 m when investigating the dependency of f q on k β h r while the model width varied from 1000 50000 m when investigating the dependency of f q on d hence the numerical simulations of stable water inflow into a tunnel were conducted under non darcian flow regime and different combinations of parameters k β h r d the control variable method was used when investigating the quantitative relationships i e for each group of numerical simulation one parameter was varied while the other two remained unchanged in five cases from a to e parameters including k β h r d were designed each case has three groups the details were provided in table 2 the selection of the value ranges for each case of numerical simulation parameters should be reasonable considering that in order to cover most engineering conditions h varied from 20 m to 1000 m and tunnel radius r varied from 3 m to 7 m noted that the parameter combinations for k and β are not arbitrary which is restricted by the 95 prediction bounds proposed by zhou et al 2019b this universal model indicates a power law scaling relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities in geologic porous media in other words forchheimer coefficient β can be predicted from hydraulic conductivity k rather than arbitrary values the width of numerical model can affect the value of the influence radius directly therefore the width of numerical models for investigating influence radius should be carefully selected in order to determine model width d the information of influence radius reported in 59 real engineering cases were collected in table s1 as shown in fig 3 a 50 of influence radius is less than 1000 m and 90 is less than 10000 m moreover the magnitude of the influence radius is also investigated by the existing empirical formulas eqs 3 5 and the calculation parameters are listed in table 3 it is worth noting that the calculation parameters in table 3 cover the value ranges presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3b 60 influence radius are less than 10000 m based on these information the model width is prescribed as 20000 m for investigating f r in this study which covers most influence radius reported in real tunnel engineering cases and estimated by empirical formulas we chose different combinations of parameters k β h r h c for simulations in analyzing the dependence of f r on each parameter according to the control variable method five cases of a e numerical simulation schemes were designed with three groups in each case table 4 the parameters k β h r were selected on the same basis listed in table 2 it should be noted that the criterion for water level drawdown h c has been chosen in the range of 5 20 m referring to previous studies ahmadi et al 2023 hu et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 certainly the value of h c is flexible in practical applications where a smaller h c usually means stricter standards of groundwater environmental impact and higher controlling costs for tunnel excavation 3 results these representative parameters including hydraulic conductivity parameters k and β representative values of water head h and h c tunnel size r and model size d were expected to shape the correction factor f q of stable water inflow and the characterization factor f r of influence radius this section firstly examined the dependencies of f q and f r on representative parameters k β h h c r d and further integrated these quantitative dependencies into analytical models 3 1 dependencies of correction factor for stable water inflow by changing the key parameters the dependence of f q on k β h d r can be speculated for each simulation the value of f q were calculated backward using eq 7 with the simulated q case a focused on the impact of k as shown in fig 4 a the value of f q in each group decreased monotonically as k increased this is reasonable as higher hydraulic conductivity promotes the flow velocity field and further enhances the non darcian effect besides for different groups increasing β leads to a shift of the curve from right to left fig 4a this indicates that a greater β meaning more significant inertial losses for the same velocity would lead to a smaller f q based on the data points in fig 4a a hyperbolic function was used to characterize the dependence of f q on k for each group given by 10 f q k 1 l 1 m 1 k n 1 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 l 1 1 6872 m 1 1 5211 105 n 1 1 3283 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 l 1 1 6859 m 1 7 2920 105 n 1 1 3311 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 l 1 1 6870 m 1 3 1638 106 n 1 1 3261 eq 10 showed a good performance with r2 0 9981 0 9990 interestingly the fitted coefficients l 1 and n 1 remain unchanged for different groups referring to different β while the fitted coefficients m 1 changed significantly obviously coefficient m 1 is a function of β case b focused on the impact of forchheimer coefficient β as shown in fig 4b f q also showed a negative hyperbolic relationship with β this variation is possibly ascribed to the enhanced inertial losses by increasing β which reduced the water inflow besides for different groups increasing k leads to a left right shift for the curve fig 4b this indicates that a greater k resulted in a smaller f q which is consistent with eq 10 established above as the same with the analysis of f q k the hyperbola function is also adopted here 11 f q β 1 l 2 m 2 β n 2 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s l 2 1 6750 m 2 5 0996 10 8 n 2 0 6699 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s l 2 1 6873 m 2 2 6048 10 9 n 2 0 6655 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s l 2 1 6845 m 2 9 1712 10 11 n 2 0 6735 eq 11 showed a good performance with r2 0 9979 0 9986 similarly the fitted coefficients l 2 near constant 1 6 and n 2 near constant 0 66 are irrelevant to k clearly m 2 is a function of k the dependence of f q on h r was studied based on case c table 2 note that h is non dimensionalized by r in the following analysis as shown in fig 4c f q increased with h indicating that the shallow tunnel would enlarge the gap between stable water inflow and maximum water inflow for shallow tunnels with smaller values of h the groundwater surface would drop to the bottom of the tunnel resulting in zero water pressure above the upper part of tunnel in this context the amount of water inflow reduced significantly and there would be a large gap between stable water inflow and the maximum one meaning a smaller f q the relationship between f q and h r can be characterized by an exponential function 12 f q h r l 3 m 3 n 3 h r the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 l 3 0 5789 m 3 0 4183 n 3 0 9775 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 l 3 0 5985 m 3 0

coefficients indicates that different combinations of k and β would not significantly impact the variation of f q with h tunnel radius is another considerable parameter for estimating stable water inflow which was studied by case d table 2 as shown in fig 4d with the increase of r f q slightly decreased indicating an insensitive of f q to r increasing r means a higher discharge capacity but this parameter itself does not vary much thus resulting in a limited impact a power function was adopted to describe the relationship between f q and r given as 13 f q r l 4 r m 4 l 5 r m 5 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 l 4 8 4633 m 4 0 2738 l 5 8 9674 m 5 0 2624 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 l 4 11 3807 m 4 0

widely in different groups but the trends of the curves are the same the variations in coefficients l 4 l 5 m 4 m 5 for different groups are ascribed to the effect of k and β finally case e table 2 focused on the effect of d as shown in fig 4e f q decreased with increasing d and the variation can reach an order of magnitude this variation is ascribed to the controlling mechanism of d on the applied lateral constant water head fig 2 increasing d would reduce the whole water level above the tunnel and thus lead to a decrease in stable water inflow similar negative correlations between stable water inflow and influence radius referring to d here were also observed in the transformation of the dupuit s equation motyka and d obyrn 2022 moreover curves in different groups almost overlapped indicating that the variation of f q on d is independent of k and β the negative correlation of f q on d can also be speculated from the variation of groundwater drawdown the data of three groups can be collapsed and fitted by a function given as 14 f q d r l 6 m 6 n 6 d r the fitted coefficients of eq 14 are l 6 0 1285 m 6 0 7767 and n 6 0 9994 with r2 0 9905 3 2 semi empirical model of stable water inflow the dependence of f q on key parameters k β d h r for stable water inflow has been separately investigated in section 3 1 and the parameter integration needs to be conducted to incorporate all the data in figs 4a 4e the values of many fitted coefficients of eqs 10 14 are very close for different groups which provides the foundation for collapsing all the data according to each correlation analysis of the form and coefficients of eqs 10 14 a new equation of f q was proposed by integrating these key parameters with multivariate fitting 15 f q k β h r d γ d r c 2 c 1 h r c 3 c 4 ω k 4 3 β g 2 3 note that r is mainly adopted to nondimensionalize other size parameters due to its tiny impact on f q revealed from fig 4d eq 15 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 4a 4e which was conducted by 1stopt software a global optimization nonlinear regression program with the start of the art optimization algorithms the fitted coefficients are c 1 0 0325 c 2 0 0544 c 3 0 3007 c 4 0 0352 γ 0 0549 ω 0 0243 this equation can well describe the functional relationship between f q and parameters k β h r d with r2 0 9941 note that one term in the denominator k 4 3 β g 2 3 is dimensionless by introducing constant g combined with the method of dimensionless treatment for d r and h r eq 15 thus satisfies the dimensional consistency clearly f q is a correction coefficient of stable water inflow from maximum water inflow which integrated all key factors via eq 15 including hydraulic properties of the surrounding aquifer k β groundwater storage h tunnel drainage r boundary effect d substituting eq 15 into eq 7 a new semi empirical model for predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel can be finally developed as following 16 q 2 π k γ d r c 2 c 1 h r c 3 c 4 ω k 4 3 β g 2 3 λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ eq 16 provides an analytical method for estimating stable tunnel inflow by considering the non darcian flow effect this proposed model satisfies the consistency of dimension and considers all major impacting factors of water inflow to further verify the validity of eq 16 extra numerical simulation cases listed in table 5 were conducted with the parameter combination out of the fitted data the comparison of numerical simulation and analytical prediction in fig 5 further confirmed the good performance of eq 16 line slope is 0 9981 for estimating stable water inflow note that all the water inflows in fig 5 are normalized by the darcy inflow calculated by eq 1 it is worth mentioning that d is involved in eq 16 which represents the minimum model width required to apply a constant head as a lateral boundary therefore d in eq 16 is essentially equivalent to twice the influence radius r discussed below 3 3 dependencies of characterization factor for influence radius as mentioned in section 2 2 key parameters k β h r h c have an effect on estimating the influence radius by tunnel drainage by changing each parameter f r can be speculated for each simulation case the value of f r can be determined by dividing the estimated influence radius r by initial water head h fig 6 note that r is numerically determined by plotting the simulated groundwater surface and searching the point of groundwater drawdown h c for better illustrating the variation the groundwater drawdown of different combinations of parameters is also plotted as shown in fig 7 case a table 4 focused on the impact of k as shown in fig 6a f r decreased with increasing k which is consistent with the groundwater surface variation in fig 7a this is totally different from the simulation in the framework of the darcy s law where the groundwater surface is independent of the hydraulic conductivity for the conceptual model in fig 2 he 2018 for non darcian flow the impact of increasing k on the groundwater surface comes into force by enlarging the magnitude of velocity field which further promotes the non darcian effect in this context the groundwater surface becomes dependent on hydraulic conductivity based on the data points in fig 6a an exponential function was used to characterize the dependence of f r on k for each group given by 17 f r k s 1 e k τ 1 u 1 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 2 5739 τ 1 0 0025 u 1 16 8361 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 2 6015 τ 1 7 6231 10 4 u 1 16 8226 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 s 1 2 5740 τ 1 2 5214 10 4 u 1 16 8361 eq 17 is in good agreement of variation f r with k and r2 is close to 1 in three groups 0 9979 0 9985 the values of s 1 and u 1 in different groups are almost constant which proved that these coefficients are independent of β changing β causes the curve to shift thus τ 1 is a function of β case b table 4 focused on the impact of β with the increase of β the value of f r decreased fig 6b it can be seen that the increase of β makes the non darcian flow effect more significant resulting in the rise of the groundwater level line fig 7b the rise of groundwater level caused by the non darcian effect has also been reported in previous studies he 2018 besides increasing k leads to a left right shift of the f r β curve fig 6b which is consistent with the law reveals in eq 17 the variation of f r β can be described by the following formula 18 f r β s 2 τ 2 β u 2 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s s 2 19 5007 τ 2 9 2110 10 5 u 2 0 3137 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s s 2 19 5419 τ 2 3 7550 10 4 u 2 0 2327 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s s 2 19 4662 τ 2 4 0247 10 6 u 2 0 3196 eq 18 contains variate f r and β with r2 0 9524 0 9807 the fitted coefficients s 2 and u 2 are almost irrelevant to k and the shifting of the three curves is mainly controlled by the parameter τ 2 case c table 4 focused on the impact of h note that h is nondimensionalized by r in the following analysis as shown in fig 6c f r decreased with increasing h r and the variation range of f r even reaches from 9 to 152 indicating h has a significant effect on f r combined with the groundwater surface variation in fig 7c shallow buried tunnel with smaller h limits the drawdown of water level and the deep buried tunnel with larger h has a significantly larger water level drawdown three groups of data almost overlap in fig 6c which indicates that the dependence of f r on h r is independent of different combinations on k and β an exponential function was used to characterize the dependence of f r on h for groups which is given by 19 f r h r s 3 τ 3 u 3 h r where s 3 13 3106 τ 3 176 4107 and u 3 0 9603 eq 19 fits well the varied f r on h r with r2 0 9874 the dependence of f r on r was analyzed based on case d table 4 as fig 6d shown with the increase of r f r presents an insignificant increase indicating an independent of f r on r the underwater level lines are very close for each group fig 7d which also proves that r has a small effect on r a power function was used to describe the weak relationship between f r and r which is given as 20 f r r s 4 r τ 4 the fitted coefficients of eq 20 are s 4 19 3363 and τ 4 0 0015 eq 20 shows a good agreement with r2 0 9448 while the small fitted coefficient of τ 4 in eq 20 also indicates the weak relationship between f r and r finally as a subjective index the water level drawdown criterion h c is directly related to influence radius r case e table 4 focused on investigating the impact of h c as shown in fig 6e the overlapped data points of different groups indicate that the effect of h c on f r is independent of the different combinations of k and β when h c increased f r reduced gradually which presents a linear variation a linear function was chosen to fit the all three groups of data it is given by 21 f r h c r s 5 h c r τ 5 where s 5 0 3032 and τ 5 19 9947 with r2 0 9999 from the linear fitting of eq 21 and the negative slope explaining that f r decreased monotonically with the increase of h c 3 4 semi empirical model of influence radius a series of fitting curves for each parameter are systematically analyzed by variable controlling in section 3 3 while this study aims at figuring out a semi empirical solution to estimate the influence radius in tunnel drainage stage to reach this goal the dependence of f r on key parameters k β h r h c in eqs 17 21 are integrated into a new expression as following 22 f r w 1 w 2 h c r δ 1 w 3 h r ζ ψ lg k τ lg β note that r is mainly adopted to nondimensionalize other size parameters due to its tiny impact on f r revealed from fig 6d eq 22 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 6a 6e which was also conducted by 1stopt software the fitted coefficients are w 1 14 3497 w 2 391 880 δ 0 2980 w 3 0 04985 ζ 1 6065 ψ 1 0928 and τ 1 0470 such a semi empirical model can well describe the variation of f r with each parameter k β h r h c with r2 0 9543 it should be noted that the coefficients determined in section 3 3 are locally optimized for each case whereas the coefficients determined in eq 22 are globally optimized for all the cases a e in table 4 substituting eq 22 into eq 8 a new semi empirical model in estimating influence radius for tunnel drainage can be proposed as following 23 r h w 1 w 2 h c r δ 1 w 3 h r ζ ψ lg k τ lg β it is worth mentioning that r is mainly determined by the water head h which is related to groundwater level and tunnel location all numerical results r simulated from figs 6a 6e and prediction results r predicted calculated by eq 23 are compared in fig 8 noted that all the influence radius in fig 8 is normalized by water level h the slope of fitting line is 0 9682 proving that the influence radius predicted by eq 23 agree well with all simulated results therefore this proposed model can analytically estimate the influence radius for tunnel drainage under complex non darcian flow 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with existing empirical models this study established a semi empirical model eq 16 for predicting stable water inflow by considering the non darcian effect and comprehensively integrating key parameters to further discuss the difference of this model from previous ones representative models listed in table 1 were also applied to estimate the stable water inflow as compared in fig 9 the predicted results q predicted of these empirical analytical models were compared with the simulated results q simulated the calculation parameters listed in table 2 and 5 note that all the water inflows were normalized by the result of eq 1 as shown in fig 9 different color represents the result from different empirical analytical model while different symbol shape represents the results with different parameter k β h d r for the model of heuer 1995 black points derived from eq 2 by multiplying it by a constant coefficient 1 8 its predicted results plotted in fig 9 are concentrated and distributed horizontally at the bottom of the figure this indicates that heuer s model mostly underestimates the stable water inflow the model of su et al 2017 yellow points overestimates the water inflow significantly especially for the deep buried tunnel upper triangle yellow points with larger normalized value this is because the model of su et al 2017 relies heavily on the parameter r h and when r h is less than a certain degree for deeper buried tunnels the predicted value would even exceed the maximum water inflow q predicted greater than 1 the predicted results of wu et al 2020 blue points also deviate greatly from the simulated results showing a similar trend to that of su et al 2017 however its predicted value does not exceed the maximum water inflow q predicted less than 1 the predicted results from the model of dupuit 1863 orange points are the smallest due to the introduction of the influence radius r which is in the denominator and relatively large resulting in a small q predicted the predicted results from the model of sato and iizawa 1983 green points are located in the middle of the figure by contrast the predicted results of the proposed model eq 16 red points around the line with slope 1 indicating good performance in estimating stable water inflow it should be noted that the horizontal distribution of points for different models is mainly due to the inclusion of parameters β and d in the simulation results which are not present in other empirical models however the absence of these parameters does not necessarily mean that their effects have been ignored for example the model of dupuit 1863 includes the influence radius r which essentially accounts for the effect of d the model of heuer 1995 is concluded from real tunnels cases which cannot exclude the inclusion of non darcian effect similarly this study further established a semi empirical model eq 23 for estimating influence radius induced by tunnel drainage by considering the non darcian effect and comprehensively integrating key parameters note that this model was developed with a detailed and convincing basis model width was determined based on the influence radius of 59 real engineering cases reported in the literature table s1 and the magnitude of influence radius estimated by the empirical equation eqs 3 5 is also considered moreover this proposed model takes full advantage of the accuracy of considering the non darcian effect by numerical simulations in practice this model can efficiently estimate the preliminary influence radius of the tunnel with basic properties of aquifer thus this proposed model is a generalization and condensation of numerical simulation results and actual engineering experience 4 2 application to real tunnel engineering the practical significances of established eq 16 for predicting stable water inflow and established eq 23 for estimating influence radius were investigated by applying them to a real karst tunnel this tunnel is named as the shuidaqiao tunnel which is a key part of the jiayan water diversion project located in guizhou province in southwest china designed for water supply irrigation and power generation zhou et al 2021b this tunnel is a typical karst tunnel with a length of 20 36 km and it is deep buried with the minimum and maximum buried depth of 50 m and 523 m respectively the radius of the tunnel is 2 7 m this tunnel passes through moderately developed karst formations and the stratum in the area belongs to the permian and triassic systems the details of hydraulic properties for different formations and fault zones were provided in previous studies related to this project chen et al 2020 zhou et al 2021b both the proposed model eq 16 and existing empirical analytical models table 1 were adopted to predict the stable water inflow along the tunnel in order to quantitatively evaluate the relative deviation of other empirical analytical models with our proposed one the deviation percentage e is defined as 24 e q e q q 100 where q e is the water inflow per unit length calculated by the empirical analytical models listed in table 1 and q is one calculated by eq 16 as a reference the proposed model eq 16 with omitting the non darcian term is also adopted to calculate the stable water inflow this is implemented by setting β 0 01 a tiny value indicating a negligible non darcian effect fig 10 and table 6 shows the stable water inflows along the tunnel and corresponding deviations of other empirical analytical models from our predicted results d 10000 m in these cases note that the results with different values of d 1000 m 5000 m 20000 m are provided in the supporting information fig s1 and table s2 for examining the effect of d note that the sudden increase of stable water inflow is ascribed to the abrupt change in hydraulic conductivity induced by highly permeable stratum and fault zone stable water inflow illustrated by the blue shaded area refers to the results predicted by eq 16 and other lines show results calculated by other empirical analytical models different lines at the bottom of fig 10 refer to deviation e of different empirical analytical models as shown in fig 10 and table 6 the predicted results for the model of heuer 1995 are less than our proposed model eq 16 through the whole tunnel line with the deviations remaining around 50 the deviations for the model of dupuit 1863 have both positive and negative values with larger fluctuation from 96 to 425 this deviation is ascribed to considering influence radius at the denominator of dupuit 1863 equation which presented a negative correlation with the stable water inflows the results of other models including su et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and sato and iizawa 1983 all presented a larger prediction of stable water inflow in particular the deviations of su et al 2017 and wu et al 2020 are generally larger and even reach 331 while the deviation of sato and iizawa 1983 model is around 135 moreover the deviation of the proposed model with omitting non darcian effect is not exceeding 20 nevertheless it proves that omitting non darcian effect under the same model eq 16 would overestimate the stable water inflow notably the deviations between different models depend on many reasons not just whether the non darcian effect is taken into account but also different model generalizations different boundary assumptions and different induction methods it is worth mentioning that model width d also has an impact on the magnitude of relative values of above mentioned water inflows fig s1 and table s2 through the comparison with different model widths most previous empirical analytical methods predicted a relatively large amount of stable water inflow the results predicted by our established model of eq 16 are shown as the same variation pattern described in section 3 1 of case e table 2 increasing d would lead to significant decrease in stable water inflow fig s1 this is because for smaller model width the fixed water head boundary is closer to the tunnel resulting in more tunnel inflow for conceptualizing the tunnel inflow model the model width d gives the range where the boundary is not affected by the water level drawdown due to tunnel drainage in this context d is actually equivalent to or larger than twice the influence radius r however the model width d is only a definition in the numerical simulations for real engineering projects apart from selecting a sufficiently large value it is recommended to comprehensively determine d by considering hydrogeological barriers such as ridgelines water resistant faults and other impermeable and confining boundaries in addition based on the comparison results shown in fig 3 it is recommended to use d 2r of 20000 m as a conservative measure for preliminary predictions while in general 10000 m would be sufficient furthermore the impact on the groundwater environment caused by the shuidaqiao tunnel drainage was quantitatively analyzed by calculating the influence radius r using the established eq 23 as well as existing empirical and numerical methods the existing empirical methods included the kusakin model eq 3 and the standard recommendation model eq 5 while the numerical simulation method was conducted by zheng et al 2021 where a 3d hydrogeological model of the shuidaqiao tunnel was established and groundwater flow around the tunnel was simulated it should be noted that we adopted a water level drawdown criterion of h c 10 m when estimating r keeping consistent with the previous numerical simulation study zheng et al 2021 the water level red line has the same trend of influence radius estimated by most of the models in fig 11 which indicates that underground water level has a significant effect on influence radius as a reference the proposed model eq 23 with omitting non darcian term by setting β 0 01 referring to a negligible non darcian effect is also adopted to predict the influence radius as marked in white dashed line in fig 11 for any method the estimated influence range is limited by the hydrogeological boundaries of the shuidaqiao tunnel i e the liuchong and baifu rivers the impervious machang fault as well as the ridgeline on the north side of the tunnel fig 11 note that only machang fault is impervious and the remaining faults are all high permeable as shown in fig 11 the estimated groundwater influence ranges by the kusakin model dark blue area and the standard recommended model brown area are both less than our proposed model light blue area throughout the tunnel when the non darcian effect is not considered the predicted range of influence radius by the proposed model is significantly larger compared to when it is taken into account in spite of this the variation of the influence range along the tunnel is similar among our proposed model and these two empirical methods it is worth mentioning that the influence range estimated by the kusakin model increased significantly in the high permeability section high permeable fault with the value even more than 10000 m the simulation results of zheng et al 2021 green area are roughly consistent with our proposed model in the middle segment of the tunnel line but the results at the beginning and the end of the tunnel are largely different especially by zheng s simulations there is no groundwater influence for nearly half the length of the tunnel this is ascribed to the fact that zheng s simulation considered the tunnel lining at this part of tunnel in this context the groundwater influence of the tunnel with linings is tiny due to the extremely low permeability of the linings notably empirical models have the advantage of being relatively simple and easy to use however their disadvantage is that they are only applicable under homogeneous and isotropic conditions the numerical simulations of 3d seepage provided by zheng et al 2021 adopted the coupled discrete continuum modeling approach where both the tunnels and karst conduits were treated as discrete channels it may be more accurate and can provide a comprehensive understanding of stable water inflow into the tunnel however the accuracy of the numerical method depends on the degree to which the geological structures are considered which is costly in most instances the above comparative analyses show how much difference there is in the magnitude and variation law of stable water inflow and influence radius predicted by different methods and these comparisons clearly illustrated different responses of these models to parameters including the initial water head hydraulic conductivity of the stratums and faults discussion on the validity and applicability of these methods required the support of further monitoring data nonetheless our study revealed that the non darcian flow is a non negligible factor when estimating the water inflow and influence radius especially for the tunnel inflow with high flow rate it should be mentioned that in fractured and karst aquifers the occurrence width filling and other geometric parameters of fractures faults and karst pipes have significant impacts on predicting water inflow into the tunnel strong heterogeneity and anisotropy of fractured and karst aquifers may require a more complex form of the permeability tensor to characterize the aquifer hydraulics snow 1969 oda 1985 rather than isotropic k and β therefore further efforts are recommended to complement the analytical models established in this study by conducting and analyzing a series of simulations of non darcian flow into a tunnel buried in anisotropic media notably when the sizes of karst pipes and faults are too larger to be equivalent more complex methods have to be adopted such as dual or triple medium models chen 1995 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 li et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the prediction of the stable water inflow into tunnels and influence radius during the tunnel drainage process in which the effect of non darcian flow is considered firstly a correction factor was introduced to quantify the gap between maximum water inflow in the classical formula and stable water inflow considering the non darcian effect a series of stable water inflow simulations were conducted by varying key parameters the dependencies of the correction factor on key parameters were carried out with control variable method based on these simulations and ingenious parameter integration a semi empirical model was established by integrating the fitted correction factor into the classical formula which has a concise expression and follows dimensional consistency this proposed model can be used to predict the stable water inflow into the tunnels considering the non darcian effect meanwhile the influence radius was first investigated by statistical analysis of 59 actual engineering cases and estimated by existing empirical formulas based on these preliminary studies the basic magnitude of influence radius was delineated a characterization factor was introduced to quantify the effect of key parameters on the influence radius using the control variable method a series of numerical simulations with the model width determined by covering the most common magnitude of influence radius were conducted to shape this characterization factor based on this factor a semi empirical model was subsequently developed for estimating the influence radius considering the non darcian effect the validity of these two proposed semi empirical models for stable water inflow and influence radius was further numerically verified through comparative analysis of actual engineering cases with other empirical models it shows that most existing empirical methods predicted a larger stable water inflow and a smaller influence range of groundwater besides comparative results of proposed models with omitting non darcian term indicate that neglecting non darcian flow would overestimate the stable water inflow and influence radius especially at higher initial water heads the findings and proposed models in this study would be hopeful for estimating water inflow and corresponding groundwater environmental impact induced by tunnels with large flow

1883,how to accurately predict water inflow and relevant groundwater influence of a tunnel are classical scientific issues in the field of hydrogeology which are also of great significance to the construction and operation of underground engineering this issue is usually investigated based on the assumption of the linear darcy s law however the tunnel inflow is usually featured by high velocities or high pressures especially in karst regions which allows the flow regime to easily develop into non darcian flow regime the impact of the non darcian effect on predicting water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel has not yet been systematically examined here we numerically investigated the prediction of stable water inflow and influence radius under non darcian flow regime by numerically solving the continuity equation of seepage flow incorporating the nonlinear forchheimer law a series of numerical simulations were conducted for stable water inflow into a tunnel by varying key controlling parameters the quantitative dependencies of stable water inflow on these parameters were figured out based on which a semi empirical stable water inflow model was developed considering the non darcian effect meanwhile the magnitude of the influence radius was investigated by statistical analysis of 59 actual engineering cases and estimated using existing empirical formulas based on these preliminary explorations a semi empirical model for estimating influence radius was concluded from massive simulations the validities of our proposed semi empirical models for stable water inflow and influence radius were further numerically verified comparative study and application in a real engineering case showed that compared with our proposed models most existing empirical methods predicted a larger stable water inflow and a smaller influence range of groundwater besides comparative results of proposed models with omitting non darcian term indicated that neglecting non darcian effect would overestimate both the stable water inflow and influence radius these findings and established models would be useful for assessing stable water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel under non darcian flow regime keywords water inflow influence radius tunnel non darcian flow semi empirical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water inflow into a tunnel is one of the most common geological problems in tunnel engineering activities which significantly affects the construction and operation of tunnels excessive and uncontrolled water inflow of a tunnel would lead to serious water and mud inrush disasters in tunnel engineering and even cause tunnel collapse apaydin et al 2019 font capó et al 2011 moreover the groundwater drawdown caused by water inflow of a tunnel results in groundwater resources loss and imbalance in the ecological environment which could bring about serious ecological and environmental disasters gokdemir et al 2022 lv et al 2020 preisig et al 2014 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2021a therefore accurate prediction of water inflow into a tunnel and the influence range of groundwater are crucial for ensuring construction safety and protecting the surrounding groundwater environment in tunnel projects practically the real water inflow into a tunnel is a dynamic process which can be divided into maximum water inflow and stable water inflow in horizontal water level and lowered water level respectively different from maximum water inflow with explicit water level boundaries the stable water inflow is harder to derive theoretically analytical solutions due to its dynamic boundary conditions in engineering practice much progress has been made over years in estimating stable water inflow into the tunnel including empirical analyses moon et al 2017 su et al 2017 vanarelli 2020 theoretical derivation el tani et al 2019 fernandez and moon 2010 liu et al 2018 perrochet 2004 wu et al 2020 xie et al 2019 and numerical simulation huang et al 2019 kaufmann and romanov 2020 nikvar hassani et al 2016 shahbazi et al 2021 among these methods numerical simulation is more suitable for solving complex hydrogeological conditions chen et al 2020 nikvar hassani et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 since the tunnel can be considered as a horizontal water collecting gallery the analytical model of irrigation ditch derived by dupuit 1863 was borrowed to predict the stable water inflow of the tunnel goodman et al 1964 first derived a steady state analytical model for predicting maximum water inflow into a circular tunnel sato and iizawa 1983 obtained an unsteady flow formula for predicting stable water inflow through laboratory model experiments according to the experience of various projects heuer 1995 found that real stable water inflow is around one eighth of the maximum inflow calculated by goodman s formula while el tani et al 2019 moon and fernandez 2010 su et al 2017 and wu et al 2020 proposed different methods to estimate or analyze stable water inflow by taking into account various factors on the other hand most models for estimating stable water inflow assume the flow regime follows the linear darcy s law which deviate the prediction of water inflow into the actual tunnels especially in fractured aquifers and fault zones with high flow rates or pressures chen et al 2020 moon and jeong 2011 su et al 2022 recently chen et al 2020 numerically investigated stable water inflow of a karst tunnel and confirmed the necessity of considering the non darcian effect for accurately assessing water inflow zhou et al 2021b proposed an analytical model to predict the non darcian water inflow into a tunnel by incorporating non linear flow law but only for the maximum water inflow thus these uncertain changes in groundwater level and the non darcian flow regimes due to high flow velocities make it difficult to accurately estimate stable water inflow which requires more efforts to investigate water inflow may also result in groundwater drawdown near the tunnel resulting in a conical groundwater depression with a minimum water level possibly reaching the bottom of the tunnel this influence range caused by groundwater drawdown is called the influence radius which is actually an index that reflects the degree of aquifer recharge by the tunnel the mathematical definition of the influence radius was first proposed by dupuit 1863 in well flow where the well model was located at the center of a circular area surrounded by a fixed water head boundary however this type of definition has limitations in the practice therefore based on a large amount of test data theim 1906 modified the dupuit formula to dupuit thiem formula by extending the model to infinite aquifers recently bresciani et al 2020 proposed a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition of influence radius depending on the model the influence radius of well flow can be extended to the pumping and drainage of foundation pits tunnels and horizontal corridors there are several methods commonly used to determine the influence radius of a tunnel including empirical estimation field tests observation and numerical simulation liu et al 2011 conducted a transient analysis to investigate the relationship between the influence radius and factors such as tunnel construction schedule hydrogeological conditions and rainfall infiltration wei and zhu 2021 proposed a dewatering funnel curve equation of the groundwater level surface which can further determine the influence radius among various estimating results the most recommended method is the numerical modeling method but this method was limited by the hydrogeological parameters complex geological structures and computational capabilities motyka and d obyrn 2022 besides analytical and empirical estimation are simple methods to approximate the influence radius of a tunnel but most of them ignore the possible nonlinear flow in tunnel drainage which remains an open issue previous researches have summarized and organized the analytical solutions of maximum water inflow into a tunnel farhadian and katibeh 2017 farhadian and nikvar hassani 2019 zhou et al 2021b here a summary of the state of the art for analytically predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel and corresponding influence radius is provided in table 1 based on a systematic literature review these analytical models involve different medium types homogeneous media and jointed rock mass and water level conditions groundwater level drawdown and excavation induced drawdown however the flow regime is seldom considered in these models which usually assume that the flow obeys the linear darcy s law as a result it is still an open question how much the non darcian effect affects the estimation of stable water inflow and influence radius the main purpose of this study is to establish analytical methods for estimating stable water inflow and influence radius of a tunnel under non darcian flow regime firstly a series of non dacian flows in a conceptual model of tunnel were simulated with different combinations of parameters by solving the seepage equations incorporating the nonlinear forchheimer law by analyzing quantitative dependencies on key parameters semi empirical models for predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel and influence radius were established by comparing with numerical results and previous empirical analytical methods the validity of these semi empirical models has been verified finally the performance of the proposed semi empirical models with existing empirical analytical methods was compared by applying them to a deep buried karst tunnel engineering 2 methodology 2 1 analytical methods for estimating stable water inflow and influence radius the conceptual model of stable water inflow into a tunnel with lowered water level is shown in fig 1 where the circular tunnel is excavated in a semi infinite isotropic and homogeneous aquifer and lowered water level is caused by tunnel drainage the vertical distance from initial water head of aquifer to the center of tunnel is defined as h r and r are the influence radius and tunnel radius respectively in practice r usually corresponds to the water level drawdown criterion h c which is subjectively defined according to different environmental impact requirements therefore r indicates a range beyond which the water level drop value will not exceed h c in the current practice analytical solutions are usually established to estimate the maximum water inflow into a tunnel with a constant water table and these solutions are generally based on assumptions of constant horizontal water head semi infinite homogenous aquifer as well as linear darcy s law one of the most classic theoretical formulas for estimating maximum water inflow into a tunnel is given as el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 1 q 0 2 π k λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where q 0 m2 s is the flux flowing into the tunnel per unit tunnel length k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer λ is a dimensionless parameter defined as h r h r 2 1 eq 1 is theoretically derived without simplifications and serves as the basis for deriving more complex models in this study based on this analytical equation several approximate solutions can be obtained with specific assumptions for example considering deep tunnels h r eq 1 can be simplified as the following equation 2 q 0 2 π k h ln 2 h r eq 2 is also widely used in estimating water inflow into a tunnel which was derived by well theory under a constant head boundary condition goodman et al 1964 the main controlled variable is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and water level condition it should be noted that eqs 1 2 assume that the water level remains at the initial horizontal condition so eqs 1 2 are used to calculate the maximum water inflow into the tunnel in extreme conditions thus modifications of eqs 1 2 are required for estimating stable water inflow into a tunnel where the water level drawdown occurs the water level drawdown during the process of water inflow into a tunnel can be directly observed from excavated test wells which allows for accurate determination of the influence radius through pumping tests and mapping methods however in the absence of excavated test wells empirical models are commonly used to estimate the influence radius without need for excavation in the application of practical engineering the following empirical formulas are recommended in the standard code for hydrogeological investigation of railway engineering tb 10049 2014 3 r 2 s hk where s m is the drawdown of underwater caused by tunnel drainage eq 3 is called as kusakin formula which works better for phreatic water well and sand layer notably in most cases h is greater than s however in the case of shallow buried tunnels or when the water level drops to the bottom of the tunnel the underwater level drawdown s is equal to h sichardt formula is shown as following which is commonly used for confined water well and large thickness aquifer 4 r 10 s k combined with practical engineering experience the standard recommends the following empirical formula 5 r 215 5 510 5 k eq 5 considered only a single correlation between hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and influence radius thus the form is more concise note that the unit of hydraulic conductivity k in eqs 3 5 is m d according to eqs 3 5 it can be found that k and s are the key parameters for all these empirical formulas 2 2 integration of non darcian effect into analytical estimation in the case of high seepage velocities or pressures the darcy s law is inadequate to describe the fluid flow which presents significant nonlinear characteristic due to inertial effects non darcian flow behavior often occurs in porous and fractured media moutsopoulos et al 2009 especially in karst rocks lenci et al 2022 and even under low reynolds number zhou et al 2015 this nonlinear flow can be quantified by the classical forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 as following 6 j 1 k v β g v 2 where j and v m s are the hydraulic gradient and average velocity respectively β 1 m is called the forchheimer coefficient and g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity the linear and nonlinear terms on the right side of eq 6 refer to the viscous and inertial effects respectively eq 6 is expected to apply to the entire range of flow regimes as it adaptively reduces to the darcy s law at low velocities where the quadratic term can be neglected while it can describe the fully developed turbulent regime at high velocities where the linear term can be neglected tzelepis et al 2015 besides compared with other non darcian flow equations such as the cubic polynomial and power law izbash 1931 zimmerman et al 2004 the coefficients in eq 6 have clear physical meanings and have been well characterized chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2019a the classic eq 1 assumes that fluid flow follows the linear darcy s law and constant initial water head for estimating maximum water inflow into a tunnel however during the drainage process of tunnel excavation the groundwater recharge may not be fast enough resulting in less groundwater recharge than tunnel discharge which would form a significant water level drawdown therefore the revision of eq 1 is needed for estimating stable water inflow when tunnel drainage occurs in order to avoid the complicated formula derivation we incorporated a correction coefficient f q into the classic analytical formula which would be calibrated by a series of simulations of non darcian flow into a tunnel the form of this model considering the correction factor for stable water inflow can thus be written as 7 q 2 π k f q k β h r d λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ factor f q is expected to describe the correction relation between stable and maximum water inflows into a tunnel in the framework of non darcian flow many parameters would impact the value of f q without loss of generality five key parameters have been chosen to shape the correction factor i e k and β reflecting the hydraulic properties of the surrounding aquifer h describing the groundwater condition r reflecting the drainage ability of the tunnel d representing boundary conditions in numerical simulations and hydrogeological barriers in actual engineering cases the practical significance of d has been addressed below these parameters were chosen based on their universality and typicality in determining stable water inflow into tunnels notably there is a semi analytical model for predicting maximum water inflow into a tunnel under non darcian flow regime zhou et al 2021b however this model is also a modification of eq 1 in order to avoid multiple corrections this study chose to establish the non darcian stable water inflow model by directly correcting the classical formula eq 1 rather than the semi analytical model proposed by zhou et al 2021b as shown in section 2 1 the influence radius r is usually empirically estimated as there is no theoretical analytical solution according to the existing methods r is closely related to the initial water head h similar to the strategy for stable water inflow we proposed a characterization factor f r of influence radius and multiplied it by h to estimate r f r will be calibrated and parameterized by a series of non darcian flow simulations the form of the equation is given as 8 r f r k β h r h c h factor f r is expected to describe the quantitative relationship between the influence radius of tunnel drainage and the initial groundwater water level under non darcian flow regime many parameters would impact the value of f r similar with f q five key parameters have been chosen to represent the characterization factor without loss of generality i e hydraulic parameters k and β initial groundwater level h tunnel size r and water level drawdown criterion h c 2 3 numerical simulations of stable water inflow into a tunnel a finite element model d 2000 m 10 m was developed in this study as shown in fig 2 noted that this quasi three dimensional model was extended 10 m along the y axis the lateral boundary was prescribed with a constant water hydraulic boundary and no boundary conditions were set for the top as a free surface while the bottom front and rear of the model were assumed to be impermeable the tunnel wall was set as the seepage boundary satisfying the signorini s complementary condition to make the tunnel drain the aquifer chen et al 2011 it is important to highlight that unlike the constant water boundary assumption of the classical theoretical formula mentioned in section 2 2 the top free surface boundary characterizes the water level drawdown due to tunnel drainage moreover this model domain with 8 node hexahedral element was divided into finite element meshes the total number of nodes and elements was more than 1 700 000 and 2000000 respectively tunnel surroundings were refined with small elements for simulating stable water inflow more precisely as shown in the partially enlarged drawing of fig 2 the forchheimer equation eq 6 is integrated into the continuity equation v 0 for the finite element seepage simulations considering the non darcian effect with this the governing equation of numerical simulation can be introduced 9 k 1 f o h 0 where fo is defined as kβ v g javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 when β 0 fo is zero and eq 9 can reduce to the classical governing equation of the darcy s flow the validity of this numerical simulated code was verified in previous study zhou et al 2021b to avoid entanglement the stable water inflow and influence radius were investigated separately in this study note that when shaping both f q and f r apart from other parameters having clear physical meanings the model width d is a bit tricky as its value would impact the function of fixed water head boundary condition applied to the model lateral boundary theoretically d should be large enough not to impact the water inflow into the tunnel and free surface drawdown nikvar hassani et al 2016 wu and zhou 2022 recommend a model extent of no less than 200 times of the tunnel radius here in order to save computational costs and ensure the accuracy of numerical results the model width was fixed as 5000 m when investigating the dependency of f q on k β h r while the model width varied from 1000 50000 m when investigating the dependency of f q on d hence the numerical simulations of stable water inflow into a tunnel were conducted under non darcian flow regime and different combinations of parameters k β h r d the control variable method was used when investigating the quantitative relationships i e for each group of numerical simulation one parameter was varied while the other two remained unchanged in five cases from a to e parameters including k β h r d were designed each case has three groups the details were provided in table 2 the selection of the value ranges for each case of numerical simulation parameters should be reasonable considering that in order to cover most engineering conditions h varied from 20 m to 1000 m and tunnel radius r varied from 3 m to 7 m noted that the parameter combinations for k and β are not arbitrary which is restricted by the 95 prediction bounds proposed by zhou et al 2019b this universal model indicates a power law scaling relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities in geologic porous media in other words forchheimer coefficient β can be predicted from hydraulic conductivity k rather than arbitrary values the width of numerical model can affect the value of the influence radius directly therefore the width of numerical models for investigating influence radius should be carefully selected in order to determine model width d the information of influence radius reported in 59 real engineering cases were collected in table s1 as shown in fig 3 a 50 of influence radius is less than 1000 m and 90 is less than 10000 m moreover the magnitude of the influence radius is also investigated by the existing empirical formulas eqs 3 5 and the calculation parameters are listed in table 3 it is worth noting that the calculation parameters in table 3 cover the value ranges presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3b 60 influence radius are less than 10000 m based on these information the model width is prescribed as 20000 m for investigating f r in this study which covers most influence radius reported in real tunnel engineering cases and estimated by empirical formulas we chose different combinations of parameters k β h r h c for simulations in analyzing the dependence of f r on each parameter according to the control variable method five cases of a e numerical simulation schemes were designed with three groups in each case table 4 the parameters k β h r were selected on the same basis listed in table 2 it should be noted that the criterion for water level drawdown h c has been chosen in the range of 5 20 m referring to previous studies ahmadi et al 2023 hu et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 certainly the value of h c is flexible in practical applications where a smaller h c usually means stricter standards of groundwater environmental impact and higher controlling costs for tunnel excavation 3 results these representative parameters including hydraulic conductivity parameters k and β representative values of water head h and h c tunnel size r and model size d were expected to shape the correction factor f q of stable water inflow and the characterization factor f r of influence radius this section firstly examined the dependencies of f q and f r on representative parameters k β h h c r d and further integrated these quantitative dependencies into analytical models 3 1 dependencies of correction factor for stable water inflow by changing the key parameters the dependence of f q on k β h d r can be speculated for each simulation the value of f q were calculated backward using eq 7 with the simulated q case a focused on the impact of k as shown in fig 4 a the value of f q in each group decreased monotonically as k increased this is reasonable as higher hydraulic conductivity promotes the flow velocity field and further enhances the non darcian effect besides for different groups increasing β leads to a shift of the curve from right to left fig 4a this indicates that a greater β meaning more significant inertial losses for the same velocity would lead to a smaller f q based on the data points in fig 4a a hyperbolic function was used to characterize the dependence of f q on k for each group given by 10 f q k 1 l 1 m 1 k n 1 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 l 1 1 6872 m 1 1 5211 105 n 1 1 3283 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 l 1 1 6859 m 1 7 2920 105 n 1 1 3311 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 l 1 1 6870 m 1 3 1638 106 n 1 1 3261 eq 10 showed a good performance with r2 0 9981 0 9990 interestingly the fitted coefficients l 1 and n 1 remain unchanged for different groups referring to different β while the fitted coefficients m 1 changed significantly obviously coefficient m 1 is a function of β case b focused on the impact of forchheimer coefficient β as shown in fig 4b f q also showed a negative hyperbolic relationship with β this variation is possibly ascribed to the enhanced inertial losses by increasing β which reduced the water inflow besides for different groups increasing k leads to a left right shift for the curve fig 4b this indicates that a greater k resulted in a smaller f q which is consistent with eq 10 established above as the same with the analysis of f q k the hyperbola function is also adopted here 11 f q β 1 l 2 m 2 β n 2 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s l 2 1 6750 m 2 5 0996 10 8 n 2 0 6699 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s l 2 1 6873 m 2 2 6048 10 9 n 2 0 6655 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s l 2 1 6845 m 2 9 1712 10 11 n 2 0 6735 eq 11 showed a good performance with r2 0 9979 0 9986 similarly the fitted coefficients l 2 near constant 1 6 and n 2 near constant 0 66 are irrelevant to k clearly m 2 is a function of k the dependence of f q on h r was studied based on case c table 2 note that h is non dimensionalized by r in the following analysis as shown in fig 4c f q increased with h indicating that the shallow tunnel would enlarge the gap between stable water inflow and maximum water inflow for shallow tunnels with smaller values of h the groundwater surface would drop to the bottom of the tunnel resulting in zero water pressure above the upper part of tunnel in this context the amount of water inflow reduced significantly and there would be a large gap between stable water inflow and the maximum one meaning a smaller f q the relationship between f q and h r can be characterized by an exponential function 12 f q h r l 3 m 3 n 3 h r the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 l 3 0 5789 m 3 0 4183 n 3 0 9775 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 l 3 0 5985 m 3 0

coefficients indicates that different combinations of k and β would not significantly impact the variation of f q with h tunnel radius is another considerable parameter for estimating stable water inflow which was studied by case d table 2 as shown in fig 4d with the increase of r f q slightly decreased indicating an insensitive of f q to r increasing r means a higher discharge capacity but this parameter itself does not vary much thus resulting in a limited impact a power function was adopted to describe the relationship between f q and r given as 13 f q r l 4 r m 4 l 5 r m 5 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 l 4 8 4633 m 4 0 2738 l 5 8 9674 m 5 0 2624 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 l 4 11 3807 m 4 0

widely in different groups but the trends of the curves are the same the variations in coefficients l 4 l 5 m 4 m 5 for different groups are ascribed to the effect of k and β finally case e table 2 focused on the effect of d as shown in fig 4e f q decreased with increasing d and the variation can reach an order of magnitude this variation is ascribed to the controlling mechanism of d on the applied lateral constant water head fig 2 increasing d would reduce the whole water level above the tunnel and thus lead to a decrease in stable water inflow similar negative correlations between stable water inflow and influence radius referring to d here were also observed in the transformation of the dupuit s equation motyka and d obyrn 2022 moreover curves in different groups almost overlapped indicating that the variation of f q on d is independent of k and β the negative correlation of f q on d can also be speculated from the variation of groundwater drawdown the data of three groups can be collapsed and fitted by a function given as 14 f q d r l 6 m 6 n 6 d r the fitted coefficients of eq 14 are l 6 0 1285 m 6 0 7767 and n 6 0 9994 with r2 0 9905 3 2 semi empirical model of stable water inflow the dependence of f q on key parameters k β d h r for stable water inflow has been separately investigated in section 3 1 and the parameter integration needs to be conducted to incorporate all the data in figs 4a 4e the values of many fitted coefficients of eqs 10 14 are very close for different groups which provides the foundation for collapsing all the data according to each correlation analysis of the form and coefficients of eqs 10 14 a new equation of f q was proposed by integrating these key parameters with multivariate fitting 15 f q k β h r d γ d r c 2 c 1 h r c 3 c 4 ω k 4 3 β g 2 3 note that r is mainly adopted to nondimensionalize other size parameters due to its tiny impact on f q revealed from fig 4d eq 15 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 4a 4e which was conducted by 1stopt software a global optimization nonlinear regression program with the start of the art optimization algorithms the fitted coefficients are c 1 0 0325 c 2 0 0544 c 3 0 3007 c 4 0 0352 γ 0 0549 ω 0 0243 this equation can well describe the functional relationship between f q and parameters k β h r d with r2 0 9941 note that one term in the denominator k 4 3 β g 2 3 is dimensionless by introducing constant g combined with the method of dimensionless treatment for d r and h r eq 15 thus satisfies the dimensional consistency clearly f q is a correction coefficient of stable water inflow from maximum water inflow which integrated all key factors via eq 15 including hydraulic properties of the surrounding aquifer k β groundwater storage h tunnel drainage r boundary effect d substituting eq 15 into eq 7 a new semi empirical model for predicting stable water inflow into a tunnel can be finally developed as following 16 q 2 π k γ d r c 2 c 1 h r c 3 c 4 ω k 4 3 β g 2 3 λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ eq 16 provides an analytical method for estimating stable tunnel inflow by considering the non darcian flow effect this proposed model satisfies the consistency of dimension and considers all major impacting factors of water inflow to further verify the validity of eq 16 extra numerical simulation cases listed in table 5 were conducted with the parameter combination out of the fitted data the comparison of numerical simulation and analytical prediction in fig 5 further confirmed the good performance of eq 16 line slope is 0 9981 for estimating stable water inflow note that all the water inflows in fig 5 are normalized by the darcy inflow calculated by eq 1 it is worth mentioning that d is involved in eq 16 which represents the minimum model width required to apply a constant head as a lateral boundary therefore d in eq 16 is essentially equivalent to twice the influence radius r discussed below 3 3 dependencies of characterization factor for influence radius as mentioned in section 2 2 key parameters k β h r h c have an effect on estimating the influence radius by tunnel drainage by changing each parameter f r can be speculated for each simulation case the value of f r can be determined by dividing the estimated influence radius r by initial water head h fig 6 note that r is numerically determined by plotting the simulated groundwater surface and searching the point of groundwater drawdown h c for better illustrating the variation the groundwater drawdown of different combinations of parameters is also plotted as shown in fig 7 case a table 4 focused on the impact of k as shown in fig 6a f r decreased with increasing k which is consistent with the groundwater surface variation in fig 7a this is totally different from the simulation in the framework of the darcy s law where the groundwater surface is independent of the hydraulic conductivity for the conceptual model in fig 2 he 2018 for non darcian flow the impact of increasing k on the groundwater surface comes into force by enlarging the magnitude of velocity field which further promotes the non darcian effect in this context the groundwater surface becomes dependent on hydraulic conductivity based on the data points in fig 6a an exponential function was used to characterize the dependence of f r on k for each group given by 17 f r k s 1 e k τ 1 u 1 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 2 5739 τ 1 0 0025 u 1 16 8361 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 2 6015 τ 1 7 6231 10 4 u 1 16 8226 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 s 1 2 5740 τ 1 2 5214 10 4 u 1 16 8361 eq 17 is in good agreement of variation f r with k and r2 is close to 1 in three groups 0 9979 0 9985 the values of s 1 and u 1 in different groups are almost constant which proved that these coefficients are independent of β changing β causes the curve to shift thus τ 1 is a function of β case b table 4 focused on the impact of β with the increase of β the value of f r decreased fig 6b it can be seen that the increase of β makes the non darcian flow effect more significant resulting in the rise of the groundwater level line fig 7b the rise of groundwater level caused by the non darcian effect has also been reported in previous studies he 2018 besides increasing k leads to a left right shift of the f r β curve fig 6b which is consistent with the law reveals in eq 17 the variation of f r β can be described by the following formula 18 f r β s 2 τ 2 β u 2 the fitted coefficients for different groups are listed below group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s s 2 19 5007 τ 2 9 2110 10 5 u 2 0 3137 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s s 2 19 5419 τ 2 3 7550 10 4 u 2 0 2327 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s s 2 19 4662 τ 2 4 0247 10 6 u 2 0 3196 eq 18 contains variate f r and β with r2 0 9524 0 9807 the fitted coefficients s 2 and u 2 are almost irrelevant to k and the shifting of the three curves is mainly controlled by the parameter τ 2 case c table 4 focused on the impact of h note that h is nondimensionalized by r in the following analysis as shown in fig 6c f r decreased with increasing h r and the variation range of f r even reaches from 9 to 152 indicating h has a significant effect on f r combined with the groundwater surface variation in fig 7c shallow buried tunnel with smaller h limits the drawdown of water level and the deep buried tunnel with larger h has a significantly larger water level drawdown three groups of data almost overlap in fig 6c which indicates that the dependence of f r on h r is independent of different combinations on k and β an exponential function was used to characterize the dependence of f r on h for groups which is given by 19 f r h r s 3 τ 3 u 3 h r where s 3 13 3106 τ 3 176 4107 and u 3 0 9603 eq 19 fits well the varied f r on h r with r2 0 9874 the dependence of f r on r was analyzed based on case d table 4 as fig 6d shown with the increase of r f r presents an insignificant increase indicating an independent of f r on r the underwater level lines are very close for each group fig 7d which also proves that r has a small effect on r a power function was used to describe the weak relationship between f r and r which is given as 20 f r r s 4 r τ 4 the fitted coefficients of eq 20 are s 4 19 3363 and τ 4 0 0015 eq 20 shows a good agreement with r2 0 9448 while the small fitted coefficient of τ 4 in eq 20 also indicates the weak relationship between f r and r finally as a subjective index the water level drawdown criterion h c is directly related to influence radius r case e table 4 focused on investigating the impact of h c as shown in fig 6e the overlapped data points of different groups indicate that the effect of h c on f r is independent of the different combinations of k and β when h c increased f r reduced gradually which presents a linear variation a linear function was chosen to fit the all three groups of data it is given by 21 f r h c r s 5 h c r τ 5 where s 5 0 3032 and τ 5 19 9947 with r2 0 9999 from the linear fitting of eq 21 and the negative slope explaining that f r decreased monotonically with the increase of h c 3 4 semi empirical model of influence radius a series of fitting curves for each parameter are systematically analyzed by variable controlling in section 3 3 while this study aims at figuring out a semi empirical solution to estimate the influence radius in tunnel drainage stage to reach this goal the dependence of f r on key parameters k β h r h c in eqs 17 21 are integrated into a new expression as following 22 f r w 1 w 2 h c r δ 1 w 3 h r ζ ψ lg k τ lg β note that r is mainly adopted to nondimensionalize other size parameters due to its tiny impact on f r revealed from fig 6d eq 22 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 6a 6e which was also conducted by 1stopt software the fitted coefficients are w 1 14 3497 w 2 391 880 δ 0 2980 w 3 0 04985 ζ 1 6065 ψ 1 0928 and τ 1 0470 such a semi empirical model can well describe the variation of f r with each parameter k β h r h c with r2 0 9543 it should be noted that the coefficients determined in section 3 3 are locally optimized for each case whereas the coefficients determined in eq 22 are globally optimized for all the cases a e in table 4 substituting eq 22 into eq 8 a new semi empirical model in estimating influence radius for tunnel drainage can be proposed as following 23 r h w 1 w 2 h c r δ 1 w 3 h r ζ ψ lg k τ lg β it is worth mentioning that r is mainly determined by the water head h which is related to groundwater level and tunnel location all numerical results r simulated from figs 6a 6e and prediction results r predicted calculated by eq 23 are compared in fig 8 noted that all the influence radius in fig 8 is normalized by water level h the slope of fitting line is 0 9682 proving that the influence radius predicted by eq 23 agree well with all simulated results therefore this proposed model can analytically estimate the influence radius for tunnel drainage under complex non darcian flow 4 discussions 4 1 comparison with existing empirical models this study established a semi empirical model eq 16 for predicting stable water inflow by considering the non darcian effect and comprehensively integrating key parameters to further discuss the difference of this model from previous ones representative models listed in table 1 were also applied to estimate the stable water inflow as compared in fig 9 the predicted results q predicted of these empirical analytical models were compared with the simulated results q simulated the calculation parameters listed in table 2 and 5 note that all the water inflows were normalized by the result of eq 1 as shown in fig 9 different color represents the result from different empirical analytical model while different symbol shape represents the results with different parameter k β h d r for the model of heuer 1995 black points derived from eq 2 by multiplying it by a constant coefficient 1 8 its predicted results plotted in fig 9 are concentrated and distributed horizontally at the bottom of the figure this indicates that heuer s model mostly underestimates the stable water inflow the model of su et al 2017 yellow points overestimates the water inflow significantly especially for the deep buried tunnel upper triangle yellow points with larger normalized value this is because the model of su et al 2017 relies heavily on the parameter r h and when r h is less than a certain degree for deeper buried tunnels the predicted value would even exceed the maximum water inflow q predicted greater than 1 the predicted results of wu et al 2020 blue points also deviate greatly from the simulated results showing a similar trend to that of su et al 2017 however its predicted value does not exceed the maximum water inflow q predicted less than 1 the predicted results from the model of dupuit 1863 orange points are the smallest due to the introduction of the influence radius r which is in the denominator and relatively large resulting in a small q predicted the predicted results from the model of sato and iizawa 1983 green points are located in the middle of the figure by contrast the predicted results of the proposed model eq 16 red points around the line with slope 1 indicating good performance in estimating stable water inflow it should be noted that the horizontal distribution of points for different models is mainly due to the inclusion of parameters β and d in the simulation results which are not present in other empirical models however the absence of these parameters does not necessarily mean that their effects have been ignored for example the model of dupuit 1863 includes the influence radius r which essentially accounts for the effect of d the model of heuer 1995 is concluded from real tunnels cases which cannot exclude the inclusion of non darcian effect similarly this study further established a semi empirical model eq 23 for estimating influence radius induced by tunnel drainage by considering the non darcian effect and comprehensively integrating key parameters note that this model was developed with a detailed and convincing basis model width was determined based on the influence radius of 59 real engineering cases reported in the literature table s1 and the magnitude of influence radius estimated by the empirical equation eqs 3 5 is also considered moreover this proposed model takes full advantage of the accuracy of considering the non darcian effect by numerical simulations in practice this model can efficiently estimate the preliminary influence radius of the tunnel with basic properties of aquifer thus this proposed model is a generalization and condensation of numerical simulation results and actual engineering experience 4 2 application to real tunnel engineering the practical significances of established eq 16 for predicting stable water inflow and established eq 23 for estimating influence radius were investigated by applying them to a real karst tunnel this tunnel is named as the shuidaqiao tunnel which is a key part of the jiayan water diversion project located in guizhou province in southwest china designed for water supply irrigation and power generation zhou et al 2021b this tunnel is a typical karst tunnel with a length of 20 36 km and it is deep buried with the minimum and maximum buried depth of 50 m and 523 m respectively the radius of the tunnel is 2 7 m this tunnel passes through moderately developed karst formations and the stratum in the area belongs to the permian and triassic systems the details of hydraulic properties for different formations and fault zones were provided in previous studies related to this project chen et al 2020 zhou et al 2021b both the proposed model eq 16 and existing empirical analytical models table 1 were adopted to predict the stable water inflow along the tunnel in order to quantitatively evaluate the relative deviation of other empirical analytical models with our proposed one the deviation percentage e is defined as 24 e q e q q 100 where q e is the water inflow per unit length calculated by the empirical analytical models listed in table 1 and q is one calculated by eq 16 as a reference the proposed model eq 16 with omitting the non darcian term is also adopted to calculate the stable water inflow this is implemented by setting β 0 01 a tiny value indicating a negligible non darcian effect fig 10 and table 6 shows the stable water inflows along the tunnel and corresponding deviations of other empirical analytical models from our predicted results d 10000 m in these cases note that the results with different values of d 1000 m 5000 m 20000 m are provided in the supporting information fig s1 and table s2 for examining the effect of d note that the sudden increase of stable water inflow is ascribed to the abrupt change in hydraulic conductivity induced by highly permeable stratum and fault zone stable water inflow illustrated by the blue shaded area refers to the results predicted by eq 16 and other lines show results calculated by other empirical analytical models different lines at the bottom of fig 10 refer to deviation e of different empirical analytical models as shown in fig 10 and table 6 the predicted results for the model of heuer 1995 are less than our proposed model eq 16 through the whole tunnel line with the deviations remaining around 50 the deviations for the model of dupuit 1863 have both positive and negative values with larger fluctuation from 96 to 425 this deviation is ascribed to considering influence radius at the denominator of dupuit 1863 equation which presented a negative correlation with the stable water inflows the results of other models including su et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and sato and iizawa 1983 all presented a larger prediction of stable water inflow in particular the deviations of su et al 2017 and wu et al 2020 are generally larger and even reach 331 while the deviation of sato and iizawa 1983 model is around 135 moreover the deviation of the proposed model with omitting non darcian effect is not exceeding 20 nevertheless it proves that omitting non darcian effect under the same model eq 16 would overestimate the stable water inflow notably the deviations between different models depend on many reasons not just whether the non darcian effect is taken into account but also different model generalizations different boundary assumptions and different induction methods it is worth mentioning that model width d also has an impact on the magnitude of relative values of above mentioned water inflows fig s1 and table s2 through the comparison with different model widths most previous empirical analytical methods predicted a relatively large amount of stable water inflow the results predicted by our established model of eq 16 are shown as the same variation pattern described in section 3 1 of case e table 2 increasing d would lead to significant decrease in stable water inflow fig s1 this is because for smaller model width the fixed water head boundary is closer to the tunnel resulting in more tunnel inflow for conceptualizing the tunnel inflow model the model width d gives the range where the boundary is not affected by the water level drawdown due to tunnel drainage in this context d is actually equivalent to or larger than twice the influence radius r however the model width d is only a definition in the numerical simulations for real engineering projects apart from selecting a sufficiently large value it is recommended to comprehensively determine d by considering hydrogeological barriers such as ridgelines water resistant faults and other impermeable and confining boundaries in addition based on the comparison results shown in fig 3 it is recommended to use d 2r of 20000 m as a conservative measure for preliminary predictions while in general 10000 m would be sufficient furthermore the impact on the groundwater environment caused by the shuidaqiao tunnel drainage was quantitatively analyzed by calculating the influence radius r using the established eq 23 as well as existing empirical and numerical methods the existing empirical methods included the kusakin model eq 3 and the standard recommendation model eq 5 while the numerical simulation method was conducted by zheng et al 2021 where a 3d hydrogeological model of the shuidaqiao tunnel was established and groundwater flow around the tunnel was simulated it should be noted that we adopted a water level drawdown criterion of h c 10 m when estimating r keeping consistent with the previous numerical simulation study zheng et al 2021 the water level red line has the same trend of influence radius estimated by most of the models in fig 11 which indicates that underground water level has a significant effect on influence radius as a reference the proposed model eq 23 with omitting non darcian term by setting β 0 01 referring to a negligible non darcian effect is also adopted to predict the influence radius as marked in white dashed line in fig 11 for any method the estimated influence range is limited by the hydrogeological boundaries of the shuidaqiao tunnel i e the liuchong and baifu rivers the impervious machang fault as well as the ridgeline on the north side of the tunnel fig 11 note that only machang fault is impervious and the remaining faults are all high permeable as shown in fig 11 the estimated groundwater influence ranges by the kusakin model dark blue area and the standard recommended model brown area are both less than our proposed model light blue area throughout the tunnel when the non darcian effect is not considered the predicted range of influence radius by the proposed model is significantly larger compared to when it is taken into account in spite of this the variation of the influence range along the tunnel is similar among our proposed model and these two empirical methods it is worth mentioning that the influence range estimated by the kusakin model increased significantly in the high permeability section high permeable fault with the value even more than 10000 m the simulation results of zheng et al 2021 green area are roughly consistent with our proposed model in the middle segment of the tunnel line but the results at the beginning and the end of the tunnel are largely different especially by zheng s simulations there is no groundwater influence for nearly half the length of the tunnel this is ascribed to the fact that zheng s simulation considered the tunnel lining at this part of tunnel in this context the groundwater influence of the tunnel with linings is tiny due to the extremely low permeability of the linings notably empirical models have the advantage of being relatively simple and easy to use however their disadvantage is that they are only applicable under homogeneous and isotropic conditions the numerical simulations of 3d seepage provided by zheng et al 2021 adopted the coupled discrete continuum modeling approach where both the tunnels and karst conduits were treated as discrete channels it may be more accurate and can provide a comprehensive understanding of stable water inflow into the tunnel however the accuracy of the numerical method depends on the degree to which the geological structures are considered which is costly in most instances the above comparative analyses show how much difference there is in the magnitude and variation law of stable water inflow and influence radius predicted by different methods and these comparisons clearly illustrated different responses of these models to parameters including the initial water head hydraulic conductivity of the stratums and faults discussion on the validity and applicability of these methods required the support of further monitoring data nonetheless our study revealed that the non darcian flow is a non negligible factor when estimating the water inflow and influence radius especially for the tunnel inflow with high flow rate it should be mentioned that in fractured and karst aquifers the occurrence width filling and other geometric parameters of fractures faults and karst pipes have significant impacts on predicting water inflow into the tunnel strong heterogeneity and anisotropy of fractured and karst aquifers may require a more complex form of the permeability tensor to characterize the aquifer hydraulics snow 1969 oda 1985 rather than isotropic k and β therefore further efforts are recommended to complement the analytical models established in this study by conducting and analyzing a series of simulations of non darcian flow into a tunnel buried in anisotropic media notably when the sizes of karst pipes and faults are too larger to be equivalent more complex methods have to be adopted such as dual or triple medium models chen 1995 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 li et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 5 conclusions this study investigated the prediction of the stable water inflow into tunnels and influence radius during the tunnel drainage process in which the effect of non darcian flow is considered firstly a correction factor was introduced to quantify the gap between maximum water inflow in the classical formula and stable water inflow considering the non darcian effect a series of stable water inflow simulations were conducted by varying key parameters the dependencies of the correction factor on key parameters were carried out with control variable method based on these simulations and ingenious parameter integration a semi empirical model was established by integrating the fitted correction factor into the classical formula which has a concise expression and follows dimensional consistency this proposed model can be used to predict the stable water inflow into the tunnels considering the non darcian effect meanwhile the influence radius was first investigated by statistical analysis of 59 actual engineering cases and estimated by existing empirical formulas based on these preliminary studies the basic magnitude of influence radius was delineated a characterization factor was introduced to quantify the effect of key parameters on the influence radius using the control variable method a series of numerical simulations with the model width determined by covering the most common magnitude of influence radius were conducted to shape this characterization factor based on this factor a semi empirical model was subsequently developed for estimating the influence radius considering the non darcian effect the validity of these two proposed semi empirical models for stable water inflow and influence radius was further numerically verified through comparative analysis of actual engineering cases with other empirical models it shows that most existing empirical methods predicted a larger stable water inflow and a smaller influence range of groundwater besides comparative results of proposed models with omitting non darcian term indicate that neglecting non darcian flow would overestimate the stable water inflow and influence radius especially at higher initial water heads the findings and proposed models in this study would be hopeful for estimating water inflow and corresponding groundwater environmental impact induced by tunnels with large flow

1884,standard hydrologic model evaluation and calibration approaches focus on the accurate simulation of streamflow disregarding internal process simulations stable isotope tracers can provide additional information on water sources and process flux and storage which can be used to inform model calibration this study assesses the added value of isotope data in comparison to current best practice flow only calibration methods and evaluates the merits and limitations of isotope simulation performance metrics for the purposes of hydrological model calibration following several years of regular isotope sampling and measurement an isotope enabled process based hydrologic model was tested on a large watershed in western canada athabasca river which allowed model calibration using global sensitivity analyses monte carlo simulations and multi objective optimizations isotope tracer data were found to improve both process and streamflow component identifiability and produced some minor improvement in individual parameter value identifiability calibrating to optimize both flow and isotope simulation performance produced better flow simulation ensembles with improved observation capture and validation performance relative to calibrating to optimize flow simulations alone using an isotope simulation performance metric which includes timing error as a secondary optimization objective led to more robust streamflow modeling even in mesoscale watersheds with limited isotope observation datasets data availability holmes tegan 2023 research data for guidance on large scale hydrologic model calibration with isotope tracers mendeley data v1 https data mendeley com datasets h5p6mgych7 1 1 introduction hydrologic models are essential tools for hydrologists used to predict runoff or streamflow in both short term forecasting and long term climate change projection applications however the purpose or application of hydrologic models vary from overall basin water balance estimates to predicting flood volumes or for the investigation of flow generation processes such as baseflow in regional groundwater impact studies among other applications clark et al 2017 likewise hydrologic models vary in structure and complexity from fully physically based models to conceptual models and in scale from hillslope to global simulation of water fluxes guse et al 2021 refsgaard et al 2022 to reliably predict streamflow under climatic conditions different than those in limited observation records or estimate flows in ungauged locations hydrologic models must accurately represent the basic physical processes most influential in generating streamflow at a specific scale of application duethmann et al 2020 one of the major hurdles facing large scale process based models is the limited quantity of information available to define or inform runoff generation processes and water movement fatichi et al 2016 kirchner 2006 stevenson et al 2021 only in the most intensively monitored research sites i e in small scale catchments are process variables and flowpaths e g transpiration loss or wetland flux rate defined at the daily timescale streamflow records with potentially some low frequency water tracer or point process observations are often all that can be hoped for in model training at the meso scale coulibaly et al 2013 gibson et al 2020 this lack of data poses a major challenge for the reliability of process based models how can the modeler be assured of accuracy at the process level when the only available observations are the final cumulative streamflow can any confidence be placed in the model when innumerable combinations of hydrologic process simulations add up to the same total streamflow and only the total streamflow is verified by the modeler part of the solution is increasing the information available to assess model accuracy both at the internal process level i e hydrologic compartments and summative i e streamflow kirchner 2006 previous research has shown that stable isotope tracer data i e ratios of water molecules containing 18o or 2h to standard water can provide additional information for the evaluation of hydrologic models ala aho et al 2018 2017 he et al 2019 holmes et al 2020 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 stable isotope tracers are particularly useful in remote or inaccessible watersheds as they are non reactive and naturally occurring reducing field work requirements while their variable concentration in precipitation and evaporating water bodies can provide additional information on influential water sources and hydrological processes brooks et al 2018 oshun et al 2016 peralta tapia et al 2015 observational data whether flow or tracer observations can feed into the model development through parameter calibration in process based models which aim to emulate real world hydrologic storage and mass flux some parameter values can be estimated using field measurements or remotely sensed data however there are generally other parameters with limited physical basis for which good or reasonable values are unmeasurable or unknown e g regional average soil conductivity acero triana et al 2019 fatichi et al 2016 these unknown parameter values necessitate calibration where parameter values are selected or adjusted to achieve an acceptable model performance there are two approaches commonly used in the literature trying vast numbers of parameter value combinations generated either at random or using a sampled distribution and using those with the best model performance or using a search algorithm to locate optimal parameter value combinations beven and binley 1992 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 pechlivanidis et al 2011 there are benefits to both approaches generating large numbers of independent solutions allows for much more complex statistical analyses and can ensure coverage of the entire parameter space while search algorithms are much better at identifying good quality solutions i e solutions which match observed data sufficiently at a lower computational cost acero triana et al 2019 pechlivanidis et al 2011 regardless of the approach chosen the calibration depends on quantifying the quality of the simulated model output using some sort of performance metric or set of metrics bennett et al 2013 the quantified model performance can be used to identify best solutions set an acceptable model performance threshold or be used by a search algorithm as an objective performance metrics are not limited to simulated streamflow for example if the hydrologic model is capable of simulating both flow and isotope tracer composition both data types can be used to quantify the model performance quality he et al 2019 nan et al 2021 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 however to date there are no universal guidelines on the best performance metrics for isotope tracer aided model calibration and metric selection has largely been ad hoc or best guess in the tracer aided calibration literature holmes et al 2020 tracers in large scale watersheds are generally irregularly or infrequently sampled which can influence metric selection different metrics vary in their sensitivity to different properties of the data timeseries such as variability or maxima therefore by using a mixture of multiple metrics to evaluate different aspects of the flow data or to simultaneously evaluate both flow and tracer data model evaluation or calibration can be rendered more reliable or comprehensive bennett et al 2013 mizukami et al 2019 for the internal process representation the precision of a simulation depends only on the identifiability of the parameter values provided the model structure and equations are static guse et al 2021 if the calibration process results in a narrow range of values for a given parameter that parameter is well identified and if all parameters influencing a modeled process are well identified the range of flow contributions from the process will be narrow however identifiable parameters do not necessarily lead to parameter or process accuracy they may still not be representative of the real world system the model is intended to emulate guse et al 2020 due to issues such as model structure errors or forcing data uncertainty parameters which consistently produce optimal performance metric values may also be consistently wrong e g over estimating evaporation to compensate for biased precipitation inputs or not including sublimation in the model adding tracer data to the calibration process can improve the accuracy of the internal process representation particularly for soil water storages and improve the identifiability of some parameters he et al 2019 holmes et al 2020 however parameter identifiability may also decrease when calibrating with isotope tracer data as parameter values producing optimal flow simulation results can be contradicted by the second calibration target the tracer simulation holmes et al 2020 effects on flow simulation accuracy and precision are likewise unclear including isotope data in the calibration can decrease flow simulation performance during the calibration period and the flow simulation uncertainty may increase on the other hand flow simulation performance during the validation period may improve when tracer data are included in calibration the value added by isotope tracer data to calibration remains elusive and ill defined as previous studies have either used only mixed flow and isotope data used different calibration methods for flow only and mixed flow and isotope calibration limiting comparability or used a single isotope tracer performance metric with a fixed weight in calibration limiting generalizability this study aims to address two remaining gaps in the isotope aided modeling literature at the large scale quantifying the added value of isotope data relative to current best practice flow only calibration methods and a comparison of the merits and limitations of different isotope simulation performance metrics for the purposes of model calibration in particular we address the following questions does use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration alter parameter identifiability and if so is this change an improvement does use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration lead to different flow simulation results and if so is this change an improvement can a tracer performance metric be recommended to maximize the benefits of simulating isotope tracers in model calibrations our study is conducted in the oil sands region of alberta within the athabasca river basin this region was chosen because there exists one of the longest large river isotope sampling programs in canada the watershed contains several hydrometric gauges for calibration of both tributaries and mainstem and because it is a high latitude drainage system representative of cold regions seasonal hydrology permitting an evaluation of snow and glacier melt 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic model and study area 2 1 1 the charm isowatflood model assessing parameter identifiability and change in flow simulation performance resulting from the inclusion of stable isotope tracers in model calibration requires an isotope enabled hydrologic model this study uses the charm watflood hydrologic model and isowatflood the isotope simulation module both charm and isowatflood are open source models that use a combination of conceptual and physics based hydrologic process representations for relatively computational efficient distributed modeling of meso and large scale watersheds kouwen 2018 the isowatflood dual isotope tracer model simulates oxygen 18 and deuterium compositions for all water storages and fluxes in the base charm model with the assumptions that all non evaporative fluxes have the same concentration as the originating simulated storage and that hydrologic storages are completely mixed through depth holmes 2016 stadnyk et al 2013 stadnyk and holmes 2020 the linked hydrologic and isotope tracer simulations both output daily results by default but the internal simulation runs at an hourly time step the charm watflood model structure divides the watershed domain into grid cells with defined drainage directions and then subdivides each cell into grouped response units or gru with the area of each gru generally determined from landcover data as shown in fig 1 the default structure of a gru used for most types of landcover such as forests grass or shrubland has a vertical soil column divided into two soil layers the upper and lower soil zones both of which contribute lateral flow to the channel network surface water from snowmelt or rain can either infiltrate vertically or runoff directly to the channel network evapotranspiration is only modeled for wetlands and water in upper soil storages the evaporation component is fractionating and the isotopic composition of the evaporate is modeled using equations from gibson et al 2016a 2008 snowpacks melt and accumulate independently for each gru and soils freeze and thaw based on air temperature with reduced conductivity in frozen soil permafrost is not modeled there are four special gru classes without soil layers glacier impervious connected wetland and water or channel in the glacier and impervious classes all rain and snowmelt becomes direct runoff and glacier gru also generate glacier melt flows connected wetlands fens or riparian zones where present accumulate all lateral outflows from the land and soil and have a bi directional connectivity with stream channels wetland areas disconnected from the channel network are treated as a default gru the water or channel gru is the end point for all flows generated within the grid cell and it is the only gru connected to other cells with inflows from upstream cells and an outflow downstream more detailed descriptions of process representation and equations can be found in holmes 2016 and holmes et al 2022 all modeled processes have parameters controlling the simulated flux and storage with the values of these parameters being either consistent across all gru or separate gru having individual parameter values representing landcover or soil specific hydrologic response there is a very large number of parameters over 300 for the athabasca basin model which can be set for a charm isowatflood model but only a minority truly benefit from calibration the values of most parameters are best determined from previously published studies and simulations are largely insensitive to their value this study will calibrate only the most sensitive highest priority parameters based on model developer recommendations and previous isowatflood calibration studies including holmes et al 2020 and stadnyk and holmes 2020 listed in table 1 2 1 2 athabasca watershed the athabasca river runs north east from the rocky mountains toward the peace athabasca delta and lake athabasca and has a total watershed area of 156 000 km2 in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan on treaty 6 and 8 land fig 2 hydrometric gauge details provided in table s1 soils in the athabasca basin are predominately loam with more clay in the middle of the basin and sandier soil in and around the athabasca oil sands region in the downstream alberta geological survey 2013 shangguan et al 2014 regional groundwater flows contribute 5 or less of the flow of the athabasca river and its tributaries there are still small areas of actively degrading permafrost gibson et al 2016b vitt et al 2000 the largest tributaries in the south of the athabasca basin are the pembina mcleod and lesser slave rivers the clearwater firebag and mackay rivers are the largest tributaries in the downstream portion of the basin temperatures in the athabasca basin vary widely with a monthly average temperature difference of 36 c over the course of a year and average temperatures below freezing for 5 months of the year environment and climate change canada 2020 the basin receives 270 mm of rainfall and 180 cm of snowfall in an average year but there is substantial spatial and interannual variability in precipitation environment and climate change canada 2020 the flow of the athabasca river is not regulated either for flood control or hydroelectric generation but water is diverted for agricultural use and industrial uses in the oil sands rosa et al 2017 the charm model used in this study discretizes the athabasca river basin area firstly with a 0 4 longitude by 0 2 latitude grid and the resulting cells are further divided into 10 different grouped response unit types with areas determined from land cover data from the esa european space agency 2017 the overall prevalence of the gru types in the watershed model and their modeled structures as described in 2 1 1 are listed in table 2 2 1 3 forcing and evaluation data 2 1 3 1 meteorological data the coupled isotope hydrologic models were run using forcings based on observations at 56 environment and climate change canada eccc weather gauges in the watershed and surounding area environment and climate change canada 2020 forcing data in individual grid cells were interpolated at an hourly time step for humidity and air temperature and at a daily time step for accumulated daily precipitation all gauges with observation data for the relevant time interval were included in the inverse distance squared weighting estimate and lapse rates of 0 2 mm km and 5 c km were applied for precipitation and temperature estimates respectively kouwen 2018 minder et al 2010 the isotope tracer model also requires isotopic compositions of precipitation to run due to the scarcity and consistency of observations for isotopes in precipitation these compositions were generated from an empirical model for this study average monthly isotopic compositions of precipitation were estimated from local climate and geographic data based on geostatistical regressed equations originating from delavau et al 2015 and adapted by holmes 2016 to incorporate deuterium the delavau et al 2015 model has been applied successfully in several previous studies gibson et al 2021 holmes et al 2020 2022 stadnyk and holmes 2020 with model input uncertainties derived from the empirically modelled isotopes in precipitation signatures generally being smaller than the reported uncertainty bounds from model structure and parameter selection it is noted that the use of an empirical model particularly one at a monthly timestep comes with limitations and assumptions the impact of model forcing on isowatflood isotope streamflow smulation including the isop model was investigated by delavau et al 2017 and reports well constrained input forcing uncertainty in all seasons except for the spring freshet where flow source variability was the highest i e snowmelt and large rain events and isotopic compositions are more variable within a monthly timestep 2 1 3 2 flow and isotope data simulated model outputs were compared to historical hydrometric data from the water survey of canada environment and climate change canada 2018 from a total of 20 continuous or seasonal i e continuous only during the open water season flow gauges with daily data between 2002 and 2015 the 10 gauges with the highest quality i e most complete data series were used to calibrate the model and the remaining 10 were used for validation see fig 2 for spatial distribution and the supplement for detailed gauge information gauged areas for the athabasca and its tributaries range between 1000 and 137 500 km2 streamflow data have an estimated uncertainty of approximately 10 with higher uncertainty expected during peak flow and ice on periods kiang et al 2018 westerberg et al 2020 in addition to the wsc flow data the alberta environmental monitoring evaluation and reporting agency s long term river network monitoring program collected stable isotope tracer data at hydrometric gauges in the athabasca watershed between 2002 and 2014 gibson et al 2016b water samples for isotope tracer analyses were analyzed using either a micromass isoprime dual inlet gas chromatograph university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory pre 2009 or a thermo scientific delta v advangage dual inlet hdevice system alberta innovates technology futures victoria 2009 and later gibson et al 2016b both machines have estimated analytical uncertainties of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 1 for deuterium and all results are reported relative to vsmow gibson et al 2016b to prevent post collection isotopic fractionation water samples were sealed in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and analyzed within one year of sample collection gibson et al 2019 spangenberg 2012 2 2 model calibration methods assessing the value added by isotope data to model calibration relative to current best practice flow only calibration requires the application of a multi stage calibration workflow completed both with and without stable isotope tracer data the overall methodology is outlined in the flow chart in fig 3 and details are covered in the following sections two separate assessments of parameter identifiability were performed the first was a monte carlo style evaluation based on a large number of randomly generated parameter sets which has the advantages of independent sampling and limited user decisions sections 3 1 and 3 2 the second was a set of optimizations using current recommended methods assessing parameter sensitivities selecting useful metrics running multi objective optimizations and selecting behavioral parameter sets that produces higher quality solutions but also depends on a series of user choices sections 3 3 and 3 4 2 2 1 model performance metrics a variety of metrics were evaluated as potential calibration objectives selected based on the most commonly applied metrics from the literature metrics vary in their responsiveness to different types of simulation error such as timing or volume bias and likewise in their parameter sensitivities holmes et al 2022 in calculating all performance metrics only simulated data on days that have flow or isotope observations are considered the normalized root mean square error metric a simple residual error metric primarily focused on timing and bias error was evaluated as a calibration objective for both the isotope and flow simulations 1 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x s i x o i 2 x o where x o i is observation i x s i is the corresponding simulated value x o is the mean value of all observations and n is the number of observations the kling gupta efficiency k g e metric balanced between bias variability and timing error was likewise evaluated as a calibration objective for both the isotope and flow simulations as were its constituent components the bias β the relative variability α and the correlation r gupta et al 2009 2 r i 1 n x o i x o x s i x s i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x s i x s 2 3 α σ s σ o 4 β x s x o 5 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where x s is the mean value of all simulated values with corresponding observations and σ o and σ s are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated data a selection of flow signature metrics which do not include simulating timing error were considered as potential calibration objectives for the isotope and flow simulations the error in the slope of the flow duration curve s f d c for flows or the slope of the duration curve s d c for isotopes and the high and low flow signatures at the 5 and 95 exceedance probabilities viglione et al 2013 6 sfdc or sdc 100 x s 30 x s 70 40 x s x o 30 x o 70 40 x o 7 q 5 x o 5 x s 5 x o 5 8 q 95 x o 95 x s 95 x o 95 where x5 x30 x70 and x95 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 5 30 70 and 95 the previously described relative variability and bias metrics are also flow signatures shafii and tolson 2015 an additional signature metric for the isotope simulation exclusively was included in the comparison of potential calibration objectives the error in the simulated slope of the local mixing line lml the lml slope error which relies on the simulation of both isotopes and focuses on simulation variability error measures the mismatch between the simulated lml slope and the observed lml slope and like the above flow signature metrics does not include timing error stadnyk and holmes 2020 9 lmlme i 1 n o s i o s d s i d s i 1 n o s i o s 2 i 1 n o o i o o d o i d o i 1 n o o i o o 2 where o o i is oxygen 18 observation and o s i is the corresponding simulated oxygen 18 value and d o i and d s i are the observed and simulated values for deuterium finally two metrics were evaluated as potential calibration objectives for only the flow simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the log transform version of nse were calculated exclusively for the flow simulation nash and sutcliffe 1970 these traditional metrics are included due to their long standing use in hydrologic model evaluations n s e is highly affected by large residuals during high flows while l o g n s e is relatively affected by smaller residuals during low flows 10 nse 1 i 1 n x s i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 11 lognse 1 i 1 n l o g x s i l o g x o i 2 i 1 n l o g x o i l o g x o 2 in addition to individual simulation metrics which can potentially be used as calibration objectives there are also ensemble performance metrics quantifying the performance of groups of simulations e g the outcome of multi objective calibration in this study ensemble performance is assessed using two indices to quantify the two key components of ensemble quality the containment ratio and the relative band width the containment ratio quantifies the ensemble accuracy and is simply the ratio of observations contained within the ensemble upper and lower bounds to the total number observations xiong et al 2009 the average relative band width quantifies ensemble precision and is calculated as xiong et al 2009 12 rb i 1 n x s i u x s i l x o i n where n is number of observations x o i is observation i x s i u is the maximum corresponding simulated value from the ensemble i e the upper simulated bound and x s i l is the minimum corresponding simulated value from the ensemble i e the lower simulated bound 2 2 2 parameter sensitivity and metric selection parameter sensitivities for the various performance metrics are evaluated to design informed calibration strategies utilizing isotope tracer data the best method to analyze sensitivity to this end is a global analysis rather than local which evaluates parameter sensitivity over the entire specified parameter space song et al 2015 this study uses vars a global sensitivity approach which uses variograms to quantify global parameter sensitivity razavi and gupta 2016 vars which is implemented in the vars tool software package was selected for the sensitivity analysis over older alternative approaches due its relative computational efficiency which is a key consideration in applying a global analysis to highly parameterized models with longer run times razavi et al 2019 the vars tool software v2 matlab version was used to generate 48 800 sampled parameter sets and the recommended ivars50 sensitivity index was used along with bootstrapped 90 confidence intervals sampling specifics can be found in table s2 in the supplement razavi and gupta 2016 the parameter sensitivity results presented in this study have been normalized using the total sensitivity of a given metric to simplify comparisons of potential calibration objectives the averaged performance for all 10 flow and 17 isotope simulation performance metrics described in 2 2 1 at all 10 calibration sites was used as the response variable in the parameter sensitivity analysis the resulting parameter sensitivity values are used to select possible metrics for the multi objective optimization section 2 2 4 in calibrating a hydrologic model the aim is to identify good values for all calibrated parameters in order to identify a good value it is necessary that the calibration objective changes in response to changes in the value of that parameter if the objective metric is unresponsive to changes in the value of a parameter an optimization algorithm cannot distinguish between good and bad values for that parameter and it will remain uncalibrated parameter sensitivity data are quantifications of this responsiveness insensitive parameters will not be successfully calibrated to maximize the number of parameters which might potentially be calibrated metric combinations minimizing insensitive parameters are preferred the following rules were applied to quantify and rank the sensitivity coverage of performance metrics to select candidate metrics for this study in a more objective and reproducible manner 1 metrics for flow and isotope data separately are ranked from most types of error covered e g timing variability or bias errors as categorized in holmes et al 2022 to least 2 parameter sensitivities are classified as highly sensitive over 10 of total sensitivity bootstrapped sensitivity uncertainty less than 10 of total sensitivity likely sensitive over 3 of total sensitivity sensitivity uncertainty less than 25 possibly sensitive over 1 of total sensitivity and insensitive i e no detected sensitivity less than 1 of total sensitivity 3 the metric with the most broadly distributed sensitivity i e highest number of parameters which are at least possibly sensitive is selected as the primary candidate metric when using mixed data types the flow metric is primary 4 when searching for second candidate metric the metric increasing the sensitivity i e higher classification based on step 2 for the most parameters from the primary candidate base is selected 5 in cases of a tie i e equal numbers of sensitive parameters the metric covering the most types of error from step 1 is chosen seven different combinations of data types are used to select candidate metric pairs flow only isotope only oxygen 18 only deuterium only flow and oxygen 18 flow and deuterium and flow and both isotope tracers 2 2 3 monte carlo analysis exploring the relationship between parameter values and model performance requires sampling the full range of all parameters and running the hydrologic simulation with each parameter set to generate simulation results for this study a monte carlo analysis is performed where all 27 calibrated parameters are sampled across their entire calibration range using a uniform random distribution a total of 100 000 random parameter sets are generated and run in the isowatflood model of the athabasca basin the simulation performance for the resulting flow and tracer outputs was quantified using performance metrics section 2 2 1 and averaged for calibration sites the monte carlo results are used to assess the parameter identifiability for each performance metric independently by selecting the best 0 1 solutions for each metric and finding the distribution i e range median and interquartile range of parameter values for those 100 simulations parameter values are classified as very well identified if the total range of calibrated parameter values is less than 5 of the calibration range and the interquartile range iqr is less than 2 well identified if the range is less than 10 and iqr less than 5 identified if either the range is less than 20 or the iqr than 10 and somewhat identified either the range is less than 50 or the iqr is less than 25 the key benefit of the monte carlo analysis is that parameter sets and therefore simulation results are completely independent of each other permitting robust statistical treatment of the results monte carlo simulations have also been widely used to calibrate models with mixed flow and isotope data in previous studies delavau et al 2017 neill et al 2019 piovano et al 2020 however using randomly generated parameter sets is computationally inefficient requiring vast numbers of independent simulations and the best performing simulations have a very low likelihood of matching the quality of solutions produced by an optimization algorithm efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 2 2 4 multi objective optimization the current best practice for hydrologic model calibration is the use of optimization algorithms particularly multi objective automated search algorithms an optimization algorithm may start from a random point in the parameter space or from a specified initial solution but rather than continuing to generate random solutions it will search the adjacent region of the parameter space for better solutions the algorithm judges solutions as better or worse based on the value of the objective function or objective functions for multi objective algorithms the selection of an objective is therefore a key decision in model calibration that warrants further investigation this study uses the pa dds pareto archiving dynamically dimensioned search algorithm for multi objective model calibration following the results in holmes et al 2020 based on the dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 the pa dds algorithm is a computationally efficient search method where the search space is gradually constrained as the algorithm completes iterations but with the additional ability to retain an archive of solutions which are not dominated i e all solutions which are not categorically outperformed considering multiple objectives asadzadeh et al 2014 asadzadeh and tolson 2013 model calibrations were performed using the ostrich program v17 12 19 a model independent calibration tool that implements the pa dds algorithm among others matott 2017 for each set of candidate objectives five separate calibration trials were run with different random seeds the method for choosing performance metrics as possible candidates is covered in 2 2 2 each trial ran for 1000 iterations and all non dominated solutions from each of the five trials were retained in the initial results analyses section 3 3 the five trials for each candidate performance metric pair shared initial solutions non dominated solutions for the candidate metrics were selected from the monte carlo results as better quality initial solutions can reduce the computational budget required for optimization while pa dds is not limited to two objectives this study is limited to paired objectives as increasing the number of objectives generally increases the computational requirements asadzadeh et al 2014 calibrations using an optimization algorithm generally have better simulation performance than those using random parameter sets in a monte carlo analysis and using multi objective optimization generates a substantial number of parameter sets producing good flow or tracer simulations efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 however the solutions from a particular trial are not fully independent of each other as the algorithm generates new solutions from progressive modifications of previous ones which limits or complicates the statistical treatment of the results 3 results 3 1 monte carlo parameter identifiability the best 100 solutions from the 100 000 randomly generated parameter sets run in the monte carlo analysis are selected for each flow and isotope performance metric independently box whisker plots of all parameters normalized to the calibration range and all assessed metrics are shown in fig 4 mean range and iqr values for all parameters and metrics are shown in tables s6 to s8 overall there is limited identifiability for most parameters most boxplots exceed 50 of the calibration range i e parameter values are unidentifiable categorized parameter identifiability from the monte carlo analysis is shown in table s9 parameter values for melt rates for coniferous forest and barren ground the baseflow power and the baseflow coefficient in the mountains are identifiable when calibrating to some metrics most parameters have some relationship with at least one performance metric where the parameter values for the 100 selected solutions are either limited to or skewed towards only part of the total calibration range for example the distribution of values for the horizontal conductivity factor k f horz is skewed for the majority of performance metrics although it is only somewhat identifiable for a single metric kge h and the parameter value range is somewhat identified for the wetland porosity parameter for q correlation and h bias only the surface soil conductivity parameter and the downstream channel roughness k f surf and n ds are completely unidentifiable maintaining a uniform distribution of parameter values across the entire possible parameter range generally flow and isotope performance metrics are aligned in either identifying or not identifying parameter values but not in all cases for example the flow and oxygen 18 performance metrics identify opposite ends of the possible parameter value range for the soil water retention capacities for coniferous and mix forest while intriguing the monte carlo results do not identify parameter values well and are inconclusive on the utility of isotope data for improving parameter identifiability the parameter space with 27 interacting calibrated parameters is both large and complex and even the best simulations produced were of mediocre quality e g best flow kge range between 0 48 and 0 52 3 2 parameter sensitivity and candidate objective metric selection a vars global sensitivity analysis was performed for all evaluated performance metrics independently using average performance at calibration sites as the response variable the normalized sensitivities and sensitivity reliabilities are shown in fig 5 a few parameters are consistently insensitive across all evaluated metrics namely the surface soil conductivity i e kf surf and connected wetland snowmelt rate i e melt fen but generally parameters are sensitive for some metrics and not others both flow and isotope metrics are sensitive to some snowmelt and baseflow parameters isotope performance metrics are more sensitive to upper zone soil retention parameters in dominant land classes relative to the flow performance metrics but these sensitivities are not generally reliable likewise flow metrics are more sensitive to wetland and glacier parameters but not always reliably the lml slope error and the oxygen 18 kge and sdc standout for their balanced sensitivities with nearly equal shares of the total sensitivity for each individual parameter sensitive parameters are likely to be at least somewhat identifiable based on the monte carlo identifiability results in fig 4 table s3 provides correlation metrics between monte carlo iqr and vars sensitivity but with too many anomalies to make either analysis type a strong predictor of the other the melt rate for coniferous forest is both sensitive and identifiable using flow performance metrics but glacier melt is sensitive and generally poorly identified with the same metrics unidentifiable parameters match with consistently to the insensitive ones yet isotope metrics are better at identifying baseflow coefficients in the upstream and worse at identifying the same coefficient in the downstream c ds than would be predicted based on the parameter sensitivities the data presented in fig 5 are the basis of the metric candidate identification process where performance metric pairs providing the widest parameter sensitivity coverage following the quantitative criteria in 2 2 2 are selected for use in multi objective calibration the categorized parameter sensitivity coverage for all individual metrics and the candidate paired performance metrics is shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively in the supplementary data candidate pairs were selected when considering only flow metrics flow and isotope metrics and only isotope metrics see section 2 2 2 for the selection rules one additional candidate pair was added as the nrmse for isotope simulation performance is too commonly used to be overlooked in this analysis overall there is limited differences in the categorized parameter sensitivity coverage between the eight different candidate calibration metric pairs by maximizing the number of sensitive parameters within the data constraints the resulting coverage is similar with most parameters being somewhat sensitive i e not insensitive to at least one of the paired metrics the lower zone wetland and channel parameters have similar sensitivity for all candidate pairs and there is more variation between candidates for upper zone melt and evaporation parameter sensitivities 3 3 multi objective optimization each candidate pair of performance metrics were used as objectives in five independent multi objective calibration trials using the non dominated solutions for that candidate pair from the monte carlo analysis as initial solutions the outcomes of these 40 calibration trials are shown in fig 6 along with the initial solutions simulation performance after calibration is substantially improved compared to the initial random solutions e g most solutions with kge q as an objective now have kge q exceeding 0 5 fig 6 is not strictly a trade off front as neither kge q nor nrmse 18o are objectives for all calibrations but it still clearly demonstrates the cost of calibrating with an isotope tracer objective the best flow simulation performance x axis does not achieve the best isotope tracer y axis simulation performance if equivalent weight is given to isotope and flow performance the flow simulation performance in calibration will be lower than if flow performance is considered alone however considering the uncertainty in performance metric values a decrease in calibration kge q of 0 03 the difference between maximizing flow performance and giving equal weight to flow and isotope performance is not particularly serious the two isotope tracers are similar but not identical e g when kge 2h is an objective the calibration performance does not quite overlap with solutions found with kge 18o as an objective on the other hand using nrmse 18o or kge 18o as objectives produces equivalent calibration performances there is a clear segregation of objective pair types the flow only pair has the best flow performance the isotope only pairs have the best isotope simulation performance and the mixed flow isotope pairs fall between the other two with some overlap the difference between the best flow performance for the flow only and mixed flow isotope calibrations is negligible 0 586 vs 0 583 kge q the isotope only calibrations do not generally produce good flow simulations with a mean and median flow kge of 0 28 flow simulations are of similar quality to those from random parameter sets in the monte carlo analysis mean and median kge 0 20 and 0 21 isotope only calibrations only outperformed random solutions in avoiding very poor flow simulations with a minimum flow kge of 0 05 compared to 0 27 from the monte carlo analysis to assess the effect of using isotope tracer data in calibration on identified parameter values the relationships between flow and isotope simulations performance and calibrated parameter values for several key parameters are illustrated in fig 7 with other parameters in the supplementary material s1 s4 three outlier solutions with nrmse 18o greater than 0 5 are not shown due to space constraints these highly influential parameters generally have identified parameter values or correlated simulation performance and parameter values some are identified by both flow and isotope results i e kf the horizontal and vertical soil conductivity but others are better identified by either the flow i e coniferous forest soil retention or the isotope performance i e the evaporation adjustment factor with parameter values only consistent for the best performing simulations of one type the final step in the calibration process is the selection of acceptable solutions from the total output of the 40 non dominated pareto solution produced by the multi objective optimization algorithm as the flow simulation is the primary model output of interest for a hydrologic model only solutions with calibration kge q greater than 0 5 will be considered behavioral this threshold entirely removes isotope only calibrations from further consideration as no behavioral solutions were produced by calibrating to isotope tracer performance alone the average flow simulation at validation sites for behavioral solutions is shown in fig 8 along with the calibration performance as is typical for hydrologic models the validation performance decreases relative to calibration performance with average kge q exceeding 0 5 for calibration sites and ranging between 0 26 and 0 42 for validation sites the best validation flow simulation performance for behavioral solutions is best predicted by the isotope simulation performance in calibration not the flow simulation performance in calibration the best validation kge q are for solutions with low nrmse 18o and the worst are for solutions with higher nrmse 18o behavioral solutions from the calibrated parameter sets have better parameter identifiability than the best solutions from random parameter sets however solutions generated from the same pa dds multi objective calibration trial are not truly independent which limits the comparability to the monte carlo results the five trials per candidate objective pair are independent rather than all parameter sets to evaluate the effect of using isotope tracer data in calibration on parameter identifiability for moo the normalized parameter values from all behavioral solutions for all parameters are shown in the histograms in fig 9 mean range and iqr values for these distributions are shown in tables s10to s12 the majority of parameters have at least somewhat identified values and a few are well identified e g coniferous forest snowmelt rate and the baseflow coefficient in the upstream region soil retention soil conductivity wetland parameters and the evaporation adjustment factor are identified or somewhat identified for most objective pairs all five candidate objective pairs have broadly similar identifiable and unidentifiable parameters and usually agree on approximately the same parameter values the two oxygen 18 calibrations using kge 18o and nrmse 18o as secondary objectives have extremely similar parameter values and parameter identifiability and the calibration using kge 2h as the second objective is similar to both oxygen 18 calibrations except for the glacier melt factor the flow only calibration and the calibration using the lml slope error as the second objective diverge from the other calibrations for some parameters as an example the three pairs using an isotope metric including timing error all converge on a low value of wetland porosity but lml slope error calibration tends toward a high porosity value and the flow only calibration does not identify a value for porosity it is noted however that using isotope data in calibration does not consistently improve parameter identifiability e g the evaporation factor and wetland porosity are better identified but mixed wood upper zone soil water retention has a less identifiable parameter value 3 4 calibrated ensemble performance the final stage of evaluating calibration effectiveness and changes in flow simulation results from the use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration is the assessment of the ensemble performance all behavioral solutions from the five pa dds calibration trials for each candidate objective pair were included with equal weight in an ensemble of parameter sets such that simulation uncertainty resulting from parameter selection can be identified total numbers of members are listed in table 3 the average annual hydrographs for the three most divergent ensembles of behavioral solutions are shown in fig 10 at the athabasca river at fort mcmurray which covers most of the modeled area other hydrographs shown in figure s5 in the supplementary material parameter identifiability does not decisively improve when isotope data are included in calibration but the resulting ensembles produce distinctive component contributions to streamflow mixed flow isotope calibrations have similar uncertainty for total flow to a flow only calibration with slightly improved observation containment at this downstream gauge on the other hand the isotope enabled calibration ensembles have substantially higher confidence in the component contributions generating the total flow e g the range of contributions from the upper soil zone for isotope enabled calibrations is less than half that of the flow only calibrations the percent contributions from the upper and lower soil zones are listed in table 3 along with the range in percent contributions the ensemble containment ratios and relative bounds average contributions from the two soil zones are consistent for all calibrated ensembles but the ranges in those contributions are substantially different all mixed flow isotope calibrated ensembles have much lower maximum upper zone contributions and much higher minimum lower zone contributions than the flow only ensemble this improvement in flow component identifiability is linked to improvements in process flux identifiability for soils see figure s6 in the supplement median and inter quartile ranges for soil fluxes are similar for all calibration objective pairs but the flow only calibration has substantially longer tails i e higher uncertainty than mixed isotope flow calibrations similarity in the total flow uncertainty and the improvement in the ensemble observation containment is also supported quantitatively across all gauge sites the three mixed flow isotope calibrations using an isotope performance metric that includes timing errors all have better containment ratios than the flow only calibration at both calibration and validation gauges and these improvements in the mean containment ratio are statistically significant there is no significant change in the relative band width for the ensembles calibrated with flow and oxygen 18 data the ensemble calibrated with kge q and kge 2h has wider relative bounds the final flow isotope calibrated ensemble calibrated to maximize kge q and minimize lml slope error has significantly narrower relative band width but a lower containment ratio than the flow only calibration 4 discussion 4 1 parameter identifiability overall parameter values were not well identified regardless of methodology metric or data type with a few exceptions the small number of well identified parameter values is unsurprising given the model complexity number of calibrated parameters and large and heterogeneous study area the best identified parameters for both flow and isotope data were the baseflow parameters which had generally constrained values regardless of the assessment method that baseflow is the best identified process is entirely unsurprising as the majority of total streamflow is routed through the lower soil zone as baseflow and the process is controlled by a limited number of parameters the snow melt rate parameter for coniferous forest the dominant land class was well identified by most flow metrics including kge q but was not well identified by isotope tracer metrics on the other hand the pet factor is substantially better identified by isotope tracer metrics than flow metrics alone in some cases parameter values may be best identified by a combination of flow and isotope tracer simulation performance the values of horizontal soil conductivity and wetland porosity are most constrained when both flow and isotopes are optimized isotope and flow data only identified different values for the same parameter for upper zone soil water retentions with the best flow performance associated with very high retention and the best isotope performance associated with low retention it is entirely possible to have isotope simulation performance of approximately similar quality with either low or high retention but if flow simulation performance is not considered in parameter value selection lower retention values are identified altogether isotope tracer data whether δ2h or δ18o does not lead to dramatic alterations in parameter identifiability but the limited changes do tend to be improvements with so many interacting parameters within the isowatflood model individual parameter identifiability is weak even with additional tracer data a simpler more conceptual model than isowatflood would have more identifiable parameter values it is also important to note that the choice of parameter value limits for calibration can impact parameter identifiability when identifiability is defined in terms of the potential parameter value range as was done in this study excessively wide limits can artificially increase identifiability while overly restricted limits on parameter values either mask identifiability limits overlap optimal parameter values or overestimate identifiability optimal values fall outside limits this study has relied on developer recommendations for limiting parameter values in calibration and the shortage of identifiability from the monte carlo results suggest that parameter limits were not excessively broad but the tendency for well identified parameter values to approach either the upper or lower bound in the moo results suggests that some optimal parameter values lie outside the specified limit these parameters may be less identifiable than categorized based on range and iqr relative to total potential parameter range however if the optimization can push parameter values to the limit the parameter is not unidentifiable the addition of isotope performance to the calibration was more adept at constraining the overall process contributions to streamflow fig 10 than identifying parameter values the use of isotope tracer data as a calibration objective avoided many outlying flux simulations and flow component combinations that were included by calibrations using only flow data it is not unexpected that fluxes are better constrained than parameter values in models with large numbers of interacting processes and parameters given parameter identifiability is typically desired as a proxy for process identifiability it is preferable to have better process identification without better parameter value identification than the reverse 4 2 simulation performance both flow only and mixed isotope flow multi objective calibrations resulted in numerous acceptable flow simulations i e kge q greater than 0 5 in calibration while calibrating to isotope data alone did not for predictions in ungauged basins pub should a basin have sparse isotope data using these as a lone calibration objective may still be a better alternative than purely random parameter value selection within general recommended ranges as isotope tracers may rule out some of the least accurate flow simulations that said caution should be used when interpreting any long term model simulations as this study demonstrates that isotopes alone are clearly not a reliable substitute for hydrometric data pa dds calibrated solutions using kge q as an objective revealed flow simulations that outperform any randomly generated parameter set while the isotope only calibrations result in flow simulation performance similar to the random solutions from the monte carlo analysis the monte carlo analysis was an inefficient method of identifying behavioral parameter sets for both flow and isotope tracer simulations numerous higher quality solutions were identified using multi objective calibration using 1 of the computational budget of the monte carlo analysis the mixed isotope flow multi objective calibrations resulted in solutions with similar flow simulation performance and better isotope tracer simulation performance compared to the flow only calibration the differences between isotope enabled and flow only calibrations in flow simulation performance for calibration gauges was negligible and validation performance improved when isotope simulation performance was included as a calibration objective considered as ensembles the mixed isotope flow calibrations generally outperform the flow only calibration with better observation containment for calibrations when an isotope performance metric which include timing error is used as the second objective and similar relative bounds on isotope enabled calibrated ensembles the sub component ensembles benefited most from the inclusion of isotope tracer data in the calibration with substantially narrower more precise ranges the addition of either oxygen 18 or deuterium data excludes process contribution combinations that lead to acceptable total streamflow simulations the increased confidence in the flow sub component contributions may be a contributing factor in the positive correlation between isotope simulation performance in calibration and flow simulation validation performance this study has found a similar interrelationship between isotope tracer performance and flow simulation performance in validation to previous work with the isowatflood model but in a different watershed and using a different calibration methodology stadnyk and holmes 2020 overall isotope tracer data are beneficial to the flow simulation adding isotope tracer data to the calibration leads to flow simulations comparable or better than simulations calibrated with flow data alone 4 3 calibration recommendations isotope tracer simulations and observation data have demonstrable value as a supplement to hydrometric data in process based hydrologic model calibration if possible calibration using an isotope simulation performance metric as a secondary objective in a multi objective optimization is recommended results of this study indicate that mixed isotope flow calibrations result in better streamflow simulation and improved identifiability of streamflow sub component simulation than flow only calibrations monte carlo simulations are not well suited to identifying parameter values in large scale process based models or for tracer aided calibrations in such models process based models typically have large numbers of parameters to calibrate and the interactions between these parameters have complex effects on simulation outcomes exploring the parameter space of such models as a monte carlo analysis aims to is computationally onerous particularly for large scale models with significant run times and does not produce better calibration outcomes than multi objective optimization it is important that the isotope performance metric includes timing error for the isotope tracer simulation neither kge nor nrmse has a decisive advantage over the other as a calibration objective for tracer simulation this study found no reason not to use nrmse to compare isotope simulation quality as it was equivalent to using kge for improving isotope and flow model performance using kge to quantify tracer simulation performance has the advantage of aligning with a common flow performance metric but the metric is more vulnerable to sampling gaps or biases than nrmse the variability component of the kge metric is particularly unreliable when sampling programs do not include seasons e g no winter sample collection or have disproportionate numbers of samples in some periods e g intensive summer sample collection for a student research project previous research found no benefit from calibrating kge for both isotope tracers simultaneously as the oxygen 18 and deuterium simulations are correlated and contain roughly the same information for calibration holmes et al 2020 the results of this study show no decisive differences between calibrations using oxygen 18 and calibrations using deuterium both isotopes improved ensemble and validation performance increased confidence in flow component simulations and neither lead to substantial change in parameter identifiability the choice between stable isotope tracers i e oxygen 18 or deuterium is dependant on the model or the data available in this study oxygen 18 is preferrable as it can be simulated independently the current isowatflood model code is limited to either oxygen 18 or both isotopes simultaneously which may not be the case for other modeling packages in summary 1 use an isotope tracer performance metric as a second objective in multi objective optimizations of process based hydrologic models 2 choose an isotope tracer simulation performance metric that includes timing error o consider kge for consistently sampled isotope data sets o use nrmse for irregularly sampled isotope data sets 5 conclusions isotope tracer simulations and specifically calibrations including tracer model performance optimization are beneficial for both process representation and streamflow simulations these benefits including better ensemble observation containment higher validation performance scores for flow simulations and improved process contribution identification can be realized even in mesoscale watersheds and with limited isotope observation datasets flow data should remain the primary focus of hydrologic model calibration but using an isotope simulation performance metric which includes timing error as a secondary calibration objective leads to more robust streamflow modeling credit authorship contribution statement tegan l holmes conceptualization methodology software

1884,standard hydrologic model evaluation and calibration approaches focus on the accurate simulation of streamflow disregarding internal process simulations stable isotope tracers can provide additional information on water sources and process flux and storage which can be used to inform model calibration this study assesses the added value of isotope data in comparison to current best practice flow only calibration methods and evaluates the merits and limitations of isotope simulation performance metrics for the purposes of hydrological model calibration following several years of regular isotope sampling and measurement an isotope enabled process based hydrologic model was tested on a large watershed in western canada athabasca river which allowed model calibration using global sensitivity analyses monte carlo simulations and multi objective optimizations isotope tracer data were found to improve both process and streamflow component identifiability and produced some minor improvement in individual parameter value identifiability calibrating to optimize both flow and isotope simulation performance produced better flow simulation ensembles with improved observation capture and validation performance relative to calibrating to optimize flow simulations alone using an isotope simulation performance metric which includes timing error as a secondary optimization

hydrologic model calibration with isotope tracers mendeley data v1 https data mendeley com datasets h5p6mgych7 1 1 introduction hydrologic models are essential tools for hydrologists used to predict runoff or streamflow in both short term forecasting and long term climate change projection applications however the purpose or application of hydrologic models vary from overall basin water balance estimates to predicting flood volumes or for the investigation of flow generation processes such as baseflow in regional groundwater impact studies among other applications clark et al 2017 likewise hydrologic models vary in structure and complexity from fully physically based models to conceptual models and in scale from hillslope to global simulation of water fluxes guse et al 2021 refsgaard et al 2022 to reliably predict streamflow under climatic conditions different than those in limited observation records or estimate flows in ungauged locations hydrologic models must accurately represent the basic physical processes most influential in generating streamflow at a specific scale of application duethmann et al 2020 one of the major hurdles facing large scale process based models is the limited quantity of information available to define or inform runoff generation processes and water movement fatichi et al 2016 kirchner 2006 stevenson et al 2021 only in the most intensively monitored research sites i e in small scale catchments are process variables and flowpaths e g transpiration loss or wetland flux rate defined at the daily timescale streamflow records with potentially some low frequency water tracer or point process observations are often all that can be hoped for in model training at the meso scale coulibaly et al 2013 gibson et al 2020 this lack of data poses a major challenge for the reliability of process based models how can the modeler be assured of accuracy at the process level when the only available observations are the final cumulative streamflow can any confidence be placed in the model when innumerable combinations of hydrologic process simulations add up to the same total streamflow and only the total streamflow is verified by the modeler part of the solution is increasing the information available to assess model accuracy both at the internal process level i e hydrologic compartments and summative i e streamflow kirchner 2006 previous research has shown that stable isotope tracer data i e ratios of water molecules containing 18o or 2h to standard water can provide additional information for the evaluation of hydrologic models ala aho et al 2018 2017 he et al 2019 holmes et al 2020 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 stable isotope tracers are particularly useful in remote or inaccessible watersheds as they are non reactive and naturally occurring reducing field work requirements while their variable concentration in precipitation and evaporating water bodies can provide additional information on influential water sources and hydrological processes brooks et al 2018 oshun et al 2016 peralta tapia et al 2015 observational data whether flow or tracer observations can feed into the model development through parameter calibration in process based models which aim to emulate real world hydrologic storage and mass flux some parameter values can be estimated using field measurements or remotely sensed data however there are generally other parameters with limited physical basis for which good or reasonable values are unmeasurable or unknown e g regional average soil conductivity acero triana et al 2019 fatichi et al 2016 these unknown parameter values necessitate calibration where parameter values are selected or adjusted to achieve an acceptable model performance there are two approaches commonly used in the literature trying vast numbers of parameter value combinations generated either at random or using a sampled distribution and using those with the best model performance or using a search algorithm to locate optimal parameter value combinations beven and binley 1992 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 pechlivanidis et al 2011 there are benefits to both approaches generating large numbers of independent solutions allows for much more complex statistical analyses and can ensure coverage of the entire parameter space while search algorithms are much better at identifying good quality solutions i e solutions which match observed data sufficiently at a lower computational cost acero triana et al 2019 pechlivanidis et al 2011 regardless of the approach chosen the calibration depends on quantifying the quality of the simulated model output using some sort of performance metric or set of metrics bennett et al 2013 the quantified model performance can be used to identify best solutions set an acceptable model performance threshold or be used by a search algorithm as an objective performance metrics are not limited to simulated streamflow for example if the hydrologic model is capable of simulating both flow and isotope tracer composition both data types can be used to quantify the model performance quality he et al 2019 nan et al 2021 stadnyk and holmes 2020 tunaley et al 2017 however to date there are no universal guidelines on the best performance metrics for isotope tracer aided model calibration and metric selection has largely been ad hoc or best guess in the tracer aided calibration literature holmes et al 2020 tracers in large scale watersheds are generally irregularly or infrequently sampled which can influence metric selection different metrics vary in their sensitivity to different properties of the data timeseries such as variability or maxima therefore by using a mixture of multiple metrics to evaluate different aspects of the flow data or to simultaneously evaluate both flow and tracer data model evaluation or calibration can be rendered more reliable or comprehensive bennett et al 2013 mizukami et al 2019 for the internal process representation the precision of a simulation depends only on the identifiability of the parameter values provided the model structure and equations are static guse et al 2021 if the calibration process results in a narrow range of values for a given parameter that parameter is well identified and if all parameters influencing a modeled process are well identified the range of flow contributions from the process will be narrow however identifiable parameters do not necessarily lead to parameter or process accuracy they may still not be representative of the real world system the model is intended to emulate guse et al 2020 due to issues such as model structure errors or forcing data uncertainty parameters which consistently produce optimal performance metric values may also be consistently wrong e g over estimating evaporation to compensate for biased precipitation inputs or not including sublimation in the model adding tracer data to the calibration process can improve the accuracy of the internal process representation particularly for soil water storages and improve the identifiability of some parameters he et al 2019 holmes et al 2020 however parameter identifiability may also decrease when calibrating with isotope tracer data as parameter values producing optimal flow simulation results can be contradicted by the second calibration target the tracer simulation holmes et al 2020 effects on flow simulation accuracy and precision are likewise unclear including isotope data in the calibration can decrease flow simulation performance during the calibration period and the flow simulation uncertainty may increase on the other hand flow simulation performance during the validation period may improve when tracer data are included in calibration the value added by isotope tracer data to calibration remains elusive and ill defined as previous studies have either used only mixed flow and isotope data used different calibration methods for flow only and mixed flow and isotope calibration limiting comparability or used a single isotope tracer performance metric with a fixed weight in calibration limiting generalizability this study aims to address two remaining gaps in the isotope aided modeling literature at the large scale quantifying the added value of isotope data relative to current best practice flow only calibration methods and a comparison of the merits and limitations of different isotope simulation performance metrics for the purposes of model calibration in particular we address the following questions does use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration alter parameter identifiability and if so is this change an improvement does use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration lead to different flow simulation results and if so is this change an improvement can a tracer performance metric be recommended to maximize the benefits of simulating isotope tracers in model calibrations our study is conducted in the oil sands region of alberta within the athabasca river basin this region was chosen because there exists one of the longest large river isotope sampling programs in canada the watershed contains several hydrometric gauges for calibration of both tributaries and mainstem and because it is a high latitude drainage system representative of cold regions seasonal hydrology permitting an evaluation of snow and glacier melt 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic model and study area 2 1 1 the charm isowatflood model assessing parameter identifiability and change in flow simulation performance resulting from the inclusion of stable isotope tracers in model calibration requires an isotope enabled hydrologic model this study uses the charm watflood hydrologic model

computational efficient distributed modeling of meso and large scale watersheds kouwen 2018 the isowatflood dual isotope tracer model simulates oxygen 18 and deuterium compositions for all water storages and fluxes in the base charm model with the assumptions that all non evaporative fluxes have the same concentration as the originating simulated storage and that hydrologic storages are completely mixed through depth holmes 2016 stadnyk et al 2013 stadnyk and holmes 2020 the linked hydrologic and isotope tracer simulations both output daily results by default but the internal simulation runs at an hourly time step the charm watflood model structure divides the watershed domain into grid cells with defined drainage directions and then subdivides each cell into grouped response units or gru with the area of each gru generally determined from landcover data as shown in fig 1 the default structure of a gru used for most types of landcover such as forests grass or shrubland has a vertical soil column divided into two soil layers the upper and lower soil zones both of which contribute lateral flow to the channel network surface water from snowmelt or rain can either infiltrate vertically or runoff directly to the channel network evapotranspiration is only modeled for wetlands and water in upper soil storages the evaporation component is fractionating and the isotopic composition of the evaporate is modeled using equations from gibson et al 2016a 2008 snowpacks melt and accumulate independently for each gru and soils freeze and thaw based on air temperature with reduced conductivity in frozen soil permafrost is not modeled there are four special gru classes without soil layers glacier impervious connected wetland and water or channel in the glacier and impervious classes all rain and snowmelt becomes direct runoff and glacier gru also generate glacier melt flows connected wetlands fens or riparian zones where present accumulate all lateral outflows from the land and soil and have a bi directional connectivity with stream channels wetland areas disconnected from the channel network are treated as a default gru the water or channel gru is the end point for all flows generated within the grid cell and it is the only gru connected to other cells with inflows from upstream cells and an outflow downstream more detailed descriptions of process representation and equations can be found in holmes 2016 and holmes et al 2022 all modeled processes have parameters controlling the simulated flux and storage with the values of these parameters being either consistent across all gru or separate gru having individual parameter values representing landcover or soil specific hydrologic response there is a very large number of parameters over 300 for the athabasca basin model which can be set for a charm isowatflood model but only a minority truly benefit from calibration the values of most parameters are best determined from previously published studies and simulations are largely insensitive to their value this study will calibrate only the most sensitive highest priority parameters based on model developer recommendations and previous isowatflood calibration studies including holmes et al 2020 and stadnyk and holmes 2020 listed in table 1 2 1 2 athabasca watershed the athabasca river runs north east from the rocky mountains toward the peace athabasca delta and lake athabasca and has a total watershed area of 156 000 km2 in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan on treaty 6 and 8 land fig 2 hydrometric gauge details provided in table s1 soils in the athabasca basin are predominately loam with more clay in the middle of the basin and sandier soil in and around the athabasca oil sands region in the downstream alberta geological survey 2013 shangguan et al 2014 regional groundwater flows contribute 5 or less of the flow of the athabasca river and its tributaries there are still small areas of actively degrading permafrost gibson et al 2016b vitt et al 2000 the largest tributaries in the south of the athabasca basin are the pembina mcleod and lesser slave rivers the clearwater firebag and mackay rivers are the largest tributaries in the downstream portion of the basin temperatures in the athabasca basin vary widely with a monthly average temperature difference of 36 c over the course of a year and average temperatures below freezing for 5 months of the year environment and climate change canada 2020 the basin receives 270 mm of rainfall and 180 cm of snowfall in an average year but there is substantial spatial and interannual variability in precipitation environment and climate change canada 2020 the flow of the athabasca river is not regulated either for flood control or hydroelectric generation but water is diverted for agricultural use and industrial uses in the oil sands rosa et al 2017 the charm model used in this study discretizes the athabasca river basin area firstly with a 0 4 longitude by 0 2 latitude grid and the resulting cells are further divided into 10 different grouped response unit types with areas determined from land cover data from the esa european space agency 2017 the overall prevalence of the gru types in the watershed model and their modeled structures as described in 2 1 1 are listed in table 2 2 1 3 forcing and evaluation data 2 1 3 1 meteorological data the coupled isotope hydrologic models were run using forcings based on observations at 56 environment and climate change canada eccc weather gauges in the watershed and surounding area environment and climate change canada 2020 forcing data in individual grid cells were interpolated at an hourly time step for humidity and air temperature and at a daily time step for accumulated daily precipitation all gauges with observation data for the relevant time interval were included in the inverse distance squared weighting estimate and lapse rates of 0 2 mm km and 5 c km were applied for precipitation and temperature estimates respectively kouwen 2018 minder et al 2010 the isotope tracer model also requires isotopic compositions of precipitation to run due to the scarcity and consistency of observations for isotopes in precipitation these compositions were generated from an empirical model for this study average monthly isotopic compositions of precipitation were estimated from local climate and geographic data based on geostatistical regressed equations originating from delavau et al 2015 and adapted by holmes 2016 to incorporate deuterium the delavau et al 2015 model has been applied successfully in several previous studies gibson et al 2021 holmes et al 2020 2022 stadnyk and holmes 2020 with model input uncertainties derived from the empirically modelled isotopes in precipitation signatures generally being smaller than the reported uncertainty bounds from model structure and parameter selection it is noted that the use of an empirical model particularly one at a monthly timestep comes with limitations and assumptions the impact of model forcing on isowatflood isotope streamflow smulation including the isop model was investigated by delavau et al 2017 and reports well constrained input forcing uncertainty in all seasons except for the spring freshet where flow source variability was the highest i e snowmelt and large rain events and isotopic compositions are more variable within a monthly timestep 2 1 3 2 flow and isotope data simulated model outputs were compared to historical hydrometric data from the water survey of canada environment and climate change canada 2018 from a total of 20 continuous or seasonal i e continuous only during the open water season flow gauges with daily data between 2002 and 2015 the 10 gauges with the highest quality i e most complete data series were used to calibrate the model and the remaining 10 were used for validation see fig 2 for spatial distribution and the supplement for detailed gauge information gauged areas for the athabasca and its tributaries range between 1000 and 137 500 km2 streamflow data have an estimated uncertainty of approximately 10 with higher uncertainty expected during peak flow and ice on periods kiang et al 2018 westerberg et al 2020 in addition to the wsc flow data the alberta environmental monitoring evaluation and reporting agency s long term river network monitoring program collected stable isotope tracer data at hydrometric gauges in the athabasca watershed between 2002 and 2014 gibson et al 2016b water samples for isotope tracer analyses were analyzed using either a micromass isoprime dual inlet gas chromatograph university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory pre 2009 or a thermo scientific delta v advangage dual inlet hdevice system alberta innovates technology futures victoria 2009 and later gibson et al 2016b both machines have estimated analytical uncertainties of 0 1 for oxygen 18 and 1 for deuterium and all results are reported relative to vsmow gibson et al 2016b to prevent post collection isotopic fractionation water samples were sealed in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles and analyzed within one year of sample collection gibson et al 2019 spangenberg 2012 2 2 model calibration methods assessing the value added by isotope data to model calibration relative to current best practice flow only calibration requires the application of a multi stage calibration workflow completed both with and without stable isotope tracer data the overall methodology is outlined in the flow chart in fig 3 and details are covered in the following sections two separate assessments of parameter identifiability were performed the first was a monte carlo style evaluation based on a large number of randomly generated parameter sets which has the advantages of independent sampling and limited user decisions sections 3 1 and 3 2 the second was a set of optimizations using current recommended methods assessing parameter sensitivities selecting useful metrics running multi objective optimizations and selecting behavioral parameter sets that produces higher quality solutions but also depends on a series of user choices sections 3 3 and 3 4 2 2 1 model performance metrics a variety of metrics were evaluated as potential calibration objectives selected based on the most commonly applied metrics from the literature metrics vary in their responsiveness to different types of simulation error such as timing or volume bias and likewise in their parameter sensitivities holmes et al 2022 in calculating all performance metrics only simulated data on days that have flow or isotope observations are considered the normalized root mean square error metric a simple residual error metric primarily focused on timing and bias error was evaluated as a calibration objective for both the isotope and flow simulations 1 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x s i x o i 2 x o where x o i is observation i x s i is the corresponding simulated value x o is the mean value of all observations and n is the number of observations the kling gupta efficiency k g e metric balanced between bias variability and timing error was likewise evaluated as a calibration objective for both the isotope and flow simulations as were its constituent components the bias β the relative variability α and the correlation r gupta et al 2009 2 r i 1 n x o i x o x s i x s i 1 n x o i x o 2 i 1 n x s i x s 2 3 α σ s σ o 4 β x s x o 5 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where x s is the mean value of all simulated values with corresponding observations and σ o and σ s are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated data a selection of flow signature metrics which do not include simulating timing error were considered as potential calibration objectives for the isotope and flow simulations the error in the slope of the flow duration curve s f d c for flows or the slope of the duration curve s d c for isotopes and the high and low flow signatures at the 5 and 95 exceedance probabilities viglione et al 2013 6 sfdc or sdc 100 x s 30 x s 70 40 x s x o 30 x o 70 40 x o 7 q 5 x o 5 x s 5 x o 5 8 q 95 x o 95 x s 95 x o 95 where x5 x30 x70 and x95 are the data with exceedance probabilities of 5 30 70 and 95 the previously described relative variability and bias metrics are also flow signatures shafii and tolson 2015 an additional signature metric for the isotope simulation exclusively was included in the comparison of potential calibration objectives the error in the simulated slope of the local mixing line lml the lml slope error which relies on the simulation of both isotopes and focuses on simulation variability error measures the mismatch between the simulated lml slope and the observed lml slope and like the above flow signature metrics does not include timing error stadnyk and holmes 2020 9 lmlme i 1 n o s i o s d s i d s i 1 n o s i o s 2 i 1 n o o i o o d o i d o i 1 n o o i o o 2 where o o i is oxygen 18 observation and o s i is the corresponding simulated oxygen 18 value and d o i and d s i are the observed and simulated values for deuterium finally two metrics were evaluated as potential calibration objectives for only the flow simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the log transform version of nse were calculated exclusively for the flow simulation nash and sutcliffe 1970 these traditional metrics are included due to their long standing use in hydrologic model evaluations n s e is highly affected by large residuals during high flows while l o g n s e is relatively affected by smaller residuals during low flows 10 nse 1 i 1 n x s i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o 2 11 lognse 1 i 1 n l o g x s i l o g x o i 2 i 1 n l o g x o i l o g x o 2 in addition to individual simulation metrics which can potentially be used as calibration objectives there are also ensemble performance metrics quantifying the performance of groups of simulations e g the outcome of multi objective calibration in this study ensemble performance is assessed using two indices to quantify the two key components of ensemble quality the containment ratio and the relative band width the containment ratio quantifies the ensemble accuracy and is simply the ratio of observations contained within the ensemble upper and lower bounds to the total number observations xiong et al 2009 the average relative band width quantifies ensemble precision and is calculated as xiong et al 2009 12 rb i 1 n x s i u x s i l x o i n where n is number of observations x o i is observation i x s i u is the maximum corresponding simulated value from the ensemble i e the upper simulated bound and x s i l is the minimum corresponding simulated value from the ensemble i e the lower simulated bound 2 2 2 parameter sensitivity and metric selection parameter sensitivities for the various performance metrics are evaluated to design informed calibration strategies utilizing isotope tracer data the best method to analyze sensitivity to this end is a global analysis rather than local which evaluates parameter sensitivity over the entire specified parameter space song et al 2015 this study uses vars a global sensitivity approach which uses variograms to quantify global parameter sensitivity razavi and gupta 2016 vars which is implemented in the vars tool software package was selected for the sensitivity analysis over older alternative approaches due its relative computational efficiency which is a key consideration in applying a global analysis to highly parameterized models with longer run times razavi et al 2019 the vars tool software v2 matlab version was used to generate 48 800 sampled parameter sets and the recommended ivars50 sensitivity index was used along with bootstrapped 90 confidence intervals sampling specifics can be found in table s2 in the supplement razavi and gupta 2016 the parameter sensitivity results presented in this study have been normalized using the total sensitivity of a given metric to simplify comparisons of potential calibration objectives the averaged performance for all 10 flow and 17 isotope simulation performance metrics described in 2 2 1 at all 10 calibration sites was used as the response variable in the parameter sensitivity analysis the resulting parameter sensitivity values are used to select possible metrics for the multi objective optimization section 2 2 4 in calibrating a hydrologic model the aim is to identify good values for all calibrated parameters in order to identify a good value it is necessary that the calibration objective changes in response to changes in the value of that parameter if the objective metric is unresponsive to changes in the value of a parameter an optimization algorithm cannot distinguish between good and bad values for that parameter and it will remain uncalibrated parameter sensitivity data are quantifications of this responsiveness insensitive parameters will not be successfully calibrated to maximize the number of parameters which might potentially be calibrated metric combinations minimizing insensitive parameters are preferred the following rules were applied to quantify and rank the sensitivity coverage of performance metrics to select candidate metrics for this study in a more objective and reproducible manner 1 metrics for flow and isotope data separately are ranked from most types of error covered e g timing variability or bias errors as categorized in holmes et al 2022 to least 2 parameter sensitivities are classified as highly sensitive over 10 of total sensitivity bootstrapped sensitivity uncertainty less than 10 of total sensitivity likely sensitive over 3 of total sensitivity sensitivity uncertainty less than 25 possibly sensitive over 1 of total sensitivity and insensitive i e no detected sensitivity less than 1 of total sensitivity 3 the metric with the most broadly distributed sensitivity i e highest number of parameters which are at least possibly sensitive is selected as the primary candidate metric when using mixed data types the flow metric is primary 4 when searching for second candidate metric the metric increasing the sensitivity i e higher classification based on step 2 for the most parameters from the primary candidate base is selected 5 in cases of a tie i e equal numbers of sensitive parameters the metric covering the most types of error from step 1 is chosen seven different combinations of data types are used to select candidate metric pairs flow only isotope only oxygen 18 only deuterium only flow and oxygen 18 flow and deuterium and flow and both isotope tracers 2 2 3 monte carlo analysis exploring the relationship between parameter values and model performance requires sampling the full range of all parameters and running the hydrologic simulation with each parameter set to generate simulation results for this study a monte carlo analysis is performed where all 27 calibrated parameters are sampled across their entire calibration range using a uniform random distribution a total of 100 000 random parameter sets are generated and run in the isowatflood model of the athabasca basin the simulation performance for the resulting flow and tracer outputs was quantified using performance metrics section 2 2 1 and averaged for calibration sites the monte carlo results are used to assess the parameter identifiability for each performance metric independently by selecting the best 0 1 solutions for each metric and finding the distribution i e range median and interquartile range of parameter values for those 100 simulations parameter values are classified as very well identified if the total range of calibrated parameter values is less than 5 of the calibration range and the interquartile range iqr is less than 2 well identified if the range is less than 10 and iqr less than 5 identified if either the range is less than 20 or the iqr than 10 and somewhat identified either the range is less than 50 or the iqr is less than 25 the key benefit of the monte carlo analysis is that parameter sets and therefore simulation results are completely independent of each other permitting robust statistical treatment of the results monte carlo simulations have also been widely used to calibrate models with mixed flow and isotope data in previous studies delavau et al 2017 neill et al 2019 piovano et al 2020 however using randomly generated parameter sets is computationally inefficient requiring vast numbers of independent simulations and the best performing simulations have a very low likelihood of matching the quality of solutions produced by an optimization algorithm efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 2 2 4 multi objective optimization the current best practice for hydrologic model calibration is the use of optimization algorithms particularly multi objective automated search algorithms an optimization algorithm may start from a random point in the parameter space or from a specified initial solution but rather than continuing to generate random solutions it will search the adjacent region of the parameter space for better solutions the algorithm judges solutions as better or worse based on the value of the objective function or objective functions for multi objective algorithms the selection of an objective is therefore a key decision in model calibration that warrants further investigation this study uses the pa dds pareto archiving dynamically dimensioned search algorithm for multi objective model calibration following the results in holmes et al 2020 based on the dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 the pa dds algorithm is a computationally efficient search method where the search space is gradually constrained as the algorithm completes iterations but with the additional ability to retain an archive of solutions which are not dominated i e all solutions which are not categorically outperformed considering multiple objectives asadzadeh et al 2014 asadzadeh and tolson 2013 model calibrations were performed using the ostrich program v17 12 19 a model independent calibration tool that implements the pa dds algorithm among others matott 2017 for each set of candidate objectives five separate calibration trials were run with different random seeds the method for choosing performance metrics as possible candidates is covered in 2 2 2 each trial ran for 1000 iterations and all non dominated solutions from each of the five trials were retained in the initial results analyses section 3 3 the five trials for each candidate performance metric pair shared initial solutions non dominated solutions for the candidate metrics were selected from the monte carlo results as better quality initial solutions can reduce the computational budget required for optimization while pa dds is not limited to two objectives this study is limited to paired objectives as increasing the number of objectives generally increases the computational requirements asadzadeh et al 2014 calibrations using an optimization algorithm generally have better simulation performance than those using random parameter sets in a monte carlo analysis and using multi objective optimization generates a substantial number of parameter sets producing good flow or tracer simulations efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 however the solutions from a particular trial are not fully independent of each other as the algorithm generates new solutions from progressive modifications of previous ones which limits or complicates the statistical treatment of the results 3 results 3 1 monte carlo parameter identifiability the best 100 solutions from the 100 000 randomly generated parameter sets run in the monte carlo analysis are selected for each flow and isotope performance metric independently box whisker plots of all parameters normalized to the calibration range and all assessed metrics are shown in fig 4 mean range and iqr values for all parameters and metrics are shown in tables s6 to s8 overall there is limited identifiability for most parameters most boxplots exceed 50 of the calibration range i e parameter values are unidentifiable categorized parameter identifiability from the monte carlo analysis is shown in table s9 parameter values for melt rates for coniferous forest and barren ground the baseflow power and the baseflow coefficient in the mountains are identifiable when calibrating to some metrics most parameters have some relationship with at least one performance metric where the parameter values for the 100 selected solutions are either limited to or skewed towards only part of the total calibration range for example the distribution of values for the horizontal conductivity factor k f horz is skewed for the majority of performance metrics although it is only somewhat identifiable for a single metric kge h and the parameter value range is somewhat identified for the wetland porosity parameter for q correlation and h bias only the surface soil conductivity parameter and the downstream channel roughness k f surf and n ds are completely unidentifiable maintaining a uniform distribution of parameter values across the entire possible parameter range generally flow and isotope performance metrics are aligned in either identifying or not identifying parameter values but not in all cases for example the flow and oxygen 18 performance metrics identify opposite ends of the possible parameter value range for the soil water retention capacities for coniferous and mix forest while intriguing the monte carlo results do not identify parameter values well and are inconclusive on the utility of isotope data for improving parameter identifiability the parameter space with 27 interacting calibrated parameters is both large and complex and even the best simulations produced were of mediocre quality e g best flow kge range between 0 48 and 0 52 3 2 parameter sensitivity and candidate objective metric selection a vars global sensitivity analysis was performed for all evaluated performance metrics independently using average performance at calibration sites as the response variable the normalized sensitivities and sensitivity reliabilities are shown in fig 5 a few parameters are consistently insensitive across all evaluated metrics namely the surface soil conductivity i e kf surf and connected wetland snowmelt rate i e melt fen but generally parameters are sensitive for some metrics and not others both flow and isotope metrics are sensitive to some snowmelt and baseflow parameters isotope performance metrics are more sensitive to upper zone soil retention parameters in dominant land classes relative to the flow performance metrics but these sensitivities are not generally reliable likewise flow metrics are more sensitive to wetland and glacier parameters but not always reliably the lml slope error and the oxygen 18 kge and sdc standout for their balanced sensitivities with nearly equal shares of the total sensitivity for each individual parameter sensitive parameters are likely to be at least somewhat identifiable based on the monte carlo identifiability results in fig 4 table s3 provides correlation metrics between monte carlo iqr and vars sensitivity but with too many anomalies to make either analysis type a strong predictor of the other the melt rate for coniferous forest is both sensitive and identifiable using flow performance metrics but glacier melt is sensitive and generally poorly identified with the same metrics unidentifiable parameters match with consistently to the insensitive ones yet isotope metrics are better at identifying baseflow coefficients in the upstream and worse at identifying the same coefficient in the downstream c ds than would be predicted based on the parameter sensitivities the data presented in fig 5 are the basis of the metric candidate identification process where performance metric pairs providing the widest parameter sensitivity coverage following the quantitative criteria in 2 2 2 are selected for use in multi objective calibration the categorized parameter sensitivity coverage for all individual metrics and the candidate paired performance metrics is shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively in the supplementary data candidate pairs were selected when considering only flow metrics flow and isotope metrics and only isotope metrics see section 2 2 2 for the selection rules one additional candidate pair was added as the nrmse for isotope simulation performance is too commonly used to be overlooked in this analysis overall there is limited differences in the categorized parameter sensitivity coverage between the eight different candidate calibration metric pairs by maximizing the number of sensitive parameters within the data constraints the resulting coverage is similar with most parameters being somewhat sensitive i e not insensitive to at least one of the paired metrics the lower zone wetland and channel parameters have similar sensitivity for all candidate pairs and there is more variation between candidates for upper zone melt and evaporation parameter sensitivities 3 3 multi objective optimization each candidate pair of performance metrics were used as objectives in five independent multi objective calibration trials using the non dominated solutions for that candidate pair from the monte carlo analysis as initial solutions the outcomes of these 40 calibration trials are shown in fig 6 along with the initial solutions simulation performance after calibration is substantially improved compared to the initial random solutions e g most solutions with kge q as an objective now have kge q exceeding 0 5 fig 6 is not strictly a trade off front as neither kge q nor nrmse 18o are objectives for all calibrations but it still clearly demonstrates the cost of calibrating with an isotope tracer objective the best flow simulation performance x axis does not achieve the best isotope tracer y axis simulation performance if equivalent weight is given to isotope and flow performance the flow simulation performance in calibration will be lower than if flow performance is considered alone however considering the uncertainty in performance metric values a decrease in calibration kge q of 0 03 the difference between maximizing flow performance and giving equal weight to flow and isotope performance is not particularly serious the two isotope tracers are similar but not identical e g when kge 2h is an objective the calibration performance does not quite overlap with solutions found with kge 18o as an objective on the other hand using nrmse 18o or kge 18o as objectives produces equivalent calibration performances there is a clear segregation of objective pair types the flow only pair has the best flow performance the isotope only pairs have the best isotope simulation performance and the mixed flow isotope pairs fall between the other two with some overlap the difference between the best flow performance for the flow only and mixed flow isotope calibrations is negligible 0 586 vs 0 583 kge q the isotope only calibrations do not generally produce good flow simulations with a mean and median flow kge of 0 28 flow simulations are of similar quality to those from random parameter sets in the monte carlo analysis mean and median kge 0 20 and 0 21 isotope only calibrations only outperformed random solutions in avoiding very poor flow simulations with a minimum flow kge of 0 05 compared to 0 27 from the monte carlo analysis to assess the effect of using isotope tracer data in calibration on identified parameter values the relationships between flow and isotope simulations performance and calibrated parameter values for several key parameters are illustrated in fig 7 with other parameters in the supplementary material s1 s4 three outlier solutions with nrmse 18o greater than 0 5 are not shown due to space constraints these highly influential parameters generally have identified parameter values or correlated simulation performance and parameter values some are identified by both flow and isotope results i e kf the horizontal and vertical soil conductivity but others are better identified by either the flow i e coniferous forest soil retention or the isotope performance i e the evaporation adjustment factor with parameter values only consistent for the best performing simulations of one type the final step in the calibration process is the selection of acceptable solutions from the total output of the 40 non dominated pareto solution produced by the multi objective optimization algorithm as the flow simulation is the primary model output of interest for a hydrologic model only solutions with calibration kge q greater than 0 5 will be considered behavioral this threshold entirely removes isotope only calibrations from further consideration as no behavioral solutions were produced by calibrating to isotope tracer performance alone the average flow simulation at validation sites for behavioral solutions is shown in fig 8 along with the calibration performance as is typical for hydrologic models the validation performance decreases relative to calibration performance with average kge q exceeding 0 5 for calibration sites and ranging between 0 26 and 0 42 for validation sites the best validation flow simulation performance for behavioral solutions is best predicted by the isotope simulation performance in calibration not the flow simulation performance in calibration the best validation kge q are for solutions with low nrmse 18o and the worst are for solutions with higher nrmse 18o behavioral solutions from the calibrated parameter sets have better parameter identifiability than the best solutions from random parameter sets however solutions generated from the same pa dds multi objective calibration trial are not truly independent which limits the comparability to the monte carlo results the five trials per candidate objective pair are independent rather than all parameter sets to evaluate the effect of using isotope tracer data in calibration on parameter identifiability for moo the normalized parameter values from all behavioral solutions for all parameters are shown in the histograms in fig 9 mean range and iqr values for these distributions are shown in tables s10to s12 the majority of parameters have at least somewhat identified values and a few are well identified e g coniferous forest snowmelt rate and the baseflow coefficient in the upstream region soil retention soil conductivity wetland parameters and the evaporation adjustment factor are identified or somewhat identified for most objective pairs all five candidate objective pairs have broadly similar identifiable and unidentifiable parameters and usually agree on approximately the same parameter values the two oxygen 18 calibrations using kge 18o and nrmse 18o as secondary objectives have extremely similar parameter values and parameter identifiability and the calibration using kge 2h as the second objective is similar to both oxygen 18 calibrations except for the glacier melt factor the flow only calibration and the calibration using the lml slope error as the second objective diverge from the other calibrations for some parameters as an example the three pairs using an isotope metric including timing error all converge on a low value of wetland porosity but lml slope error calibration tends toward a high porosity value and the flow only calibration does not identify a value for porosity it is noted however that using isotope data in calibration does not consistently improve parameter identifiability e g the evaporation factor and wetland porosity are better identified but mixed wood upper zone soil water retention has a less identifiable parameter value 3 4 calibrated ensemble performance the final stage of evaluating calibration effectiveness and changes in flow simulation results from the use of stable isotope tracer data in calibration is the assessment of the ensemble performance all behavioral solutions from the five pa dds calibration trials for each candidate objective pair were included with equal weight in an ensemble of parameter sets such that simulation uncertainty resulting from parameter selection can be identified total numbers of members are listed in table 3 the average annual hydrographs for the three most divergent ensembles of behavioral solutions are shown in fig 10 at the athabasca river at fort mcmurray which covers most of the modeled area other hydrographs shown in figure s5 in the supplementary material parameter identifiability does not decisively improve when isotope data are included in calibration but the resulting ensembles produce distinctive component contributions to streamflow mixed flow isotope calibrations have similar uncertainty for total flow to a flow only calibration with slightly improved observation containment at this downstream gauge on the other hand the isotope enabled calibration ensembles have substantially higher confidence in the component contributions generating the total flow e g the range of contributions from the upper soil zone for isotope enabled calibrations is less than half that of the flow only calibrations the percent contributions from the upper and lower soil zones are listed in table 3 along with the range in percent contributions the ensemble containment ratios and relative bounds average contributions from the two soil zones are consistent for all calibrated ensembles but the ranges in those contributions are substantially different all mixed flow isotope calibrated ensembles have much lower maximum upper zone contributions and much higher minimum lower zone contributions than the flow only ensemble this improvement in flow component identifiability is linked to improvements in process flux identifiability for soils see figure s6 in the supplement median and inter quartile ranges for soil fluxes are similar for all calibration objective pairs but the flow only calibration has substantially longer tails i e higher uncertainty than mixed isotope flow calibrations similarity in the total flow uncertainty and the improvement in the ensemble observation containment is also supported quantitatively across all gauge sites the three mixed flow isotope calibrations using an isotope performance metric that includes timing errors all have better containment ratios than the flow only calibration at both calibration and validation gauges and these improvements in the mean containment ratio are statistically significant there is no significant change in the relative band width for the ensembles calibrated with flow and oxygen 18 data the ensemble calibrated with kge q and kge 2h has wider relative bounds the final flow isotope calibrated ensemble calibrated to maximize kge q and minimize lml slope error has significantly narrower relative band width but a lower containment ratio than the flow only calibration 4 discussion 4 1 parameter identifiability overall parameter values were not well identified regardless of methodology metric or data type with a few exceptions the small number of well identified parameter values is unsurprising given the model complexity number of calibrated parameters and large and heterogeneous study area the best identified parameters for both flow and isotope data were the baseflow parameters which had generally constrained values regardless of the assessment method that baseflow is the best identified process is entirely unsurprising as the majority of total streamflow is routed through the lower soil zone as baseflow and the process is controlled by a limited number of parameters the snow melt rate parameter for coniferous forest the dominant land class was well identified by most flow metrics including kge q but was not well identified by isotope tracer metrics on the other hand the pet factor is substantially better identified by isotope tracer metrics than flow metrics alone in some cases parameter values may be best identified by a combination of flow and isotope tracer simulation performance the values of horizontal soil conductivity and wetland porosity are most constrained when both flow and isotopes are optimized isotope and flow data only identified different values for the same parameter for upper zone soil water retentions with the best flow performance associated with very high retention and the best isotope performance associated with low retention it is entirely possible to have isotope simulation performance of approximately similar quality with either low or high retention but if flow simulation performance is not considered in parameter value selection lower retention values are identified altogether isotope tracer data whether δ2h or δ18o does not lead to dramatic alterations in parameter identifiability but the limited changes do tend to be improvements with so many interacting parameters within the isowatflood model individual parameter identifiability is weak even with additional tracer data a simpler more conceptual model than isowatflood would have more identifiable parameter values it is also important to note that the choice of parameter value limits for calibration can impact parameter identifiability when identifiability is defined in terms of the potential parameter value range as was done in this study excessively wide limits can artificially increase identifiability while overly restricted limits on parameter values either mask identifiability limits overlap optimal parameter values or overestimate identifiability optimal values fall outside limits this study has relied on developer recommendations for limiting parameter values in calibration and the shortage of identifiability from the monte carlo results suggest that parameter limits were not excessively broad but the tendency for well identified parameter values to approach either the upper or lower bound in the moo results suggests that some optimal parameter values lie outside the specified limit these parameters may be less identifiable than categorized based on range and iqr relative to total potential parameter range however if the optimization can push parameter values to the limit the parameter is not unidentifiable the addition of isotope performance to the calibration was more adept at constraining the overall process contributions to streamflow fig 10 than identifying parameter values the use of isotope tracer data as a calibration objective avoided many outlying flux simulations and flow component combinations that were included by calibrations using only flow data it is not unexpected that fluxes are better constrained than parameter values in models with large numbers of interacting processes and parameters given parameter identifiability is typically desired as a proxy for process identifiability it is preferable to have better process identification without better parameter value identification than the reverse 4 2 simulation performance both flow only and mixed isotope flow multi objective calibrations resulted in numerous acceptable flow simulations i e kge q greater than 0 5 in calibration while calibrating to isotope data alone did not for predictions in ungauged basins pub should a basin have sparse isotope data using these as a lone calibration objective may still be a better alternative than purely random parameter value selection within general recommended ranges as isotope tracers may rule out some of the least accurate flow simulations that said caution should be used when interpreting any long term model simulations as this study demonstrates that isotopes alone are clearly not a reliable substitute for hydrometric data pa dds calibrated solutions using kge q as an objective revealed flow simulations that outperform any randomly generated parameter set while the isotope only calibrations result in flow simulation performance similar to the random solutions from the monte carlo analysis the monte carlo analysis was an inefficient method of identifying behavioral parameter sets for both flow and isotope tracer simulations numerous higher quality solutions were identified using multi objective calibration using 1 of the computational budget of the monte carlo analysis the mixed isotope flow multi objective calibrations resulted in solutions with similar flow simulation performance and better isotope tracer simulation performance compared to the flow only calibration the differences between isotope enabled and flow only calibrations in flow simulation performance for calibration gauges was negligible and validation performance improved when isotope simulation performance was included as a calibration objective considered as ensembles the mixed isotope flow calibrations generally outperform the flow only calibration with better observation containment for calibrations when an isotope performance metric which include timing error is used as the second objective and similar relative bounds on isotope enabled calibrated ensembles the sub component ensembles benefited most from the inclusion of isotope tracer data in the calibration with substantially narrower more precise ranges the addition of either oxygen 18 or deuterium data excludes process contribution combinations that lead to acceptable total streamflow simulations the increased confidence in the flow sub component contributions may be a contributing factor in the positive correlation between isotope simulation performance in calibration and flow simulation validation performance this study has found a similar interrelationship between isotope tracer performance and flow simulation performance in validation to previous work with the isowatflood model but in a different watershed and using a different calibration methodology stadnyk and holmes 2020 overall isotope tracer data are beneficial to the flow simulation adding isotope tracer data to the calibration leads to flow simulations comparable or better than simulations calibrated with flow data alone 4 3 calibration recommendations isotope tracer simulations and observation data have demonstrable value as a supplement to hydrometric data in process based hydrologic model calibration if possible calibration using an isotope simulation performance metric as a secondary objective in a multi objective optimization is recommended results of this study indicate that mixed isotope flow calibrations result in better streamflow simulation and improved identifiability of streamflow sub component simulation than flow only calibrations monte carlo simulations are not well suited to identifying parameter values in large scale process based models or for tracer aided calibrations in such models process based models typically have large numbers of parameters to calibrate and the interactions between these parameters have complex effects on simulation outcomes exploring the parameter space of such models as a monte carlo analysis aims to is computationally onerous particularly for large scale models with significant run times and does not produce better calibration outcomes than multi objective optimization it is important that the isotope performance metric includes timing error for the isotope tracer simulation neither kge nor nrmse has a decisive advantage over the other as a calibration objective for tracer simulation this study found no reason not to use nrmse to compare isotope simulation quality as it was equivalent to using kge for improving isotope and flow model performance using kge to quantify tracer simulation performance has the advantage of aligning with a common flow performance metric but the metric is more vulnerable to sampling gaps or biases than nrmse the variability component of the kge metric is particularly unreliable when sampling programs do not include seasons e g no winter sample collection or have disproportionate numbers of samples in some periods e g intensive summer sample collection for a student research project previous research found no benefit from calibrating kge for both isotope tracers simultaneously as the oxygen 18 and deuterium simulations are correlated and contain roughly the same information for calibration holmes et al 2020 the results of this study show no decisive differences between calibrations using oxygen 18 and calibrations using deuterium both isotopes improved ensemble and validation performance increased confidence in flow component simulations and neither lead to substantial change in parameter identifiability the choice between stable isotope tracers i e oxygen 18 or deuterium is dependant on the model or the data available in this study oxygen 18 is preferrable as it can be simulated independently the current isowatflood model code is limited to either oxygen 18 or both isotopes simultaneously which may not be the case for other modeling packages in summary 1 use an isotope tracer performance metric as a second objective in multi objective optimizations of process based hydrologic models 2 choose an isotope tracer simulation performance metric that includes timing error o consider kge for consistently sampled isotope data sets o use nrmse for irregularly sampled isotope data sets 5 conclusions isotope tracer simulations and specifically calibrations including tracer model performance optimization are beneficial for both process representation and streamflow simulations these benefits including better ensemble observation containment higher validation performance scores for flow simulations and improved process contribution identification can be realized even in mesoscale watersheds and with limited isotope observation datasets flow data should remain the primary focus of hydrologic model calibration but using an isotope simulation performance metric which includes timing error as a secondary calibration objective leads to more robust streamflow modeling credit authorship contribution statement tegan l holmes conceptualization methodology software
