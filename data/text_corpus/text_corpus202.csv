characteristics of mountain city chongqing to study the development mode of sponge city and the quantitative contribution of sponge city construction to the reduction in non point source loads in reservoir areas is still unclear in addition the influence of this process on the aquatic environmental quality in the reservoir area still needs to be evaluated through scientific research in addition there are clear requirements for assessing the aquatic environment for sponge city construction in yuelai new town of chongqing the water quality of the sponge lake river system in the urban construction area water quality is not lower than the iv class standard of the surface water environmental quality standard and the water quality is better than that of urban construction at the beginning of the sponge city therefore to meet the assessment requirements of aquatic environmental quality in the demonstration area urban non point source pollution must be controlled however research on the effect of sponge city facilities on urban non point source control under different conditions is still lacking therefore it is not clear whether the planned sponge facilities can meet the requirements of urban non point source pollution control the coupling relationship between the planning and designing of sponge city construction and the aquatic environmental assessment index needs to be revealed this study takes the yuelai sponge city construction demonstration area as the research object to quantitatively analyze the reduction of urban non point source load in the three

obtained the comprehensive results will be provide some clues and suggestions for the construction of sponge city in the mountain city 2 methodology 2 1 study area chongqing city is a typical mountain city in which pollutants tend to accumulate liangjiang new district is a sub provincial new area and a state level new area under the jurisdiction of chongqing municipality it is also the first state level development and opening new area in inland china the research area is yuelai new town which is the sponge city demonstration area of the liangjiang new district yuelai new town is located in the core area of liangjiang district on the right bank of the jialing river yuelai new town is a modern international business center integrating international businesses conferences and exhibitions

builds the multilayer the multifunctional the compound convention and exhibition new city through the organic integration of transportation network land function development intensity ecological corridor balance of employment and residence and public service the ecological zone achieves low energy consumption low carbon emission and beautiful ecological environment 2 2 basic data collection and preprocessing sponge city planning needs to be established based on the basis of accurate data collection and collation including rainwater pipe network data terrain data rainfall data land use type data pollution load water quality parameters and other data accurate and reliable basic data can establish the reliability of mathematical model results and ensure the model can play a role in current situation assessment and plan analysis some data have been collected table s1 such as the standard zoning land use plan of yuelai group in the main urban area of chongqing drainage zoning rainwater network planning and road planning the preliminary planning scheme of yuelai ecological zone exhibition zone and smart zone was obtained yubei district daily rainfall data from 2003 to 2013 and measured rainfall data from march to june 2016 were consulted monitoring results of initial rainwater quality of some rainfall sites from november 2015 to june 2016 were obtained yuelai sponge city demonstration area with a 1 500 topographic map and yuelai sponge city master plan text and drawings were obtained 2 3 establishment of the sponge city aided design scad model in this study the scad independently developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi was used to evaluate the current situation of urban non point source load in the yuelai new town scad includes a series of functions for sponge city planning and design such as the simulation of urban runoff production and non point source pollution reduction by low impact development lid facilities luan et al 2017 zhou and guan 2017 the water quality indexes simulated in this project were cod tn tp and ss to improve the reliability of the model a set of monitoring plans and model calibration schemes were developed for the calibration of relevant water quality parameters based on monitoring data the autocal tool in the mike zero toolkit independently developed by dhi was used for automatic calibration and calibration of model parameters then the scad was used to analyze and evaluate the reduction effect of various sponge city construction projects on the urban non point source pollution load scad simulation mainly includes the accumulation process of surface pollutants and scour process of surface pollutants the accumulation of surface pollutants is calculated by the equivalent number of sunny days 1 1 p t t e y s u pt is the amount of suspended pollutant accumulation in each land type plot before the rainfall kg te is the cumulative days of equivalent sunny days d te t ts 1 es ts t is the number of days after the last rainfall ts is the number of days since the last cleaning es is the cleaning efficiency 0 1 and the default value is 0 25 y s u is the daily load of solids on the surface of the block kg d the scour process of surface pollutants is that part or all of the pollutants accumulated on the surface during a rainfall are washed away from the surface during the runoff process and then the surface will take the residual pollutants on the surface at the end of this rainfall as the starting value to start the accumulation before the next rainfall 2 2 p t p 0 e k 2 r t pt kg is the amount of pollutants remaining on the surface at the beginning of storm runoff t p0 kg is the amount of surface pollutants at the beginning of the storm rt rdt mm is the cumulative runoff after the beginning of the rainstorm t l is the total amount of pollutants washed out by storm runoff 3 3 l p o 1 e k 2 r t assuming that the basin area is a the pollutant concentration c in the runoff process can be calculated by the following formula 4 4 c t c 0 e k 2 r t c 0 pollutant concentration in the rain water at the beginning of runoff k2 coefficient of scouring mm 1 k2 represents the proportion of ground accumulated pollutants that can be carried away by a given rainfall intensity for example the cumulative rainfall of a can wash out b of the accumulated pollutants on the ground 5 5 k 2 ln 1 b a at the beginning of runoff the relationship between pollutant concentration in rainwater and pollution load at the beginning is as follows 6 p 0 a c o k 2 2 4 water quality monitoring plan and model parameters calibration the main non point source pollution in yuelai new town is that caused by rainfall scour on the ground by referring to the yearbook combined with the land use type distribution data from google earth the average annual discharge of non point source pollutants was as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 673 t suspended solid ss 1730 t total nitrogen tn 26 6 t and total phosphorus tp 4 42 t the current monitoring data are the water quality monitoring data from 3 sampling sites under different rainfall conditions from november 2015 to july 2016 the topographic and geomorphic features within the selected range were analyzed to determine the factors affecting surface runoff pollution within the study range and cod ss tp and tn were selected as the water quality monitoring indexes in this experiment the data collected at sampling site 1 the gate of the national museum center sampling site 2 yuanyang oak hill bay villa area sampling site 3 lawn at the turn of the guobo interchange were used for model calibration sampling site 1 was mainly used for monitoring runoff rainwater of asphalt roads from the main urban roads the rainwater runoff collected at sampling site 1 was from yuelai avenue which is a main road in the exhibition zone with more traffic than that in other areas and had a good representation sampling site 2 was used for monitoring runoff rainwater of low density residential areas the stormwater runoff from sampling site 2 was from yuanyang oak villa area which is a typical residential area so the results can be applied to various residential lands in yuelai new town sampling site 3 was used for monitoring runoff rainwater from lawns the stormwater runoff at sampling site 3 was from the grassland near the sidewalk at the turning point of the guobo interchange which represents the non point source pollution parameters of land types such as green space and vegetation these three sampling sites represented the three main land types of roads residential areas and green spaces respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of a new urban watershed water system pollution model urban stormwater runoff pollutant composition is complex the concentration changes greatly biodegradability is poor and discharge is intermittent and irregular ghane et al 2016 walaszek et al 2018 under the leaching and scouring action of rainfall runoff pollutants will enter the water body and cause water quality deterioration to better control the pollution of stormwater runoff it is necessary to understand the variation characteristics of pollutant concentrations in stormwater runoff and determine their variation trends yuelai new town has formed a residential area convention and exhibition center park main traffic road and other land use type layouts the main monitoring indexes were the flow rate of the outflow and change curve of corresponding pollution load concentration considering that the cumulative value of pollutants in the park is difficult to monitor it is not recommended to sample in the park area instead the green space beside the road was used for sampling at present there are no residents living in residential areas so the pollutant accumulation value of low density residential areas near the study area was selected as the boundary of the model in the measurement the water quality determination parameters of sampling site 1 are shown in table 1 the overall calibration effect was high as shown in fig 2 the monitoring value of cod after 60min was higher than the simulation result which may have been caused by monitoring errors or other factors meanwhile from the overall trend the simulation results were consistent with the general pollutant scour outflow concentration the calibration results of sampling site 1 can be effectively used to simulate the runoff pollution of all levels of roads in yuelai new town the water quality correction parameters of sampling site 2 are shown in table s2 and the calibration results are shown in figure s1 the calibration result of tn was good reflecting the trend of monitoring data the simulation results of ss and cod were essentially consistent with the normal physical trend but the simulation value was generally lower than the measured value the tp monitoring data values were all below 0 2 mm l under low concentration conditions the monitoring data were greatly affected by monitoring errors and sampling conditions so it was difficult to obtain a good fitting result the planning area of residential land in yuelai new town is about 36 5 the calibration results of sampling site 2 played an important role in the calculation of storm runoff non point source pollution in the whole yuelai new town the water quality correction parameters of sampling site 3 are shown in table s3 and the calibration results are shown in figure s2 the results of the water quality calibration show that the simulated values of ss and tn were good which generally reflected the trend of monitoring data the difference between the simulated value and the measured value of cod gradually increased after 70 minutes the reason may be that the cod monitoring data are affected by other factors this result is inconsistent with the general pollutant rainfall erosion model the simulation results did not reflect the trend of the measured data after 70 minutes the simulated value of tp differed greatly from the measured value of tp through the study of the change in the water quality of grassland runoff it is helpful to analyze the reduction contribution of increasing green space to non point source pollution 3 2 model parameters for different schemes the newly built area of yuelai new town based on traditional development is similar to other urban areas in terms of its features the impermeable surface area of the area is large thus the non point sources within the area have fast stormwater production flows large flows and an especially high pollutant content in initial runoff in addition compared with plain cities yuelai new town has its own unique characteristics of mountain cities the urban terrain slope is large and the vertical layout is trapezoidal in comparison to during other periods during the rainfall period the urban production flow is faster and the confluence time is shorter to accurately evaluate the impact of traditional planning and sponge city construction on urban runoff and non point source pollution four scenarios were designed namely the non point source pollution scenario simulation before development fd the non point source pollution scenario simulation of traditional development td the non point source pollution simulation in the sponge city planning scheme scp and the non point source pollution simulation in the sponge city optimization scheme sco before development the study area was basically in a state of natural basin with only sporadic villages scattered throughout it the underlying surface was similar to the urban green space so the calibration parameters of the model for the non point source pollution model in the research area were selected as the calibration parameters of medium green space and low density housing pollutant accumulation per unit area and the erosion coefficient are shown in table s4 the erosion factor is characterized by percentage of pollutants washed out by rainfall of 20 mm b according to the urban design and planning of yuelai new town after the construction of yuelai new town the main land would be residential land and roads for the fd the calibration parameters pollutant accumulation per unit area and erosion coefficient of non point source pollution model parameters of different land types are shown in the table s5 the soil type of chongqing is clay and the infiltration capacity is based on the form of permeable pavement the permeability coefficient is 3 00 10 8 1 41 10 7 m s according to the actual situation of a thin 5 m 6 m soil layer and minimal infiltration capacity in chongqing the permeability coefficient is 1 00 10 7 m s without considering the influence of other cases the 24 h infiltration amount is 8 64 mm the permeability coefficient in scad is 0 325 different lid facilities and corresponding permeability coefficients in the scp are shown in table s6 after the development of the sponge city the land use function of the urban plots did not change therefore the parameters of non point source pollution models of different land uses are the same as those of traditional source pollution models there is currently no detailed design plan for green space in the overall plan of the sponge city according to simulation results in section 3 1 simply increasing green space cannot effectively reduce non point source pollution brought by urban runoff therefore in the sco 12 of the ordinary green space was considered to be converted into sunken green space the storage depth of 20 cm is increased and the original 18 of the green space of the residential area and 8 of the original common green space of roads and other land are retained the parameters of the sunken green space were based on the design parameters in other sponge cities permeable pavement is consistent with sponge city master plan the specific facility parameters are shown in table s7 3 3 yuelai sponge city non point source pollution simulation the peak concentrations of ss cod tn and tp in each area of yuelai new town under different development modes are in fig 3 in the pre development state ss had a high peak concentration in the river it is speculated that in the natural state ss accumulation is high and easy to scour after traditional development the peak concentrations of cod tn and tp into the river increased significantly among which ss increased by 56 7 cod increased by 465 tn increased by 2930 and tp increased by 49 8 traditional development resulted in substantial non point source pollution with the acceleration of urbanization the pollution of water bodies will become increasingly serious compared with the traditional development sponge city construction results in the concentrations of all kinds of pollutants flowing into the river slightly reduced with the increase in the green land rate and infiltration pavement only under the sponge city planning scheme the peak concentrations of pollutants into the river were 1000 mg l for ss 180 mg l for cod 12 0 mg l for tn and 0 02 mg l for tp the concentration of pollutants into the river decreases rapidly with rainfall under the optimization scheme the peak of ss concentration in sponge city significantly increased reaching 1915 39 mg l but the peak concentrations of cod tn and tp were not significantly different from those before the development as shown in fig 4 in the predevelopment state the pollutant concentrations in the river from rainfall runoff were all low except ss indicating that in the natural state the rainfall runoff in the study area would scarcely bring pollution into the water system after traditional development the cumulative amount of major pollutants flowing into the river increased significantly in comparison to after traditional development there was no significant difference in the amount of main pollutants accumulated into the river after the sponge city design interestingly after the sponge city optimization scheme design the cumulative amount of the main pollutants into the river basically recovered to levels that existed before development therefore in comparison to the sponge city development model that simply increased the green land rate the sponge city development model that increased the sunken green space more obviously decreased urban non point source pollution the main reason for this result was that yuelai new town is a typical mountain city with fast runoff high runoff surface velocity and confluence period in comparison to ordinary green space sunken green space better intercepts and purifies runoff pollution 3 4 the reduction ratio of the pollutant in different zones in the yuelai new town the reduction ratio of the pollution load of different non point sources of pollutants in scp and sco is shown in table 2 under the scp model the accumulation of pollutants into the river is reduced however the reduction was less with cod at approximately 10 and tp at approximately 5 therefore it was indicated that the sponge city construction under the condition of increasing the green land rate and permeating pavement only reduced the concentration of various pollutants into the river slightly and the total pollution load also decreased compared with traditional development mode under the sco mode the ss reduction ratio of yuelai new town is 53 7 the cod reduction ratio is 93 0 the tn reduction ratio is 95 9 and the tp reduction ratio is 95 3 indicating that good sponge city development mode has a very good effect on reducing non point source pollution brought by urban runoff in addition the contribution rates of different zones smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone to the reduction in different pollutants were calculated respectively as shown in fig 5 in terms of cod reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone is 45 1 43 2 and 11 7 respectively in terms of ss reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 41 4 38 2 and 20 4 respectively in terms of tn reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 43 9 45 8 and 10 3 respectively in terms of tp reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 43 0 47 2 and 9 8 respectively yuelai new city is a typical mountain city with fast runoff high runoff surface velocity and confluence period compared with common green space sunken green space has better interception and purification effect on runoff and pollution caused by runoff with the acceleration of urbanization urban non point source pollution caused by traditional development is becoming more and more serious compared with traditional development pollution caused by urban rainfall and runoff can be significantly improved through sponge construction indexes of main pollutants entering rivers can approach the undeveloped state meanwhile for mountainous cities such as chongqing the effect of sunken green space on non point source pollution interception and purification is obviously better than ordinary green space in the construction of sponge city it is necessary to pay attention to the construction of facilities such as sunken green space and other source control types 4 conclusion combined with the actual demand of yuelai new town construction a complete and effective urban watershed water system pollution model was established based on the surface pollutant accumulation process and scour process calculation model the simulation results were in good agreement with the measured data the simulated values of the peak concentrations of ss cod tn and tp and the cumulative amounts of the four main pollutants flowing into the river were analyzed compared with the traditional development mode under the sco mode the ss reduction ratio of yuelai new town is 53 7 the cod reduction ratio is 93 0 the tn reduction ratio is 95 9 and the tp reduction ratio is 95 3 it was found that under the sponge city development mode the contribution ratio of smart zone and exhibition zone account for 45 1 and 43 2 in terms of cod reduction the research results will provide theoretical technical and methodological support for the sponge city demonstration pilot in chongqing which will be helpful for promoting this type of developing in the three gorges reservoir area and mountain cities in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

geomorphic features within the selected range were analyzed to determine the factors affecting surface runoff pollution within the study range and cod ss tp and tn were selected as the water quality monitoring indexes in this experiment the data collected at sampling site 1 the gate of the national museum center sampling site 2 yuanyang oak hill bay villa area sampling site 3 lawn at the turn of the guobo interchange were used for model calibration sampling site 1 was mainly used for monitoring runoff rainwater of asphalt roads from the main urban roads the rainwater runoff collected at sampling site 1 was from yuelai avenue which is a main road in the exhibition zone with more traffic than that in other areas and had a good representation sampling site 2 was used for monitoring runoff rainwater of low density residential areas the stormwater runoff from sampling site 2 was from yuanyang oak villa area which is a typical residential area so the results can be applied to various residential lands in yuelai new town sampling site 3 was used for monitoring runoff rainwater from lawns the stormwater runoff at sampling site 3 was from the grassland near the sidewalk at the turning point of the guobo interchange which represents the non point source pollution parameters of land types such as green space and vegetation these three sampling sites represented the three main land types of roads residential areas and green spaces respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of a new urban watershed water system pollution model urban stormwater runoff pollutant composition is complex the concentration changes greatly biodegradability is poor and discharge is intermittent and irregular ghane et al 2016 walaszek et al 2018 under the leaching and scouring action of rainfall runoff pollutants will enter the water body and cause water quality deterioration to better control the pollution of stormwater runoff it is necessary to understand the variation characteristics of pollutant concentrations in stormwater runoff and determine their variation trends yuelai new town has formed a residential area convention and exhibition center park main traffic road and other land use type layouts the main monitoring indexes were the flow rate of the outflow and change curve of corresponding pollution load concentration considering that the cumulative value of pollutants in the park is difficult to monitor it is not recommended to sample in the park area instead the green space beside the road was used for sampling at present there are no residents living in residential areas so the pollutant accumulation value of low density residential areas near the study area was selected as the boundary of the model in the measurement the water quality determination parameters of sampling site 1 are shown in table 1 the overall calibration effect was high as shown in fig 2 the monitoring value of cod after 60min was higher than the simulation result which may have been caused by monitoring errors or other factors meanwhile from the overall trend the simulation results were consistent with the general pollutant scour outflow concentration the calibration results of sampling site 1 can be effectively used to simulate the runoff pollution of all levels of roads in yuelai new town the water quality correction parameters of sampling site 2 are shown in table s2 and the calibration results are shown in figure s1 the calibration result of tn was good reflecting the trend of monitoring data the simulation results of ss and cod were essentially consistent with the normal physical trend but the simulation value was generally lower than the measured value the tp monitoring data values were all below 0 2 mm l under low concentration conditions the monitoring data were greatly affected by monitoring errors and sampling conditions so it was difficult to obtain a good fitting result the planning area of residential land in yuelai new town is about 36 5 the calibration results of sampling site 2 played an important role in the calculation of storm runoff non point source pollution in the whole yuelai new town the water quality correction parameters of sampling site 3 are shown in table s3 and the calibration results are shown in figure s2 the results of the water quality calibration show that the simulated values of ss and tn were good which generally reflected the trend of monitoring data the difference between the simulated value and the measured value of cod gradually increased after 70 minutes the reason may be that the cod monitoring data are affected by other factors this result is inconsistent with the general pollutant rainfall erosion model the simulation results did not reflect the trend of the measured data after 70 minutes the simulated value of tp differed greatly from the measured value of tp through the study of the change in the water quality of grassland runoff it is helpful to analyze the reduction contribution of increasing green space to non point source pollution 3 2 model parameters for different schemes the newly built area of yuelai new town based on traditional development is similar to other urban areas in terms of its features the impermeable surface area of the area is large thus the non point sources within the area have fast stormwater production flows large flows and an especially high pollutant content in initial runoff in addition compared with plain cities yuelai new town has its own unique characteristics of mountain cities the urban terrain slope is large and the vertical layout is trapezoidal in comparison to during other periods during the rainfall period the urban production flow is faster and the confluence time is shorter to accurately evaluate the impact of traditional planning and sponge city construction on urban runoff and non point source pollution four scenarios were designed namely the non point source pollution scenario simulation before development fd the non point source pollution scenario simulation of traditional development td the non point source pollution simulation in the sponge city planning scheme scp and the non point source pollution simulation in the sponge city optimization scheme sco before development the study area was basically in a state of natural basin with only sporadic villages scattered throughout it the underlying surface was similar to the urban green space so the calibration parameters of the model for the non point source pollution model in the research area were selected as the calibration parameters of medium green space and low density housing pollutant accumulation per unit area and the erosion coefficient are shown in table s4 the erosion factor is characterized by percentage of pollutants washed out by rainfall of 20 mm b according to the urban design and planning of yuelai new town after the construction of yuelai new town the main land would be residential land and roads for the fd the calibration parameters pollutant accumulation per unit area and erosion coefficient of non point source pollution model parameters of different land types are shown in the table s5 the soil type of chongqing is clay and the infiltration capacity is based on the form of permeable pavement the permeability coefficient is 3 00 10 8 1 41 10 7 m s according to the actual situation of a thin 5 m 6 m soil layer and minimal infiltration capacity in chongqing the permeability coefficient is 1 00 10 7 m s without considering the influence of other cases the 24 h infiltration amount is 8 64 mm the permeability coefficient in scad is 0 325 different lid facilities and corresponding permeability coefficients in the scp are shown in table s6 after the development of the sponge city the land use function of the urban plots did not change therefore the parameters of non point source pollution models of different land uses are the same as those of traditional source pollution models there is currently no detailed design plan for green space in the overall plan of the sponge city according to simulation results in section 3 1 simply increasing green space cannot effectively reduce non point source pollution brought by urban runoff therefore in the sco 12 of the ordinary green space was considered to be converted into sunken green space the storage depth of 20 cm is increased and the original 18 of the green space of the residential area and 8 of the original common green space of roads and other land are retained the parameters of the sunken green space were based on the design parameters in other sponge cities permeable pavement is consistent with sponge city master plan the specific facility parameters are shown in table s7 3 3 yuelai sponge city non point source pollution simulation the peak concentrations of ss cod tn and tp in each area of yuelai new town under different development modes are in fig 3 in the pre development state ss had a high peak concentration in the river it is speculated that in the natural state ss accumulation is high and easy to scour after traditional development the peak concentrations of cod tn and tp into the river increased significantly among which ss increased by 56 7 cod increased by 465 tn increased by 2930 and tp increased by 49 8 traditional development resulted in substantial non point source pollution with the acceleration of urbanization the pollution of water bodies will become increasingly serious compared with the traditional development sponge city construction results in the concentrations of all kinds of pollutants flowing into the river slightly reduced with the increase in the green land rate and infiltration pavement only under the sponge city planning scheme the peak concentrations of pollutants into the river were 1000 mg l for ss 180 mg l for cod 12 0 mg l for tn and 0 02 mg l for tp the concentration of pollutants into the river decreases rapidly with rainfall under the optimization scheme the peak of ss concentration in sponge city significantly increased reaching 1915 39 mg l but the peak concentrations of cod tn and tp were not significantly different from those before the development as shown in fig 4 in the predevelopment state the pollutant concentrations in the river from rainfall runoff were all low except ss indicating that in the natural state the rainfall runoff in the study area would scarcely bring pollution into the water system after traditional development the cumulative amount of major pollutants flowing into the river increased significantly in comparison to after traditional development there was no significant difference in the amount of main pollutants accumulated into the river after the sponge city design interestingly after the sponge city optimization scheme design the cumulative amount of the main pollutants into the river basically recovered to levels that existed before development therefore in comparison to the sponge city development model that simply increased the green land rate the sponge city development model that increased the sunken green space more obviously decreased urban non point source pollution the main reason for this result was that yuelai new town is a typical mountain city with fast runoff high runoff surface velocity and confluence period in comparison to ordinary green space sunken green space better intercepts and purifies runoff pollution 3 4 the reduction ratio of the pollutant in different zones in the yuelai new town the reduction ratio of the pollution load of different non point sources of pollutants in scp and sco is shown in table 2 under the scp model the accumulation of pollutants into the river is reduced however the reduction was less with cod at approximately 10 and tp at approximately 5 therefore it was indicated that the sponge city construction under the condition of increasing the green land rate and permeating pavement only reduced the concentration of various pollutants into the river slightly and the total pollution load also decreased compared with traditional development mode under the sco mode the ss reduction ratio of yuelai new town is 53 7 the cod reduction ratio is 93 0 the tn reduction ratio is 95 9 and the tp reduction ratio is 95 3 indicating that good sponge city development mode has a very good effect on reducing non point source pollution brought by urban runoff in addition the contribution rates of different zones smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone to the reduction in different pollutants were calculated respectively as shown in fig 5 in terms of cod reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone is 45 1 43 2 and 11 7 respectively in terms of ss reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 41 4 38 2 and 20 4 respectively in terms of tn reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 43 9 45 8 and 10 3 respectively in terms of tp reduction the contribution rates of smart zone exhibition zone and eco zone were 43 0 47 2 and 9 8 respectively yuelai new city is a typical mountain city with fast runoff high runoff surface velocity and confluence period compared with common green space sunken green space has better interception and purification effect on runoff and pollution caused by runoff with the acceleration of urbanization urban non point source pollution caused by traditional development is becoming more and more serious compared with traditional development pollution caused by urban rainfall and runoff can be significantly improved through sponge construction indexes of main pollutants entering rivers can approach the undeveloped state meanwhile for mountainous cities such as chongqing the effect of sunken green space on non point source pollution interception and purification is obviously better than ordinary green space in the construction of sponge city it is necessary to pay attention to the construction of facilities such as sunken green space and other source control types 4 conclusion combined with the actual demand of yuelai new town construction a complete and effective urban watershed water system pollution model was established based on the surface pollutant accumulation process and scour process calculation model the simulation results were in good agreement with the measured data the simulated values of the peak concentrations of ss cod tn and tp and the cumulative amounts of the four main pollutants flowing into the river were analyzed compared with the traditional development mode under the sco mode the ss reduction ratio of yuelai new town is 53 7 the cod reduction ratio is 93 0 the tn reduction ratio is 95 9 and the tp reduction ratio is 95 3 it was found that under the sponge city development mode the contribution ratio of smart zone and exhibition zone account for 45 1 and 43 2 in terms of cod reduction the research results will provide theoretical technical and methodological support for the sponge city demonstration pilot in chongqing which will be helpful for promoting this type of developing in the three gorges reservoir area and mountain cities in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1011,owing to their widespread use pharmaceuticals have become important pollutants of the aquatic environment pharmaceuticals and parasites can affect the immunity physiology and behaviour of target organisms both singly and through interaction in this study we related pharmaceutical concentration parasite infection and condition in brown trout salmo trutta m fario collected at localities upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant stp the sites were separated by a weir preventing fish migration pharmaceutical number and concentrations differed significantly between sites antibiotics and antidepressants were found at the highest concentrations at both localities though fish condition and overall parasite abundance did not differ between sites there was a significant difference in parasite community composition a higher abundance of monogenean ectoparasites along with a lower abundance of endoparasites was observed at the downstream locality the adverse effect of pharmaceutical load on ecto and endoparasitic species on brown trout was further confirmed at the individual level using multivariate analysis both the number and concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues reflected their high incidence in the environment confirming the ability of trout to bioaccumulate pharmaceuticals this could have important consequences on fish health particularly in small streams where stp effluent represents a high proportion of stream flow keywords aquatic pollution brown trout health indicators parasites sewage treatment plants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction despite improvements in cleaning technology incomplete water treatment at sewage treatment plants stp results in a range of contaminants being released into surface waters zenker et al 2014 contamination by heavy metals personal care products and persistent organic pollutants has been the subject of extensive research in recent years austin 1999 schwarzenbach et al 2006 baresel et al 2015 brazova et al 2015 while presence of pharmaceuticals in free waters has started to receive more attention recently sanderson et al 2004 owing to their extensive and increasing use in human and veterinary medicine pharmaceuticals are now considered emerging environmental pollutants grabicova et al 2015 2017 further while hundreds of such compounds have been identified in stp effluents surface waters seawater and groundwater their impact on wildlife and ecosystems remains poorly understood küster and adler 2014 aus der beek et al 2016 as most pharmaceuticals are designed to quickly medicate and leave the human animal body they remain pharmacologically active in the environment what is more many pharmaceutical compounds undergo transformation in the body leading to the release of metabolites nikolaou et al 2007 some of which are more toxic than the parent compounds garcía galán et al 2008 in the aquatic environment pharmaceuticals may form complex mixtures making it difficult to link individual elements with environmental impact even at low concentrations such mixtures may also lead to synergistic interactions ebele et al 2017 that produce stronger effects on target

as an example parasites may interfere with a host s immunological defence thereby increasing the impact of a toxic substance sasal et al 2007 and reducing resistance tolerance to further parasitic infection marcogliese and pietrock 2011 on the other hand pollution has been shown to decrease some parasite populations especially those with complex life cycles sures et al 2017 pollution induced reductions in intermediate host abundance can significantly reduce parasite population density while directly exposed parasites e g external parasites or free living stages may be highly susceptible to a wide range of pollutants blanar et al 2009 finally pollution may also alter parasite or host behaviour and indirectly affect host parasite dynamics especially in more complex systems though the interaction between hosts parasites and environmental pollutants particularly heavy metals has been widely studied see sures et al 2017 for review the effect of pharmaceutical pollution on aquatic biota has received much less attention despite their increasing use by humans based on previous studies we predicted different effects of pharmaceutical load on the abundance of parasites with direct ectoparasites in this study and complex endoparasites life cycles and consequently their effect on fish condition using wild brown trout salmo trutta m fario collected from localities separated by a weir upstream and downstream of a small urban stp as a model species this study seeks to assess potential relationships between pharmaceutical loading parasitic infection and trout condition trout are a common species in small lotic habitats and are known to host a range of both endo and ectoparasites pharmaceuticals health status and parasites were quantified in the same individual fish at both stp affected and unaffected localities and the effects of particular pharmaceutical compounds on fish health and parasite abundance were linked using a multivariate approach in addition the effects of intermediate host presence absence and fish host diet were assessed in order to exclude simple explanations for any differences in trophically transmitted parasite abundance between localities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area brown trout stocked as 0 juveniles by the local angling club all fish genetically comparable to the local wild brown trout population and macrozoobenthos samples were collected from the zivny stream 13 km long av depth 30 cm av width 3 m a tributary of the river blanice elbe basin in the south west of the czech republic the stream is highly impacted by effluent from the prachatice stp with recent studies showing higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals grabicova et al 2015 2017 giang et al 2018 and cosmetic chemicals li et al 2011 downstream of the stp but comparable concentrations of industrial chemicals pcbs ddts at upstream and downstream sites li et al 2011 effluent from the stp can represent up to 25 of the water flowing through the stream a detailed description of the stream and the treatment process employed at the prachatice stp are given in grabicova et al 2015 two localities were selected for sampling the first located 600 m

and all fauna captured were placed in plastic bottles and preserved in 4 formaldehyde samples were collected from three main habitats shoreline main streamline lotic habitat and a pool macroinvertebrates were sorted in the laboratory determined to the lowest practicable taxonomic level by visual inspection and comparison with identification keys provided by waringer and graf 2011 and rozkosny 1980 brown trout 10 20 per month were caught at the upstream and downstream localities between june and december 2015 five sampling events using the same capture methods outlined above in order to assess the range and quantity of potential intermediate parasite hosts in the diet trout stomach contents were flushed out with 150 ml of water applied from a syringe fitted with a soft plastic tube and immediately preserved in 4 formaldehyde kamler and pope 2001 all fish were then released back to the stream unharmed in the laboratory the contents of the digestive tract were determined to the lowest practicable taxonomic group under a binocular microscope and the quantity of each item calculated as ephemeroptera mollusca and crustaceans all serve as intermediate hosts for brown trout parasites with ephemeroptera hosting salmonema ephemeridarum nematoda and crepidostomum metoecus trematoda and aquatic molluscs and crustaceans involved in the life cycle of c metoecus petkevičiūtė et al 2018 special attention was paid to these taxa 2 4 fish tissue analysis samples of liver brain and kidney tissue were extracted from each fish and analysed for pharmaceutical compounds according to the validated methods of grabicova et al 2018 in brief internal standards extraction solvent and a homogenising ball were added to the weighed tissue sample which was then homogenised and centrifuged the supernatant was then filtered and frozen at 20 c for 24 h whereupon it was defrosted and analysed using a liquid chromatograph coupled with a high resolution mass

sampled mean abundance expressed as the mean number of parasites in all hosts combined and intensity of infection expressed as the number of individuals of a particular parasite species in a single infected host bush et al 1997 overall parasite abundance was measured as the total abundance of all parasite species per individual host owing to collinearity between parameters of pharmaceutical load concentrations of several pharmaceutical compounds fish condition fish sl condition indices and parasite abundance principal component analysis pca was conducted to simplify the matrix with the scores of the first two components pc1 pc2 used for further analysis for pharmaceutical load the sum of pharmaceutical concentrations in particular medicinal classes in each fish tissue was used medicinal classes with just one positive sample were excluded from the analysis as scores of both components were negatively correlated with the concentration of most compounds pc1 and pc2 values 1 were multiplied and used as a measure positively associated with pharmaceutical load for further analysis the abundance of each parasite species was used for parasitological load while log transformation was used for pharmaceutical concentration and parasite abundance fish sl condition indices and parasite abundance were compared between localities using the non parametric mann whithey u test while between site differences in pc scores were tested using the t test associations between parasite infection fish parameters and pharmaceutical load expressed by scores obtained from the pca analysis

the kidney and brain with the same pattern observed at both localities antibiotics and antidepressants were detected at highest concentrations at both localities the number of pharmaceutical compounds detected in a single fish ranged from 5 to 13 at the upstream reference locality and from 14 to 27 at the downstream polluted locality n desmethylcitalopram a metabolite of the antidepressant citalopram and the antibiotic azithromycin were detected in the liver and kidney respectively of all fish supplementary table s1 overall pharmaceutical load was expressed by the first two components

taxa except trichoptera diptera excluding chironomid larvae and coleoptera being higher downstream crustacea for example were ca 20 times greater in density downstream while hirudinea density was five times greater and ephemeroptera oligochaeta chironomidae and mollusca density more than twice that of the upstream locality while the proportion of ephemeroptera and mollusca was comparable between localities the proportion of crustaceans at the downstream locality was higher fig 2 a analysis of brown trout stomach content showed a similar representation of macroinvertebrate taxa at both localities fig 2b though with a higher proportion of hirudinea 15 vs 1 ephemeroptera 8 vs 3 and crustacea 20 vs 3 and a lower proportion of trichoptera 4 vs 17 and mollusca 0 vs 8 at the downstream locality 4 discussion 4 1 fish health status though pharmaceuticals are generally designed to have low toxicity they may have unintended side effects particularly to non target species such as fish moreover in the aquatic environment fish are continuously exposed to pharmaceuticals potentially increasing the likelihood of long term chronic biological effects corcoran et al 2010 galus et al 2013 both an increase e g giang et al 2018 and decrease in somatic condition have been reported for a number of fish species in ecosystems with poor water quality e g benejam et al 2010 nevertheless our study indicated no significant difference in condition parameters between the polluted downstream and reference upstream localities see fig 2b despite a higher prey availability a higher concentration of antibiotics and anthelmintics that could potentially prevent infection and a slightly higher water temperature 0 9 c at the downstream site which could affect fish metabolism and efficiency of energy transmission giang et al 2018 also at the downstream site pharmaceutical load expressed by the pc1 axis which was mainly associated with concentration of psychoactive drugs and beta blockers increased with fish sl as the fish used in this study were of the same age differences in fish sl may have reflected at least partially higher food intake increased consumption of benthic organisms also containing pharmaceutical compounds grabicova et al 2015 may then have contributed to higher concentrations of several pharmaceuticals in larger fish via bioaccumulation 4 2 concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish despite an absence of fish migration between studied localities confirmed by giang et al 2018 pharmaceuticals were detected in fish tissues at both localities the high number of pharmaceutical compounds detected in our fish 42 in total with up to 27 in a single fish at the downstream polluted locality and up to 13 at the upstream reference locality is representative of the high number of pharmaceuticals presently used in human and veterinary medicine in the region of the 15 medicinal classes detected in brown trout tissues antidepressants antibiotics and beta blockers were the most frequently found and exhibited highest concentrations again corroborating previous studies on pharmaceutical compounds in both the aquatic environment nikolaou et al 2007 and aquatic biota grabicova et al 2015 2017 moreno gonzáles et al 2016 of these n desmethylcitalopram a metabolite of the antidepressant citalopram and the antibiotic azithromycin were observed in all fish samples with individual concentrations of over 100 ng g in either liver or kidney downstream of the stp while fish can potentially accumulate pharmaceuticals through the dermal and gill surfaces or maternally through the egg s lipid reserve corcoran et al 2010 our results indicate that uptake through diet can also serve as an important contamination route previous studies on the zivny stream have recorded relatively high concentrations of azithromycin in benthic organisms despite low concentrations in the water strongly supporting pharmaceutical bioacumulation as mentioned above grabicova et al 2015 both azithromycin and citalopram have previously been recorded in hydropsyche sp caddisflies grabicova et al 2015 trichopteran caddisflies were an important dietary item for brown trout in this study fig 2b especially at the upstream reference locality most likely explaining the detection of azithromycin in all fish upstream of the stp despite concentrations of this antibiotic repeatedly having been reported as below the limits of quantification in water samples from the same locality grabicova et al 2015 giang et al 2018 brodin et al 2014 also demonstrated prey consumption as a significant exposure route for bioaccumulation of the psychiatric drug oxazepam in a fish predator the importance of exposure via the food web may also be supported by our observation of higher overall pharmacological load in larger 1 fish the increase in size possibly resulting from higher food uptake 4 3 parasite abundance while at least 40 helminth parasites are known from brown trout in europe kennedy 1978 barus and oliva 1995 only four species were recorded on fish from our up and downstream localities all species occurring at both localities this low parasite species richness is possibly related to our use of juvenile fish with parasites having had less time to infect the host or simply reflects low parasite abundance in the environment nevertheless the relatively poor parasite community in this study was similar to that reported from lakes in england hartvigsen and kennedy 1993 and streams in italy dezfuli et al 2001 while the overall parasite abundance was comparable between localities the abundance of particular species differed significantly in relation to the contaminant burden reflecting the differing responses of particular parasite species groups to pollutants see neubert et al 2016 although this study was designed to assess relationships between pharmaceutical compounds in fish tissue and parasite infection it was impossible to distinguish the particular role each contaminant may have played in affecting the parasite community due to the wide range of pollutants that fish in the downstream stretch were exposed to thus our results can best be taken as representing the effect of overall contaminant burden including pharmaceuticals on parasite abundance at a particular locality 4 4 parasite response to environmental conditions in this study concentrations of particular compounds and parasite species were quantified in individual fish from two contrasting localities in order to assess possible associations between pharmaceutical load and susceptibility to parasite infection according to sueiro et al 2017 fish may be predisposed to infectious diseases following exposure to xenobiotic contaminants as such pollutants are expected to impact fish immune function our results appear to confirm this overall parasite abundance increased significantly with pharmacological load expressed by the pc1 axis which was associated with most pharmaceutical compounds except cns stimulants recent studies examining the effects of neuroactive pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour dzieweczynski and hebert 2012 barry 2013 indicate that ecological endpoints e g behaviour are more sensitive to pharmaceuticals than more commonly used toxicological endpoints melvin and wilson 2013 as these compounds are designed to change mood nerve function or reduce stress with possible consequences for feeding or predator avoidance in vertebrates and even invertebrates fent et al 2006 such behavioural alterations may also represent a significant factor in addition to impaired immune system functioning increasing host susceptibility to parasite infection while monoxenous parasites with a direct life cycle may benefit from the negative effects of pollution on the fish host by multiplying in number mackenzie 1999 dzikowski et al 2003 benejam et al 2010 unfavourable environmental conditions may interrupt the life cycle of heteroxenous parasites resulting in a decrease in species richness and abundance lafferty 1997 mackenzie 1999 neubert et al 2016 our results correspond with these findings at both the population and individual level supporting our main hypothesis at the population level increased ectoparasitic g derjavinoides and decreased endoparasitic s epemeridarum c metoecus abundance was observed at the downstream polluted locality environmental pollution is known to negatively affect a fish s skin and gills potentially leading to colonisation by infectious microorganisms austin 1999 individuals weakened in this way are more likely to be infected by parasites and especially surface parasites evering and weiss 2006 increased abundance of g derjavinoides at the individual level corresponded with increasing concentrations of pharmaceutical load expressed by the pc1 axis which was mainly associated with antidepressants beta blockers anti dementia drugs and antipsychotics such neuroactive pharmaceuticals particularly in complex environmental mixtures may potentially impact fish behaviour and ecology brodin et al 2013 2014 fish harbouring gyrodactylid parasites for example display flashing or scratching behaviour walker et al 2004 which can increase the transmission of such parasites from one host to another through direct contact bakke et al 1992 thereby multiplying both the effect of the pharmaceuticals and the parasite s own reproduction strategy parasites with complex life cycles must successfully infect all hosts in its life cycle in order to survive and reproduce and yet abundance of endoparasites c metoecus s ephemeridarum was lower at the downstream locality despite intermediate host density being higher than at the upstream locality as availability of intermediate hosts was not a limiting factor at our study locality it is more likely that the parasite life cycle was disrupted at the free living stage i e miracidia or cercariae for c metoecus and the egg stage for s ephemeridarum this being when the hosts are in direct contact with water borne pollutants pietrock and marcogliese 2003 abundance of s ephemeridarum increased with fish sl with larger fish containing higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals increased food uptake including intermediate hosts of parasites such as s ephemeridarum may therefore result in higher parasite abundance in larger i e more intensively feeding fish and possibly increased bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues as mention above in our study anthelmintics were recorded in both upstream and downstream localities no doubt due to the presence of many livestock farms in the region surrounding the zivny stream anthelmintics administrated to animals enter the environment through excretion of faeces and urine where they persist and potentially impact on non target organisms boxall et al 2012 exposure of lower helminth developmental stages to such compounds may encourage development of drug resistant helminth strains horvat et al 2012 as anthelmintics contributed significantly to the pharmacological load expressed by the pc1 axis rs 0 82 our results indicate a positive association with abundance of g derjavinoides and anthelmintics which is diametrically opposite to what might be expected thus our results point to the potential for acquired resistance in brown trout helminth parasites with subsequent impacts on fisheries and or aquaculture 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the ability of juvenile trout in a small stream affected by stp effluent to accumulate relatively high amounts of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds despite relatively low concentrations in the water grabicova et al 2015 2017 giang et al 2018 information on pharmaceutical bioaccumulation remains relatively scarce with even less known about bioaccumulation of pharmaceutical products in complex mixtures hence further detailed research is still required recent studies suggest that even chronic exposure at low concentrations is sufficient to produce an adverse impact on fish populations galus et al 2013 this is even more relevant in small streams where stp effluent can make up a high proportion of the overall flow and where aquatic organisms are exposed to a wide range of xenobiotics in addition to the pharmaceutical cocktail tested in this study though fish from the downstream locality showed no significant difference in somatic condition to those from the upstream locality negative effects may be more strongly manifested as the fish mature similarly the lack of any significant difference in total parasite abundance between the up and downstream localities may imply that pollution has no significant effect on parasite abundance nevertheless pca performed on parasite abundance data fig 1d showed clear differences between the two sites highlighting differences at the community composition level with further implications for the host parasite balance bakke et al 1992 host parasite interactions under natural conditions are highly complex thus variations in parasitism levels are more likely to reflect a combination of factors such as season host age and parasite host density in addition to biotic and abiotic environmental components sueiro et al 2017 this study was designed to eliminate the effects of such factors by using fish of the same size and thus likely to be the same age caught at the same time under comparable environmental conditions excluding concentration of pharmaceuticals thus differences in the abundance of particular parasite species observed in this study most likely reflect changes in water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1011,owing to their widespread use pharmaceuticals have become important pollutants of the aquatic environment pharmaceuticals and parasites can affect the immunity physiology and behaviour of target organisms both singly and through interaction in this study we related pharmaceutical concentration parasite infection and condition in brown trout salmo trutta m fario collected at localities upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant stp the sites were separated by a weir preventing fish migration pharmaceutical number and concentrations differed significantly between sites antibiotics and antidepressants were found at the highest concentrations at both localities though fish condition and overall parasite abundance did not differ between sites there was a significant difference in parasite community composition a higher abundance of monogenean ectoparasites along with a lower abundance of endoparasites was observed at the downstream locality the adverse effect of pharmaceutical load on ecto and endoparasitic species on brown trout was further confirmed at the individual level using multivariate analysis both the number and concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues reflected their high incidence in the environment confirming the ability of trout to bioaccumulate pharmaceuticals this could have important consequences on fish health particularly in small streams where stp effluent represents a high proportion of stream flow keywords aquatic pollution brown trout health indicators parasites sewage treatment plants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction despite improvements in cleaning technology incomplete water treatment at sewage treatment plants stp results in a range of contaminants being released into surface waters zenker et al 2014 contamination by heavy metals personal care products and persistent organic pollutants has been the subject of extensive research in recent years austin 1999 schwarzenbach et al 2006 baresel et al 2015 brazova et al 2015 while presence of pharmaceuticals in free waters has started to receive more attention recently sanderson et al 2004 owing to their extensive and increasing use in human and veterinary medicine pharmaceuticals are now considered emerging environmental pollutants grabicova et al 2015 2017 further while hundreds of such compounds have been identified in stp effluents surface waters seawater and groundwater their impact on wildlife and ecosystems remains poorly understood küster and adler 2014 aus der beek et al 2016 as most pharmaceuticals are designed to quickly medicate and leave the human animal body they remain pharmacologically active in the environment what is more many pharmaceutical compounds undergo transformation in the body leading to the release of metabolites nikolaou et al 2007 some of which are more toxic than the parent compounds garcía galán et al 2008 in the aquatic environment pharmaceuticals may form complex mixtures making it difficult to link individual elements with environmental impact even at low concentrations such mixtures may also lead to synergistic interactions ebele et al 2017 that produce stronger effects on target organisms compared with individual compounds of the same concentration e g cleuvers 2003 or alter the body s production of proteins e g vitellogenin thorpe et al 2007 in fish pharmaceuticals have been shown to induce changes in social behaviour feeding behaviour and general activity patterns e g brodin et al 2013 as well as affecting reproduction lalone et al 2012 and speed of movement nassef et al

behaviour brodin et al 2014 multiple stressors e g pollution and parasites may directly affect host health and increase mortality or susceptibility to disease sures et al 2017 day et al 2007 parasites may alter host physiological or biochemical responses to a pollutant in alternate directions depending on whether stressors interact in a synergistic antagonistic or additive manner sures et al 2017 as an example parasites may interfere with a host s immunological defence thereby increasing the impact of a toxic substance sasal et al 2007 and reducing resistance tolerance to further parasitic infection marcogliese and pietrock 2011 on the other hand pollution has been shown to decrease some parasite populations especially those with complex life cycles sures et al 2017 pollution induced reductions in intermediate host abundance can significantly reduce parasite population density while directly exposed parasites e g external parasites or free living stages may be highly susceptible to a wide range of pollutants blanar et al 2009 finally pollution may also alter parasite or host behaviour and indirectly affect host parasite dynamics especially in more complex systems though the interaction between hosts parasites and environmental pollutants particularly heavy metals has been widely studied see sures et al 2017 for review the effect of pharmaceutical pollution on aquatic biota has received much less attention despite their increasing use by humans based on previous studies we predicted different effects of pharmaceutical load on the abundance of parasites with direct ectoparasites in this study and complex endoparasites life cycles and consequently their effect on fish condition using wild brown trout salmo trutta m fario collected from localities separated by a weir upstream and downstream of a small urban stp as a model species this study seeks to assess potential relationships between pharmaceutical loading parasitic infection and trout condition trout are a common species in small lotic habitats and are known to host a range of both endo and ectoparasites pharmaceuticals health status and parasites were quantified in the same individual fish at both stp affected and unaffected localities and the effects of particular pharmaceutical compounds on fish health and parasite abundance were linked using a multivariate approach in addition the effects of intermediate host presence absence and fish host diet were assessed in order to exclude simple explanations for any differences in trophically transmitted parasite abundance between localities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area brown trout stocked as 0 juveniles by the local angling club all fish genetically comparable to the local wild brown trout population and macrozoobenthos samples were collected from the zivny stream 13 km long av depth 30 cm av width 3 m a tributary of the river blanice elbe basin in the south west of the czech republic the stream is highly impacted by

macroinvertebrates were sorted in the laboratory determined to the lowest practicable taxonomic level by visual inspection and comparison with identification keys provided by waringer and graf 2011 and rozkosny 1980 brown trout 10 20 per month were caught at the upstream and downstream localities between june and december 2015 five sampling events using the same capture methods outlined above in order to assess the range and quantity of potential intermediate parasite hosts in the diet trout stomach contents were flushed out with 150 ml of water applied from a syringe fitted with a soft plastic tube and immediately preserved in 4 formaldehyde kamler and pope 2001 all fish were then released back to the stream unharmed in the laboratory the contents of the digestive tract were determined to the lowest practicable taxonomic group under a binocular microscope and the quantity of each item calculated as ephemeroptera mollusca and crustaceans all serve as intermediate hosts for brown trout parasites with ephemeroptera hosting salmonema ephemeridarum nematoda and crepidostomum metoecus trematoda and aquatic molluscs and crustaceans involved in the life cycle of c metoecus petkevičiūtė et al 2018 special attention was paid to these taxa 2 4 fish tissue analysis samples of liver brain and kidney tissue were extracted from each fish and analysed for pharmaceutical compounds according to the validated methods of grabicova et al 2018 in brief internal standards extraction solvent and a homogenising ball were added to the weighed tissue sample which was then homogenised and centrifuged the supernatant was then filtered and frozen at 20 c for 24 h whereupon it was defrosted and analysed using a liquid chromatograph coupled with a high resolution mass

classes with just one positive sample were excluded from the analysis as scores of both components were negatively correlated with the concentration of most compounds pc1 and pc2 values 1 were multiplied and used as a measure positively associated with pharmaceutical load for further analysis the abundance of each parasite species was used for parasitological load while log transformation was used for pharmaceutical concentration and parasite abundance fish sl condition indices and parasite abundance were compared between localities using the non parametric mann whithey u test while between site differences in pc scores were tested using the t test associations between parasite infection fish parameters and pharmaceutical load expressed by scores obtained from the pca analysis

taxa except trichoptera diptera excluding chironomid larvae and coleoptera being higher downstream crustacea for example were ca 20 times greater in density downstream while hirudinea density was five times greater and ephemeroptera oligochaeta chironomidae and mollusca density more than twice that of the upstream locality while the proportion of ephemeroptera and mollusca was comparable between localities the proportion of crustaceans at the downstream locality was higher fig 2 a analysis of brown trout stomach content showed a similar representation of macroinvertebrate taxa at both localities fig 2b though with a higher proportion of hirudinea 15 vs 1 ephemeroptera 8 vs 3 and crustacea 20 vs 3 and a lower proportion of trichoptera 4 vs 17 and mollusca 0 vs 8 at the downstream locality 4 discussion 4 1 fish health status though pharmaceuticals are generally designed to have low toxicity they may have unintended side effects particularly to non target species such as fish moreover in the aquatic environment fish are continuously exposed to pharmaceuticals potentially increasing the likelihood of long term chronic biological effects corcoran et al 2010 galus et al 2013 both an increase e g giang et al 2018 and decrease in somatic condition have been reported for a number of fish species in ecosystems with poor water quality e g benejam et al 2010 nevertheless our study indicated no significant difference in condition parameters between the polluted downstream and reference upstream localities see fig 2b despite a higher prey availability a higher concentration of antibiotics and anthelmintics that could potentially prevent infection and a slightly higher water temperature 0 9 c at the downstream site which could affect fish metabolism and efficiency of energy transmission giang et al 2018 also at the downstream site pharmaceutical load expressed by the pc1 axis which was mainly associated with concentration of psychoactive drugs and beta blockers increased with fish sl as the fish used in this study were of the same age differences in fish sl may have reflected at least partially higher food intake increased consumption of benthic organisms also containing pharmaceutical compounds grabicova et al 2015 may then have contributed to higher concentrations of several pharmaceuticals in larger fish via bioaccumulation 4 2 concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish despite an absence of fish migration between studied localities confirmed by giang et al 2018 pharmaceuticals were detected in fish tissues at both localities the high number of pharmaceutical compounds detected in our fish 42 in total with up to 27 in a single fish at the downstream polluted locality and up to 13 at the upstream reference locality is representative of the high number of pharmaceuticals presently used in human and veterinary medicine in the region of the 15 medicinal classes detected in brown trout tissues antidepressants antibiotics and beta blockers were the most frequently found and exhibited highest concentrations again corroborating previous studies on pharmaceutical compounds in both the aquatic environment nikolaou et al 2007 and aquatic biota grabicova et al 2015 2017 moreno gonzáles et al 2016 of these n desmethylcitalopram a metabolite of the antidepressant citalopram and the antibiotic azithromycin were observed in all fish samples with individual concentrations of over 100 ng g in either liver or kidney downstream of the stp while fish can potentially accumulate pharmaceuticals through the dermal and gill surfaces or maternally through the egg s lipid reserve corcoran et al 2010 our results indicate that uptake through diet can also serve as an important contamination route previous studies on the zivny stream have recorded relatively high concentrations of azithromycin in benthic organisms despite low concentrations in the water strongly supporting pharmaceutical bioacumulation as mentioned above grabicova et al 2015 both azithromycin and citalopram have previously been recorded in hydropsyche sp caddisflies grabicova et al 2015 trichopteran caddisflies were an important dietary item for brown trout in this study fig 2b especially at the upstream reference locality most likely explaining the detection of azithromycin in all fish upstream of the stp despite concentrations of this antibiotic repeatedly having been reported as below the limits of quantification in water samples from the same locality grabicova et al 2015 giang et al 2018 brodin et al 2014 also demonstrated prey consumption as a significant exposure route for bioaccumulation of the psychiatric drug oxazepam in a fish predator the importance of exposure via the food web may also be supported by our observation of higher overall pharmacological load in larger 1 fish the increase in size possibly resulting from higher food uptake 4 3 parasite abundance while at least 40 helminth parasites are known from brown trout in europe kennedy 1978 barus and oliva 1995 only four species were recorded on fish from our up and downstream localities all species occurring at both localities this low parasite species richness is possibly related to our use of juvenile fish with parasites having had less time to infect the host or simply reflects low parasite abundance in the environment nevertheless the relatively poor parasite community in this study was similar to that reported from lakes in england hartvigsen and kennedy 1993 and streams in italy dezfuli et al 2001 while the overall parasite abundance was comparable between localities the abundance of particular species differed significantly in relation to the contaminant burden reflecting the differing responses of particular parasite species groups to pollutants see neubert et al 2016 although this study was designed to assess relationships between pharmaceutical compounds in fish tissue and parasite infection it was impossible to distinguish the particular role each contaminant may have played in affecting the parasite community due to the wide range of pollutants that fish in the downstream stretch were exposed to thus our results can best be taken as representing the effect of overall contaminant burden including pharmaceuticals on parasite abundance at a particular locality 4 4 parasite response to environmental conditions in this study concentrations of particular compounds and parasite species were quantified in individual fish from two contrasting localities in order to assess possible associations between pharmaceutical load and susceptibility to parasite infection according to sueiro et al 2017 fish may be predisposed to infectious diseases following exposure to xenobiotic contaminants as such pollutants are expected to impact fish immune function our results appear to confirm this overall parasite abundance increased significantly with pharmacological load expressed by the pc1 axis which was associated with most pharmaceutical compounds except cns stimulants recent studies examining the effects of neuroactive pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour dzieweczynski and hebert 2012 barry 2013 indicate that ecological endpoints e g behaviour are more sensitive to pharmaceuticals than more commonly used toxicological endpoints melvin and wilson 2013 as these compounds are designed to change mood nerve function or reduce stress with possible consequences for feeding or predator avoidance in vertebrates and even invertebrates fent et al 2006 such behavioural alterations may also represent a significant factor in addition to impaired immune system functioning increasing host susceptibility to parasite infection while monoxenous parasites with a direct life cycle may benefit from the negative effects of pollution on the fish host by multiplying in number mackenzie 1999 dzikowski et al 2003 benejam et al 2010 unfavourable environmental conditions may interrupt the life cycle of heteroxenous parasites resulting in a decrease in species richness and abundance lafferty 1997 mackenzie 1999 neubert et al 2016 our results correspond with these findings at both the population and individual level supporting our main hypothesis at the population level increased ectoparasitic g derjavinoides and decreased endoparasitic s epemeridarum c metoecus abundance was observed at the downstream polluted locality environmental pollution is known to negatively affect a fish s skin and gills potentially leading to colonisation by infectious microorganisms austin 1999 individuals weakened in this way are more likely to be infected by parasites and especially surface parasites evering and weiss 2006 increased abundance of g derjavinoides at the individual level corresponded with increasing concentrations of pharmaceutical load expressed by the pc1 axis which was mainly associated with antidepressants beta blockers anti dementia drugs and antipsychotics such neuroactive pharmaceuticals particularly in complex environmental mixtures may potentially impact fish behaviour and ecology brodin et al 2013 2014 fish harbouring gyrodactylid parasites for example display flashing or scratching behaviour walker et al 2004 which can increase the transmission of such parasites from one host to another through direct contact bakke et al 1992 thereby multiplying both the effect of the pharmaceuticals and the parasite s own reproduction strategy parasites with complex life cycles must successfully infect all hosts in its life cycle in order to survive and reproduce and yet abundance of endoparasites c metoecus s ephemeridarum was lower at the downstream locality despite intermediate host density being higher than at the upstream locality as availability of intermediate hosts was not a limiting factor at our study locality it is more likely that the parasite life cycle was disrupted at the free living stage i e miracidia or cercariae for c metoecus and the egg stage for s ephemeridarum this being when the hosts are in direct contact with water borne pollutants pietrock and marcogliese 2003 abundance of s ephemeridarum increased with fish sl with larger fish containing higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals increased food uptake including intermediate hosts of parasites such as s ephemeridarum may therefore result in higher parasite abundance in larger i e more intensively feeding fish and possibly increased bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues as mention above in our study anthelmintics were recorded in both upstream and downstream localities no doubt due to the presence of many livestock farms in the region surrounding the zivny stream anthelmintics administrated to animals enter the environment through excretion of faeces and urine where they persist and potentially impact on non target organisms boxall et al 2012 exposure of lower helminth developmental stages to such compounds may encourage development of drug resistant helminth strains horvat et al 2012 as anthelmintics contributed significantly to the pharmacological load expressed by the pc1 axis rs 0 82 our results indicate a positive association with abundance of g derjavinoides and anthelmintics which is diametrically opposite to what might be expected thus our results point to the potential for acquired resistance in brown trout helminth parasites with subsequent impacts on fisheries and or aquaculture 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the ability of juvenile trout in a small stream affected by stp effluent to accumulate relatively high amounts of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds despite relatively low concentrations in the water grabicova et al 2015 2017 giang et al 2018 information on pharmaceutical bioaccumulation remains relatively scarce with even less known about bioaccumulation of pharmaceutical products in complex mixtures hence further detailed research is still required recent studies suggest that even chronic exposure at low concentrations is sufficient to produce an adverse impact on fish populations galus et al 2013 this is even more relevant in small streams where stp effluent can make up a high proportion of the overall flow and where aquatic organisms are exposed to a wide range of xenobiotics in addition to the pharmaceutical cocktail tested in this study though fish from the downstream locality showed no significant difference in somatic condition to those from the upstream locality negative effects may be more strongly manifested as the fish mature similarly the lack of any significant difference in total parasite abundance between the up and downstream localities may imply that pollution has no significant effect on parasite abundance nevertheless pca performed on parasite abundance data fig 1d showed clear differences between the two sites highlighting differences at the community composition level with further implications for the host parasite balance bakke et al 1992 host parasite interactions under natural conditions are highly complex thus variations in parasitism levels are more likely to reflect a combination of factors such as season host age and parasite host density in addition to biotic and abiotic environmental components sueiro et al 2017 this study was designed to eliminate the effects of such factors by using fish of the same size and thus likely to be the same age caught at the same time under comparable environmental conditions excluding concentration of pharmaceuticals thus differences in the abundance of particular parasite species observed in this study most likely reflect changes in water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1012,relatively short time that passed since the onset of river restoration activities worldwide and a scarcity of monitored restoration projects cause that scientific evidence of changes in restored rivers is still meagre particularly with respect to innovative restoration techniques and long term effects of restoration activities restoration projects realized in the first half of the 2010s in three polish carpathian watercourses resulted in establishing of an erodible corridor in reaches of the biała and the raba rivers and installation of block ramps in the deeply incised channel of krzczonówka stream downstream of a lowered check dam environmental monitoring was conducted in the initial and final phases of the restoration projects and is to be repeated 5 years after their completion this paper i introduces the area of the restoration projects ii informs on their objectives and implementation iii outlines the methodology of the environmental monitoring and of the analysis of immediate and long term effectiveness of the projects in improving the ecological state of the watercourses and reducing flood hazard and iv overviews papers presenting outcomes from the initial phase of the monitoring the analysis of the monitoring data will increase knowledge on effects of the innovative cost effective restoration measures that could be widely used in the carpathian context and thus will be useful for changes in the management of degraded mountain rivers keywords river restoration hydromorphological quality ecological river state flood hazard mountain river 1 introduction during the last century or more most streams and rivers in densely populated regions experienced intense human pressures on their physical structure and the functioning of their riverine and riparian ecosystems malmqvist and rundle 2002 these pressures have been especially pronounced in mountain watercourses wohl 2006 in which the high energy of flood flows facilitates exceedance of the resistance of channel boundaries and leads to rapid morphological and sedimentary adjustments such impacts as channelization in channel gravel mining partitioning of river course by dams and weirs decoupling of channels from floodplains by flood embankments and removal of large wood from channels bravard and petts 1996 caused dramatic changes in the physical structure and habitat integrity of the watercourses muhar and jungwirth 1998 that were reflected in the impoverishment of riverine communities allan and castillo 2007 channel incision a common phenomenon in impacted rivers reduced floodwater retention in floodplain areas and accelerated evacuation of floodwater wyżga et al 2016d increasing flood hazard to downstream reaches wyżga 1997 wyżga et al 2016a with recognition of the abovementioned and other adverse effects of human impacts on watercourses activities aimed to improve their degraded attributes have been undertaken in many countries these activities are collectively called river restoration wohl et al 2015 and apart from improvement of ecological integrity they frequently tend to achieve other goals such as enhancement of recreational use of rivers floodplain reconnection flood management etc dufour and piégay 2009 although many river restoration projects were implemented worldwide particularly in the usa over the last thirty years a vast majority of the projects lacked environmental monitoring rubin et al 2017 and very few were followed by research of long term effects of the implemented measures lorenz et al 2018 monitoring results indicated that restoration projects often fail to achieve the intended ecological objectives palmer et al 2010 or the long term persistence of geomorphic e g kondolf et al 2001 or hydraulic effects e g geerling et al 2008 this seems to be a consequence of a tendency to design and create channels that appear more natural rather than re establish the operation of natural processes particularly geomorphic and hydrological ones that would induce and sustain desired changes in channel form and habitat structure wyżga et al 2018b moreover defining rules of the monitoring that would properly evaluate a success of restoration projects is also a challenge rubin et al 2017 adverse changes in the physical structure and functioning of watercourses caused by human pressures were extensively documented in scientific literature for the rivers of the polish carpathians such evidence was presented with respect to channel morphology e g wyżga 2008 bed substrate e g zawiejska et al 2015 hydraulic conditions

wyżga et al 2009 2011 bylak and kukuła 2018 and riparian communities e g skalski et al 2016 is also well documented however with relatively short time that passed since the onset of restoration activities worldwide and a scarcity of monitored restoration projects scientific evidence of changes in these attributes of restored rivers is still meagre e g wyżga et al 2018b particularly with respect to innovative restoration techniques and long term effects of restoration activities this is especially true with regard to poland where river restoration activities are still in their infancy apart from enhancing self sustainability of the restored rivers good restoration projects should be cost effective and reduce rather than increase flood hazard both in the restored reach and in downstream reaches these criteria seem to be met by an erodible corridor a part of a valley floor where free channel development is allowed the concept of this restoration measure was formulated in western europe piégay et al 1997 2005 and described also in poland bojarski et al 2005 subsequently it has been increasingly applied in mountain and piedmont rivers in europe e g rinaldi et al 2011 including poland nieznański et al 2008 wyżga and zawiejska 2012 the unquestionable advantage of this restoration measure is that it allows a river to restore itself and to adjust fluvial form to its flow regime and sediment load this contrasts with a different approach when river managers create a new channel that may not be adjusted to the actual river regime kondolf 2006 however necessary conditions for a successful self restoration of a river in an erodible corridor are the available space for free channel development on a valley floor and the sufficient power of a river to actively reshape its form kondolf 2012 which may not be met for urban and lowland rivers respectively so far very few scientific analyses of the effects of the application of the restoration measure have been published rohde et al 2005 restoration of deeply incised but relatively narrow streams draining forested corridors can be promoted by enabling spontaneous formation of wood dams from fallen trees or construction and placement of such dams wyżga et al 2016b 2018a in some countries large wood has been widely used in stream restoration but in most of these projects wood was fixed to channel banks which considerably reduced its effects on stream hydraulics and morphology e g kail et al 2007 where there is no forest in the riparian area or channels become wider than the height of riparian trees improvement of conditions in deeply incised streams can be achieved with use of another innovative cost effective restoration measure fish passable transversal structures created from rocky material superimposed on or mixed with river gravels jeleński et al 2016 wyżga et al 2018a such structures called block ramps tamagni et al 2010 or rock riffles newbury et al 2011 newbury 2013 can be applied to control bed erosion reduce flow capacity of incised channels improve aquatic habitat through formation of backwatering pools facilitate sediment entrapment and re establish a pool riffle sequence on the channel bed this paper deals with two river restoration projects carried out in the first half of the 2010s in three polish carpathian watercourses the first project was realized in the biała river with an erodible corridor established in two sections of the upper and middle river course another project was realized in the raba river and its tributary krzczonówka stream and encompassed establishing an erodible corridor in a reach of the upper raba and lowering of a check dam and formation of several block ramps in the stream reach downstream of the dam the implementation of both restoration projects was accompanied by environmental monitoring conducted at their initial and final stages a research project immediate and long term effects of river restoration projects in the polish carpathians aims at environmental monitoring in the area of these restoration projects 5 years after their completion and evaluating immediate that is within the time span of the restoration projects and longer term effectiveness of the restoration measures in improving the ecological state of the watercourses and reducing flood hazard this paper i introduces the area of the restoration projects ii informs on their objectives and implementation iii outlines the methodology of the environmental monitoring and of the analysis of immediate and longer term effectiveness of the projects and iv overviews outcomes from the initial phase of the monitoring 2 field setting fig 1 presents the location of reaches of the three polish carpathian watercourses in which the restoration measures were implemented in the first half of the 2010s the raba and the biała are relatively large rivers draining the western and eastern parts of the polish carpathians respectively whereas krzczonówka stream is one of major tributaries to the raba river the three watercourses drain catchments in the flysch part of the polish carpathians rivers draining the western and eastern parts of the polish carpathians differ somewhat in their physiographic and hydrological characteristics in the western part where mountains of medium height predominate rivers have steep channel gradients and floods caused by prolonged advective rainfall occur during late spring and summer the raba catchment upstream from the reach subjected to restoration has moderately high relief with altitudes up to 1311 m whereas the restored reach is located between 340 and 330 m of altitude the catchment of krzczonówka stream has low mountain relief with the highest point at 867 m a s l and the stream mouth to the raba river at 330 m a s l restoration activities were conducted in the lowest 2 km of stream length in the eastern region main carpathian rivers have long reaches within the foothill and foreland areas where they have gentler channel gradients than the rivers in the western region frequent moderate floods caused by snowmelt typically occur in early spring whereas rare large floods caused by advective rainfall can occur in late spring and summer the biała river in its upper course drains low mountains with the highest point at an altitude of 997 m while foothill areas with altitudes up to 500 m in the middle course the section subjected to restoration in the upper river course is located between 523 and 378 m a s l and that in the middle river course between 292 and 272 m a s l low retention potential of the flysch bedrock results in great variability of water stage and discharge of the studied watercourses the coefficient of flow irregularity ratio of the highest and the lowest discharge on record for the stróża station located downstream of the restored reach of the raba equals 2130 while that for the grybów station characterising runoff from the mountain part of the biała catchment amounts to 7500 reflecting the occurrence of only shallow slope aquifers in this area with the high flow variability and the delivery of coarse grained sandstone material to their channels the raba krzczonówka and the biała in its mountain course are gravel bed watercourses that until the beginning of the twentieth century supported multi thread morphology wyżga et al 2016c the biała in its foothill course is fed with both cobble pebble material and large amounts of fines and consequently it maintains a gravel bed but tends to form a sinuous channel in unmanaged reaches fig 2 b in the twentieth century the three watercourses were channelized with their wide multi thread or sinuous channels replaced by straight narrow channels with reinforced banks in the mid century a 3 7 m high check dam was constructed in krzczonówka disrupting the continuity of the stream for biota migration and resulting in long term sediment starvation of its 2 km long downstream reach moreover in the second half of the century the three watercourses experienced widespread uncontrolled in channel gravel mining cf rinaldi et al 2005 these impacts have induced rapid channel incision that lowered the bed of krzczonówka stream by up to 2 m and those of the raba and the biała rivers by up to 2 5 m and caused transformation of their alluvial beds into bedrock or bedrock alluvial beds in some parts of their course 3 objectives and implementation of the river restoration projects the erodible corridor of the biała river was established in the frame of the project restoring connectivity of the ecological corridor of the biała tarnowska river valley realized in the years 2010 2014 by the regional water management board in kraków its establishing was intended to mitigate the adverse effects of human caused channel changes for the state of the river ecosystem and flood hazard and to initiate river recovery it also aimed to reduce maintenance costs for bank protection structures that are repeatedly destroyed in dynamic mountain rivers cf bojarski et al 2005 wyżga and zawiejska 2012 the erodible corridor was delimited on the basis of three criteria i extent of the zone of channel migration during the last 130 years determined through the analysis of cartographic materials ii extent of floodplain and iii location of buildings and infrastructure that have to remain outside the zone of potential channel migration moreover the erodible corridor was preferentially delimited in those parts of the river course where a large proportion of riparian areas is state owned and the impact of channel migration on private property would be minimal cf piégay et al 1997 bojarski et al 2005 because a majority of native inhabitants of the low beskid mountains were resettled to other areas in the mid twentieth century lach and wyżga 2002 and their lands on the valley floor were nationalized the upper course of the biała was most suitable for establishing an erodible corridor consequently an erodible corridor was delimited in two river sections in the mountain river course on the length of 14 5 km and in its foothill course on the length of 5 9 km fig 1 in both sections relatively long unmanaged channel reaches alternate with short channelized reaches in the vicinity of bridges fig 2 in the upper section the established corridor had mean width of 112 m and was more than four times wider than the average river width 27 m the area of the corridor 1 6 km2 was 12 smaller than the area of the zone of channel migration in the last 130 years which mainly reflected the occurrence of five bridges disrupting continuity of unmanaged channel reaches along the corridor in the lower section mean corridor width was 194 m seven times exceeding the average river width 27 m here the lateral extent of the delimited corridor mainly corresponded to the extent of the floodplain and the area of the corridor exceeded by half the area of the zone of channel migration in the last 130 years restoration activities in the raba and krzczonówka were conducted in the frame of the project the upper raba river spawning grounds realized in the years 2011 2016 by the non governmental organization ab ovo however already in the late 2000s by the decision of water authorities maintenance of channelization structures was abandoned in a 2 3 km long reach of the upper raba where roads and settlements are located close to valley slopes leaving a few hundred metres wide undeveloped corridor for the river fig 3 jeleński and wyżga 2016 the erodible corridor was here formally established within the scope of the restoration project and its lateral extent was delimited on the basis of the extent of state owned land along the river the location of areas overgrown with riparian forest and boundaries of the natura 2000 protected area on the valley floor so delimited erodible corridor had mean width of 224 m and was about 3 5 times wider than the average channel width 63 m in 2009 in may 2010 a 30 year flood caused a considerable widening up to 3 times in some cross sections of the river in this reach after the flood the boundary of the corridor had to be reinforced on a distance of ca 300 m at the place where the migrating river channel approached a local road threatening its stability however the reinforcement did not consist of rip rap or gabions typically constructed on channel banks but instead it was created by substituting river gravels with coarse sandstone rubble mixed with laterite matrix and compacting these materials with a road roller to form a gently sloping surface importantly all these works were conducted without the movement of heavy machinery within a low flow channel of the river following the construction works trees were planted on the external side of the revetments jeleński and wyżga 2016 a principal aim of restoration activities in krzczonówka stream was a lowering of the 3 7 m high check dam to make it passable for fish the works were conducted between april and october 2014 resulting in the lowering of the dam by 1 7 m and adjusting it to enable fish migration through the structure as the planned lowering of the check dam must have released sediments stored behind the dam in march 2013 fourteen block ramps were installed in the deeply incised downstream reach of krzczonówka fig 4 to facilitate entrapment of the sediments flushed out from the dam reservoir jeleński et al 2016 simulations using the hey and thorne regime equations thorne et al 1997 indicated that to remain relatively stable in the deeply incised channel the ramps should consist of the material 3 4 times coarser than that filling the dam reservoir and so the ramps were formed of rock rubble from a nearby quarry with a topping of coarse gravel compacted by a road roller the ramps were also intended to promote re establishment of a riffle and pool pattern of the stream and thus they were located at thalweg inflection points fig 4 jeleński et al 2016 in may 2014 when the works on the check dam were underway a flood flushed out considerable amounts of gravel from the dam reservoir this material was efficiently trapped by block ramps in the downstream reach which resulted in marked aggradation of the stream bed wyżga et al 2018a 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the restoration measures 4 1 general methodology of environmental monitoring in the biała and the raba rivers in which erodible corridors were established abiotic and biotic river characteristics were determined in the initial and final phases of the restoration projects for two sets of closely located freely developing and channelized cross sections figs 2 5 with 10 cross sections of each type in the biała and 6 in the raba the freely developing and channelized cross sections represent similar hydrological conditions but differ in hydromorphological conditions during the current scientific project these observations will be repeated 5 years after the completion of the restoration projects fig 5 observations on effects of the functioning of both rivers in the erodible corridors thus follow a baci experimental design conner et al 2016 for the studies of effects of environmental changes before after the change versus control i e channelized impacted i e restored river cross sections with verification of the after situation not only at the end of the restoration projects but also 5 years after the projects finished fig 5 this will allow for distinguishing changes resulting from river dynamics within the erodible corridors from those induced by temporal variability in climatic and hydrological conditions during the study period analysis of changes recorded at the end of the restoration projects will show immediate effects of the projects while changes recorded 5 years later will inform about longer term project effects in krzczonówka abiotic and biotic stream characteristics were surveyed in 10 cross sections located in the reach restored by construction of block ramps fig 5 here observations were conducted before the onset of restoration activities in 2012 after the construction of block ramps in 2013 during the works on the check dam in 2014 and after their end in 2015 these observations will be repeated 5 years after the end of the restoration works in the stream fig 5 4 2 considered river characteristics and methods of their analysis during the current project we intend to verify the hypotheses that the implemented restoration measures caused significant improvement of three groups of river characteristics achieved either during the restoration projects or in the long term the first group of the hypotheses comprises those concerning hydromorphological quality of the watercourses and complexity of physical habitats fig 5 the hydromorphological state of the watercourses is evaluated with the river hydromorphological quality method that is largely based on a field survey of hydromorphological conditions and has been demonstrated to be particularly useful for the assessment of effects of restoration activities hajdukiewicz et al 2017 complexity of aquatic habitats significantly influences the abundance and richness of fish and benthic invertebrate communities in a mountain river wyżga et al 2009 2011 this complexity will be determined with respect to water depth near bed and depth averaged flow velocity and bed material grain size in the raba river the assessment also comprises characteristics of riparian habitats of ground beetles such as the distance from and the height above the nearest low flow channel surface slope sediment size class and the degree of plant cover the second group of hypotheses to be verified refers to riverine and riparian communities and the assessment of ecological river quality based on fish and benthic invertebrates fig 5 the assessment of changes in the abundance and species richness of fish communities is done on the basis of two electrofishings performed in july and september seasons of distinct thermal conditions and development stages of juvenile fish changes in taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate communities are evaluated on the basis of samplings conducted in spring summer and autumn of a given year the results of surveys of fish and benthic invertebrates are the basis of calculating scores of the european fish index efi and the invertebrate based bmwp pl index and the evaluation of changes in ecological river quality indicated by these indices moreover in the raba surveys of ground beetles conducted in spring summer and autumn of a given year are to be used to determine i how the abundance species richness and diversity of the riparian biota change with time since the onset of river restoration ii how the assemblages vary among the sites with different microhabitat conditions in channelized and freely developing cross sections and iii how seasonal variability in the occurrence patterns of ground beetles influences evaluation of the effects of river restoration on these riparian biota the third group of analysed river characteristics comprises components of flood hazard i flow velocity unit stream power and shear forces responsible for erosional damage during floods and ii the role of floodplain in conveyance i e downstream evacuation and retention of floodwater at discharges of given recurrence intervals fig 5 high values of flow velocity unit stream power and bed shear stress in channelized and incised reaches of mountain rivers radecki pawlik et al 2016 coupled with sediment deficit typifying contemporary polish carpathian rivers underlie high erosional damage caused by these rivers during floods stoffel et al 2016 moreover incised river reaches have a considerably reduced potential for the retention of floodwater in floodplain areas wyżga 1999 numerical modelling of hydraulic conditions typifying channelized and restored reaches of the watercourses at different time since the onset of restoration activities will allow us to verify whether the applied restoration measures reduce the erosional potential of flood flows and increase the retention of floodwater in restored river reaches it seems reasonable to expect that restoration of channelized and incised mountain watercourses attained through either channel widening in erodible corridors or bed aggradation stimulated by block ramps will differently change hydraulic conditions at flood flows 4 3 evaluation of the safety of erodible corridor boundaries reliable prediction of bank retreat and channel migration is crucial for safe functioning of rivers in erodible corridors as it may indicate a need to construct anti erosion revetments on the corridor boundaries where settlements or infrastructure may be threatened by migrating river bojarski et al 2005 in 2012 the authors formulated a prognosis of the probability relative intensity of retreat of the banks of the biała river along the 20 4 km long reaches of its erodible corridor the prognosis was made for more than 800 river segments 25 m in length taking into account four factors i qualitative assessment of resistance of bank material to erosion ii the degree of river narrowing in the course of the twentieth century channelization indicating the degree of a local increase in unit stream power iii the amount of channel incision and iv the presence absence of the direct contact of low flow channel and river bank as well as the angle of the contact of low flow channel with the bank the analysis was based on the reasoning that bank erosion is more probable proceeds faster where bank material is less resistant to erosion the river was considerably narrowed in the course of channelization the channel is not incised and local direction of low flow channel is perpendicular to river bank the analysis was made in relative terms as absolute values of bank retreat channel migration in a given period inevitably depend on the occurrence and magnitude of flood flows in this period we intend to verify the forecasts within the current project as a 9 or 10 year long period seems to be sufficiently long for the comparison of predicted and actual rates of bank retreat in the erodible corridor of the biała river 5 environmental monitoring in the biała and the raba rivers published findings while the analysis of changes in the restored sections of the biała and the raba rivers occurring during the time span of the restoration projects and after their end will be conducted in the frame of the current scientific project some results from the environmental monitoring carried out in the early phases of the restoration projects have already been published wyżga et al 2013 used data about benthic macroinvertebrates water quality and physical habitat characteristics in 10 pairs of closely located channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the biała to verify the common understanding of the invertebrate based bmwp pl index as an indicator of water quality the biological monitoring working party bmwp score system is based on the occurrence of macroinvertebrate families with higher scores ascribed to the taxa typical of fast flowing well oxygenated water and lower scores to the taxa tolerating stagnant poorly oxygenated water armitage et al 1983 hawkes 1998 the bmwp pl index is a variant of this score system adjusted to the composition of macroinvertebrate communities typical of polish rivers dumnicka et al 2006 in the biała the macroinvertebrate taxa richness and the index scores appeared to be significantly related to several physical habitat characteristics especially the complexity of flow pattern and cross sectional variation in flow velocity and bed material grain size at the same time they were unrelated to physicochemical parameters of the river water which consistently indicated high water quality the study by wyżga et al 2013 thus indicated that the bmwp pl index should be considered an indicator of the ecological status of rivers dependent both on their hydromorphological and water quality characteristics sections of the biała river which are to be restored through establishing erodible corridor consist of relatively long unmanaged channel reaches alternating with short channelized reaches close to bridges wyżga et al 2014 investigated effects of these alternating morphologies on benthic invertebrate and fish communities and the appraisal of ecological river quality based on these groups of aquatic biota they found that surveyed channelized cross sections were typified by three times lower taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages on average than unmanaged cross sections and consequently the ecological river quality indicated by the invertebrate based bmwp pl index for the former was worse by about 1 quality class than that for the latter however no statistically significant difference in the number of fish species was recorded between both types of river cross sections and calculated scores of the european fish index allowed both cross section types to be associated with the same class of ecological river quality the study indicated that even though short channelized river reaches provide worse habitats for benthic invertebrates they do not disrupt continuity of fish populations this means that the occurrence of such regulated channel reaches within the established erodible corridor of the biała should not preclude the expected improvement of the ecological state of the river in unmanaged channel reaches hajdukiewicz et al 2016 compared results of the surveys of adjacent unmanaged and channelized reaches of the biała river performed in 2009 and in the late summer 2010 to evaluate changes in channel morphology valley infrastructure and river habitats caused by an 80 year flood in june 2010 they found that although the flood increased active channel width by half in surveyed unmanaged cross sections of the river and by one third in channelized cross sections damage to valley floor infrastructure was limited to the channelized river reaches with reinforced channel banks fig 6 this indicated improper management of riparian areas rather than the degree of river widening as a principal reason for the economic losses during the flood the authors concluded that while establishing erodible corridors is possible in unmanaged river reaches the remaining reaches supporting infrastructure such as bridges will have to be maintained and function as artificial reaches adjusting the infrastructure in these non restored often narrow reaches to the flood hazard is thus essential to limit the risk of material loss this study also found that the large flood increased the variability of physical habitat conditions during low to medium flows in channelized river reaches and decreased it in unmanaged reaches thus obliterating differences in the complexity of physical habitats that previously existed between the river reaches with different style of channel management hajdukiewicz et al 2018 extended the analysis of changes in the biała river resulting from the 80 year flood of june 2010 to fish and benthic invertebrate communities they found that the flood caused similar but relatively small decreases in the species richness of fish and the abundance of subadult and adult fish individuals in channelized and unmanaged river cross sections consequently the flood did not significantly change the ecological river quality indicated by the european fish index with both types of river cross sections falling into the class of good ecological quality before and after the flood fig 7 prior to the flood the unmanaged cross sections hosted 2 3 more benthic invertebrate taxa on average than the channelized ones and the ecological river quality indicated by the invertebrate based bmwp pl index for both cross section types differed by about 1 5 quality class however the flood significantly reduced the number of invertebrate taxa in the unmanaged cross sections so that the taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages and river quality indicated by the bmwp pl index in both cross section types became similar fig 7 the study indicated that extreme hydrological events such as floods or droughts can significantly affect biotic components of river ecosystems and that their impact can vary between river reaches with a different style of channel management as well as between different groups of aquatic biota czech et al 2016 performed one dimensional hydraulic modelling for 10 pairs of neighbouring channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the biała river to determine effects of these differing channel morphologies on the conditions for flood flows they found that flood flows conveyed in freely developed cross sections are typified by significantly greater width fig 8 and significantly lower velocity unit stream power and bed shear stress than those in channelized cross sections of particular importance was that flood flows conveyed in the channel zone of the unmanaged cross sections are typified by significantly reduced values of unit stream power fig 8 and bed shear stress in comparison to those in the channelized cross sections this indicated that despite the early phase of the river functioning in the erodible corridor the river restoration already brings beneficial effects enabling to arrest and possibly revert in the future the tendency to channel incision however the study also indicated that channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the river display a similar low potential for floodwater retention in floodplain areas this reflects the enlargement of channel capacity associated with the channel widening in the freely developing river reaches that has not yet been compensated by bed aggradation hajdukiewicz et al 2017 indicated that assessment of the hydromorphological state of a river should diagnose reasons for its degradation and identify features requiring improvement in the course of restoration actions they used the example of the biała river to demonstrate usefulness of the river hydromorphological quality method for the river assessment for restoration purposes the assessment of hydromorphological quality for 10 pairs of channelized and unmanaged river cross sections indicated significant differences of this quality between both cross section types and identified the most severely modified assessment categories channel geometry the presence of erosional and depositional channel forms bank structure as well as channel mobility and lateral connectivity of the river and its floodplain fig 9 the assessment thus confirmed the choice of the erodible river corridor as a restoration measure for the biała and indicated features which should be improved the most with enabling free channel migration within the erodible corridor bednarska et al 2018 investigated effects of passive restoration of the upper raba river on ground beetles inhabiting exposed riverine sediments abandonment of the maintenance of channelization structures in the river reach with established erodible corridor and the passage of two major floods in 2010 and 2014 resulted in up to a threefold increase in river width and re establishment of a multi thread channel pattern a comparison of ground beetle samples collected in 6 unmanaged river cross sections and 6 cross sections from the adjacent channelized reaches indicated that the restoration of a more natural physical structure of the river was reflected in the higher abundance and species richness of ground beetles in the unmanaged than in the channelized cross sections fig 10 increases in these biotic metrics were significantly linked with the increase in river width however no significant differences in the indices of ground beetle diversity between the two cross section types were recorded which indicated that more than a few years is needed for development of more diverse riparian beetle communities the study by mikuś et al 2019 differs from works described above as it summarizes 7 year long observations of island development in the passively restored reach of the upper raba river widening was a crucial factor inducing the development of islands and at the end of the observation period a highly significant relation was found between the percentage of river area covered by islands and river width fig 11 the initial flood caused increase in river width was followed by marked increases in the number of islands and their average and total area over the observation period however these increases were not steady but moderated by island erosion by flood flows establishment of islands after major floods and their coalescence in the years without such floods a repeat inventory of vascular plant species on islands and in the riparian forest indicated that in early phases of island re establishment in a mountain river recovering from channelization and channel incision islands can variously contribute to the overall richness of plant species in the riparian corridor depending on hydraulic and hydrological conditions in particular years 6 concluding remarks despite a large number of river restoration projects implemented worldwide over the last three decades a scarcity of monitored projects causes that scientific evidence of the resultant changes in restored rivers is still meagre this gap in knowledge is particularly important with respect to innovative restoration measures and long term effects of restoration activities environmental monitoring conducted in the initial and final phases of two river restoration projects realized in the early 2010s in the polish carpathians as well as 5 years after their completion will increase knowledge on the immediate and long term effectiveness of establishing an erodible corridor of a mountain river and constructing block ramps in a deeply incised stream channel in improving ecological river quality and reducing flood hazard we believe that

1012,relatively short time that passed since the onset of river restoration activities worldwide and a scarcity of monitored restoration projects cause that scientific evidence of changes in restored rivers is still meagre particularly with respect to innovative restoration techniques and long term effects of restoration activities restoration projects realized in the first half of the 2010s in three polish carpathian watercourses resulted in establishing of an erodible corridor in reaches of the biała and the raba rivers and installation of block ramps in the deeply incised channel of krzczonówka stream downstream of a lowered check dam environmental monitoring was conducted in the initial and final phases of the restoration projects and is to be repeated 5 years after their completion this paper i introduces the area of the restoration projects ii informs on their objectives and implementation iii outlines the methodology of the environmental monitoring and of the analysis of immediate and long term effectiveness of the projects in improving the ecological state of the watercourses and reducing flood hazard and iv overviews papers presenting outcomes from the initial phase of the monitoring the analysis of the monitoring data will increase knowledge on effects of the innovative cost effective restoration measures that could be widely used in the carpathian context and thus will be useful for changes in the management of degraded mountain rivers keywords river restoration hydromorphological quality ecological river state flood hazard mountain river 1 introduction during the last century or more most streams and rivers in densely populated regions experienced intense human pressures on their physical structure and the functioning of their riverine and riparian ecosystems malmqvist and rundle 2002 these pressures have been especially pronounced in mountain watercourses wohl 2006 in which the high energy of flood flows facilitates exceedance of the resistance of channel boundaries and leads to rapid morphological and sedimentary adjustments such impacts as channelization in channel gravel mining partitioning of river course by dams and weirs decoupling of channels from floodplains by flood embankments and removal of large wood from channels bravard and petts 1996 caused dramatic changes in the physical structure and habitat integrity of the watercourses muhar and jungwirth 1998 that were reflected in the impoverishment of riverine communities allan and castillo 2007 channel incision a common phenomenon in impacted rivers reduced floodwater retention in floodplain areas and accelerated evacuation of floodwater wyżga et al 2016d increasing flood hazard to downstream reaches wyżga 1997 wyżga et al 2016a with recognition of the abovementioned and other adverse effects of human impacts on watercourses activities aimed to improve their degraded attributes have been undertaken in many countries these activities are collectively called river restoration wohl et al 2015 and apart from improvement of ecological integrity they frequently tend to achieve other goals such as enhancement of recreational use of rivers floodplain reconnection flood management etc dufour and piégay 2009 although many river restoration projects were implemented worldwide particularly in the usa over the last thirty years a vast majority of the projects lacked environmental monitoring rubin et al 2017 and very few were followed by research of long term effects of the implemented measures lorenz et al 2018 monitoring results indicated that restoration projects often fail to achieve the intended ecological objectives palmer et al 2010 or the long term persistence of geomorphic e g kondolf et al 2001 or hydraulic effects e g geerling et al 2008 this seems to be a consequence of a tendency to design and create channels that appear more natural rather than re establish the operation of natural processes particularly geomorphic and hydrological ones that would induce and sustain desired changes in channel form and habitat structure wyżga et al 2018b moreover defining rules of the monitoring that would properly evaluate a success of restoration projects is also a challenge rubin et al 2017 adverse changes in the physical structure and functioning of watercourses caused by human pressures were extensively documented in scientific literature for the rivers of the polish carpathians such evidence was presented with respect to channel morphology e g wyżga 2008 bed substrate e g zawiejska et al 2015 hydraulic conditions

wyżga et al 2009 2011 bylak and kukuła 2018 and riparian communities e g skalski et al 2016 is also well documented however with relatively short time that passed since the onset of restoration activities worldwide and a scarcity of monitored restoration projects scientific evidence of changes in these attributes of restored rivers is still meagre e g wyżga et al 2018b particularly with respect to innovative restoration techniques and long term effects of restoration activities this is especially true with regard to poland where river restoration activities are still in their infancy apart from enhancing self sustainability of the restored rivers good restoration projects should be cost effective and reduce rather than increase flood hazard both in the restored reach and in downstream reaches these criteria seem to be met by an erodible corridor a part of a valley floor where free channel development is allowed the concept of this restoration measure was formulated in western europe piégay et al 1997 2005 and described also in poland bojarski et al 2005 subsequently it has been increasingly applied in mountain and piedmont rivers in europe e g rinaldi et al 2011 including poland nieznański et al 2008 wyżga and zawiejska 2012 the unquestionable advantage of this restoration measure is that it allows a river to restore itself and to adjust fluvial form to its flow regime and sediment load this contrasts with a different approach when river managers create a new channel that may not be adjusted to the actual river regime kondolf 2006 however necessary conditions for a successful self restoration of a river in an erodible corridor are the available space for free channel development on a valley floor and the sufficient power of a river to actively reshape its form kondolf 2012 which may not be met for urban and lowland rivers respectively so far very few scientific analyses of the effects of the application of the restoration measure have been published rohde et al 2005 restoration of deeply incised but relatively narrow streams draining forested corridors can be promoted by enabling spontaneous formation of wood dams from fallen trees or construction and placement of such dams wyżga et al 2016b 2018a in some countries large wood has been widely used in stream restoration but in most of these projects wood was fixed to channel banks which considerably reduced its effects on stream hydraulics and morphology e g kail et al 2007 where there is no forest in the riparian area or channels become wider than the height of riparian trees improvement of conditions in deeply incised streams can be achieved with use of another innovative cost effective restoration measure fish passable transversal structures created from rocky material superimposed on or mixed with river gravels jeleński et al 2016 wyżga et al 2018a such structures called block ramps tamagni et al 2010 or rock riffles newbury et al 2011 newbury 2013 can be applied to control bed erosion reduce flow capacity of incised channels improve aquatic habitat through formation of backwatering pools facilitate sediment entrapment and re establish a pool riffle sequence on the channel bed this paper deals with two river restoration projects carried out in the first half of the 2010s in three polish carpathian watercourses the first project was realized in the biała river with an erodible corridor established in two sections of the upper and middle river course another project was realized in the raba river and its tributary krzczonówka stream and encompassed establishing an erodible corridor in a reach of the upper raba and lowering of a check dam and formation of several block ramps in the stream reach downstream of the dam the implementation of both restoration projects was accompanied by environmental monitoring conducted at their initial and final stages a research project immediate and long term effects of river restoration projects in the polish carpathians aims at environmental monitoring in the area of these restoration projects 5 years after their completion and evaluating immediate that is within the time span of the restoration projects and longer term effectiveness of the restoration measures in improving the ecological state of the watercourses and reducing flood hazard this paper i introduces the area of the restoration projects ii informs on their objectives and implementation iii outlines the methodology of the environmental monitoring and of the analysis of immediate and longer term effectiveness of the projects and iv overviews outcomes from the initial phase of the monitoring 2 field setting fig 1 presents the location of reaches of the three polish carpathian watercourses in which the restoration measures were implemented in the first half of the 2010s the raba and the biała are relatively large rivers draining the western and eastern parts of the polish carpathians respectively whereas krzczonówka stream is one of major tributaries to the raba river the three watercourses drain catchments in the flysch part of the polish carpathians rivers draining the western and eastern parts of the polish carpathians differ somewhat in their physiographic and hydrological characteristics in the western part where mountains of medium height predominate rivers have steep channel gradients and floods caused by prolonged advective rainfall occur during late spring and summer the raba catchment upstream from the reach subjected to restoration has moderately high relief with altitudes up to 1311 m whereas the restored reach is located between 340 and 330 m of altitude the catchment of krzczonówka stream has low mountain relief with the highest point at 867 m a s l and the stream mouth to the raba river at 330 m a s l restoration activities were conducted in the lowest 2 km of stream length in the eastern region main carpathian rivers have long reaches within the foothill and foreland areas where they have gentler channel gradients than the rivers in the western region frequent moderate floods caused by snowmelt typically occur in early spring whereas rare large floods caused by advective rainfall can occur in late spring and summer the biała river in its upper course drains low mountains with the highest point at an altitude of 997 m while foothill areas with altitudes up to 500 m in the middle course the section subjected to restoration in the upper river course is located between 523 and 378 m a s l and that in the middle river course between 292 and 272 m a s l low retention potential of the flysch bedrock results in great variability of water stage and discharge of the studied watercourses the coefficient of flow irregularity ratio of the highest and the lowest discharge on record for the stróża station located downstream of the restored reach of the raba equals 2130 while that for the grybów station characterising runoff from the mountain part of the biała catchment amounts to 7500 reflecting the occurrence of only shallow slope aquifers in this area with the high flow variability and the delivery of coarse grained sandstone material to their channels the raba krzczonówka and the biała in its mountain course are gravel bed watercourses that until the beginning of the twentieth century supported multi thread morphology wyżga et al 2016c the biała in its foothill course is fed with both cobble pebble material and large amounts of fines and consequently it maintains a gravel bed but tends to form a sinuous channel in unmanaged reaches fig 2 b in the twentieth century the three watercourses were channelized with their wide multi thread or sinuous channels replaced by straight narrow channels with reinforced banks in the mid century a 3 7 m high check dam was constructed in krzczonówka disrupting the continuity of the stream for biota migration and resulting in long term sediment starvation of its 2 km long downstream reach moreover in the second half of the century the three watercourses experienced widespread uncontrolled in channel gravel mining cf rinaldi et al 2005 these impacts have induced rapid channel incision that lowered the bed of krzczonówka stream by up to 2 m and those of the raba and the biała rivers by up to 2 5 m and caused transformation of their alluvial beds into bedrock or bedrock alluvial beds in some parts of their course 3 objectives and implementation of the river restoration projects the erodible corridor of the biała river was established in the frame of the project restoring connectivity of the ecological corridor of the biała tarnowska river valley realized in the years 2010 2014 by the regional water management board in kraków its establishing was intended to mitigate the adverse effects of human caused channel changes for the state of the river ecosystem and flood hazard and to initiate river recovery it also aimed to reduce maintenance costs for bank protection structures that are repeatedly destroyed in dynamic mountain rivers cf bojarski et al 2005 wyżga and zawiejska 2012 the erodible corridor was delimited on the basis of three criteria i extent of the zone of channel migration during the last 130 years determined through the analysis of cartographic materials ii extent of floodplain and iii location of buildings and infrastructure that have to remain outside the zone of potential channel migration moreover the erodible corridor was preferentially delimited in those parts of the river course where a large proportion of riparian areas is state owned and the impact of channel migration on private property would be minimal cf piégay et al 1997 bojarski et al 2005 because a majority of native inhabitants of the low beskid mountains were resettled to other areas in the mid twentieth century lach and wyżga 2002 and their lands on the valley floor were nationalized the upper course of the biała was most suitable for establishing an erodible corridor consequently an erodible corridor was delimited in two river sections in the mountain river course on the length of 14 5 km and in its foothill course on the length of 5 9 km fig 1 in both sections relatively long unmanaged channel reaches alternate with short channelized reaches in the vicinity of bridges fig 2 in the upper section the established corridor had mean width of 112 m and was more than four times wider than the average river width 27 m the area of the corridor 1 6 km2 was 12 smaller than the area of the zone of channel migration in the last 130 years which mainly reflected the occurrence of five bridges disrupting continuity of unmanaged channel reaches along the corridor in the lower section mean corridor width was 194 m seven times exceeding the average river width 27 m here the lateral extent of the delimited corridor mainly corresponded to the extent of the floodplain and the area of the corridor exceeded by half the area of the zone of channel migration in the last 130 years restoration activities in the raba and krzczonówka were conducted in the frame of the project the upper raba river spawning grounds realized in the years 2011 2016 by the non governmental organization ab ovo however already in the late 2000s by the decision of water authorities maintenance of channelization structures was abandoned in a 2 3 km long reach of the upper raba where roads and settlements are located close to valley slopes leaving a few hundred metres wide undeveloped corridor for the river fig 3 jeleński and wyżga 2016 the erodible corridor was here formally established within the scope of the restoration project and its lateral extent was delimited on the basis of the extent of state owned land along the river the location of areas overgrown with riparian forest and boundaries of the natura 2000 protected area on the valley floor so delimited erodible corridor had mean width of 224 m and was about 3 5 times wider than the average channel width 63 m in 2009 in may 2010 a 30 year flood caused a considerable widening up to 3 times in some cross sections of the river in this reach after the flood the boundary of the corridor had to be reinforced on a distance of ca 300 m at the place where the migrating river channel approached a local road threatening its stability however the reinforcement did not consist of rip rap or gabions typically constructed on channel banks but instead it was created by substituting river gravels with coarse sandstone rubble mixed with laterite matrix and compacting these materials with a road roller to form a gently sloping surface importantly all these works were conducted without the movement of heavy machinery within a low flow channel of the river following the construction works trees were planted on the external side of the revetments jeleński and wyżga 2016 a principal aim of restoration activities in krzczonówka stream was a lowering of the 3 7 m high check dam to make it passable for fish the works were conducted between april and october 2014 resulting in the lowering of the dam by 1 7 m and adjusting it to enable fish migration through the structure as the planned lowering of the check dam must have released sediments stored behind the dam in march 2013 fourteen block ramps were installed in the deeply incised downstream reach of krzczonówka fig 4 to facilitate entrapment of the sediments flushed out from the dam reservoir jeleński et al 2016 simulations using the hey and thorne regime equations thorne et al 1997 indicated that to remain relatively stable in the deeply incised channel the ramps should consist of the material 3 4 times coarser than that filling the dam reservoir and so the ramps were formed of rock rubble from a nearby quarry with a topping of coarse gravel compacted by a road roller the ramps were also intended to promote re establishment of a riffle and pool pattern of the stream and thus they were located at thalweg inflection points fig 4 jeleński et al 2016 in may 2014 when the works on the check dam were underway a flood flushed out considerable amounts of gravel from the dam reservoir this material was efficiently trapped by block ramps in the downstream reach which resulted in marked aggradation of the stream bed wyżga et al 2018a 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the restoration measures 4 1 general methodology of environmental monitoring in the biała and the raba rivers in which erodible corridors were established abiotic and biotic river characteristics were determined in the initial and final phases of the restoration projects for two sets of closely located freely developing and channelized cross sections figs 2 5 with 10 cross sections of each type in the biała and 6 in the raba the freely developing and channelized cross sections represent similar hydrological conditions but differ in hydromorphological conditions during the current scientific project these observations will be repeated 5 years after the completion of the restoration projects fig 5 observations on effects of the functioning of both rivers in the erodible corridors thus follow a baci experimental design conner et al 2016 for the studies of effects of environmental changes before after the change versus control i e channelized impacted i e restored river cross sections with verification of the after situation not only at the end of the restoration projects but also 5 years after the projects finished fig 5 this will allow for distinguishing changes resulting from river dynamics within the erodible corridors from those induced by temporal variability in climatic and hydrological conditions during the study period analysis of changes recorded at the end of the restoration projects will show immediate effects of the projects while changes recorded 5 years later will inform about longer term project effects in krzczonówka abiotic and biotic stream characteristics were surveyed in 10 cross sections located in the reach restored by construction of block ramps fig 5 here observations were conducted before the onset of restoration activities in 2012 after the construction of block ramps in 2013 during the works on the check dam in 2014 and after their end in 2015 these observations will be repeated 5 years after the end of the restoration works in the stream fig 5 4 2 considered river characteristics and methods of their analysis during the current project we intend to verify the hypotheses that the implemented restoration measures caused significant improvement of three groups of river characteristics achieved either during the restoration projects or in the long term the first group of the hypotheses comprises those concerning hydromorphological quality of the watercourses and complexity of physical habitats fig 5 the hydromorphological state of the watercourses is evaluated with the river hydromorphological quality method that is largely based on a field survey of hydromorphological conditions and has been demonstrated to be particularly useful for the assessment of effects of restoration activities hajdukiewicz et al 2017 complexity of aquatic habitats significantly influences the abundance and richness of fish and benthic invertebrate communities in a mountain river wyżga et al 2009 2011 this complexity will be determined with respect to water depth near bed and depth averaged flow velocity and bed material grain size in the raba river the assessment also comprises characteristics of riparian habitats of ground beetles such as the distance from and the height above the nearest low flow channel surface slope sediment size class and the degree of plant cover the second group of hypotheses to be verified refers to riverine and riparian communities and the assessment of ecological river quality based on fish and benthic invertebrates fig 5 the assessment of changes in the abundance and species richness of fish communities is done on the basis of two electrofishings performed in july and september seasons of distinct thermal conditions and development stages of juvenile fish changes in taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate communities are evaluated on the basis of samplings conducted in spring summer and autumn of a given year the results of surveys of fish and benthic invertebrates are the basis of calculating scores of the european fish index efi and the invertebrate based bmwp pl index and the evaluation of changes in ecological river quality indicated by these indices moreover in the raba surveys of ground beetles conducted in spring summer and autumn of a given year are to be used to determine i how the abundance species richness and diversity of the riparian biota change with time since the onset of river restoration ii how the assemblages vary among the sites with different microhabitat conditions in channelized and freely developing cross sections and iii how seasonal variability in the occurrence patterns of ground beetles influences evaluation of the effects of river restoration on these riparian biota the third group of analysed river characteristics comprises components of flood hazard i flow velocity unit stream power and shear forces responsible for erosional damage during floods and ii the role of floodplain in conveyance i e downstream evacuation and retention of floodwater at discharges of given recurrence intervals fig 5 high values of flow velocity unit stream power and bed shear stress in channelized and incised reaches of mountain rivers radecki pawlik et al 2016 coupled with sediment deficit typifying contemporary polish carpathian rivers underlie high erosional damage caused by these rivers during floods stoffel et al 2016 moreover incised river reaches have a considerably reduced potential for the retention of floodwater in floodplain areas wyżga 1999 numerical modelling of hydraulic conditions typifying channelized and restored reaches of the watercourses at different time since the onset of restoration activities will allow us to verify whether the applied restoration measures reduce the erosional potential of flood flows and increase the retention of floodwater in restored river reaches it seems reasonable to expect that restoration of channelized and incised mountain watercourses attained through either channel widening in erodible corridors or bed aggradation stimulated by block ramps will differently change hydraulic conditions at flood flows 4 3 evaluation of the safety of erodible corridor boundaries reliable prediction of bank retreat and channel migration is crucial for safe functioning of rivers in erodible corridors as it may indicate a need to construct anti erosion revetments on the corridor boundaries where settlements or infrastructure may be threatened by migrating river bojarski et al 2005 in 2012 the authors formulated a prognosis of the probability relative intensity of retreat of the banks of the biała river along the 20 4 km long reaches of its erodible corridor the prognosis was made for more than 800 river segments 25 m in length taking into account four factors i qualitative assessment of resistance of bank material to erosion ii the degree of river narrowing in the course of the twentieth century channelization indicating the degree of a local increase in unit stream power iii the amount of channel incision and iv the presence absence of the direct contact of low flow channel and river bank as well as the angle of the contact of low flow channel with the bank the analysis was based on the reasoning that bank erosion is more probable proceeds faster where bank material is less resistant to erosion the river was considerably narrowed in the course of channelization the channel is not incised and local direction of low flow channel is perpendicular to river bank the analysis was made in relative terms as absolute values of bank retreat channel migration in a given period inevitably depend on the occurrence and magnitude of flood flows in this period we intend to verify the forecasts within the current project as a 9 or 10 year long period seems to be sufficiently long for the comparison of predicted and actual rates of bank retreat in the erodible corridor of the biała river 5 environmental monitoring in the biała and the raba rivers published findings while the analysis of changes in the restored sections of the biała and the raba rivers occurring during the time span of the restoration projects and after their end will be conducted in the frame of the current scientific project some results from the environmental monitoring carried out in the early phases of the restoration projects have already been published wyżga et al 2013 used data about benthic macroinvertebrates water quality and physical habitat characteristics in 10 pairs of closely located channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the biała to verify the common understanding of the invertebrate based bmwp pl index as an indicator of water quality the biological monitoring working party bmwp score system is based on the occurrence of macroinvertebrate families with higher scores ascribed to the taxa typical of fast flowing well oxygenated water and lower scores to the taxa tolerating stagnant poorly oxygenated water armitage et al 1983 hawkes 1998 the bmwp pl index is a variant of this score system adjusted to the composition of macroinvertebrate communities typical of polish rivers dumnicka et al 2006 in the biała the macroinvertebrate taxa richness and the index scores appeared to be significantly related to several physical habitat characteristics especially the complexity of flow pattern and cross sectional variation in flow velocity and bed material grain size at the same time they were unrelated to physicochemical parameters of the river water which consistently indicated high water quality the study by wyżga et al 2013 thus indicated that the bmwp pl index should be considered an indicator of the ecological status of rivers dependent both on their hydromorphological and water quality characteristics sections of the biała river which are to be restored through establishing erodible corridor consist of relatively long unmanaged channel reaches alternating with short channelized reaches close to bridges wyżga et al 2014 investigated effects of these alternating morphologies on benthic invertebrate and fish communities and the appraisal of ecological river quality based on these groups of aquatic biota they found that surveyed channelized cross sections were typified by three times lower taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages on average than unmanaged cross sections and consequently the ecological river quality indicated by the invertebrate based bmwp pl index for the former was worse by about 1 quality class than that for the latter however no statistically significant difference in the number of fish species was recorded between both types of river cross sections and calculated scores of the european fish index allowed both cross section types to be associated with the same class of ecological river quality the study indicated that even though short channelized river reaches provide worse habitats for benthic invertebrates they do not disrupt continuity of fish populations this means that the occurrence of such regulated channel reaches within the established erodible corridor of the biała should not preclude the expected improvement of the ecological state of the river in unmanaged channel reaches hajdukiewicz et al 2016 compared results of the surveys of adjacent unmanaged and channelized reaches of the biała river performed in 2009 and in the late summer 2010 to evaluate changes in channel morphology valley infrastructure and river habitats caused by an 80 year flood in june 2010 they found that although the flood increased active channel width by half in surveyed unmanaged cross sections of the river and by one third in channelized cross sections damage to valley floor infrastructure was limited to the channelized river reaches with reinforced channel banks fig 6 this indicated improper management of riparian areas rather than the degree of river widening as a principal reason for the economic losses during the flood the authors concluded that while establishing erodible corridors is possible in unmanaged river reaches the remaining reaches supporting infrastructure such as bridges will have to be maintained and function as artificial reaches adjusting the infrastructure in these non restored often narrow reaches to the flood hazard is thus essential to limit the risk of material loss this study also found that the large flood increased the variability of physical habitat conditions during low to medium flows in channelized river reaches and decreased it in unmanaged reaches thus obliterating differences in the complexity of physical habitats that previously existed between the river reaches with different style of channel management hajdukiewicz et al 2018 extended the analysis of changes in the biała river resulting from the 80 year flood of june 2010 to fish and benthic invertebrate communities they found that the flood caused similar but relatively small decreases in the species richness of fish and the abundance of subadult and adult fish individuals in channelized and unmanaged river cross sections consequently the flood did not significantly change the ecological river quality indicated by the european fish index with both types of river cross sections falling into the class of good ecological quality before and after the flood fig 7 prior to the flood the unmanaged cross sections hosted 2 3 more benthic invertebrate taxa on average than the channelized ones and the ecological river quality indicated by the invertebrate based bmwp pl index for both cross section types differed by about 1 5 quality class however the flood significantly reduced the number of invertebrate taxa in the unmanaged cross sections so that the taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages and river quality indicated by the bmwp pl index in both cross section types became similar fig 7 the study indicated that extreme hydrological events such as floods or droughts can significantly affect biotic components of river ecosystems and that their impact can vary between river reaches with a different style of channel management as well as between different groups of aquatic biota czech et al 2016 performed one dimensional hydraulic modelling for 10 pairs of neighbouring channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the biała river to determine effects of these differing channel morphologies on the conditions for flood flows they found that flood flows conveyed in freely developed cross sections are typified by significantly greater width fig 8 and significantly lower velocity unit stream power and bed shear stress than those in channelized cross sections of particular importance was that flood flows conveyed in the channel zone of the unmanaged cross sections are typified by significantly reduced values of unit stream power fig 8 and bed shear stress in comparison to those in the channelized cross sections this indicated that despite the early phase of the river functioning in the erodible corridor the river restoration already brings beneficial effects enabling to arrest and possibly revert in the future the tendency to channel incision however the study also indicated that channelized and unmanaged cross sections of the river display a similar low potential for floodwater retention in floodplain areas this reflects the enlargement of channel capacity associated with the channel widening in the freely developing river reaches that has not yet been compensated by bed aggradation hajdukiewicz et al 2017 indicated that assessment of the hydromorphological state of a river should diagnose reasons for its degradation and identify features requiring improvement in the course of restoration actions they used the example of the biała river to demonstrate usefulness of the river hydromorphological quality method for the river assessment for restoration purposes the assessment of hydromorphological quality for 10 pairs of channelized and unmanaged river cross sections indicated significant differences of this quality between both cross section types and identified the most severely modified assessment categories channel geometry the presence of erosional and depositional channel forms bank structure as well as channel mobility and lateral connectivity of the river and its floodplain fig 9 the assessment thus confirmed the choice of the erodible river corridor as a restoration measure for the biała and indicated features which should be improved the most with enabling free channel migration within the erodible corridor bednarska et al 2018 investigated effects of passive restoration of the upper raba river on ground beetles inhabiting exposed riverine sediments abandonment of the maintenance of channelization structures in the river reach with established erodible corridor and the passage of two major floods in 2010 and 2014 resulted in up to a threefold increase in river width and re establishment of a multi thread channel pattern a comparison of ground beetle samples collected in 6 unmanaged river cross sections and 6 cross sections from the adjacent channelized reaches indicated that the restoration of a more natural physical structure of the river was reflected in the higher abundance and species richness of ground beetles in the unmanaged than in the channelized cross sections fig 10 increases in these biotic metrics were significantly linked with the increase in river width however no significant differences in the indices of ground beetle diversity between the two cross section types were recorded which indicated that more than a few years is needed for development of more diverse riparian beetle communities the study by mikuś et al 2019 differs from works described above as it summarizes 7 year long observations of island development in the passively restored reach of the upper raba river widening was a crucial factor inducing the development of islands and at the end of the observation period a highly significant relation was found between the percentage of river area covered by islands and river width fig 11 the initial flood caused increase in river width was followed by marked increases in the number of islands and their average and total area over the observation period however these increases were not steady but moderated by island erosion by flood flows establishment of islands after major floods and their coalescence in the years without such floods a repeat inventory of vascular plant species on islands and in the riparian forest indicated that in early phases of island re establishment in a mountain river recovering from channelization and channel incision islands can variously contribute to the overall richness of plant species in the riparian corridor depending on hydraulic and hydrological conditions in particular years 6 concluding remarks despite a large number of river restoration projects implemented worldwide over the last three decades a scarcity of monitored projects causes that scientific evidence of the resultant changes in restored rivers is still meagre this gap in knowledge is particularly important with respect to innovative restoration measures and long term effects of restoration activities environmental monitoring conducted in the initial and final phases of two river restoration projects realized in the early 2010s in the polish carpathians as well as 5 years after their completion will increase knowledge on the immediate and long term effectiveness of establishing an erodible corridor of a mountain river and constructing block ramps in a deeply incised stream channel in improving ecological river quality and reducing flood hazard we believe that not only will the outcomes from the monitoring be of considerable scientific interest but they will also contribute to a wider use of these innovative cost effective restoration measures to improve

1013,dissolved organic carbon doc is an important component of the carbon cycle as a measure of the hydrological transport of carbon between terrestrial carbon pools into soil pools and eventually into streams as a result changes in doc in rivers and streams may indicate alterations in the storage of terrestrial carbon exploring the complex interactions between biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic processes as well as the micro climate variabilities that impact the rate of doc fluxes are challenging because the information is not readily available from in situ measurements or from empirical models alone this is particularly true of large scale watersheds the penobscot watershed is the largest watershed of the gulf of maine and the second largest in new england its typical soils with high organic matter and a large forested and wetland landscape result in higher doc fluxes than what has been observed previously for most rivers in the northern temperate or boreal zones hope et al 1994 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 in this study we emphasized the simulation of streamflow and doc fluxes from the penobscot watershed and several tributaries within the penobscot watershed using the spatially distributed process based regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys model simulated results were evaluated using field measurements streamflow doc fluxes and remotely sensed products net primary production npp and leaf area index lai from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the average doc flux for the penobscot watershed during 2004 2012 using the rhessys model was 69 kg c ha year the rhessys simulated doc flux is shown to correlate well with observed values as well as with results previously reported from the empirical load estimator loadest model 71 kg c ha year for 2004 2007 huntington and aiken 2013 our simulated results also show a temporal variation in the amount of doc flux indicating that the antecedent doc concentration from one year can impact the doc export in following years thus doc concentration is positively correlated with streamflow and antecedent precipitation in agreement with previous studies ågren et al 2010 huntington and aiken 2013 tian et al 2013 the successful application of the rigorous rhessys model in the penobscot watershed makes it a reasonable platform to test future scenarios impacting the hydrology and biogeochemistry within similar large complex watersheds 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc is an important component of the carbon cycle as doc from the terrestrial sphere leaches into aquatic systems and eventually exports large quantity of the doc to the marine environment although doc fluxes are small in comparison to some other carbon fluxes in the ecosystem they serve an important role in the carbon balance of litter and of the upper layer of soil the o horizon the importance of doc lies in its role in the hydrologic transport of carbon between living biomass carbon pools into soil pools and eventually into streams thus temporal changes of doc in streams may indicate changes in terrestrial carbon storage therefore affecting exchanges between the biosphere geosphere and atmosphere worrall and burt 2007 williamson et al 2008 bianchi et al 2009 soil organic carbon is a crucial carbon sink and the largest contributor of net carbon flux from the land to the atmosphere schlesinger 1997 lettens et al 2007 changes in doc concentration have been observed in a number of catchments across the northern hemisphere monteith et al 2007 bragee et al 2014 leading to concerns about changes in carbon cycling that may affect sequestration or the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems changes in doc export and concentration may also have adverse impacts on aquatic systems as increasing doc concentrations may have important effects on the quality of drinking water haaland and mulder 2009 on ecological processes gergel et al 1999 miller et al 2016 and on mercury dynamics forsius et al 2010 increases in terrestrially derived doc concentrations in aquatic ecosystems may also lead to a rise in aquatic carbon dioxide emissions as well as decreasing light penetration schindler et al 1996 a number of watersheds have been experiencing increases in doc transport as a result of increasing temperatures and precipitation from climate change huntington et al 2016 worral and burt 2007 in large complex watersheds doc dynamics are controlled by both hydrologic processes and the effects of the landscape such as the proportion of wetland and forested areas tranvik and jansson 2002 frost et al 2006 creed et al 2008 yang et al 2017 laudon et al 2011 therefore in addition to climate change the type of land covers that a watershed is made up of will also affect the nutrients and matter entering its streams difficulty in obtaining frequent field measurements along with a lack of consistency between laboratory studies and field measurements have made it hard to obtain accurate estimates of the doc present in soil and to monitor the doc flux from terrestrial to aquatic systems kalbitz et al 2000 especially in large heterogeneous catchments therefore ecosystem models can help us to quantify and monitor possible changes in terrestrial carbon cycling in this study we present data to simulate and quantify the doc flux from the penobscot watershed the second largest watershed in new england into the gulf of maine for the period of 2004 2012 we carefully parametrized the physical and ecological properties of the penobscot watershed and used the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys a semi mechanistic water nutrient and carbon cycling model band et al 2000 band et al 1993 tague and band 2004 rhessys gives us the opportunity to explore and simulate details of watershed biogeochemistry by combining a process based model of vegetation growth with hydrologic and decomposition models characterizing ecosystem carbon fluxes and estimating the quantities of these fluxes at various scales local regional continental and global improves our understanding of the relationship between the terrestrial biosphere the atmosphere and aquatic systems law et al 2004 xiao et al 2010 because the parameters defining these processes are difficult to measure and there is substantial uncertainty in these values as a result of the heterogeneity of the large penobscot watershed landscape we also performed sensitivity analysis on a number of the model s parameters details are described in the methodology section rhessys has enhanced our ability to better understand the mechanisms that drive the biogeochemical processes band et al 2001 christensen et al 2008 tague et al 2013 tague and band 2004 vicente serrano et al 2015 zierl et al 2007 which may also help us better study the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow doc within a very large catchment and explore the impact of vegetation processes on streamflow a reasonable estimation of doc fluxes from this large heterogeneous watershed could be used to model future climate change and land cover change impacts under varying model setups land cover types anthropogenic development deforestation changes in climate status etc this model will become a useful tool to estimate doc loads under changing climate and land cover disturbances 2 study site the penobscot river watershed in north central maine is the second largest watershed in new england draining about 22 400 km2 nearly one third of the state of maine despite its size the watershed has a low human population density and is mostly forested including red maple spruce sugar maple yellow birch and white pine with extensive bogs marshes and wooded swamps covered in shrubs griffith and alerich 1996 forested wetlands scrub shrub wetlands and emergent wetlands are three types of wetlands in the penobscot watershed the penobscot watershed also has many large lakes and tributaries which make it a suitable environment for important native fisheries such as the atlantic salmon and brook trout the penobscot watershed is mostly well drained with acidic soils that contain high organic matter with a low decomposition rate precipitation is distributed rather uniformly throughout the year with mean annual precipitation of 108 cm 42 5 inches and a mean annual temperature of 6 1 c 43 f national climatic data center 1975 2015 runoff as an important factor controlling doc export into the aquatic system is dominated by snowmelt in high latitude areas lammers et al 2001 on average 60 of annual flow in new england happens during the winter and spring therefore snowmelt has the greatest effect on annual streamflow which also coincides with the highest peak of doc discharge runoff and doc export from the penobscot watershed has a large impact on the near coastal ocean in the gulf of maine huntington et al 2016 balch et al 2012 2016 gnanadesikan et al 2019 so it is important to study the temporal trends of doc flux from this watershed into the marine ecosystem the penobscot watershed is an ideal watershed to investigate how these trends will change according to future climate change and land cover change projections because it is a large basin representative of the gulf of maine watershed and has been well studied figure 1 illustrates the penobscot watershed and its vegetation types in state of maine across the new england region in the united states the vegetation data were derived from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd dataset and were downloaded from the national map viewer http viewer nationalmap gov viewer 3 data the hydrologic data used for calibration and validation purposes were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database u s geological survey 2014 daily streamflow data for the west enfield gauge station somewhat inland were downloaded from the nwis database for the period of 2000 2012 site number 01034500 the discharge for the actual mouth of the penobscot river site number 01036390 was not available for this time period so the daily discharge was estimated from the west enfield data using an area adjustment this method of estimation has been used in previous studies hodgkins 1999 huntington and aiken 2013 where the export of doc from the penobscot watershed was modeled using the same observational doc data with the coarser resolution empirical load estimator loadest model runkel et al 2004 remotely sensed data were used in this study to provide the spatial input data required by rhessys to create flowpath and landscape representations input maps and remote sensing data used in this study were land cover soil type vegetation type leaf area index lai and a digital elevation model dem the dem data for the state of maine were obtained from the national elevation dataset ned in this study 500 meter resolution data were used scaling up from the 30 meter elevation data available from the national map viewer website http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the nearest neighbor resampling technique http pro arcgis com en pro app tool reference data management resample html was used in arcgis for scaling up the 30 meter resolution data to 500 meter resolution the 500 meter resolution was chosen in this study because of the large scale of the penobscot watershed and the ability to compare rhessys simulated results with gridded 500 meter satellite derived moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products for evaluation land cover data were also downloaded from the national map viewer http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the version used in this research is from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd classifying 17 land types in this study land cover data were then reclassified to five types undeveloped high intensity urban area medium intensity urban area low intensity urban area and agriculture which were then defined in the rhessys land cover classification the vegetation data were also derived from the 2006 nlcd dataset the nine categories used in this study were selected and defined in rhessys as the vegetation classification types of un vegetated mixed forest crops grass deciduous evergreen shrub wetland and wetland forest in addition lai information was used leaf area index is defined as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies the 500 meter resolution mcd15a2h satellite product derived from combined terra and

https grass osgeo org grass64 and the stream network was created from the drainage map table 1 summarizes the rhessys input data and sources used in this study in addition to meteorological time series data and geographic information system gis based inputs a library of commonly used parameter files was also assembled from an extensive literature search of field measurements and specific soil data in the u s department of agriculture usda natural resource conservation service soil survey geographic database ssurgo in order to initialize soil parameters and assign vegetation and land use type information these initial state variables correspond to the definition files that describe the characteristics of the variables associated with each level of the spatial hierarchy defined in the rhessys model white et al 2000 the field measured doc flux information from the penobscot watershed that was used in this study for validation was obtained from continuous discharge measurements and discrete water sampling done by huntington and aiken 2013 the data from 2008 to 2013 were reported in huntington et al 2016 and are available from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2014 the data collected by bowdoin college are available from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa seabass archive http seabass gsfc nasa gov seabasscgi archive cgi q bowdoin camill 3rivers archive our simulated doc flux values were then compared with the observed measurements in addition we compared our rhessys results with those from the empirical loadest regression model huntington and aiken 2013 4 methodology 4 1 the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys rhessys band et al 2000 band et al 1993 tague and band 2004 is a physical process based model combining hydrologic biogeochemical and microclimate processes that enables modeling of the spatial temporal interactions between the different processes at the watershed scale furthermore its internal structure uses a hierarchical representation to define the landscape and combines several different process models topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 biome bgc running and hunt jr 1993 and mtn clim running et al 1987 along with two distributed hydrologic models topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 making it possible to study fluxes at different scales the biome bgc model an eco physiological model is used within the rhessys model for carbon water and nitrogen flux simulations the mtn clim model incorporates the user defined climate base information to derive the spatially resolved climate variables at the watershed scale the hydrological models allow us to simulate both vertical and lateral flows in this study we initialized the model with climate inputs minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation and remote sensing data through the gis based model framework of rhessys each spatial unit within the catchment scale is associated with specific processes modeled by rhessys a text document called a worldfile generated from references maps linking to the parameter definition files default files meteorological time series along with initial state variables was used to represent the landscape at watershed scale these initial state variables such as soil moisture atmospheric co2 etc correspond to the default files that describe the characteristics of the variables associated with each level of the spatial hierarchy the default file values are defined based on literature reviews and they remain constant through time a flowtable describes the connectivity between patches the finest spatial unit in this model to model subsurface and overland flow routing dynamic coupling between hydrologic response and vegetation and land cover dynamics is implemented with this differential representation of vertical and lateral processes at different temporal scales the flowtable is created based on the set of specific reference maps incorporating topology soil types and landscape representation of the watershed these are the same reference maps that are used for worldfile creation as well more information about the flowtable in the rhessys model can be found at https github com rhessys rhessys wiki flowtable 4 2 spin up calibration and validation the rhessys model for this study was set up for the penobscot watershed under historic land cover and climate conditions and then the soil carbon and nitrogen stores were stabilized and an organic soil layer was built up from initial bare ground by spinning up the system for 750 years until a state of equilibrium was reached for soil carbon and nitrogen and vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools in our study area after the spin up process the usgs stream gauge record was used to calibrate the model for several drainage related parameters that cannot be directly measured beven and freer 2001 tague et al 2013 by comparing rhessys modeled streamflow to observed streamflow records these calibrated hydrologic parameters include the hydraulic conductivity at the surface ksat 0 the decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth m and two groundwater parameters the first of which controls the proportion of infiltrated water that bypasses the soil to reach a deeper groundwater table gw1 and the second of which controls the rate of lateral flow from a hillslope scale groundwater table to the stream channel gw2 the calibration effort first used a monte carlo sampling method to run the model over a range of values liang et al 2011 the best fit results were then used for further evaluations using the markov chain approach metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 liu et al 2000 de martino et al 2013 the quality of the correspondence of the calibrated parameters improves as they approach the desired statistical distribution that best fit our study area therefore the best calibrated parameters were selected for future runs from calibration results that exhibited optimal correspondence between usgs observed and rhessys simulated streamflow based on the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and best r squared measures the rhessys model was then used to simulate the streamflow for the period from 01 01 2000 to 12 31 2003 for calibration and then from 01 01 2004 to 12 31 2012 for validation of the penobscot river at eddington site number 01036390 our rhessys simulated results correlated well with observed streamflow at annual monthly and daily steps figure 2 shows the penobscot watershed s simulated streamflow versus the observed streamflow using the rhessys model r2 0 76 figure 3 and table 2 present the correlation between annual monthly and daily rhessys simulated streamflow versus observed streamflow 4 3 the carbon cycle simulation inrhessys rhessys uses a set of mathematical representations of the key processes controlling carbon cycling dynamics within an ecosystem carbon cycling estimation within the rhessys model includes the estimation of photosynthesis farquhar photosynthesis model farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 vegetation respiration ryan model ryan 1991 vegetation allocation processes and turnover rates as vegetation specific parameters and scaled by environmental factors landsberg and waring 1997 thornton 1998 and soil decomposition and respiration rates parton et al 1996 more details about the mathematical equations used in each sub model of rhessys can be found in tague and band 2004 during carbon cycling in rhessys carbon will be fixed by plants from atmospheric co₂ as a function of temperature nutrients radiation and water availability the amount of carbon left after vegetation respiration is then allocated to the various parts of plants the primary first carbon pool leaves stemwood and fine roots there are four litter and soil pools defined in rhessys the secondary carbon pools the doc in soil solutions is produced from the decomposition processes in the secondary carbon pools soil and litter carbon pools the decomposition rate is estimated by first using base decomposition rates for the different litter and soil pools and then is scaled by soil temperature nutrient availability and soil water content nutrient availability impacts both photosynthesis and decomposition processes within rhessys modeling a partitioning strategy followed by landsberg and waring 1997 is used in the rhessys model to simulate the impact of nutrient availability and soil moisture content on species specific allocation ratios the amount of doc being transported from the soil solution into the streams is then controlled by the changes in water content of the three layer zones root zone unsaturated zone and saturated zone which are defined in rhessys to simulate the vertical fluxes the amount of doc that gets leached out from the soil is a function of soil porosity the decay rate of soil porosity with soil depth root zone depth the available doc in the soil the doc distribution with depth the dom dissolved organic matter production rate the doc absorption rate and the soil water content figure 4 represents the carbon cycle simulation within the rhessys model 4 4 impact of climate variables on doc flux we studied the impact of projected changes in climate variables individually temperature and precipitation based on the u s global change research program report karl and others 2009 for the northeastern united states we then used a feedback index fi to estimate the extent to which changes in a parameter will influence the doc flux 1 fi stream do c i stream do c 0 β i β 0 where the stream doci is the simulated seasonally annually averaged stream doc flux using the changed values for the test parameter the stream doc0 is the simulated background stream doc flux using the original values for the test parameter βi is the new value of the test parameter and β0 is the original value of the test parameter a positive fi means larger values of the test parameter will increase the doc flux and a negative fi means larger values of the test parameter will decrease the doc flux 5 results 5 1 simulated daily stream doc concentration and flux using the rhessys model we were able to simulate the daily penobscot watershed doc flux and concentration quite successfully estimated daily doc fluxes for the penobscot river at eddington averaged 69 kg c ha year during the period 2004 2012 we then compared the simulated doc flux with observed doc flux values from the penobscot watershed for the period of 2004 2012 the field measured doc flux from the penobscot watershed which was used in this study for validation was obtained from continuous discharge measurements and the discrete water sampling done by huntington and aiken 2013 where the samples were collected periodically throughout the year more samples were collected from the penobscot river at eddington than other tributaries inside the penobscot watershed more details about the methodology of sampling can be found in huntington and aiken 2013 figure 5 shows the simulated doc flux orange line and the observed values purple points at the bottom and the simulated streamflow black line and observed streamflow green line at the top figure 6 illustrates the simulated doc flux green line and the observed value orange points in logarithm scale for better visualization the simulated doc flux correlates well with the observed values r 0 66 rmse 0 053 std 0 041 figure 7 the correlation is highest during winter time 0 86 and lowest in spring 0 6 the average annual doc flux varied throughout the years of simulation for wet and dry periods among the simulated years 2004 2012 the year 2004 had the lowest streamflow doc flux which also corresponded to the lowest streamflow and precipitation amounts for that year the high peak of doc flux in 2005 occurred during the time of snowmelt and may be caused by the accumulation of soil carbon during the previous year 2004 this high peak also coincided with higher precipitation amounts in 2005 thus during 2005 heavy precipitation events and resulting runoff carried a large amount of doc into the streams it must be noted that in 2006 there were lower amounts of doc in the streams even though the precipitation amounts and the streamflow for 2006 were almost as large as those in 2005 however there does not appear to have been sufficient stored doc in the soil from 2005 to lead to high doc amounts in the soil solution for 2006 this tendency towards a memory has also been noted in other studies indicating that the stored doc concentration in one year can impact the doc export in the following year yurova et al 2008 huntington and aiken 2013 this short term change in the concentration discharge relation indicated that in this case the doc was supply limited despite the generally good agreement between the rhessys simulated results and the observed values the model overestimated the doc flux during periods where the snowmelt coincided with extreme precipitation events such as in 2005 and 2009 and again during high precipitation events in the late fall of 2005 when the model also overestimated streamflow at those time of years note that doc flux is a function of streamflow our rhessys simulated monthly doc concentration results for the period of 2004 2012 indicated that on average doc concentrations were highest during summer time and lowest during winter time and especially during the early spring snowmelt period data not shown this high doc concentration in summer and lower doc concentration during winter was also previously reported by of huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot river to further compare the simulated streamflow doc flux with the measured values and to test the reliability of our modeled results we also compared the rhessys simulated results with previously modeled values from the empirical loadest model huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot watershed the loadest regression program runkel et al 2004 is widely used for constituent loads in stream and river estimations loadest is used to estimate doc nutrient pesticide and contaminant export by using daily river discharge data plus paired discrete instantaneous discharge data and constituent concentration data huntington and aiken 2013 used the loadest model over a time period that they had discrete sample collections during 2004 2007 for the penobscot river at eddington and during 2004 2005 for the tributaries table 3 summarizes the rhessys streamflow doc simulations as compared with the loadest simulation results from the penobscot watershed and three of the sub watersheds inside the larger penobscot watershed the rhessys simulated results for doc fluxes and carbon yields compare well with the loadest from the large penobscot watershed and sub watersheds the complexity of the rhessys model where carbon cycle processes are responsive to environmental conditions allows us to understand the underlying physical processes and how they affect doc flux in ways that the loadest regression model cannot physical hydro ecological models like the rhessys model enable us to better understand how various parameters impact a simulated result through sensitivity analysis and explore the spatial variation in doc flux among the watershed tributaries considering different land cover types in stream doc is tightly linked to both the ecological processes and hydrological processes but the physiological parameters defining these processes are difficult to measure and there is much uncertainty in these values because of the heterogeneity of the large penobscot watershed landscape the second largest watershed modeled thus far with the rhessys model the south platte in colorado was the largest watershed modeled by the rhessys baron et al 1998 we performed a sensitivity analysis on two parameters that have direct control on the amount of doc export dom production rate and doc absorption rate described more in sensitivity analysis section this analysis was not conducted in the previous sensitivity analysis yang 2013 yang 2013 performed an extensive sensitivity analysis of dom decay rate temperature nitrogen deposition rates soil depth the ratio of infiltrated water that bypasses soil directly into a deeper groundwater table and the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of leaf litter yang 2013 found that slightly higher nitrogen deposition amounts and temperatures as well as a deeper soil depth can lead to increased stream doc flux and concentrations any increase in the stream doc flux and concentration caused by increasing the nitrogen deposition only occurs up to the point where the nitrogen is no longer a limiting factor for vegetation growth also the model is sensitive to changes in nitrogen deposition and the initialization of soil c n ratios the nitrogen required for microbial processes depends on the soil c n ratio and nitrogen deposition and the availability of nitrogen a higher c n ratio would result in less availability of nitrogen for microbial processes furthermore the yang 2013 study concluded that rises in temperature may also act as a limiting factor for vegetation growth after some optimum threshold further rises in temperature beyond this threshold will only increase the respiration rate and decrease stream doc flux and concentration this negative impact of further rises in temperature and decline in doc export are also captured by the rhessys model implemented for this study our simulated annual temperature feedback index results described in methodology section are positive under all scenarios indicating temperature will have a positive impact and increase the streamflow doc flux figure 8 right however as temperature increases the increase in doc flux in response to increasing temperature decreases exponentially as discussed above even though rises in air temperature may initially stimulate primary vegetation production by accelerating photosynthesis and enhancing vegetation respiration and organic matter decay rates temperatures may reach a point at which they exceed the tolerance of vegetation and then they may act as a limiting factor for vegetation growth bassow et al 1994 wayne et al 1998 under these conditions an increasing temperature will only serve to increase respiration rates and decrease stream doc flux and concentration changes in streamflow doc flux become more complicated when precipitation estimates alone are changed to be consistent with precipitation projections as discussed precipitation is key in explaining changes in the long term doc pattern hudson et al 2003 the store of doc compounds in peaty soils is flushed from the soil by rainfall or snowmelt with the highest concentrations often coinciding with the higher flow levels arvola et al 2004 worrall et al 2002 laudon et al 2004 as the doc mass export and runoff are tightly coupled dillon and molot 2005 it would be expected that higher precipitation would always increase the loss of organic carbon from terrestrial systems clair et al 1994 and lower precipitation amounts would cause a reduction in export of doc from terrestrial to aquatic systems schindler and curtis 1997 our simulated annual precipitation feedback index results are positive under all scenarios where precipitation increases and negative where it decreases and temperature is held constant indicating precipitation will have a positive impact and increase the streamflow doc flux figure 8 left however an increase in precipitation may not always correspond to an increase in the doc flux because the flux is also influenced by air temperature and the stored doc available in the terrestrial or wetlands portions of the watershed these results can also be explained by the higher correlation of changes in temperature on doc flux than from changes in precipitation only temperature plays a more important role on doc production and therefore on the availability of doc for transport within the catchment figure 9 represents the sensitivity of the average daily doc flux to changes in temperature only increase by 1 12 degrees of fahrenheit 5 2 sensitivity analysis we investigated the sensitivity of our rhessys model application to two important parameters that influence the amount of doc export in the penobscot watershed dom production rate and doc absorption rate dom which includes both dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen serves as a vector for the loss of carbon c and nitrogen n from terrestrial ecosystems the sensitivity of changes in doc export with changes in dom production rate is important in the penobscot watershed containing high organic matter with a low decomposition rate the dom production rate in rhessys is based on the soil parameter of each soil class and is scalar from 0 to 1 the dom production rate influences both the ecological and hydrological aspects of the doc simulation as it impacts the soil water availability for doc leached out into the stream the dom production rate parameter in the rhessys model is set to allow the conversion of a fraction of the litter carbon into doc and don dissolved organic nitrogen there is a spatial variation in soil type the dom production rate and the doc absorption rate in the penobscot watershed figure 10 shows the average daily streamflow doc flux under a changing dom production rate a higher dom production rate means more litter carbon is converted to doc and don however our sensitivity results reveal that the mean daily stream doc flux increases with an increase in the dom production rate until some threshold 30 increases in our study area where it then levels off and begins to decrease the dom production rate can decrease due to microbial competition for nitrogen that can limit vegetation growth in addition higher dom production rates mean more water consumption by plants during the decomposition processes those two factors will eventually decrease the amount of potential doc that can be leached out into the streams because they will slow the rate of carbon assimilation by the vegetation transport of doc from a terrestrial to aquatic system is also regulated by the mineral soil absorption doc absorption rate which is difficult to measure an increase in the mineral absorption rate of doc results in a decrease in doc flux and this negative correlation was found in this study in the penobscot watershed the existence of large reservoirs huntington et al 2013 appears to affect the doc absorption rates and the streamflow doc flux table 4 the lakes and reservoirs are modeled in rhessys by considering the depth and amount of storage in these land forms the outflow of the lakes and reservoirs into streams occurs through surface water and groundwater discharge table 4 shows the percentage of reservoirs and wetlands in a few sub watersheds of the penobscot watershed the seboeis watershed has the largest reservoir area and despite its large wetland area generally streamflow doc flux is positively correlated to wetland area creed et al 2008 laudon et al 2011 huntington and aiken 2013 the doc yield is less than two other watersheds piscataquis and kingsbury that were explored in this study figure 11 illustrates the sensitivity of streamflow doc flux to doc absorption rate as simulated by rhessys in the penobscot river our results indicate that even a slight decrease a decrease of 10 doc absorption rate in parameterizing this specific soil parameter would lead to a large increase in the amount of streamflow doc that is leached out of the watershed 6 discussion physical process based hydro ecological models can not only be used to model ecosystems and predict future conditions but also offer a frame work for analyzing and unveiling the mechanisms underlying various phenomena the existence of large wetland areas along with abundance of high organic matter in the penobscot watershed soil types resulted in a relatively high yield of doc 69 kg c ha year for the period of 2004 2012 as compared to most rivers in northern temperate or boreal zones hope et al 1994 hudon et al 1996 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 our simulated results also indicate a temporal variation in doc flux in our study time period 2004 2012 doc discharge varies over time in response to unusual hydrologic conditions such as drought and heavy precipitation events the lack of sufficient hydrological conditions for doc production and release into streams or the extreme flush of doc into streams caused by heavy rainfall can impact the doc export in the following years yurova et al 2008 huntington and aiken 2013 changes in doc concentration and flux would likely be more evident in the future as most of the projected climate scenarios are predicting increases in precipitation amount and intensity hayhoe et al 2007 as rhessys is a spatially distributed model we were able to study the impact of changes in physiological parameters on doc flux both as temporal changes as well as spatial controls variation in the dom production rate influenced eco hydrological processes controlling doc by regulating the hydrology and vegetation growth our sensitivity analysis showed that doc absorption rate was a key variable that influenced doc export and that lakes and reservoirs were found to be important sinks for doc because of their high doc absorption rates therefore a careful parameterization of doc absorption rate in lake and reservoirs can regulate the amount of doc export in streams in the penobscot watershed a careful model parameterization was needed to account for appropriate doc absorption rates due to the presence of these lakes and reservoirs within the penobscot watershed as slightly lower doc absorption rates would have resulted in large increases in streamflow doc flux the substantial number of reservoirs in the penobscot watershed tended to decrease the amount of doc release into streams by storing large amounts of doc in these lakes and reservoirs this would indicate that changes in the size of reservoirs resulting from climate change sedimentation or dam removal in the future would result in large changes in doc flux to streams furthermore the autochthonous and allochthonous sources can also contribute to the doc pool of lakes these generated doc forms along with terrestrial doc can be transported to a lake basin fowler et al 2018 the rhessys model which is more complex than the loadest regression model provides a better understanding of the watershed hydrological and ecological processes influencing the doc flux dynamic coupling between the hydrologic response and possible land cover changes and vegetation dynamics as well as climate variable changes in the rhessys model make studies of the impact of future projections more realistic 7 conclusion in this study we incorporated a spatially distributed hydro ecological process based model rhessys and remotely sensed data to simulate the detailed forest processes in the second largest watershed in new england the penobscot watershed the rhessys model was initialized and validated using both remotely sensed data npp and lai products and in situ measurements streamflow and doc flux thereby providing a reasonable platform to explore both ecological and hydrological controls on doc flux in this large heterogeneous watershed the rhessys results were evaluated by comparing them with additional field data and with loadest model results the rhessys simulation of streamflow and doc flux 74 kg c ha year for 2004 to 2007 agreed well with previously published measurements of streamflow and estimation of doc fluxes using the empirical loadest model huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot river and its major tributaries for the period of 2004 2007 71 kg c ha year in another study of in situ field measurements taken from the penobscot watershed cronan 2012 reported the penobscot watershed doc flux ranged from 43 to 80 kg c ha year during the 2000 2005 water years october 1 1999 to september 30 2005 given the high rate of doc production and doc export from the penobscot watershed entering into the gulf of maine the ability to understand and accurately model the hydrologic processes and carbon cycling from this large forested watershed is crucial the rhessys model enabled us to investigate the role of land cover types such as reservoirs in doc export the rhessys simulation indicated that large reservoirs in the penobscot watershed likely influenced the mineral absorption of doc resulting in decreased doc yields from basins that contained these reservoirs a recent study employed the results of a climate model to predict future changes in runoff in the penobscot river huntington et al 2016 and then applied the loadest model to predict how doc fluxes would respond to changes in runoff however an empirical model such as loadest cannot fully incorporate the detailed changes in vegetation that are likely to result from projected climate changes nor can it lead to a fuller understanding of how these changes will influence doc production and transport from the soil to aquatic systems furthermore empirical models do not consider the dynamic interactions of factors controlling doc production and doc export resulting in assumptions of stationarity in the parameters controlling the export of doc from rivers that are not sufficient enough for studies of future projections the rhessys model can provide more robust estimates of the potential effects of climate changes and land cover changes on doc flux and doc production the success we demonstrate in simulating the doc flux and concentration from this large forested watershed represents an ideal framework to test future hypotheses and better understand the ecological and hydrological controls on doc production and fluxes over a larger scale the penobscot watershed is the second largest watershed in the united states to be modeled using rhessys the impact of climate change and vegetation composition change on both the doc production and doc flux in the penobscot watershed can be further explored through use of the rhessys model

1013,dissolved organic carbon doc is an important component of the carbon cycle as a measure of the hydrological transport of carbon between terrestrial carbon pools into soil pools and eventually into streams as a result changes in doc in rivers and streams may indicate alterations in the storage of terrestrial carbon exploring the complex interactions between biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic processes as well as the micro climate variabilities that impact the rate of doc fluxes are challenging because the information is not readily available from in situ measurements or from empirical models alone this is particularly true of large scale watersheds the penobscot watershed is the largest watershed of the gulf of maine and the second largest in new england its typical soils with high organic matter and a large forested and wetland landscape result in higher doc fluxes than what has been observed previously for most rivers in the northern temperate or boreal zones hope et al 1994 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 in this study we emphasized the simulation of streamflow and doc fluxes from the penobscot watershed and several tributaries within the penobscot watershed using the spatially distributed process based regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys model simulated results were evaluated using field measurements streamflow doc fluxes and remotely sensed products net primary production npp and leaf area index lai from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the average doc flux for the penobscot watershed during 2004 2012 using the rhessys model was 69 kg c ha year the rhessys simulated doc flux is shown to correlate well with observed values as well as with results previously reported from the empirical load estimator loadest model 71 kg c ha year for 2004 2007 huntington and aiken 2013 our simulated results also show a temporal variation in the amount of doc flux indicating that the antecedent doc concentration from one year can impact the doc export in following years thus doc concentration is positively correlated with streamflow and antecedent precipitation in agreement with previous studies ågren et al 2010 huntington and aiken 2013 tian et al 2013 the successful application of the rigorous rhessys model in the penobscot watershed makes it a reasonable platform to test future scenarios impacting the hydrology and biogeochemistry within similar large complex watersheds 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc is an important component of the carbon cycle as doc from the terrestrial sphere leaches into aquatic systems and eventually exports large quantity of the doc to the marine environment although doc fluxes are small in comparison to some other carbon fluxes in the ecosystem they serve an important role in the carbon balance of litter and of the upper layer of soil the o horizon the importance of doc lies in its role in the hydrologic transport of carbon between living biomass carbon pools into soil pools and eventually into streams thus temporal changes of doc in streams may indicate changes in terrestrial carbon storage therefore affecting exchanges between the biosphere geosphere and atmosphere worrall and burt 2007 williamson et al 2008 bianchi et al 2009 soil organic carbon is a crucial carbon sink and the largest contributor of net carbon flux from the land to the atmosphere schlesinger 1997 lettens et al 2007 changes in doc concentration have been observed in a number of catchments across the northern hemisphere monteith et al 2007 bragee et al 2014 leading to concerns about changes in carbon cycling that may affect sequestration or the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems changes in doc export and concentration may also have adverse impacts on aquatic systems as increasing doc concentrations may have important effects on the quality of drinking water haaland and mulder 2009 on ecological processes gergel et al 1999 miller et al 2016 and on mercury dynamics forsius et al 2010 increases in terrestrially derived doc concentrations in aquatic ecosystems may also lead to a rise in aquatic carbon dioxide emissions as well as decreasing light penetration schindler et al 1996 a number of watersheds have been experiencing increases in doc transport as a result of increasing temperatures and precipitation from climate change huntington et al 2016 worral and burt 2007 in large complex watersheds doc dynamics are controlled by both hydrologic processes and the effects of the landscape such as the proportion of wetland and forested areas tranvik and jansson 2002 frost et al 2006 creed et al 2008 yang et al 2017 laudon et al 2011 therefore in addition to climate change the type of land covers that a watershed is made up of will also affect the nutrients and matter entering its streams difficulty in obtaining frequent field measurements along with a lack of consistency between laboratory studies and field measurements have made it hard to obtain accurate estimates of the doc present in soil and to monitor the doc flux from terrestrial to aquatic systems kalbitz et al 2000 especially in large heterogeneous catchments therefore ecosystem models can help us to quantify and monitor possible changes in terrestrial carbon cycling in this study we present data to simulate and quantify the doc flux from the penobscot watershed the second largest watershed in new england into the gulf of maine for the period of 2004 2012 we carefully parametrized the physical and ecological properties of the penobscot watershed and used the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys a semi mechanistic water nutrient and carbon cycling model band et al 2000 band et al 1993 tague and band 2004 rhessys gives us the opportunity to explore and simulate details of watershed biogeochemistry by combining a process based model of vegetation growth with hydrologic and decomposition models characterizing ecosystem carbon fluxes and estimating the quantities of these fluxes at various scales local regional continental and global improves our understanding of the relationship between the terrestrial biosphere the atmosphere and aquatic systems law et al 2004 xiao et al 2010 because the parameters defining these processes are difficult to measure and there is substantial uncertainty in these values as a result of the heterogeneity of the large penobscot watershed landscape we also performed sensitivity analysis on a number of the model s parameters details are described in the methodology section rhessys has enhanced our ability to better understand the mechanisms that drive the biogeochemical processes band et al 2001 christensen et al 2008 tague et al 2013 tague and band 2004 vicente serrano et al 2015 zierl et al 2007 which may also help us better study the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow doc within a very large catchment and explore the impact of vegetation processes on streamflow a reasonable estimation of doc fluxes from this large heterogeneous watershed could be used to model future climate change and land cover change impacts under varying model setups land cover types anthropogenic development deforestation changes in climate status etc this model will become a useful tool to estimate doc loads under changing climate and land cover disturbances 2 study site the penobscot river watershed in north central maine is the second largest watershed in new england draining about 22 400 km2 nearly one third of the state of maine despite its size the watershed has a low human population density and is mostly forested including red maple spruce sugar maple yellow birch and white pine with extensive bogs marshes and wooded swamps covered in shrubs griffith and alerich 1996 forested wetlands scrub shrub wetlands and emergent wetlands are three types of wetlands in the penobscot watershed the penobscot watershed also has many large lakes and tributaries which make it a suitable environment for important native fisheries such as the atlantic salmon and brook trout the penobscot watershed is mostly well drained with acidic soils that contain high organic matter with a low decomposition rate precipitation is distributed rather uniformly throughout the year with mean annual precipitation of 108 cm 42 5 inches and a mean annual temperature of 6 1 c 43 f national climatic data center 1975 2015 runoff as an important factor controlling doc export into the aquatic system is dominated by snowmelt in high latitude areas lammers et al 2001 on average 60 of annual flow in new england happens during the winter and spring therefore snowmelt has the greatest effect on annual streamflow which also coincides with the highest peak of doc discharge runoff and doc export from the penobscot watershed has a large impact on the near coastal ocean in the gulf of maine huntington et al 2016 balch et al 2012 2016 gnanadesikan et al 2019 so it is important to study the temporal trends of doc flux from this watershed into the marine ecosystem the penobscot watershed is an ideal watershed to investigate how these trends will change according to future climate change and land cover change projections because it is a large basin representative of the gulf of maine watershed and has been well studied figure 1 illustrates the penobscot watershed and its vegetation types in state of maine across the new england region in the united states the vegetation data were derived from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd dataset and were downloaded from the national map viewer http viewer nationalmap gov viewer 3 data the hydrologic data used for calibration and validation purposes were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database u s geological survey 2014 daily streamflow data for the west enfield gauge station somewhat inland were downloaded from the nwis database for the period of 2000 2012 site number 01034500 the discharge for the actual mouth of the penobscot river site number 01036390 was not available for this time period so the daily discharge was estimated from the west enfield data using an area adjustment this method of estimation has been used in previous studies hodgkins 1999 huntington and aiken 2013 where the export of doc from the penobscot watershed was modeled using the same observational doc data with the coarser resolution empirical load estimator loadest model runkel et al 2004 remotely sensed data were used in this study to provide the spatial input data required by rhessys to create flowpath and landscape representations input maps and remote sensing data used in this study were land cover soil type vegetation type leaf area index lai and a digital elevation model dem the dem data for the state of maine were obtained from the national elevation dataset ned in this study 500 meter resolution data were used scaling up from the 30 meter elevation data available from the national map viewer website http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the nearest neighbor resampling technique http pro arcgis com en pro app tool reference data management resample html was used in arcgis for scaling up the 30 meter resolution data to 500 meter resolution the 500 meter resolution was chosen in this study because of the large scale of the penobscot watershed and the ability to compare rhessys simulated results with gridded 500 meter satellite derived moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products for evaluation land cover data were also downloaded from the national map viewer http viewer nationalmap gov viewer the version used in this research is from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd classifying 17 land types in this study land cover data were then reclassified to five types undeveloped high intensity urban area medium intensity urban area low intensity urban area and agriculture which were then defined in the rhessys land cover classification the vegetation data were also derived from the 2006 nlcd dataset the nine categories used in this study were selected and defined in rhessys as the vegetation classification types of un vegetated mixed forest crops grass deciduous evergreen shrub wetland and wetland forest in addition lai information was used leaf area index is defined as the one sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies the 500 meter resolution mcd15a2h satellite product derived from combined terra and aqua modis data were used in this study https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov other spatial input data such as slope aspect drainage and wetness index were created from the dem map using grass 6 4 https grass osgeo org grass64 and the stream network was created from the drainage map table 1 summarizes the rhessys input data and sources used in this study in addition to meteorological time series data and geographic information system gis based inputs a library of commonly used parameter files was also assembled from an extensive literature search of field measurements and specific soil data in the u s department of agriculture usda natural resource conservation service soil survey geographic database ssurgo in order to initialize soil parameters and assign vegetation and land use type information these initial state variables correspond to the definition files that describe the characteristics of the variables associated with each level of the spatial hierarchy defined in the rhessys model white et al 2000 the field measured doc flux information from the penobscot watershed that was used in this study for validation was obtained from continuous discharge measurements and discrete water sampling done by huntington and aiken 2013 the data from 2008 to 2013 were reported in huntington et al 2016 and are available from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2014 the data collected by bowdoin college are available from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa seabass archive http seabass gsfc nasa gov seabasscgi archive cgi q bowdoin camill 3rivers archive our simulated doc flux values were then compared with the observed measurements in addition we compared our rhessys results with those from the empirical loadest regression model huntington and aiken 2013 4 methodology 4 1 the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys rhessys band et al 2000 band et al 1993 tague and band 2004 is a physical process based model combining hydrologic biogeochemical and microclimate processes that enables modeling of the spatial temporal interactions between the different processes at the watershed scale furthermore its internal structure uses a hierarchical representation to define the landscape and combines several different process models topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 biome bgc running and hunt jr 1993 and mtn clim running et al 1987 along with two distributed hydrologic models topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 making it possible to study fluxes at different scales the biome bgc model an eco physiological model is used within the rhessys model for carbon water and nitrogen flux simulations the mtn clim model incorporates the user defined climate base information to derive the spatially resolved climate variables at the watershed scale the hydrological models allow us to simulate both vertical and lateral flows in this study we initialized the model with climate inputs minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation and remote sensing data through the gis based model framework of rhessys each spatial unit within the catchment scale is associated with specific processes modeled by rhessys a text document called a worldfile generated from references maps linking to the parameter definition files default files meteorological time series along with initial state variables was used to represent the landscape at watershed scale these initial state variables such as soil moisture atmospheric co2 etc correspond to the default files that describe the characteristics of the variables associated with each level of the spatial hierarchy the default file values are defined based on literature reviews and they remain constant through time a flowtable describes the connectivity between patches the finest spatial unit in this model to model subsurface and overland flow routing dynamic coupling between hydrologic response and vegetation and land cover dynamics is implemented with this differential representation of vertical and lateral processes at different temporal scales the flowtable is created based on the set of specific reference maps incorporating topology soil types and landscape representation of the watershed these are the same reference maps that are used for worldfile creation as well more information about the flowtable in the rhessys model can be found at https github com rhessys rhessys wiki flowtable 4 2 spin up calibration and validation the rhessys model for this study was set up for the penobscot watershed under historic land cover and climate conditions and then the soil carbon and nitrogen stores were stabilized and an organic soil layer was built up from initial bare ground by spinning up the system for 750 years until a state of equilibrium was reached for soil carbon and nitrogen and vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools in our study area after the spin up process the usgs stream gauge record was used to calibrate the model for several drainage related parameters that cannot be directly measured beven and freer 2001 tague et al 2013 by comparing rhessys modeled streamflow to observed streamflow records these calibrated hydrologic parameters include the hydraulic conductivity at the surface ksat 0 the decay of hydraulic conductivity with depth m and two groundwater parameters the first of which controls the proportion of infiltrated water that bypasses the soil to reach a deeper groundwater table gw1 and the second of which controls the rate of lateral flow from a hillslope scale groundwater table to the stream channel gw2 the calibration effort first used a monte carlo sampling method to run the model over a range of values liang et al 2011 the best fit results were then used for further evaluations using the markov chain approach metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 liu et al 2000 de martino et al 2013 the quality of the correspondence of the calibrated parameters improves as they approach the desired statistical distribution that best fit our study area therefore the best calibrated parameters were selected for future runs from calibration results that exhibited optimal correspondence between usgs observed and rhessys simulated streamflow based on the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and best r squared measures the rhessys model was then used to simulate the streamflow for the period from 01 01 2000 to 12 31 2003 for calibration and then from 01 01 2004 to 12 31 2012 for validation of the penobscot river at eddington site number 01036390 our rhessys simulated results correlated well with observed streamflow at annual monthly and daily steps figure 2 shows the penobscot watershed s simulated streamflow versus the observed streamflow using the rhessys model r2 0 76 figure 3 and table 2 present the correlation between annual monthly and daily rhessys simulated streamflow versus observed streamflow 4 3 the carbon cycle simulation inrhessys rhessys uses a set of mathematical representations of the key processes controlling carbon cycling dynamics within an ecosystem carbon cycling estimation within the rhessys model includes the estimation of photosynthesis farquhar photosynthesis model farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 vegetation respiration ryan model ryan 1991 vegetation allocation processes and turnover rates as vegetation specific parameters and scaled by environmental factors landsberg and waring 1997 thornton 1998 and soil decomposition and respiration rates parton et al 1996 more details about the mathematical equations used in each sub model of rhessys can be found in tague and band 2004 during carbon cycling in rhessys carbon will be fixed by plants from atmospheric co₂ as a function of temperature nutrients radiation and water availability the amount of carbon left after vegetation respiration is then allocated to the various parts of plants the primary first carbon pool leaves stemwood and fine roots there are four litter and soil pools defined in rhessys the secondary carbon pools the doc in soil solutions is produced from the decomposition processes in the secondary carbon pools soil and litter carbon pools the decomposition rate is estimated by first using base decomposition rates for the different litter and soil pools and then is scaled by soil temperature nutrient availability and soil water content nutrient availability impacts both photosynthesis and decomposition processes within rhessys modeling a partitioning strategy followed by landsberg and waring 1997 is used in the rhessys model to simulate the impact of nutrient availability and soil moisture content on species specific allocation ratios the amount of doc being transported from the soil solution into the streams is then controlled by the changes in water content of the three layer zones root zone unsaturated zone and saturated zone which are defined in rhessys to simulate the vertical fluxes the amount of doc that gets leached out from the soil is a function of soil porosity the decay rate of soil porosity with soil depth root zone depth the available doc in the soil the doc distribution with depth the dom dissolved organic matter production rate the doc absorption rate and the soil water content figure 4 represents the carbon cycle simulation within the rhessys model 4 4 impact of climate variables on doc flux we studied the impact of projected changes in climate variables individually temperature and precipitation based on the u s global change research program report karl and others 2009 for the northeastern united states we then used a feedback index fi to estimate the extent to which changes in a parameter will influence the doc flux 1 fi stream do c i stream do c 0 β i β 0 where the stream doci is the simulated seasonally annually averaged stream doc flux using the changed values for the test parameter the stream doc0 is the simulated background stream doc flux using the original values for the test parameter βi is the new value of the test parameter and β0 is the original value of the test parameter a positive fi means larger values of the test parameter will increase the doc flux and a negative fi means larger values of the test parameter will decrease the doc flux 5 results 5 1 simulated daily stream doc concentration and flux using the rhessys model we were able to simulate the daily penobscot watershed doc flux and concentration quite successfully estimated daily doc fluxes for the penobscot river at eddington averaged 69 kg c ha year during the period 2004 2012 we then compared the simulated doc flux with observed doc flux values from the penobscot watershed for the period of 2004 2012 the field measured doc flux from the penobscot watershed which was used in this study for validation was obtained from continuous discharge measurements and the discrete water sampling done by huntington and aiken 2013 where the samples were collected periodically throughout the year more samples were collected from the penobscot river at eddington than other tributaries inside the penobscot watershed more details about the methodology of sampling can be found in huntington and aiken 2013 figure 5 shows the simulated doc flux orange line and the observed values purple points at the bottom and the simulated streamflow black line and observed streamflow green line at the top figure 6 illustrates the simulated doc flux green line and the observed value orange points in logarithm scale for better visualization the simulated doc flux correlates well with the observed values r 0 66 rmse 0 053 std 0 041 figure 7 the correlation is highest during winter time 0 86 and lowest in spring 0 6 the average annual doc flux varied throughout the years of simulation for wet and dry periods among the simulated years 2004 2012 the year 2004 had the lowest streamflow doc flux which also corresponded to the lowest streamflow and precipitation amounts for that year the high peak of doc flux in 2005 occurred during the time of snowmelt and may be caused by the accumulation of soil carbon during the previous year 2004 this high peak also coincided with higher precipitation amounts in 2005 thus during 2005 heavy precipitation events and resulting runoff carried a large amount of doc into the streams it must be noted that in 2006 there were lower amounts of doc in the streams even though the precipitation amounts and the streamflow for 2006 were almost as large as those in 2005 however there does not appear to have been sufficient stored doc in the soil from 2005 to lead to high doc amounts in the soil solution for 2006 this tendency towards a memory has also been noted in other studies indicating that the stored doc concentration in one year can impact the doc export in the following year yurova et al 2008 huntington and aiken 2013 this short term change in the concentration discharge relation indicated that in this case the doc was supply limited despite the generally good agreement between the rhessys simulated results and the observed values the model overestimated the doc flux during periods where the snowmelt coincided with extreme precipitation events such as in 2005 and 2009 and again during high precipitation events in the late fall of 2005 when the model also overestimated streamflow at those time of years note that doc flux is a function of streamflow our rhessys simulated monthly doc concentration results for the period of 2004 2012 indicated that on average doc concentrations were highest during summer time and lowest during winter time and especially during the early spring snowmelt period data not shown this high doc concentration in summer and lower doc concentration during winter was also previously reported by of huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot river to further compare the simulated streamflow doc flux with the measured values and to test the reliability of our modeled results we also compared the rhessys simulated results with previously modeled values from the empirical loadest model huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot watershed the loadest regression program runkel et al 2004 is widely used for constituent loads in stream and river estimations loadest is used to estimate doc nutrient pesticide and contaminant export by using daily river discharge data plus paired discrete instantaneous discharge data and constituent concentration data huntington and aiken 2013 used the loadest model over a time period that they had discrete sample collections during 2004 2007 for the penobscot river at eddington and during 2004 2005 for the tributaries table 3 summarizes the rhessys streamflow doc simulations as compared with the loadest simulation results from the penobscot watershed and three of the sub watersheds inside the larger penobscot watershed the rhessys simulated results for doc fluxes and carbon yields compare well with the loadest from the large penobscot watershed and sub watersheds the complexity of the rhessys model where carbon cycle processes are responsive to environmental conditions allows us to understand the underlying physical processes and how they affect doc flux in ways that the loadest regression model cannot physical hydro ecological models like the rhessys model enable us to better understand how various parameters impact a simulated result through sensitivity analysis and explore the spatial variation in doc flux among the watershed tributaries considering different land cover types in stream doc is tightly linked to both the ecological processes and hydrological processes but the physiological parameters defining these processes are difficult to measure and there is much uncertainty in these values because of the heterogeneity of the large penobscot watershed landscape the second largest watershed modeled thus far with the rhessys model the south platte in colorado was the largest watershed modeled by the rhessys baron et al 1998 we performed a sensitivity analysis on two parameters that have direct control on the amount of doc export dom production rate and doc absorption rate described more in sensitivity analysis section this analysis was not conducted in the previous sensitivity analysis yang 2013 yang 2013 performed an extensive sensitivity analysis of dom decay rate temperature nitrogen deposition rates soil depth the ratio of infiltrated water that bypasses soil directly into a deeper groundwater table and the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of leaf litter yang 2013 found that slightly higher nitrogen deposition amounts and temperatures as well as a deeper soil depth can lead to increased stream doc flux and concentrations any increase in the stream doc flux and concentration caused by increasing the nitrogen deposition only occurs up to the point where the nitrogen is no longer a limiting factor for vegetation growth also the model is sensitive to changes in nitrogen deposition and the initialization of soil c n ratios the nitrogen required for microbial processes depends on the soil c n ratio and nitrogen deposition and the availability of nitrogen a higher c n ratio would result in less availability of nitrogen for microbial processes furthermore the yang 2013 study concluded that rises in temperature may also act as a limiting factor for vegetation growth after some optimum threshold further rises in temperature beyond this threshold will only increase the respiration rate and decrease stream doc flux and concentration this negative impact of further rises in temperature and decline in doc export are also captured by the rhessys model implemented for this study our simulated annual temperature feedback index results described in methodology section are positive under all scenarios indicating temperature will have a positive impact and increase the streamflow doc flux figure 8 right however as temperature increases the increase in doc flux in response to increasing temperature decreases exponentially as discussed above even though rises in air temperature may initially stimulate primary vegetation production by accelerating photosynthesis and enhancing vegetation respiration and organic matter decay rates temperatures may reach a point at which they exceed the tolerance of vegetation and then they may act as a limiting factor for vegetation growth bassow et al 1994 wayne et al 1998 under these conditions an increasing temperature will only serve to increase respiration rates and decrease stream doc flux and concentration changes in streamflow doc flux become more complicated when precipitation estimates alone are changed to be consistent with precipitation projections as discussed precipitation is key in explaining changes in the long term doc pattern hudson et al 2003 the store of doc compounds in peaty soils is flushed from the soil by rainfall or snowmelt with the highest concentrations often coinciding with the higher flow levels arvola et al 2004 worrall et al 2002 laudon et al 2004 as the doc mass export and runoff are tightly coupled dillon and molot 2005 it would be expected that higher precipitation would always increase the loss of organic carbon from terrestrial systems clair et al 1994 and lower precipitation amounts would cause a reduction in export of doc from terrestrial to aquatic systems schindler and curtis 1997 our simulated annual precipitation feedback index results are positive under all scenarios where precipitation increases and negative where it decreases and temperature is held constant indicating precipitation will have a positive impact and increase the streamflow doc flux figure 8 left however an increase in precipitation may not always correspond to an increase in the doc flux because the flux is also influenced by air temperature and the stored doc available in the terrestrial or wetlands portions of the watershed these results can also be explained by the higher correlation of changes in temperature on doc flux than from changes in precipitation only temperature plays a more important role on doc production and therefore on the availability of doc for transport within the catchment figure 9 represents the sensitivity of the average daily doc flux to changes in temperature only increase by 1 12 degrees of fahrenheit 5 2 sensitivity analysis we investigated the sensitivity of our rhessys model application to two important parameters that influence the amount of doc export in the penobscot watershed dom production rate and doc absorption rate dom which includes both dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen serves as a vector for the loss of carbon c and nitrogen n from terrestrial ecosystems the sensitivity of changes in doc export with changes in dom production rate is important in the penobscot watershed containing high organic matter with a low decomposition rate the dom production rate in rhessys is based on the soil parameter of each soil class and is scalar from 0 to 1 the dom production rate influences both the ecological and hydrological aspects of the doc simulation as it impacts the soil water availability for doc leached out into the stream the dom production rate parameter in the rhessys model is set to allow the conversion of a fraction of the litter carbon into doc and don dissolved organic nitrogen there is a spatial variation in soil type the dom production rate and the doc absorption rate in the penobscot watershed figure 10 shows the average daily streamflow doc flux under a changing dom production rate a higher dom production rate means more litter carbon is converted to doc and don however our sensitivity results reveal that the mean daily stream doc flux increases with an increase in the dom production rate until some threshold 30 increases in our study area where it then levels off and begins to decrease the dom production rate can decrease due to microbial competition for nitrogen that can limit vegetation growth in addition higher dom production rates mean more water consumption by plants during the decomposition processes those two factors will eventually decrease the amount of potential doc that can be leached out into the streams because they will slow the rate of carbon assimilation by the vegetation transport of doc from a terrestrial to aquatic system is also regulated by the mineral soil absorption doc absorption rate which is difficult to measure an increase in the mineral absorption rate of doc results in a decrease in doc flux and this negative correlation was found in this study in the penobscot watershed the existence of large reservoirs huntington et al 2013 appears to affect the doc absorption rates and the streamflow doc flux table 4 the lakes and reservoirs are modeled in rhessys by considering the depth and amount of storage in these land forms the outflow of the lakes and reservoirs into streams occurs through surface water and groundwater discharge table 4 shows the percentage of reservoirs and wetlands in a few sub watersheds of the penobscot watershed the seboeis watershed has the largest reservoir area and despite its large wetland area generally streamflow doc flux is positively correlated to wetland area creed et al 2008 laudon et al 2011 huntington and aiken 2013 the doc yield is less than two other watersheds piscataquis and kingsbury that were explored in this study figure 11 illustrates the sensitivity of streamflow doc flux to doc absorption rate as simulated by rhessys in the penobscot river our results indicate that even a slight decrease a decrease of 10 doc absorption rate in parameterizing this specific soil parameter would lead to a large increase in the amount of streamflow doc that is leached out of the watershed 6 discussion physical process based hydro ecological models can not only be used to model ecosystems and predict future conditions but also offer a frame work for analyzing and unveiling the mechanisms underlying various phenomena the existence of large wetland areas along with abundance of high organic matter in the penobscot watershed soil types resulted in a relatively high yield of doc 69 kg c ha year for the period of 2004 2012 as compared to most rivers in northern temperate or boreal zones hope et al 1994 hudon et al 1996 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 our simulated results also indicate a temporal variation in doc flux in our study time period 2004 2012 doc discharge varies over time in response to unusual hydrologic conditions such as drought and heavy precipitation events the lack of sufficient hydrological conditions for doc production and release into streams or the extreme flush of doc into streams caused by heavy rainfall can impact the doc export in the following years yurova et al 2008 huntington and aiken 2013 changes in doc concentration and flux would likely be more evident in the future as most of the projected climate scenarios are predicting increases in precipitation amount and intensity hayhoe et al 2007 as rhessys is a spatially distributed model we were able to study the impact of changes in physiological parameters on doc flux both as temporal changes as well as spatial controls variation in the dom production rate influenced eco hydrological processes controlling doc by regulating the hydrology and vegetation growth our sensitivity analysis showed that doc absorption rate was a key variable that influenced doc export and that lakes and reservoirs were found to be important sinks for doc because of their high doc absorption rates therefore a careful parameterization of doc absorption rate in lake and reservoirs can regulate the amount of doc export in streams in the penobscot watershed a careful model parameterization was needed to account for appropriate doc absorption rates due to the presence of these lakes and reservoirs within the penobscot watershed as slightly lower doc absorption rates would have resulted in large increases in streamflow doc flux the substantial number of reservoirs in the penobscot watershed tended to decrease the amount of doc release into streams by storing large amounts of doc in these lakes and reservoirs this would indicate that changes in the size of reservoirs resulting from climate change sedimentation or dam removal in the future would result in large changes in doc flux to streams furthermore the autochthonous and allochthonous sources can also contribute to the doc pool of lakes these generated doc forms along with terrestrial doc can be transported to a lake basin fowler et al 2018 the rhessys model which is more complex than the loadest regression model provides a better understanding of the watershed hydrological and ecological processes influencing the doc flux dynamic coupling between the hydrologic response and possible land cover changes and vegetation dynamics as well as climate variable changes in the rhessys model make studies of the impact of future projections more realistic 7 conclusion in this study we incorporated a spatially distributed hydro ecological process based model rhessys and remotely sensed data to simulate the detailed forest processes in the second largest watershed in new england the penobscot watershed the rhessys model was initialized and validated using both remotely sensed data npp and lai products and in situ measurements streamflow and doc flux thereby providing a reasonable platform to explore both ecological and hydrological controls on doc flux in this large heterogeneous watershed the rhessys results were evaluated by comparing them with additional field data and with loadest model results the rhessys simulation of streamflow and doc flux 74 kg c ha year for 2004 to 2007 agreed well with previously published measurements of streamflow and estimation of doc fluxes using the empirical loadest model huntington and aiken 2013 for the penobscot river and its major tributaries for the period of 2004 2007 71 kg c ha year in another study of in situ field measurements taken from the penobscot watershed cronan 2012 reported the penobscot watershed doc flux ranged from 43 to 80 kg c ha year during the 2000 2005 water years october 1 1999 to september 30 2005 given the high rate of doc production and doc export from the penobscot watershed entering into the gulf of maine the ability to understand and accurately model the hydrologic processes and carbon cycling from this large forested watershed is crucial the rhessys model enabled us to investigate the role of land cover types such as reservoirs in doc export the rhessys simulation indicated that large reservoirs in the penobscot watershed likely influenced the mineral absorption of doc resulting in decreased doc yields from basins that contained these reservoirs a recent study employed the results of a climate model to predict future changes in runoff in the penobscot river huntington et al 2016 and then applied the loadest model to predict how doc fluxes would respond to changes in runoff however an empirical model such as loadest cannot fully incorporate the detailed changes in vegetation that are likely to result from projected climate changes nor can it lead to a fuller understanding of how these changes will influence doc production and transport from the soil to aquatic systems furthermore empirical models do not consider the dynamic interactions of factors controlling doc production and doc export resulting in assumptions of stationarity in the parameters controlling the export of doc from rivers that are not sufficient enough for studies of future projections the rhessys model can provide more robust estimates of the potential effects of climate changes and land cover changes on doc flux and doc production the success we demonstrate in simulating the doc flux and concentration from this large forested watershed represents an ideal framework to test future hypotheses and better understand the ecological and hydrological controls on doc production and fluxes over a larger scale the penobscot watershed is the second largest watershed in the united states to be modeled using rhessys the impact of climate change and vegetation composition change on both the doc production and doc flux in the penobscot watershed can be further explored through use of the rhessys model

1014,in recent years the ecohydrological separation paradigm has stimulated significant scientific debate as it challenges the basis of existing hydrological process understanding through the use of stable isotope analysis several studies have demonstrated that two isotopically distinct water stores may exist within the subsurface a matric bound store which sustains transpiration and a mobile store which contributes to the recharge of groundwater and streams despite growing evidence supporting this hypothesis further testing across a range of climatic regimes and environmental settings has been advocated to develop an improved hydrological understand of this paradigm in this study the dual isotopic composition of meteoric and environmental waters was analysed in a semi arid riparian environment during a significant el nino induced drought to ascertain if plants were using water that would have otherwise contributed to stream and or groundwater recharge overall the results of these investigations showed no clear evidence supporting ecohydrological separation environmental waters were found to be significantly different from rainfall whereas no significant differences were established between xylem bulk soil water and streamflow while these findings represent a unique scenario with regards to the testing of ecohydrological separation these results are by no means ubiquitous as sampling was conducted during extreme climatic conditions with limited spatio temporal representation of the system therefore longer term sampling and monitoring is recommended to obtain an improved understanding of the system under a range of climatic conditions keywords ecohydrological separation dual stable isotopes isotopically distinct meteoric water lines line conditioned excess 1 introduction the movement of precipitation and the complex rapport between the partitioning of this water in the sub surface and its subsequent influence on hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration and streamflow has attracted the interests of scientists for over a century and remains an area of active research effort mcdonnell 2014 hervé fernández et al 2016 mccutcheon et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 berry et al 2017 the mediatory role which the vadose zone plays within the hydrological cycle is paramount to advance the existing understanding and modelling of hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales mccutcheon et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 the concept of translatory flow has long dominated the conceptualization of hydrological models geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 this paradigm is predicated on the assumption that water within the soil matrix is well mixed and antecedent soil water will be rapidly displaced by new water from ensuing rainfall events subsequently leading to water being pushed further down the soil profile and eventually contributing to streamflow hewlett and hibbert 1966 this implies that during root water uptake vegetation uses water that would have otherwise contributed to the recharge of groundwater or streamflow hewlett and hibbert 1966 brooks et al 2010 challenged this paradigm through the analysis of deuterium and oxygen 18 δ2h and δ18o isotopes by demonstrating that vegetation within a seasonally dry catchment were using tightly bound soil water that did not contribute to streamflow or groundwater recharge the basis of this approach was predicated on the assumption that two water worlds tww exist within the subsurface these isotopically distinct stores are characterised by a tightly bound store which sustains transpiration and a mobile store which contributes to the recharge of groundwater and streams the rationale for using stable isotopes to identify these distinct water stores within the subsurface can be attributed to the location at which measured values of δ2h and δ18o in water samples lie within the dual isotope space mccutcheon et al 2016 according to gat 2005 measured values of δ2h and δ18o in meteoric waters for a particular region display a linear relationship usually described as a local meteoric water line lmwl during non equilibrium conditions waters that have undergone evaporation will lie along an evaporation line that possesses a slope lower than the lmwl hervé fernández et al 2016 according to mccutcheon et al 2016 the tww hypothesis can be summarized as follows draining or mobile waters which eventually recharge streams and groundwater will usually plot along the lmwl whereas tightly bound soil water will tend to plot along an evaporation line with xylem water plotting in a similar space mccutcheon et al 2016 brooks et al 2010 postulated that this occurrence could be attributed to soil micro pores being recharged by the first rainfall events after a dry summer with the isotopic signature of water stored in these pores remaining unaffected by subsequent rainfall events once transpiration resumed during the following dry summer the plants would use this tightly bound water following the drainage of mobile soil water which recharges streams and groundwater several studies have since provided evidence supporting the notion of the existence of tww or ecohydrological separation qian et al 2017 evaristo et al 2015 demonstrated that this occurrence is widespread across various biomes and more common than initially perceived however a few studies have suggested that ecohydrological separation may be seasonal rather than exclusively spatial in nature geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 qian et al 2017 the abovementioned findings potentially have major implications for hydrological modelling applications as the basis of existing hydrological model parametrizations and conceptualizations may need to be revisited to more adequately represent ecohydrological processes evaristo et al 2015 cain et al 2019 luo et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in order to better understand the concept of ecohydrological separation further testing is advocated and required across various biomes soil types and climatic regimes mcdonnell 2014 this in turn may also assist in revealing the limits of the ecohydrological separation paradigm pfister and kirchner 2017 in this study we aimed to test for ecohydrological separation in a semi arid riparian environment during a very significant el niño induced drought period kogan and gao 2016 for this purpose the dual stable isotopic composition of meteoric waters and environmental waters xylem soil ground and stream water were analysed to determine whether plant species situated within the riparian zone along a perennial river system were utilizing water that would have otherwise contributed to streamflow or groundwater recharge during the extreme drought conditions according to qiu et al 2019 the testing of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis is poorly represented in semi arid and arid environments subsequently the results of our investigations may shed further light as to whether the existence of ecohydrological separation is a common occurrence in these environments 2 methodology 2 1 study site this study was conducted within the riparian zone along a section of the groot letaba river which flows through the limpopo province located in the north eastern region of south africa fig 1 the topography within the catchment varies from mountainous regions in the western parts of the catchment to flatter low lying areas in the eastern regions the average elevation within the study site is approximately 400 m a s l the river section studied is situated within a semi arid region and generally experiences hot wet summers and mild dry winters with a mean annual temperature of 25 50 c katambara and ndiritu 2010 rainfall is seasonal and generally occurs as convective showers and thundershowers during the summer months october to march with 40 50 occurring in january and february katambara and ndiritu 2010 mean annual potential evaporation as measured by a pan is approximately 2097 93 mm and exceeds mean annual precipitation 417 50 mm approximately three quarters of the catchment are underlain by gneiss and granitic formations due to the large presence of granites weathered zones are generally shallow with soils possessing a sandy texture riddell et al 2017 vegetation situated within the study site was dominated by woody savanna shrubs and large trees particularly ficus sycomorus philonoptera violecia and diospyros mespiliformis gokool et al 2018 2 2 data collection and analysis rainfall data and samples for the study site were collected using a davistm vantage pro 2 weather station for the period june 2015 till october 2016 all samples were collected and stored in hermetic vials within 24 hours following the conclusion of a rain event to minimize the effects of evaporation according to gokool et al 2018 during this period the cumulative rainfall received within the study site was approximately 180 mm which is substantially lower than the mean annual precipitation due to the effect of the drought and the remote locality of the study site only a limited number of meteoric water samples were collected and available for analysis additional isotopic rainfall data from october 2017 to february 2018 was acquired from the international water management institute iwmi for a nearby quaternary catchment b81d the rationale for sourcing this data was done in an attempt to provide a more representative elucidation of the rainfall isotopic characteristics within the study region environmental waters were collected from 6 separate sampling points within the riparian zone distributed along a 14 km segment of the groot letaba river sampling was undertaken on 3 separate occasions august september and october during the 2016 dry season gokool et al 2018 stem samples of mature wood from eight different plant species were collected the epidermis for each of these samples was removed immediately before being transferred into hermetic vials this was done to minimize evaporative water loss which can result in fractionation of the xylem water dawson and ehlringer 1993 soils situated in close proximity to the plants were sampled at varying depths 30 60 and 100 cm using a standard bucket auger and then transferred into hermetic plastic 500 ml bottles stream and groundwater were sampled concurrently with plants and soils stream samples flowing water were collected and stored in hermetic 500 ml plastic bottles while every attempt was made to collect stream samples at a constant depth below the surface 0 50 m this was not possible due to variability in flow depth along the river during this low flow period groundwater samples were collected from boreholes situated within the riparian zone fig 1 the hydraulic characteristics of the sampled boreholes are provided in table 1 with further details provided in riddell et al 2017 during sample collection the boreholes were first purged to ensure steady state chemical conditions were attained before the actual sample was collected and stored in hermetic 500 ml plastic bottles all samples collected in situ were stored in a cooler box once in the laboratory samples were stored at 1 2 c prior to analysis 2h and 18o contents of the collected samples were analysed using a los gatos research lgr dlt 100 liquid water rainfall stream and groundwater liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep b81d rainfall data as well as a picarro l1102 i crds analyser xylem and soil water a 2 step cryogenic open manifold system was used to extract xylem and soil water it should be noted that the cryogenically extracted soil water represented a combination of both mobile and matric bound waters brooks et al 2010 liu et al 2020 the overall analytical precision of the measurements was 0 76 and 0 12 permil for δ2h and δ18o respectively δ2h and δ18o values are expressed relative to vienna standard mean ocean water in permil as 1 δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where δ expressed in represents changes in the ratio of the heavy to light isotopes 2h 1h or 18o 16o for the sample rsample and standard rstandard respectively the line conditioned excess lc excess technique derived by landwehr and coplen 2004 is often used to demonstrate how the covariation of stable isotopes in environmental waters differs from meteoric water by providing an accuracy measure of the distance a sample is from the lmwl since plant water uptake does not influence lc excess values this approach can be implemented to differentiate between waters that maintain characteristics of regional meteoric waters from those that have undergone evaporation under non equilibrium conditions hervé fernández et al 2016 meteoric waters will generally possess lc excess values close to zero evaporation during non equilibrium conditions alters the isotopic composition of meteoric waters resulting in evaporated waters possessing negative lc excess values mccutcheon et al 2016 positive lc excess values are indicative of mixing from numerous sources which is inclusive of newly evaporated water hervé fernández et al 2016 based on the abovementioned discussion ecohydrological separation can be tested through comparisons between meteoric and environmental water lc excess values which is calculated as 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h l m w l a δ 18 o l m w l b where a and b and represent the slope and intercept respectively of the lmwl the lmwl for our study region can be described as δ2h 7 29 δ18o 11 52 according to liu et al 2018 there are only a few sites internationally which possess sufficiently long data records to develop defensible lmwl s due to the significant volume of data that is required to be collected and analysed considering the limited number of meteoric water samples collected and used in this study to derive the lmwl it may not provide an adequate reflection of the general isotopic characteristics of meteoric waters for the region subsequently an additional assessment was conducted using the pretoria local meteoric water line plmwl based on the long term monitoring record acquired at the pretoria meteorological station iaea 2019 once lc excess values were determined for meteoric and environmental waters the non parametric mann whitney u test 99 confidence interval was used to determine if the aforementioned values for environmental waters are significantly different from meteoric waters evaristo et al 2015 3 results the stable isotope values for all water samples were plotted in the dual isotope space fig 2 meteoric waters generally plotted above the plmwl the lower slope of the lmwl indicates the influence of evaporation on the falling rain droplets whereas the higher intercept suggests the contribution of re evaporated waters to the local precipitation yidana 2013 in general the stable isotopic composition of environmental waters falls below both the plmwl and lmwl indicative of the influence of evaporation this observation is reaffirmed by the lower slopes obtained for the linear regression between δ2h and δ18o for all environmental waters compared to the aforementioned meteoric water lines mwl s the evaluation of ecohydrological separation using the lc excess technique is largely influenced by adequately defining the rainfall characteristics for a particular region for this purpose lc excess values were derived for environmental waters using both the lmwl as well as the plwml to assist in contextualizing the findings of the study comparisons between meteoric waters against the lmwl and plmwl revealed some positive and negative scatter however lc excess values were generally close to zero fig 3 stream and groundwater plotted closest to the mwl s however these water samples generally possessed negative lc excess values the divergence of stream water from groundwater was potentially due to the greater influence of evaporation on surface waters leading to enrichment of δ2h and δ18o in these samples qian et al 2017 the lc excess values of bulk soil waters reflect high levels of evaporation with bulk soil water showing greater levels of evaporative enrichment near the surface and gradually declining with depth xylem waters generally possessed lc excess which were analogous to bulk soil waters in the deeper soil layers overall environmental waters were significantly different from meteoric waters table 2 while geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 and qian et al 2017 inter alia have demonstrated that ecohydrological separation may be seasonal the results of our investigations showed no clear evidence that environmental waters were significantly different from the lmwl for both the wet and dry seasons as shown in fig 4 it can be argued that the results presented in the aforementioned figs 2 4 and table 2 may be influenced by the failure to differentiate between the isotopic signatures associated with the mobile and immobile soil water stores and subsequently identify which store was sustaining transpiration however the results presented in table 2 show that there were no significant differences between xylem stream and soil water 60 cm which may suggest that if immobile waters were sustaining transpiration these waters would possess an isotopic signature similar to that of mobile waters 4 discussion 4 1 an evaluation of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis within the study site the results of the various investigations do not provide any conclusive evidence of ecohydrological separation at our study site during drought conditions previous studies supporting the existence of ecohydrological separation have shown that mobile waters will usually follow the trend of the local precipitation input signal and plot along the lwml whereas tightly bound soil water and xylem water will plot below the lmwl evaristo et al 2015 2016 hervé fernández et al 2016 liu et al 2020 contrastingly various studies have supported the notion of ecohydrological connectivity by demonstrating that all environmental waters plot along the lmwl geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 qian et al 2017 in light of these findings the results presented in this particular study highlight a unique scenario as all environmental waters plot below the lmwl and are significantly different from meteoric water although previous studies evaluating ecohydrological separation have shown that it is generally not common for stream and groundwater to be significantly different from meteoric water such an occurrence in this particular environmental setting may not be uncommon according to peterson 2012 evaporation rates in the study region are generally high during both the summer and winter months subsequently the extreme hot and dry conditions prevalent during the drought may have amplified the influence of evaporation on the isotopic signature of water samples collected during the period of investigation the evaporative enrichment of stream water relative to rainfall can be largely attributed to the shallow sampling depth and open nature of these samples a corollary of this is that these samples would be predisposed to evaporative enrichment due to their greater exposure to atmospheric conditions yidana 2013 qian et al 2017 furthermore perennial rivers such as the groot letaba represent a mixture of meteoric waters accumulated from varying climatic conditions and may therefore not resemble the general rainfall characteristics represented by the lmwl yidana 2013 groundwater recharge may occur through rainfall rapidly moving along preferential pathways in the subsurface for example through soil macro pores and or a mixture of evaporated stream and soil water originating from various recharge events yin et al 2011 qian et al 2017 groundwater which is exclusively recharged by the rapid movement of draining water along preferential flow paths will possess an isotopic signature resembling that of rainfall yin et al 2011 banda et al 2019 groundwater lc excess values for the study area were found to be significantly different from meteoric waters however these values plotted closest to the lmwl fig 2 a possible explanation for this occurrence is that groundwater was largely recharged by preferential flow and to a lesser extent via infiltrating soil water and stream water since stream and soil water not moving along preferential flow paths are subject to a greater evaporative influence the mixing of infiltrating waters from various recharge events and flow paths could have potentially contributed to the groundwater isotopic signature diverging from meteoric water yidana 2013 banda et al 2019 4 2 contextualizing the findings despite groundwater possessing lc excess values that were statistically different from xylem water the relative contribution of this source to transpiration could be substantial barbeta and penuelas 2017 for example gokool et al 2018 demonstrated that riparian vegetation within the study site potentially used groundwater to fulfil a proportion of their transpiration demands with dependence on groundwater increasing as the dry season progressed similarly evaristo et al 2016 and barbeta and penuelas 2017 showed that while other sources stream and groundwater of plant water use may be statistically different to soil water the relative contribution of these sources to transpiration may be substantial subsequently the general statistical differences identified by evaristo et al 2015 between xylem water and mobile waters may not imply that root water uptake is solely supplied by a subsurface store which does not contribute to the recharge of stream and groundwater barbeta and penuelas 2017 according to mccutcheon et al 2017 a further limitation of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis is that it is predicated on the premise that the isotopic distinction between subsurface water stores is related to mobility however these differences cannot be adequately accounted for by soil water mobility alone furthermore soil waters of different mobility can be isotopically distinct or similar and in both instances ecohydrological separation may exist thus evaluating ecohydrological separation by quantifying isotopic distinction using only statistical differences between lc excess values may prove to be insufficient mccutcheon et al 2016 while the aforementioned limitations associated with the ecohydrological separation hypothesis may have contributed to the results of the study not providing any clear evidence supporting the existence of ecohydrological separation or ecohydrological connectivity these findings are likely not ubiquitous as sampling was conducted during extreme climatic conditions with limited spatial and temporal representation of the system under study subsequently accepting or rejecting the hypothesis with limited spatio temporal replication of investigations may lead to misconceptions regarding hydrological process dynamics within the study region considering the implications that ecohydrological separation may have on the conceptualization and parameterization of existing and future hydrological models it is imperative that the prevailing understanding of ecohydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales across environmental and climatic regimes is improved upon in order to provide more realistic representations of the systems being modelled evaristo et al 2015 barbeta and penuelas 2017 cain et al 2019 liu et al 2020 penna et al 2018 acknowledges that there appears to be a trend developing in several ecohydrological separation studies which are solely aimed at interpreting isotopic data to either reject or confirm a single hypothesis ecohydrological separation consequently there remains a limited understanding of the hydrological processes which underlie these findings or the methodological approaches which may influence the results of these studies mccutcheon et al 2016 liu et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 and berry et al 2017 outline the need to develop and test alternate hypotheses in order to obtain a better understanding of the systems being studied and ultimately account for the divergence of environmental waters from the mwl for example sprenger et al 2016 propose that the isotopic distinction between environmental waters could be better explained by the mixing of non fractionated precipitation water and enriched soil water during dry periods antecedent soil water in the upper soil layers becomes isotopically enriched following a rainfall event the antecedent soil water will mix with rainfall and percolate due to the increased pressure head sprenger et al 2016 barbeta and penuelas 2017 in general the volume of this enriched soil water is relatively minor in comparison to the total volume of water in the vadose zone darling and bath 1988 subsequently with increasing depth this enriched water will mix with a higher volume of water already present in these deeper layers wenner et al 1991 eventually the isotopic signature of this water will converge towards the lmwl once it

1014,in recent years the ecohydrological separation paradigm has stimulated significant scientific debate as it challenges the basis of existing hydrological process understanding through the use of stable isotope analysis several studies have demonstrated that two isotopically distinct water stores may exist within the subsurface a matric bound store which sustains transpiration and a mobile store which contributes to the recharge of groundwater and streams despite growing evidence supporting this hypothesis further testing across a range of climatic regimes and environmental settings has been advocated to develop an improved hydrological understand of this paradigm in this study the dual isotopic composition of meteoric and environmental waters was analysed in a semi arid riparian environment during a significant el nino induced drought to ascertain if plants were using water that would have otherwise contributed to stream and or groundwater recharge overall the results of these investigations showed no clear evidence supporting ecohydrological separation environmental waters were found to be significantly different from rainfall whereas no significant differences were established between xylem bulk soil water and streamflow while these findings represent a unique scenario with regards to the testing of ecohydrological separation these results are by no means ubiquitous as sampling was conducted during extreme climatic conditions with limited spatio temporal representation of the system therefore longer term sampling and monitoring is recommended to obtain an improved understanding of the system under a range of climatic conditions keywords ecohydrological separation dual stable isotopes isotopically distinct meteoric water lines line conditioned excess 1 introduction the movement of precipitation and the complex rapport between the partitioning of this water in the sub surface and its subsequent influence on hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration and streamflow has attracted the interests of scientists for over a century and remains an area of active research effort mcdonnell 2014 hervé fernández et al 2016 mccutcheon et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 berry et al 2017 the mediatory role which the vadose zone plays within the hydrological cycle is paramount to advance the existing understanding and modelling of hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales mccutcheon et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 the concept of translatory flow has long dominated the conceptualization of hydrological models geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 this paradigm is predicated on the assumption that water within the soil matrix is well mixed and antecedent soil water will be rapidly displaced by new water from ensuing rainfall events subsequently leading to water being pushed further down the soil profile and eventually contributing to streamflow hewlett and hibbert 1966 this implies that during root water uptake vegetation uses water that would have otherwise contributed to the recharge of groundwater or streamflow hewlett and hibbert 1966 brooks et al 2010 challenged this paradigm through the analysis of deuterium and oxygen 18 δ2h and δ18o isotopes by demonstrating that vegetation within a seasonally dry catchment were using tightly bound soil water that did not contribute to streamflow or groundwater recharge the basis of this approach was predicated on the assumption that two water worlds tww exist within the subsurface these isotopically distinct stores are characterised by a tightly bound store which sustains transpiration and a mobile store which contributes to the recharge of groundwater and streams the rationale for using stable isotopes to identify these distinct water stores within the subsurface can be attributed to the location at which measured values of δ2h and δ18o in water samples lie within the dual isotope space mccutcheon et al 2016 according to gat 2005 measured values of δ2h and δ18o in meteoric waters for a particular region display a linear relationship usually described as a local meteoric water line lmwl during non equilibrium conditions waters that have undergone evaporation will lie along an evaporation line that possesses a slope lower than the lmwl hervé fernández et al 2016 according to mccutcheon et al 2016 the tww hypothesis can be summarized as follows draining or mobile waters which eventually recharge streams and groundwater will usually plot along the lmwl whereas tightly bound soil water will tend to plot along an evaporation line with xylem water plotting in a similar space mccutcheon et al 2016 brooks et al 2010 postulated that this occurrence could be attributed to soil micro pores being recharged by the first rainfall events after a dry summer with the isotopic signature of water stored in these pores remaining unaffected by subsequent rainfall events once transpiration resumed during the following dry summer the plants would use this tightly bound water following the drainage of mobile soil water which recharges streams and groundwater several studies have since provided evidence supporting the notion of the existence of tww or ecohydrological separation qian et al 2017 evaristo et al 2015 demonstrated that this occurrence is widespread across various biomes and more common than initially perceived however a few studies have suggested that ecohydrological separation may be seasonal rather than exclusively spatial in nature geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 qian et al 2017 the abovementioned findings potentially have major implications for hydrological modelling applications as the basis of existing hydrological model parametrizations and conceptualizations may need to be revisited to more adequately represent ecohydrological processes evaristo et al 2015 cain et al 2019 luo et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in order to better understand the concept of ecohydrological separation further testing is advocated and required across various biomes soil types and climatic regimes mcdonnell 2014 this in turn may also assist in revealing the limits of the ecohydrological separation paradigm pfister and kirchner 2017 in this study we aimed to test for ecohydrological separation in a semi arid riparian environment during a very significant el niño induced drought period kogan and gao 2016 for this purpose the dual stable isotopic composition of meteoric waters and environmental waters xylem soil ground and stream water were analysed to determine whether plant species situated within the riparian zone along a perennial river system were utilizing water that would have otherwise contributed to streamflow or groundwater recharge during the extreme drought conditions according to qiu et al 2019 the testing of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis is poorly represented in semi arid and arid environments subsequently the results of our investigations may shed further light as to whether the existence of ecohydrological separation is a common occurrence in these environments 2 methodology 2 1 study site this study was conducted within the riparian zone along a section of the groot letaba river which flows through the limpopo province located in the north eastern region of south africa fig 1 the topography within the catchment varies from mountainous regions in the western parts of the catchment to flatter low lying areas in the eastern regions the average elevation within the study site is approximately 400 m a s l the river section studied is situated within a semi arid region and generally experiences hot wet summers and mild dry winters with a mean annual temperature of 25 50 c katambara and ndiritu 2010 rainfall is seasonal and generally occurs as convective showers and thundershowers during the summer months october to march with 40 50 occurring in january and february katambara and ndiritu 2010 mean annual potential evaporation as measured by a pan is approximately 2097 93 mm and exceeds mean annual precipitation 417 50 mm approximately three quarters of the catchment are underlain by gneiss and granitic formations due to the large presence of granites weathered zones are generally shallow with soils possessing a sandy texture riddell et al 2017 vegetation situated within the study site was dominated by woody savanna shrubs and large trees particularly ficus sycomorus philonoptera violecia and diospyros mespiliformis gokool et al 2018 2 2 data collection and analysis rainfall data and samples for the study site were collected using a davistm vantage pro 2 weather station for the period june 2015 till october 2016 all samples were collected and stored in hermetic vials within 24 hours following the conclusion of a rain event to minimize the effects of evaporation according to gokool et al 2018 during this period the cumulative rainfall received within the study site was approximately 180 mm which is substantially lower than the mean annual precipitation due to the effect of the drought and the remote locality of the study site only a limited number of meteoric water samples were collected and available for analysis additional isotopic rainfall data from october 2017 to february 2018 was acquired from the international water management institute iwmi for a nearby quaternary catchment b81d the rationale for sourcing this data was done in an attempt to provide a more representative elucidation of the rainfall isotopic characteristics within the study region environmental waters were collected from 6 separate sampling points within the riparian zone distributed along a 14 km segment of the groot letaba river sampling was undertaken on 3 separate occasions august september and october during the 2016 dry season gokool et al 2018 stem samples of mature wood from eight different plant species were collected the epidermis for each of these samples was removed immediately before being transferred into hermetic vials this was done to minimize evaporative water loss which can result in fractionation of the xylem water dawson and ehlringer 1993 soils situated in close proximity to the plants were sampled at varying depths 30 60 and 100 cm using a standard bucket auger and then transferred into hermetic plastic 500 ml bottles stream and groundwater were sampled concurrently with plants and soils stream samples flowing water were collected and stored in hermetic 500 ml plastic bottles while every attempt was made to collect stream samples at a constant depth below the surface 0 50 m this was not possible due to variability in flow depth along the river during this low flow period groundwater samples were collected from boreholes situated within the riparian zone fig 1 the hydraulic characteristics of the sampled boreholes are provided in table 1 with further details provided in riddell et al 2017 during sample collection the boreholes were first purged to ensure steady state chemical conditions were attained before the actual sample was collected and stored in hermetic 500 ml plastic bottles all samples collected in situ were stored in a cooler box once in the laboratory samples were stored at 1 2 c prior to analysis 2h and 18o contents of the collected samples were analysed using a los gatos research lgr dlt 100 liquid water rainfall stream and groundwater liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep b81d rainfall data as well as a picarro l1102 i crds analyser xylem and soil water a 2 step cryogenic open manifold system was used to extract xylem and soil water it should be noted that the cryogenically extracted soil water represented a combination of both mobile and matric bound waters brooks et al 2010 liu et al 2020 the overall analytical precision of the measurements was 0 76 and 0 12 permil for δ2h and δ18o respectively δ2h and δ18o values are expressed relative to vienna standard mean ocean water in permil as 1 δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where δ expressed in represents changes in the ratio of the heavy to light isotopes 2h 1h or 18o 16o for the sample rsample and standard rstandard respectively the line conditioned excess lc excess technique derived by landwehr and coplen 2004 is often used to demonstrate how the covariation of stable isotopes in environmental waters differs from meteoric water by providing an accuracy measure of the distance a sample is from the lmwl since plant water uptake does not influence lc excess values this approach can be implemented to differentiate between waters that maintain characteristics of regional meteoric waters from those that have undergone evaporation under non equilibrium conditions hervé fernández et al 2016 meteoric waters will generally possess lc excess values close to zero evaporation during non equilibrium conditions alters the isotopic composition of meteoric waters resulting in evaporated waters possessing negative lc excess values mccutcheon et al 2016 positive lc excess values are indicative of mixing from numerous sources which is inclusive of newly evaporated water hervé fernández et al 2016 based on the abovementioned discussion ecohydrological separation can be tested through comparisons between meteoric and environmental water lc excess values which is calculated as 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h l m w l a δ 18 o l m w l b where a and b and represent the slope and intercept respectively of the lmwl the lmwl for our study region can be described as δ2h 7 29 δ18o 11 52 according to liu et al 2018 there are only a few sites internationally which possess sufficiently long data records to develop defensible lmwl s due to the significant volume of data that is required to be collected and analysed considering the limited number of meteoric water samples collected and used in this study to derive the lmwl it may not provide an adequate reflection of the general isotopic characteristics of meteoric waters for the region subsequently an additional assessment was conducted using the pretoria local meteoric water line plmwl based on the long term monitoring record acquired at the pretoria meteorological station iaea 2019 once lc excess values were determined for meteoric and environmental waters the non parametric mann whitney u test 99 confidence interval was used to determine if the aforementioned values for environmental waters are significantly different from meteoric waters evaristo et al 2015 3 results the stable isotope values for all water samples were plotted in the dual isotope space fig 2 meteoric waters generally plotted above the plmwl the lower slope of the lmwl indicates the influence of evaporation on the falling rain droplets whereas the higher intercept suggests the contribution of re evaporated waters to the local precipitation yidana 2013 in general the stable isotopic composition of environmental waters falls below both the plmwl and lmwl indicative of the influence of evaporation this observation is reaffirmed by the lower slopes obtained for the linear regression between δ2h and δ18o for all environmental waters compared to the aforementioned meteoric water lines mwl s the evaluation of ecohydrological separation using the lc excess technique is largely influenced by adequately defining the rainfall characteristics for a particular region for this purpose lc excess values were derived for environmental waters using both the lmwl as well as the plwml to assist in contextualizing the findings of the study comparisons between meteoric waters against the lmwl and plmwl revealed some positive and negative scatter however lc excess values were generally close to zero fig 3 stream and groundwater plotted closest to the mwl s however these water samples generally possessed negative lc excess values the divergence of stream water from groundwater was potentially due to the greater influence of evaporation on surface waters leading to enrichment of δ2h and δ18o in these samples qian et al 2017 the lc excess values of bulk soil waters reflect high levels of evaporation with bulk soil water showing greater levels of evaporative enrichment near the surface and gradually declining with depth xylem waters generally possessed lc excess which were analogous to bulk soil waters in the deeper soil layers overall environmental waters were significantly different from meteoric waters table 2 while geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 and qian et al 2017 inter alia have demonstrated that ecohydrological separation may be seasonal the results of our investigations showed no clear evidence that environmental waters were significantly different from the lmwl for both the wet and dry seasons as shown in fig 4 it can be argued that the results presented in the aforementioned figs 2 4 and table 2 may be influenced by the failure to differentiate between the isotopic signatures associated with the mobile and immobile soil water stores and subsequently identify which store was sustaining transpiration however the results presented in table 2 show that there were no significant differences between xylem stream and soil water 60 cm which may suggest that if immobile waters were sustaining transpiration these waters would possess an isotopic signature similar to that of mobile waters 4 discussion 4 1 an evaluation of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis within the study site the results of the various investigations do not provide any conclusive evidence of ecohydrological separation at our study site during drought conditions previous studies supporting the existence of ecohydrological separation have shown that mobile waters will usually follow the trend of the local precipitation input signal and plot along the lwml whereas tightly bound soil water and xylem water will plot below the lmwl evaristo et al 2015 2016 hervé fernández et al 2016 liu et al 2020 contrastingly various studies have supported the notion of ecohydrological connectivity by demonstrating that all environmental waters plot along the lmwl geris et al 2015 hervé fernández et al 2016 qian et al 2017 in light of these findings the results presented in this particular study highlight a unique scenario as all environmental waters plot below the lmwl and are significantly different from meteoric water although previous studies evaluating ecohydrological separation have shown that it is generally not common for stream and groundwater to be significantly different from meteoric water such an occurrence in this particular environmental setting may not be uncommon according to peterson 2012 evaporation rates in the study region are generally high during both the summer and winter months subsequently the extreme hot and dry conditions prevalent during the drought may have amplified the influence of evaporation on the isotopic signature of water samples collected during the period of investigation the evaporative enrichment of stream water relative to rainfall can be largely attributed to the shallow sampling depth and open nature of these samples a corollary of this is that these samples would be predisposed to evaporative enrichment due to their greater exposure to atmospheric conditions yidana 2013 qian et al 2017 furthermore perennial rivers such as the groot letaba represent a mixture of meteoric waters accumulated from varying climatic conditions and may therefore not resemble the general rainfall characteristics represented by the lmwl yidana 2013 groundwater recharge may occur through rainfall rapidly moving along preferential pathways in the subsurface for example through soil macro pores and or a mixture of evaporated stream and soil water originating from various recharge events yin et al 2011 qian et al 2017 groundwater which is exclusively recharged by the rapid movement of draining water along preferential flow paths will possess an isotopic signature resembling that of rainfall yin et al 2011 banda et al 2019 groundwater lc excess values for the study area were found to be significantly different from meteoric waters however these values plotted closest to the lmwl fig 2 a possible explanation for this occurrence is that groundwater was largely recharged by preferential flow and to a lesser extent via infiltrating soil water and stream water since stream and soil water not moving along preferential flow paths are subject to a greater evaporative influence the mixing of infiltrating waters from various recharge events and flow paths could have potentially contributed to the groundwater isotopic signature diverging from meteoric water yidana 2013 banda et al 2019 4 2 contextualizing the findings despite groundwater possessing lc excess values that were statistically different from xylem water the relative contribution of this source to transpiration could be substantial barbeta and penuelas 2017 for example gokool et al 2018 demonstrated that riparian vegetation within the study site potentially used groundwater to fulfil a proportion of their transpiration demands with dependence on groundwater increasing as the dry season progressed similarly evaristo et al 2016 and barbeta and penuelas 2017 showed that while other sources stream and groundwater of plant water use may be statistically different to soil water the relative contribution of these sources to transpiration may be substantial subsequently the general statistical differences identified by evaristo et al 2015 between xylem water and mobile waters may not imply that root water uptake is solely supplied by a subsurface store which does not contribute to the recharge of stream and groundwater barbeta and penuelas 2017 according to mccutcheon et al 2017 a further limitation of the ecohydrological separation hypothesis is that it is predicated on the premise that the isotopic distinction between subsurface water stores is related to mobility however these differences cannot be adequately accounted for by soil water mobility alone furthermore soil waters of different mobility can be isotopically distinct or similar and in both instances ecohydrological separation may exist thus evaluating ecohydrological separation by quantifying isotopic distinction using only statistical differences between lc excess values may prove to be insufficient mccutcheon et al 2016 while the aforementioned limitations associated with the ecohydrological separation hypothesis may have contributed to the results of the study not providing any clear evidence supporting the existence of ecohydrological separation or ecohydrological connectivity these findings are likely not ubiquitous as sampling was conducted during extreme climatic conditions with limited spatial and temporal representation of the system under study subsequently accepting or rejecting the hypothesis with limited spatio temporal replication of investigations may lead to misconceptions regarding hydrological process dynamics within the study region considering the implications that ecohydrological separation may have on the conceptualization and parameterization of existing and future hydrological models it is imperative that the prevailing understanding of ecohydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales across environmental and climatic regimes is improved upon in order to provide more realistic representations of the systems being modelled evaristo et al 2015 barbeta and penuelas 2017 cain et al 2019 liu et al 2020 penna et al 2018 acknowledges that there appears to be a trend developing in several ecohydrological separation studies which are solely aimed at interpreting isotopic data to either reject or confirm a single hypothesis ecohydrological separation consequently there remains a limited understanding of the hydrological processes which underlie these findings or the methodological approaches which may influence the results of these studies mccutcheon et al 2016 liu et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 and berry et al 2017 outline the need to develop and test alternate hypotheses in order to obtain a better understanding of the systems being studied and ultimately account for the divergence of environmental waters from the mwl for example sprenger et al 2016 propose that the isotopic distinction between environmental waters could be better explained by the mixing of non fractionated precipitation water and enriched soil water during dry periods antecedent soil water in the upper soil layers becomes isotopically enriched following a rainfall event the antecedent soil water will mix with rainfall and percolate due to the increased pressure head sprenger et al 2016 barbeta and penuelas 2017 in general the volume of this enriched soil water is relatively minor in comparison to the total volume of water in the vadose zone darling and bath 1988 subsequently with increasing depth this enriched water will mix with a higher volume of water already present in these deeper layers wenner et al 1991 eventually the isotopic signature of this water will converge towards the lmwl once it has passed the maximum evaporation penetration depth as it will mix with soil water that is no longer affected by the influence of evaporation sprenger et al 2016 5 conclusions in recent years the proposed ecohydrological separation hypothesis has stimulated significant debate as it controverts conventional hydrological wisdom which underlies the conceptualization and parameterization of existing hydrological models as a corollary several studies have aimed to provide evidence to support or refute this hypothesis for a range of environmental settings and climatic conditions in this
