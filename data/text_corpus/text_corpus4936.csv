24680,the kerguelen islands are part of the french southern territories located at the limit of the indian and southern oceans they are highly impacted by climate change and coastal marine areas are particularly at risk assessing the responses of species and populations to environmental change is challenging in such areas for which ecological modelling can constitute a helpful approach in the present work a deb ibm model dynamic energy budget individual based model was generated to simulate and predict population dynamics in an endemic and common benthic species of shallow marine habitats of the kerguelen islands the sea urchin abatus cordatus the model relies on a dynamic energy budget model deb developed at the individual level upscaled to an individual based population model ibm it then enables to model population dynamics through time as a result of individual physiological responses to environmental variations the model was successfully built for a reference site to simulate the response of populations to variations in food resources and temperature then it was implemented to model population dynamics at other sites and for the different ipcc climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and 8 5 under present day conditions models predict a more determinant effect of food resources on population densities and on juvenile densities in particular relative to temperature in contrast simulations predict a sharp decline in population densities under conditions of ipcc scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 with a determinant effect of water warming leading to the extinction of most vulnerable populations after a 30 year simulation time due to high mortality levels associated with peaks of high temperatures such a dynamic model is here applied for the first time to a southern ocean benthic and brooding species and offers interesting prospects for antarctic and sub antarctic biodiversity research it could constitute a useful tool to support conservation studies in these remote regions where access and bio monitoring represent challenging issues keywords ecological modelling kerguelen climate change model sensitivity endemic echinoderm dynamic energy budget individual based model 1 introduction the kerguelen islands are part of the french southern territories terres australes françaises taf located at the limit of the indian and southern oceans in the sub antarctic area the region is highly impacted by climate change and coastal marine ecosystems and habitats are particularly at risk given that species have long adapted to cold and stable conditions convey and peck 2019 gutt et al 2018 waller et al 2017 coastal marine species of the kerguelen islands are threatened by temperature and seasonality shifts which are expected to intensify in a near future turner et al 2014 ipcc 5th report pachauri and meyer 2014 future predictions of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 5th report pachauri and meyer 2014 are provided as possible representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios of climate change and can be used to infer the potential response of ecosystems to future environmental conditions however the insufficient spatial and time resolutions of such models constitute serious limitations to assessing the effects of future environmental changes on sub antarctic species constable et al 2014 murphy and hofmann 2012 the echinoid abatus cordatus verrill 1876 is endemic to the kerguelen oceanic plateau and common in coastal benthic habitats of the kerguelen islands it is reported in the northern kerguelen plateau and around heard and kerguelen islands but most records are from shallow coastal areas of the kerguelen islands where dense populations are commonly observed agassiz 1881 de ridder et al 1992 david et al 2005 guillaumot et al 2016 2018b 2018a hibberd and moore 2009 mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 this makes the species particularly at risk considering the synergetic effects of the multiple factors temperature variations significant shifts in coastal currents sedimentation rates and phytoplanktonic blooms affecting coastal marine communities at high latitudes gutt et al 2018 stenni et al 2017 waller et al 2017 the species endemicity can be partly related to low dispersal capabilities which is a consequence of a particular life trait a cordatus broods its young in incubating pouches located on the aboral side of the test and has a direct development with no larval stage and no metamorphosis the low dispersal capacity of a cordatus likely increases its vulnerability to environmental changes ledoux et al 2012 benthic fauna of sub antarctic regions remains under studied compared to pelagic species améziane et al 2011 xavier et al 2016 ecological niche models can represent relevant tools to study the consequences of environmental changes on the biology of these benthic organisms and on their population dynamics correlative niche models were used to predict the distribution of suitable areas for a cordatus on the kerguelen plateau guillaumot et al 2018a b however supplementary data and analyses are still needed to depict and understand the species response to environmental changes in the present work a mechanistic modelling approach using a dynamic energy budget individual based model deb ibm was used to analyse the biological response of a cordatus to various environmental conditions an individual mechanistic model deb was first built using experimental and literature data guillaumot 2019 a deb model aims to represent the physiological development of an organism from the embryo to its death based on energetic fluxes and allows considering the metabolic state of the individual at any given moment of its life cycle it relies on biological principles and first laws of thermodynamics to recreate the metabolic development as a function of two environmental parameters food resources and temperature kooijman 2010 the deb model was then upscaled to the population level ibm wherein it was implemented as iterative mathematical calculations of each organism s individual development in the population the ibm relies on the simulation of individuals as autonomous entities forming a complex population within a dynamic system railsback and grimm 2019 the deb ibm is used to analyse population dynamics emerging from the development and the physiological traits of individuals as a function of environmental forcing variables i e food resources and temperature the deb ibm can then be used to simulate population dynamics under different environmental scenarios enabling a better quantification of the vulnerability of populations to changing environmental conditions modelling population dynamics using a deb ibm model for a sub antarctic and brooding invertebrate brings a feature so far unseen in other published deb models the main objectives of the study were to develop a deb ibm model for a cordatus 1 to simulate population structure and dynamics at different sites under both current environmental conditions and future ipcc climate scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 and 2 to assess the feasibility of such a model for organisms in a region where low data availability and resolution may limit model building and validation the current resolution and accuracy of future climate scenarios in sub antarctic areas do not allow building precise and reliable predictions for the future but they were used here as a proof of concept to test population responses to various conceivable conditions sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness potential and relevance of models grimm and berger 2016 considering data availability simulations performed for various temperature conditions and food resource availabilities if validated may constitute a promising tool to address conservation issues 2 methods 2 1 study area the deb ibm population model was generated in the geographic and environmental context of the kerguelen islands fig 1 using data of the study site of anse du halage a fieldwork station that has regularly been investigated through several biological studies since the 1980s magniez 1980 mespoulhé 1992 schatt and féral 1991 poulin 1995 ledoux et al 2012 poulin and féral 1998 the kerguelen islands show jagged coastlines and numerous islets and fjords that provide a large variety of habitats to the marine benthic fauna the nature of the seafloor varies from rocky to sandy and muddy shores the predominance of the giant kelp macrocystis pyrifera is a main feature of the kerguelen as this engineer and key species plays a decisive role in the protection and structuring of benthic shallow habitats in many places of the archipelago arnaud 1974 féral et al 2019 lang 1967 1971 located in the morbihan bay a 700 km2 semi enclosed shallow embayment 50 m depth on average of the kerguelen islands anse du halage is situated at the bottom of a small and shallow 2 m depth cove dominated by fine to medium sands magniez 1979 poulin 1996 fig 1 the tidal range is comprised between 0 4 and 2 1 m so that the area can exceptionally be uncovered at the lowest tides mespoulhé 1992 schatt and féral 1991 sea surface temperature varies between 1 and 2 c in winter september to 7 to 8 c in summer march with sporadic peaks of 11 c in some places for certain years féral et al 2019 schatt and féral 1991 salinity varies between 31 89 and 33 57 arnaud 1974 temperature data used in the model were collected in the framework of the proteker programme french polar institute n 1044 féral et al 2019 and accessed online ipev programme n 1044 http www proteker net thermorecorders html lang en accessed on 08 05 2019 they were recorded from 2012 to 2018 at three sites used in the model fig 1 ile longue for the model at anse du halage ile haute an island in the north western corner of the morbihan bay and port couvreux a coastal site outside the morbihan bay in the gulf of the baleiniers on the northern coast of the archipelago fig a 1 see supplementary materials for all figures indexed by a letter the organic matter deposited on the seabed varies with seasonal phytoplankton blooms and remineralization by bacteriae delille et al 1979 the sediment organic content and phytoplanktonic blooms are particularly important at anse du halage with average values of 4 5 of organic carbon content the sediment organic carbon oc content was measured monthly as a percentage of sediment dry weight by delille and bouvy 1989 environmental data time series are available at a monthly timestep the model was scaled on a single square metre patch supposing no connectivity between neighbour locations as no data on horizontal nor vertical water movements and matter fluxes were available 2 2 study species abatus cordatus fig 2 is a shallow deposit feeder and sediment swallower living at 5 c average full or half buried into soft sediments de ridder and lawrence 1982 it is distributed all around the kerguelen islands but population densities are highly variable depending on depth substrate nature and exposure to the open sea distributed from the intertidal area to the deep shelf over 500 m depth populations highest densities are found in very shallow 0 2 m depth and sheltered areas with soft bottoms of fine to medium sand poulin 1996 in shallow areas observed density vary from less than 5 individuals m2 in the fjord des portes noires poulin and féral 1995 to 10 ind m2 at port aux français mespoulhé 1992 130 ind m2 ile haute mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 168 ind m2 port couvreux poulin 1996 and up to 280 ind m2 anse du halage magniez 1980 poulin 1996 juveniles are commonly found sheltered in between holdfasts of the giant kelp macrocystis pyrifera bordering with sandy shallow areas the species is relatively resistant to low salinities locally induced by freshwater run off from the main island guille and lasserre 1979 it is tolerant to temperature variations particularly marked in shallow areas but temperature tolerance does not exceed 12 c personal observations the maximum size ever observed is 4 9 cm in length mespoulhé 1992 lifespan is assumed to be around six years old mespoulhé 1992 although it cannot be excluded that some individuals may grow older identified predators are gastropods crustaceans and seagulls poulin 1996 poulin and féral 1995 from which the specimens are hidden when burrowing into the sediment magniez 1979 poulin and féral 1995 sexual reproduction in a cordatus occurs every year with all mature females producing eggs magniez 1983 and incubating their young in their four brood pouches located on the aboral side of the test fig 2b after brooding juveniles exit the pouches and start their autonomous development on the seabed in the vicinity of their mother magniez 1983 schatt 1985 reproduction time can greatly differ between sites generally extending from march to may as in anse du halage and ile haute reproduction can also occur from june to august ile suhm from december to february port matha or from august to november port couvreux poulin 1996 females usually spawn once a year poulin 1996 brooding and burrowing behaviours imply a relative sedentary lifestyle and can explain a part of the species endemicity with dense populations scattered all around the archipelago and only a few older individuals that may be found isolated from core populations mespoulhé 1992 poulin and féral 1995 2 3 deb modelling 2 3 1 principles deb theory defines individuals as dynamic systems and provides a mathematical framework for modelling organisms life cycle it describes physiological processes using four primary state variables reserve structure reproduction buffer and maturity directly linked to mass and energy flows and influenced by two forcing variables temperature and food availability fig 3 jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 based on feeding growth and reproduction processes deb models predict the metabolic and development states of organisms through time kooijman 2010 sousa et al 2008 metabolic processes are linked to shape and size of the organism represented by the structural volume and the structural area structural volume is related to maintenance processes while structural area is closely linked to food ingestion and assimilation processes and controls the amount of energy arriving into the reserve compartment e fig 3a van der meer 2006 the energy contained in the reserve compartment is allocated to organism maintenance somatic and maturity maintenances priority processes that condition the organism s survival to growth increase of structural volume v and to the increase of complexity eh or reproduction buffer er fig 3a according to the kappa rule kooijman 2010 the complexity is represented as the maturity level the amount of energy accumulated into this compartment triggers metabolic switches such as the transition i e ability to feed to reproduce between life stages defined in deb theory namely embryo juvenile and adult life stages kooijman 2010 2 3 2 application of deb model to a cordatus parameter estimation an individual mechanistic deb model was developed for a cordatus guillaumot 2019 estimated deb parameters are reported in table 1 the deb model considers a larval growth accelerated compared to the adult stage schatt 1985 so called abj type model the model was constructed using data from the literature table 2 the goodness of fit of the deb model to the data was evaluated by calculating the mean relative error mre of each dataset which is the sum of the absolute differences between observed and expected values divided by the expected values mre values are contained in the interval 0 infinity the mre is considered to be a reference method to assess deb modelling performance lika et al 2011b for which the closer to 0 the better model predictions match the data maturation and development embryos of a cordatus have a direct development in brood pouches of females magniez 1983 schatt 1985 they start feeding inside pouches after 142 days of incubation i e 5 months and leave the pouches as fully developed sea urchins after 8 5 months schatt 1985 according to deb theory individuals are considered embryos until they can feed kooijman 2010 before the fifth month feeding inside the maternal pouches is not clearly attested but feeding through epidermal uptake of dissolved organic matter dom is considered as the possible mechanism schatt and féral 1996 at each growth step energy is supplied to the reserve by the ingested food fig 3a ṗa and then leaves the reserve compartment to be directed to growth maturation or reproduction compartments through the mobilisation flux fig 3a ṗc this is performed following the kappa rule a κ fraction is directed towards the structure growth compartment and somatic maintenance fig 3a a and the remaining 1 κ fraction towards complexity maturation reproduction compartments and maturity maintenance fig 3a b during the juvenile stage the individual does not supply energy into reproduction but accumulates energy in its maturity compartment eh until reaching the puberty threshold that according to deb theory defines the moment when the organism is mature enough to reproduce kooijman 2010 after reaching this threshold at around 2 5 to 3 years old mespoulhé 1992 schatt 1985 the organism can allocate energy into the reproduction buffer er for gamete production fig 3a the structural volume increases continuously along the individual s life from birth to death supplied in energy left from what has not been allocated to priority maintenance costs ṗm and ṗj starvation mortality magniez 1983 observed that the gonadal index continues to decrease slightly for around two months after reproduction he hypothesized that it was related to the season as the reproduction period finishes at the start of winter food resources decrease and energy investment into reproductive organs is momentary diverted towards the maintenance of somatic elements this was demonstrated in the other sea urchin species strongylocentrotus purpuratus lawrence et al 1966 and arbacia lixula fenaux et al 1975 confronted to starvation in the model when scaled reserve e reserve relative to reserve capacity no dimension falls below the scaled structural length l length relative to maximum length no dimension it is assumed that the individual is confronted to starvation the kappa rule is then altered as energy is entirely redirected to the somatic maintenance and all other fluxes growth reproduction or maturation are set to 0 when e 0 the organism does not have enough energy to allocate the amount necessary for survival somatic maintenance costs and dies see section 7 submodels starvation in appendix g for further details and implemented equations ageing mortality death probability by senescence was calculated in the model using the ageing sub model a simulation of damages induced by lethal compounds such as free radical or other reactive oxygen species ros following the deb theory for ageing kooijman 2010 the density of damage inducing compounds in the body increases as the reserve compartment is fuelled with energy that is allocated through the entire organism it influences the hazard mortality rate ḣ which is a function of the damage accumulated in the body and simulates the vulnerability of the individual to damages such as the risk of dying from illness increases with age in the model the hazard mortality rate ḣ is supplemented by a stochastic parameter martin et al 2010 to control the ageing mortality rate see section 7 submodels ageing in appendix g for further details and implemented equations 2 4 individual based modelling for the population 2 4 1 principles the individual deb model is used to simulate each individual as an entity of the individual based population model ibm an ibm represents the individual components individuals of a cordatus of an environmental system anse du halage and their behaviours enabling to feature each individual as an autonomous entity and looking at results at the scale of the whole population deangelis and mooij 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 railsback and grimm 2019 in our model each individual do not have any direct interaction nor adaptive behaviour towards their environment nor the other members of the population they follow a continuous development governed by metabolic fluxes deb model that are influenced by environmental conditions temperature and food resources along their entire life each individual is a component of the modelled population which is itself affected by population death rate and density dependant processes the ibm was built with the software netlogo version 6 0 4 wilensky 1999 using the deb ibm model developed by martin et al 2010 for the species daphnia magna the netlogo code is available at http modelingcommons org browse one model 6201 it contains the script to run the model the input files of monthly food resources and temperatures for the three stations and a detailed description of the model following the odd protocol from grimm et al 2010 and the associated list of variables present in the code this detailed odd was also included in appendix g 2 4 2 application of ibm model to a cordatus model structure the model includes two types of entities the individuals and the environment individuals are divided into 4 types of sub agents depending on their life stage and sex embryos juveniles adult males and adult females the values of four primary state variables are attributed to each individual scaled reserve ue volumetric structural length l scaled maturity uh and scaled reproduction buffer ur the level of energy contained in the scaled maturity uh thresholds the life stages these four variables are scaled meaning here that the energy dimension has been removed by dividing with the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate ṗam in j l 2 t 1 based on deb theory kooijman 2010 simulations were run with a monthly timestep for calculation in regard to the slow growth of the species and the available data an analysis of the effect of the timestep on the core individual model was conducted cf appendix c at each timestep food and temperature conditions are first input into the model state variable values of each individual are calculated in order to assess whether new maturity thresholds are reached or whether energy is sufficient for survival growth or reproduction the population state is reassessed at the end of each month spatially population structure and density are simulated on a patch of one square metre at each site and individuals do not leave the patch during their entire life initialisation the initial population density value was set to 120 ind m2 and this figure was split into classes of equal densities of 20 individuals of different age classes between 0 and 5 years old in order to stabilize the initialisation between the different replicates an initial run is realised to capture the values of the four state variables that characterize the individual of each age class at october 2012 temperatures and f 1 in order to initiate the model appendix h the first decade of the simulation period was always considered as the initialisation phase and was removed from the analysis the model showing important outliers in individual metabolism and population structure during these first ten years inter individuals variability each individual is characterized by similar energetic performances estimated by the deb estimation table 1 five deb parameters were divided by a scatter multiplier parameter that was generated in order to create inter individual variability these five deb parameters were selected because they are associated to the four state variables that characterize the individuals and are not null at the time the individual is initiated into the model following martin et al 2010 1 maturity level at birth u h b d cm2 that is the amount of energy accumulated in the maturity compartment needed to reach the juvenilestage 2 maturity level at puberty u h p d cm2 the amount of energy accumulated into the maturity compartment to reach the adult stage 3 energy investment ratio g no dimension the cost of the added volume relative to the maximum potentially available energy for growth and maintenance 4 the initial energy reserve at birth ue d cm2 and 5 the initial structural length l cm the scatter multiplier is the exponential of a random number from a normal distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation cv 0 1 by default can be set by the user in the interface of the model the value is therefore small enough to not affect tremendously the initial variable and generate trade off between parameters it is applied as soon as the individual is created in the system reproduction sex ratios ratio males females in the studied populations are slightly contrasting between localities from 0 94 ile haute to 0 99 anse du halage and 1 04 port couvreux poulin 1996 the average ratio of 0 99 was chosen in the model by approximation it was considered that only females undergo physiological changes during the reproduction process males being only used as a component of the total population to this date few monitoring studies have been performed on a cordatus reproduction magniez 1983 is the only one who studied the gonado somatic index gsi that is the proportion of ash free gonads dry weight over the ash free body dry weight therefore directly linked to the accumulation of energy into the reproduction buffer according to magniez 1983 reproduction can occur if the gsi reaches at least 0 07 this condition was used in our model to control the ability of the female to reproduce when time comes the gonadosomatic index gsi was only attributed to females and was estimated for each month with this equation kooijman 2010 section 4 10 eq 4 89 gsi time of accumulatio n k m g f 3 f ϰ g y ve 1 ϰ f 3 k j u h p l m 2 s m 3 where the time of accumulation is the number of days spent since the end of the reproduction period k m is the somatic maintenance rate coefficient in d 1 g the energy investment ratio no dimension f the scaled functional response no dimension κ the fraction of energy directed towards structure yve the parameter for the yield of

rate coefficient in d 1 u h p the scaled energy in the complexity compartment at puberty d cm2 lm the maximum structural length cm and sm the acceleration factor no dimension the reproduction period is constant from march to may for the individuals at anse du halage and they only spawn once a year magniez 1983 schatt and féral 1996 poulin 1996 after each monthly step the model checks the gsi value for each female if the gsi reaches the 0 07 threshold at the onset of the period march reproduction is triggered for this considered female according to the literature when reproducing females invest around 52 of their reproductive organs energy into reproduction magniez 1983 this energy is released during the three months when spawning occurs that is the gsi of the female will decrease by 52 of its initial value over the 3 months period so a decrease of one third of 52 per month with gsi gsistart 0 52 gsistart 3 where gsistart is the level of gonadal index at the onset of reproduction in parallel the usual ur change in energy density in the reproduction buffer outside of the reproduction period no unit is set to 0 for the three months while ur energy density in the reproduction buffer is forced to decrease in a similar fashion to the gsi 2ur ur start 0 52 ur start 3 with ur start being the reproduction buffer at the start of the period reproduction induces the introduction of 27 embryos in average in the system magniez 1983 added proportionally along the three months 9 per month background mortality no specific adult mortality rates are mentioned in the literature as no cause have been defined precisely background population mortality annual rates were estimated based on size frequency distribution provided by mespoulhé 1992 and using the formula from ebert 2013 n t n0 e m t with n t the population size at time t n0 the initial population size m the mortality rate and t the time in months two yearly mortality rates were defined one for juveniles 41 and one for adults 24 a percentage of embryos mortality in the pouches was calculated based on data from poulin 1996 determining an egg survival of 65 this mortality is associated to the fact that when the first juveniles start leaving the maternal pouches at the beginning of january they push aside the protecting spikes of the pouch and eggs remaining in the brood are no longer protected and die magniez 1980 mortality induced by temperatures as no precise information is available to accurately describe a cordatus temperature tolerance three different types of sensitivity were designed to cover different hypothesis fig d 2 based on experimental results obtained in the kerguelen islands personal observation mortality gradient due to temperature was applied to the population for temperatures comprised between 8 and 12 c over 12 c all individuals are considered to die in the model as none survived in the experiment 1 a vulnerable type was defined with population death rates of 25 35 and 45 when the sea urchins are exposed to temperatures respectively reaching 8 9 5 and 11 c during two consecutive months 2 the resistant type was defined with a mortality rate 15 lower than the vulnerable one for the same temperature thresholds e g 10 instead of 25 population mortality at 8 c for similar exposure duration i e two months 3 the intermediate type is similar to the resistant type but individuals are considered to die after one month of exposure to each temperature instead of two fig d 2 density dependant regulation population density autoregulates through competition for food resources this procedure relies on the monitoring of population density in relation to the carrying capacity and allows to stabilize the model the model calculates the current population density and quantifies the competition effect on food availability depending on how far from the carrying capacity k the population density p is and updates food availability in accordance it is considered that at each timestep a certain amount of food is available in the environment fenv but according to population size competition for food fc quantified food competition is present and influences effective food availability feff with feff fenv fc following goedegebuure et al 2018 feff and fenv are contained between 0 and 1 fc is calculated with the following equations if p 1 9 k then fc 1 f env 1 p 2 k p if p 1 9 k then fc 1 f env 1 p k 10 fc is positive if p k and feff tends to its maximal value 1 with a decreasing population size as fc becomes very low and tends to 1 fenv when p k fc turns negative and makes feff decrease with the minimal value reached at p 2 k two equations are used because if p 2 k the first formula gives an error due to a division by 0 and if p 2 k then the formula gives the untrue result of less competition with a bigger population hence the use of 1 9 as a pivot value competition is only effective if food availability is less than the maximum hence the use of 1 fenv in the equation 2 5 summary of model parameterization and sensitivity analysis the model was constructed following the ecological and physiological observations available in the literature for a cordatus these observations are summarised in the following table table 3 once these elements added the ageing submodel and the carrying capacity parameters for which no in situ observations are defined were calibrated until obtaining a model stable in time over several centuries the sensitivity of the model to different parameters was tested this sensitivity analysis also served as a first form of validation in the absence of wider means of validation initial population number inter individuals variation coefficient juvenile and adult background mortalities number of eggs produced per female during a reproduction event and egg survival rate were each applied variations of 30 20 10 10 20 and 30 table 3 the influence of changes in these parameter values was assessed on the average population density ind m2 the average juvenile adult ratio the average physical length the average reserve energy and the average structural length variation over the period of 200 years for each analysis models were replicated 100 times a model was considered to crash when the population is not stable and collapses entirely before the end of the simulation period the proportion of crashes relates to the number of crashes counted for 100 simulations i e for 15 crashes and 100 simulations the proportion is 15 100 15 13 due to computing time limitations the analysis was stopped when reaching a proportion higher than 66 of crashes indicated by a black cross in appendix e the model sensitivity to the gsi threshold assumption was tested with the upper and lower values of the gsi calculated at the onset of reproduction in magniez 1983 the minimum value did not impact the model at all but the higher threshold value prevented most of the females from reproducing results not presented 2 6 forcing environmental variables 2 6 1 temperature in the frame of deb theory temperature influences metabolic rates following the arrhenius function which defines the range of temperatures that affect enzyme performance considering that metabolic rates are controlled by enzymes that are set inactive beyond an optimal temperature tolerance kooijman 2010 thomas and bacher 2018 the arrhenius response is characterized by five parameters that describe the species tolerance range the arrhenius temperature ta the temperature at the upper and lower limits of the species tolerance range th and tl respectively and the arrhenius temperature beyond upper and lower limits of the tolerance range tah and tal respectively in our study the available information is not sufficient to define the complete relationship between temperature and metabolic performances and the temperature correction factor tc is only calculated using one of the five arrhenius parameter ta in k following the equation τ t τ exp ta tref ta t with τ a given metabolic rate tref the reference temperature 293 k 20 c t the environmental temperature in kelvin and exp ta tref ta t being the temperature correction factor tc the correction is applied to the metabolic rates v k m k j ḧa table 1 temperatures recorded since 1993 at port aux français another site in the gulf of morbihan show a clear 6 year cycle of increasing and decreasing temperatures appendix a the 2012 2018 temperature dataset selected as input forcing variable in the model therefore constitutes an interesting proxy of temperature conditions at anse du halage which includes a complete overview of the environmental variability at the station however it is important to take this choice into consideration during interpretation of results as it needs to be differentiated from a cycle that would be inherent to the biology of the species 2 6 2 food resources in deb theory the energy is supplied to the reserve of the organism through ingestion proportional to food availability represented in the model by a functional response f from 0 to 1 food assimilation ṗa fig 3a is proportional to the surface of the structure of each individual and contributes to the filling of the reserve compartment e fig 3a the functional response f was calibrated using the values of organic carbon oc content in sediment as a percentage of dry weight of sediment at the station anse du halage at the end of each month available in delille and bouvy 1989 the maximum value of 1 for f corresponds here to the maximum value of organic carbon content that was found 6 94 and a f minimum of 0 corresponds to 0 oc 2 7 model projection 2 7 1 present day conditions at anse du halage to assess the influence of varying environmental conditions on model outputs after being constructed for the site anse du halage the model was implemented in two other sites ile haute and port couvreux where a cordatus is reported in high densities poulin 1996 fig 1 the implementation to these two other stations was done with contrasting temperatures from the proteker programme as previously explained in 2 1 food conditions at these two sites are not available and were estimated at the end of the summer to be 50 to 30 of the organic carbon values measured at anse du halage according to the comparative study of delille et al 1979 these rates were applied to yearlong conditions fig a 2 models were launched for a period of 200 years 2 7 2 future conditions two future scenarios predicting environmental conditions for 2100 were used based on the ipcc scenario rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively optimistic and pessimistic scenarios ipcc 5th report accessed at https www esrl noaa gov psd ipcc ocn in august 2019 coarse ipcc predictions 1 x1 resolution of chlorophyll a concentration were used to roughly evaluate potential changes of food availability on the east coast of the kerguelen island in future conditions scenario rcp 2 6 shows an average decrease of 10 of current food resources availability while scenario rcp 8 5 shows an average decrease of 20 fig d 3 as for temperature we defined rcp 2 6 with a linear increase of 1 1 c and 1 7 c for rcp 8 5 models were launched for a period of 30 years 3 results 3 1 the individual based model variations in energy allocated to the reserve and the maturation buffer are the main controls of individual development monthly variations ue and ur x here stands for d x d t were simulated over one year under present day environmental conditions fig 4 energy in the reserve fig 4a shows variations between 2 5 and 8 on average no unit with maximum range values reaching 5 8 and 13 7 this shows a relative constant energy density inside the reserve throughout the year with however a noticeable increase from october to december and a sharp decrease from december to january fig 4a according to deb theory kooijman 2010 the more energy is stored inside the reserve through food assimilation the more it can be distributed to other compartments and the more energy can be assimilated into the reserve anew availability of food resources for a cordatusis the highest in december f 1 fig a 2 it is assimilated and stored as energy into the reserve based on the energy available in the reserve at the end of december energy is supplied in january to other compartments such as the reproduction buffer fig 4b and growth fig fa while the individual ingests the food available to replenish its reserve anew as food availability decreases in january f 0 748 the reserve loses energy fig 4a because the individual cannot assimilate as much energy as the amount transferred to other compartments the energy density entering the reproduction buffer fig 4b of mature females varies between 0 and 4 9 on average in the course of the year with a maximum of 10 7 the rate of energy input increases at an average pace of 1 1 per month from october to the onset of the reproduction period in march when it decreases and remains null until the end of the spawning period in june then energy starts accumulating again until the next reproduction period during the three months of the spawning period from march to may no energy is allocated from the reserve to the reproduction buffer and the energy stored in this buffer is progressively delivered to gametes only females that are mature in march undergo reproduction and deliver the energy contained in the reproductive buffer to the gametes females that become mature during the reproduction period undergo a normal increase of the energy in the reproduction buffer which explains the small increasing trend observed during the march may period fig 4b 3 2 the population model 3 2 1 modelled population dynamics at the calibration site based on the individual model population dynamics were simulated over a time period of 30 years showing a constant population density comprised between 120 and 220 individuals per square metre overall the population structure remains constant through time but with well marked yearly variations mainly in juvenile density fig 5 juveniles indeed represent around 83 of the total population density and show important yearly variations due to 1 important seasonal reproductive outputs causing a surge in population density 2 strong mortality rates causing gradual decreases in the population 3 the transfer of the large juvenile cohort to the adult population after around 3 years and 4 the influence of inter individual competition for food limiting population densities and even causing its decrease in contrast the adult population is much more stable relative to the juvenile one with lower density values around 40 individuals per square metre both juvenile and adult population fluctuations follow a general 6 year pattern displayed over the 30 years of simulations rectangle fig 5 this pattern is linked to temperature cycles over the same time span and includes two sharp decline in population density over a 6 year cycle t symbol fig 5 which corresponds to high temperatures rising above 8 c during two consecutive months and causing mortality rates of 10 of the entire population 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis different parameter settings for the model initiation may result in very diverging outputs appendix e it also influences model stability and population collapse in particular overall the initial number of individuals and the level of the inter individual variation coefficient are parameters that have little influence on model stability and low proportion of population crashes may result in addition model outputs do not differ significantly between simulations increase in juvenile and adult mortality levels will also have little influence on model outputs but decreasing mortality levels will induce a population burst followed by a strong competition for food and a consequent population collapse amongst all the parameters set at the model initialisation egg number and egg survival are the most important determining model stability as they directly control juvenile density high juvenile densities induced by a low background juvenile mortality and a high number of eggs and egg survival always result in fast population collapses as a result of high competition for food between individuals as population density increases the amount of food available for each individual decreases and individuals start starving to death in contrast a reduction in the number of juveniles causes a reduction in the average population density due to a strong mortality rate of juveniles it does not imply model instability and the proportion of modelled population crashes is always lower than 15 the reduction of population density also strongly influences the average amount of energy available for each individual the more energy is available the more individuals can grow in structural length 3 2 3 projections of the population dynamics model to other sites the dynamic population model built at anse du halage was implemented appendix g for the two sites of ile haute inside the morbihan bay and port couvreux outside the morbihan bay both models were simulated twice with initial estimates of 50 and 30 of food availability f compared to anse du halage fh temperature inputs were based on local temperature variations recorded at the two sites model outputs predict lower population densities at both sites compared to anse du halage and interestingly similar ratios between juveniles and adults table 4 these results are consistent with density values found in the literature which give between 100 and 136 individuals m2 at ile haute and 50 to 168 ind m2 at port couvreux mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 the different observed density values reported in publications for port couvreux may be due to contrasting conditions that locally prevail amongst the three small embayments of that locality poulin 1996 this has recently been confirmed by our personal observations in the field saucède 2020 model outputs suggest a strong influence of food availability on population densities controlled by inter individual competition for food accordingly simulations predict a drop in density values at port couvreux when food resources decrease at 30 of fh while density values are relatively stable at ile haute in comparison table 4a this mainly affects juvenile densities and results in a lower population ratio table 4b temperatures recorded at the two sites inside the morbihan bay anse du halage and ile haute are close to each other and slightly higher than outside the bay at port couvreux fig a 1 contrasting results were therefore expected between port couvreux and the two other sites on the contrary temperatures may not be contrasting enough between sites to affect population structure and density confidence intervals overlap between all sites for values of both population density and juveniles adults ratio table 4 3 2 4 population dynamics under future predictions of climate change population structure and density were simulated and implemented for scenarios of temperature and food resources changes based on ipcc scenarios rcp 2 6 and 8 5 and for populations of resistant intermediate and vulnerable organisms fig 6 population dynamics are all predicted to be affected by both scenarios fig 6d 6g with overall population densities predicted to be four to seven times lower than current population predictions population structures are also predicted to be affected by a lower contribution of juveniles to overall population densities the respective effects of temperature fig 6b and resource availability fig 6c were simulated independently under temperature change only fig 6b model predictions are close to model outputs in which both variables are combined fig 6g with a strong decrease in average population density compared to present day conditions fig 6a the effect of changes in resources availability only fig 6c is less marked with population densities showing a close pattern to present day models fig 6a models therefore predict a stronger effect of temperature changes on populations with population densities of vulnerable organisms predicted as very low less than one tenth of present day densities on average populations of vulnerable organisms are even predicted to go extinct in only 30 years of simulation fig 6f 6i populations of organisms with intermediate sensitivity fig 6e 6h are more resilient and withstand over 30 years of simulation in some cases but they collapse at the end of the period under ipcc scenario rcp 8 5 overall densities are very low around 20 or less individuals per square metre on average 3 3 population mortality under present day and future predictions under present day conditions fig 7 b background mortality and ageing are the main causes that affect population mortality each year respectively 65 to 90 and 5 8 to 9 high temperatures and starvation have sporadic effects on mortality high mortality due to high temperatures only happened in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and starvation contributes at the highest to 10 of overall mortality depending on the year over the course of a year fig 7a background mortality and ageing affect the population every month while high temperatures over 8 c cause the death of half of the population in march and april starvation is responsible for the death of a weak proportion of the population in november and december only austral summer in link with the competition for food resources of the increasing population during this productive and warm period under both future scenarios fig 7e 7f mortality levels are low compared to present day model fig 7b which is mostly due to small predicted population densities background and ageing mortalities are therefore very low starvation is not a cause of mortality anymore while high temperatures cause mortality of individuals before they may starve to death when comparing between model predictions under scenario rcp 8 5 for changes in food availability only fig 7c temperature change only fig 7d and the combined variables fig 7f temperature clearly appears as the main cause of mortality at the same level as background mortality 4 discussion 4 1 potential and limitations of the deb ibm approach in the present work a deb ibm model was built for a cordatus based on our current knowledge of this vulnerable endemic species of the kerguelen plateau on site monitoring and experiments on species tolerance to changing environmental conditions remains challenging issues in the kerguelen islands and in the southern ocean in general difficulties are owed to the sensitivity of specimens magniez 1983 schatt 1985 mespoulhé 1992 and the inherent ecological characteristics models can constitute a powerful tool for antarctic research as they can provide additional support to experimental knowledge and infer the impact of broad scale climate change on populations the potential of the present mechanistic modelling approach resides in its capacity to model the physiology of organisms as a response to environmental factors using deb models for the representation of individual components within the ibm enables to upscale a dynamic model to an entire population railsback and grimm 2019 as a function of two changing abiotic factors temperature and food resources applying such a model to a sub antarctic benthic and brooding species is challenging and had never been performed so far the present work shows the feasibility and relevance of the deb ibm approach to study southern ocean species like a cordatus relevant results were obtained both at the individual and populations levels first simulations showed the characteristic annual evolution of energy dynamics in the organism fig 4 appendix f and second population structure and density dynamics were modelled over an extended period of time decoupling juvenile and adult populations table 4 fig 6 fig 7 projections to other sites also show the potential application of the model to other areas for which environmental data are available future models give an insight and add some clues to assess the potential impact of climate change and predict the biotic response of populations models however still need some improvements including complementary data on species ecophysiology the model was also shown to be sensitive to mortality rates and some parameters egg number and egg survival settings while some population characteristics initial population densities and inter individual variability have little effects appendix e 4 2 limitations to the deb individual model the dynamic population model built in this work uses outputs from the deb model developed for a cordatus guillaumot 2019 which allows to represent as faithfully as possible the physiological dynamics of individuals during their entire life cycle the goodness of fit of the deb model shows that estimated parameters accurately described observed data however collecting additional data at the different stages of the organism s life cycle and under different conditions of temperature and food availability would contribute to improving further model accuracy and parameter predictions in particular data on environmental settings and species ecophysiology are still needed to improve the accuracy and relevance of the following parameters 4 2 1 the arrhenius function and the optimal temperature range in deb theory the arrhenius function determines the optimal temperature range of the organism s metabolism as a response to enzymatic tolerance kooijman 2010 thomas and bacher 2018 in the present work calculation of the arrhenius function relies on fragmental datasets the ascending part of the arrhenius curve that is the temperature range in which faster metabolic rates are determined by higher temperatures was estimated but values are still missing for the descending slope i e the temperature range beyond the optimal temperatures in which the metabolic rates slow down with higher temperatures kooijman 2010 the present model assumes that higher temperatures favour more suitable conditions with no limit appendix f which has to be corrected arbitrarily using our personal field and experimental observations on the echinoid ecology fig d 2 further experiments should help improve the calculation of the arrhenius function they would consist in measurements of respiratory rates as a function of temperature variations e g uthicke et al 2014 and will enable more accurate simulations of a cordatus ecophysiology and the direct effect of temperature on the organism s metabolism a prerequisite to better model population mortality 4 2 2 age size and growth estimates most parameters used in the deb model were taken from the literature and experimental studies except for some of them that were assumed based on physiological traits of counterparts in particular organisms maximum age growth rate and size are not sufficiently known due to difficulties in setting up long term experiments in the kerguelen islands the relationship between echinoid growth size and shape cannot be assessed based on growth lines measurement because there is no linear relationship between echinoid size and age ebert 1975 and because resorption may occur during periods of starvation brockington et al 2001 ingels et al 2012 the most reliable method would consist in monitoring organisms growth through time using tagging methods ebert 2013 however such an approach is time consuming and challenging as even small measurement errors may have a significant effect on results ebert 2013 and no experimental data are available so far former studies mespoulhé 1992 showed that after 4 to 5 years specimens of a cordatus only slowly increase in size and echinoids test tend to become distorted a common feature in large spatangoid echinoids in which test plates tend to overlap while body size does not increase anymore mespoulhé 1992 however this slow growth rate in aged specimens could also result from other causes affecting optimal food intake for instance at the calibration site of anse du halage a study of echinoid cohorts suggests that few individuals grow older than six years old poulin and féral 1994 overall the absence or nearly absence of growth in old invertebrate organisms makes age estimates delicate to assess in the present model based on the combination of the ageing sub model and other mortality processes most individuals are calibrated to die within the assumed maximum age before 6 years old although some individuals may reach over ten years old due to the chosen stochasticity introduced in the sub model juveniles inside brood pouches were assumed to grow at a constant and same rate as adults but it has sometimes been assumed that the brooded young may already feed and develop at a faster rate schatt 1985 schatt and féral 1996 at this stage the offspring is particularly fragile and needs protection in the brood pouches to survive which prevents any monitoring of growth rates and feeding behaviours magniez 1983 schatt 1985 mespoulhé 1992 4 3 ecological relevance of the ibm population model upscaling the deb individual model to the population level in the ibm enables to simulate population structure and dynamics as a response to temperature and food resource availability in particular the ibm enables to predict the targetted effect of environmental changes on the population at the different life stages of individuals additional environmental data would help enhance ibm reliability and improve our knowledge of populations and environmental conditions in remote areas field works are also subject to uncertainties due to the species burrowing habit which renders the assessment of population structure difficult the brittleness of specimens also limiting counting replicates magniez 1980 mespoulhé 1992 important variations in population densities were noted across studies guille and lasserre 1979 mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 personal observations for a same site which may suggest either important variations in population density and structure through time which was however refuted by poulin and féral 1994 or important biases in sampling due to the aggregative behaviour of individuals and the patchiness of distribution patterns poulin 1996 the sensitivity analysis appendix e showed that the model is not very much dependant on assumptions made on initial population densities because the model density dependant regulation operates through intra specific competition for food resources only there is no agonistic behaviour amongst conspecific individuals as it was reported in other echinoid species e g echinometra sp shulman 1990 and there is no evidence of competition for space in a cordatus based on field observation intra specific competition in shallow water echinoids is a common phenomenon under food limited conditions stevenson mitchell and davies 2015 mcclanahan and kurtis 1991 stated that in echinometra mathaei when predation pressure and intra specific competition are low populations increase without limitation and regulation operates through a decrease in food availability for individuals the same could hold true for a cordatus as well intra specific competition for oxygen could also have a regulatory effect ferguson et al 2013 since a cordatus shows a high oxygen consumption rate guille and lasserre 1979 magniez and féral 1988 in muddy substrates specimens are usually observed unburied positioned onto the sediment instead of underneath which was often interpreted as a result of difficulties to breath inside fine sediments the sensitivity analysis also showed that the number of eggs produced by females is a controlling parameter of model stability as well there is a high variability in the number of eggs produced amongst females from 9 to 106 eggs per female personal communication from p magniez taking into account such a variability would introduce an enhanced stochasticity in the population dynamics model if implemented and linked to each female s reproductive buffer ur and gsi values martin et al 2010 e g for zebrafish in beaudouin et al 2015 finally the model was also shown to be sensitive to background mortality appendix e although monitoring mortality rates in the field is challenging such data would greatly enhance the reliability of the ibm in general the sensitivity tests showed that the model works with the current quality and quantity of data available for this species in this habitat however on the matter of the temporal resolution our model needs to be expanded and further consolidated and we consider this element as a limitation to our work in its current state appendix c 4 3 1 modelled food resources the organic content of sediments is one of the main food resources for detritus feeders and sediment swallowers like a cordatus snelgrove and butman 1994 and antarctic echinoids michel et al 2016 in the present model the organic carbon content of sediments was used as a proxy for food availability for a cordatus intra specific competition for food has a stronger effect on resources availability than seasonal variations in resource availability this is in line with ecological evidences that populations of a cordatus survive periods of low food resources that prevail during the austral winter high seasonality in food resources is a common feature of polar ecosystems and species have long adapted their diet accordingly de ridder and lawrence 1982 michel et al 2016 this has been shown in antarctic benthic invertebrates such as shallow water brachiopods peck et al 2005 cnidarians orejas et al 2001 and echinoids brockington et al 2001 ingels et al 2012 for instance the antarctic sea urchin sterechinus neumayeri is believed to be capable of mobilizing energy from gut tissues gonads and the body wall during the austral winter brockington et al 2001 a strategy that may have been evolved in a cordatus as well magniez 1983 shrinking and resorption which are sometimes hypothesized as a survival mechanism in other echinoids facing long periods of starvation are phenomena which are still understudied david and néraudeau 1989 ebert 2013 and have not been verified in a cordatus in the present model starvation results in the redirection of the energy flow exclusively toward maintenance of structure at the expense of other compartments although magniez 1983 observed a decrease in gonadal material after the reproduction period it is very small in females 0 3 and slightly bigger in males 1 6 and the exact cause has not been studied it is not known whether this decrease in gonadal material can be directly attributed to a reabsorption for survival purposes or some other mechanism the use of previously stored energy in the different compartments to sustain the maintenance of structure is assumed to be non existent in our model such starvation processes could be tested in future implementation provided sufficient data is obtained through experimental setups observing the phenomenon the two scenarios of future food availability were based on coarse ipcc and noaa projection models for the region these simulations and associated outputs are here considered as conceivable scenarios of the influence of food and temperature changes on population dynamics they are used as a proof of concept and are by no means considered as definite and reliable scenarios of population dynamics in the future future accurate predictions should imply the integration of complex mechanisms influencing the production transport and deposition of organic matter in the ocean the possibility of species to adapt to changing environmental conditions and more experimental data are needed to integrate the detailed influence of temperature on physiological processes first observations suggest a low response toward the applied changes in food availability in comparison with the influence of temperature however it cannot be concluded that the species would not be affected by future conditions in food resources in the area 4 3 2 temperature resilience important differences were obtained between population structures and densities depending on future scenarios and model projections made for contrasting food resources and temperature most importantly the resistant population model of a cordatus at anse du halage is predicted to sustain the expected changes in temperature and food resources under both future scenarios although population density is also predicted to be strongly reduced in contrast the vulnerable population model predicts population extinction after a few decades of simulation this implies that a precise evaluation of the species resilience to temperatures is needed for more robust and decisive models moreover antarctic echinoids were shown to present varied responses to ocean warming depending on species and life stages with higher vulnerability to warm temperatures in juveniles than in adults ingels et al 2012 such a contrast suggests that more data could help fine tune the present model 4 4 relevance of the deb ibm approach for southern ocean studies deb ibm models are being developed for various applications and research fields they are considered a powerful tool for environmental risk assessment such as the effect of toxicity e g beaudouin et al 2015 david et al 2019 vlaeminck et al 2019 and the impact of environmental changes on population dynamics e g malishev et al 2018 saraiva et al 2014 thomas and bacher 2018 goedegebuure et al 2018 they can also be used to predict the behaviour of microbial systems jayathilake et al 2017 or bring to light underlying mechanisms of life history strategies e g gatti petitgas and huret 2017 the deb model brings ontogenetic and phenotypic variations to the population model while the ibm brings stochasticity population dynamics e g competition for food as well as learning and interaction mechanisms deangelis et al 1991 martin et al 2012 to complement the model the potential of the deb ibm approach resides in the combination of both models to predict population dynamics as a response to changing environmental conditions i e at the individual level in the deb model and at population level in the ibm in the present work the deb ibm was used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of a cordatus populations applications could be further developed to address conservation issues such as the designation of priority areas and the definition of management plan strategies vast areas of the french southern territories have recently been placed under enhanced protection of a national nature reserve based on experts knowledge and ecoregionalisation approaches koubbi et al 2010 fabri ruiz et al 2020 most areas however could not have benefited from thorough benthic field studies and ecological models can represent interesting tools to assess the relevance of defined protection areas for target species and ecosystems such models can be useful when drafting management plan strategies for determining favored ship traffic routes or areas where human activities can be implemented in coastal areas of the national nature reserve of the french southern territories dynamic population models allow testing different ecological scenarios in a quite straightforward way to illustrate research designs and proposals they can provide some clues to investigate the potential effect of environmental changes on key species for which conservation efforts should be directed in a short to long term strategy fulton et al 2015 dynamic models can also prove useful for adaptable conservation strategies like the designation of dynamic protected areas as a consequence of changing environments and ecosystems finally dynamic models could be further

24680,the kerguelen islands are part of the french southern territories located at the limit of the indian and southern oceans they are highly impacted by climate change and coastal marine areas are particularly at risk assessing the responses of species and populations to environmental change is challenging in such areas for which ecological modelling can constitute a helpful approach in the present work a deb ibm model dynamic energy budget individual based model was generated to simulate and predict population dynamics in an endemic and common benthic species of shallow marine habitats of the kerguelen islands the sea urchin abatus cordatus the model relies on a dynamic energy budget model deb developed at the individual level upscaled to an individual based population model ibm it then enables to model population dynamics through time as a result of individual physiological responses to environmental variations the model was successfully built for a reference site to simulate the response of populations to variations in food resources and temperature then it was implemented to model population dynamics at other sites and for the different ipcc climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 and 8 5 under present day conditions models predict a more determinant effect of food resources on population densities and on juvenile densities in particular relative to temperature in contrast simulations predict a sharp decline in population densities under conditions of ipcc scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 with a determinant effect of water warming leading to the extinction of most vulnerable populations after a 30 year simulation time due to high mortality levels associated with peaks of high temperatures such a dynamic model is here applied for the first time to a southern ocean benthic and brooding species and offers interesting prospects for antarctic and sub antarctic biodiversity research it could constitute a useful tool to support conservation studies in these

variations significant shifts in coastal currents sedimentation rates and phytoplanktonic blooms affecting coastal marine communities at high latitudes gutt et al 2018 stenni et al 2017 waller et al 2017 the species endemicity can be partly related to low dispersal capabilities which is a consequence of a particular life trait a cordatus broods its young in incubating pouches located on the aboral side of the test and has a direct development with no larval stage and no metamorphosis the low dispersal capacity of a cordatus likely increases its vulnerability to environmental changes ledoux et al 2012 benthic fauna of sub antarctic regions remains under studied compared to pelagic species améziane et al 2011 xavier et al 2016 ecological niche models can represent relevant tools to study the consequences of environmental changes on the biology of these benthic organisms and on their population dynamics correlative niche models were used to predict the distribution of suitable areas for a cordatus on the kerguelen plateau guillaumot et al 2018a b however supplementary data and analyses are still needed to depict and understand the species response to environmental changes in the present work a mechanistic modelling approach using a dynamic energy budget individual based model deb ibm was used to analyse the biological response of a cordatus to various environmental conditions an individual mechanistic model deb was first built using experimental and literature data guillaumot 2019 a deb model aims to represent the physiological development of an organism from the embryo to its death based on energetic fluxes and allows considering the metabolic state of the individual at any given moment of its life cycle it relies on biological principles and first laws of thermodynamics to recreate the metabolic development as a function of two environmental parameters food resources and temperature kooijman 2010 the deb model was then upscaled to the population level ibm wherein it was implemented as iterative mathematical calculations of each organism s individual development in the population the ibm relies on the simulation of individuals as autonomous entities forming a complex population within a dynamic system railsback and grimm 2019 the deb ibm is used to analyse population dynamics emerging from the development and the physiological traits of individuals as a function of environmental forcing variables i e food resources and temperature the deb ibm can then be used to simulate population dynamics under different environmental scenarios enabling a better quantification of the vulnerability of populations to changing environmental conditions modelling population dynamics using a deb ibm model for a sub antarctic and brooding invertebrate brings a feature so far unseen in other published deb models the main objectives of the study were to develop a deb ibm model for a cordatus 1 to simulate population structure and dynamics at different sites under both current environmental conditions and future ipcc climate scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 and 2 to assess the feasibility of such a model for organisms in a region where low data availability and resolution may limit model building and validation the current resolution and accuracy of future climate scenarios in sub antarctic areas do not allow building precise and reliable predictions for the future but they were used here as a proof of concept to test population responses to various conceivable conditions sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness potential and relevance of models grimm and berger 2016 considering data availability simulations performed for various temperature conditions and food resource availabilities if validated may constitute a promising tool to address conservation issues 2 methods 2 1 study area the deb ibm population model was generated in the geographic and environmental context of the kerguelen islands

cordatus fig 2 is a shallow deposit feeder and sediment swallower living at 5 c average full or half buried into soft sediments de ridder and lawrence 1982 it is distributed all around the kerguelen islands but population densities are highly variable depending on depth substrate nature and exposure to the open sea distributed from the intertidal area to the deep shelf over 500 m depth populations highest densities are found in very shallow 0 2 m depth and sheltered areas with soft bottoms of fine to medium sand poulin 1996 in shallow areas observed density vary from less than 5 individuals m2 in the fjord des portes noires poulin and féral 1995 to 10 ind m2 at port aux français mespoulhé 1992 130 ind m2 ile haute mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 168 ind m2 port couvreux poulin 1996 and up to 280 ind m2 anse du halage magniez 1980 poulin 1996 juveniles are commonly found sheltered in between holdfasts of the giant kelp macrocystis pyrifera bordering with sandy shallow areas the species is relatively resistant to low salinities locally induced by freshwater run off from the main island guille and lasserre 1979 it is tolerant to temperature variations particularly marked in shallow areas but temperature tolerance does not exceed 12 c personal observations the maximum size ever observed is 4 9 cm in length mespoulhé 1992 lifespan is assumed to be around six years old mespoulhé 1992 although it cannot be excluded that some individuals may grow older identified predators are gastropods crustaceans and seagulls poulin 1996 poulin and féral 1995 from which the specimens are hidden when burrowing into the sediment magniez 1979 poulin and féral 1995 sexual reproduction in a cordatus occurs every year with all mature females producing eggs magniez 1983 and incubating their young in their four brood pouches located on the aboral side of the test fig 2b after brooding juveniles exit the pouches and start their autonomous development on the seabed in the vicinity of their mother magniez 1983 schatt 1985 reproduction time can greatly differ between sites generally extending from march to may as in anse du halage and ile haute reproduction can also occur from june to august ile suhm from december to february port matha or from august to november port couvreux poulin 1996 females usually spawn once a year poulin 1996 brooding and burrowing behaviours imply a relative sedentary lifestyle and can explain a part of the species endemicity with dense populations scattered all around the archipelago and only a few older individuals that may be found isolated from core populations mespoulhé 1992 poulin and féral 1995 2 3 deb modelling 2 3 1 principles deb theory defines individuals as dynamic systems and provides a mathematical framework for modelling organisms life cycle it describes physiological processes using four primary state variables reserve structure reproduction buffer and maturity directly linked to mass and energy flows and influenced by two forcing variables temperature and food availability fig 3 jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 based on feeding growth and reproduction processes deb models predict the metabolic and development states of organisms through time kooijman 2010 sousa et al 2008 metabolic processes are linked to shape and size of the organism represented by the structural volume and the structural area structural volume is related to maintenance processes while structural area is closely linked to food ingestion and assimilation processes and controls the amount of energy arriving into the reserve compartment e fig 3a van der meer 2006 the energy contained in the reserve compartment is allocated to organism maintenance somatic and maturity maintenances priority processes that condition the organism s survival to growth increase of structural volume v and to the increase of complexity eh or reproduction buffer er fig 3a according to the kappa rule kooijman 2010 the complexity is represented as the maturity level the amount of energy accumulated into this compartment triggers metabolic switches such as the transition i e ability to feed to reproduce between life stages defined in deb theory namely embryo juvenile and adult life stages kooijman 2010 2 3 2 application of deb model to a cordatus parameter estimation an individual mechanistic deb model was developed for a cordatus guillaumot 2019 estimated deb parameters are reported in table 1 the deb model considers a larval growth accelerated compared to the adult stage schatt 1985 so called abj type model the model was constructed using data from the literature table 2 the goodness of fit of the deb model to the data was evaluated by calculating the mean relative error mre of each dataset which is the sum of the absolute differences between observed and expected values divided by the expected values mre values are contained in the interval 0 infinity the mre is considered to be a reference method to assess deb modelling performance lika et al 2011b for which the closer to 0 the better model predictions match the data maturation and development embryos of a cordatus have a direct development in brood pouches of females magniez 1983 schatt 1985 they start feeding inside pouches after 142 days of incubation i e 5 months and leave the pouches as fully developed sea urchins after 8 5 months schatt 1985 according to deb theory individuals are considered embryos until they can feed kooijman 2010 before the fifth month feeding inside the maternal pouches is not clearly attested but feeding through epidermal uptake of dissolved organic matter dom is considered as the possible mechanism schatt and féral 1996 at each growth step energy is supplied to the reserve by the ingested food fig 3a ṗa and then leaves the reserve compartment to be directed to growth maturation or reproduction compartments through the mobilisation flux fig 3a ṗc this is performed following the kappa rule a κ fraction is directed towards the structure growth compartment and somatic maintenance fig 3a a and the remaining 1 κ fraction towards complexity maturation reproduction compartments and maturity maintenance fig 3a b during the juvenile stage the individual does not supply energy into reproduction but accumulates energy in its maturity compartment eh until reaching the puberty threshold that according to deb theory defines the moment when the organism is mature enough to reproduce kooijman 2010 after reaching this threshold at around 2 5 to 3 years old mespoulhé 1992 schatt 1985 the organism can allocate energy into the reproduction buffer er for gamete production fig 3a the structural volume increases continuously along the individual s life from birth to death supplied in energy left from what has not been allocated to priority maintenance costs ṗm and ṗj starvation mortality magniez 1983 observed that the gonadal index continues to decrease slightly for around two months after reproduction he hypothesized that it was related to the season as the reproduction period finishes at the start of winter food resources decrease and energy investment into reproductive organs is momentary diverted towards the maintenance of somatic elements this was demonstrated in the other sea urchin species strongylocentrotus purpuratus lawrence et al 1966 and arbacia lixula fenaux et al 1975 confronted to starvation in the model when scaled reserve e reserve relative to reserve capacity no dimension falls below the scaled structural length l length relative to maximum length no dimension it is assumed that the individual is confronted to starvation the kappa rule is then altered as energy is entirely redirected to the somatic maintenance and all other fluxes growth reproduction or maturation are set to 0 when e 0 the organism does not have enough energy to allocate the amount necessary for survival somatic maintenance costs and dies see section 7 submodels starvation in appendix g for further details and implemented equations ageing mortality death probability by senescence was calculated in the model using the ageing sub model a simulation of damages induced by lethal compounds such as free radical or other reactive oxygen species ros following the deb theory for ageing kooijman 2010 the density of damage inducing compounds in the body increases as the reserve compartment is fuelled with energy that is allocated through the entire organism it influences the hazard mortality rate ḣ which is a function of the damage accumulated in the body and simulates the vulnerability of the individual to damages such as the risk of dying from illness increases with age in the model the hazard mortality rate ḣ is supplemented by a stochastic parameter martin et al 2010 to control the ageing mortality rate see section 7 submodels ageing in appendix g for further details and implemented equations 2 4 individual based modelling for the population 2 4 1 principles the individual deb model is used to simulate each individual as an entity of the individual based population model ibm an ibm represents the individual components individuals of a cordatus of an environmental system anse du halage and their behaviours enabling to feature each individual as an autonomous entity and looking at results at the scale of the whole population deangelis and mooij 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 railsback and grimm 2019 in our model each individual do not have any direct interaction nor adaptive behaviour towards their environment nor the other members of the population they follow a continuous development governed by metabolic fluxes deb model that are influenced by environmental conditions temperature and food resources along their entire life each individual is a component of the modelled population which is itself affected by population death rate and density dependant processes the ibm was built with the software netlogo version 6 0 4 wilensky 1999 using the deb ibm model developed by martin et al 2010 for the species daphnia magna the netlogo code is available at http modelingcommons org browse one model 6201 it contains the script to run the model the input files of monthly food resources and temperatures for the three stations and a detailed description of the model following the odd protocol from grimm et al 2010 and the associated list of variables present in the code this detailed odd was also included in appendix g 2 4 2 application of ibm model to a cordatus model structure the model includes two types of entities the individuals and the environment individuals are divided into 4 types of sub agents depending on their life stage and sex embryos juveniles adult males and adult females the values of four primary state variables are attributed to each individual scaled reserve ue volumetric structural length l scaled maturity uh and scaled reproduction buffer ur the level of energy contained in the scaled maturity uh thresholds the life stages these four variables are scaled meaning here that the energy dimension has been removed by dividing with the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate ṗam in j l 2 t 1 based on deb theory kooijman 2010 simulations were run with a monthly timestep for calculation in regard to the slow growth of the species and the available data an analysis of the effect of the timestep on the core individual model was conducted cf appendix c at each timestep food and temperature conditions are first input into the model state variable values of each individual are calculated in order to assess whether new maturity thresholds are reached or whether energy is sufficient for survival growth or reproduction the population state is reassessed at the end of each month spatially population structure and density are simulated on a patch of one square metre at each site and individuals do not leave the patch during their entire life initialisation the initial population density value was set to 120 ind m2 and this figure was split into classes of equal densities of 20 individuals of different age classes between 0 and 5 years old in order to stabilize the initialisation between the different replicates an initial run is realised to capture the values of the four state variables that characterize the individual of each age class at october 2012 temperatures and f 1 in order to initiate the model appendix h the first decade of the simulation period was always considered as the initialisation phase and was removed from the analysis the model showing important outliers in individual metabolism and population structure during these first ten years inter individuals variability each individual is characterized by similar energetic performances estimated by the deb estimation table 1 five deb parameters were divided by a scatter multiplier parameter that was generated in order to create inter individual variability these five deb parameters were selected because they are associated to the four state variables that characterize the individuals and are not null at the time the individual is initiated into the model following martin et al 2010 1 maturity level at birth u h b d cm2 that is the amount of energy accumulated in the maturity compartment needed to reach the juvenilestage 2 maturity level at puberty u h p d cm2 the amount of energy accumulated into the maturity compartment to reach the adult stage 3 energy investment ratio g no dimension the cost of the added volume relative to the maximum potentially available energy for growth and maintenance 4 the initial energy reserve at birth ue d cm2 and 5 the initial structural length l cm the scatter multiplier is the exponential of a random number from a normal distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation cv 0 1 by default can be set by the user in the interface of the model the value is therefore small enough to not affect tremendously the initial variable and generate trade off between parameters it is applied as soon as the individual is created in the system reproduction sex ratios ratio males females in the studied populations are slightly contrasting between localities from 0 94 ile haute to 0 99 anse du halage and 1 04 port couvreux poulin 1996 the average ratio of 0 99 was chosen in the model by approximation it was considered that only females undergo physiological changes during the reproduction process males being only used as a component of the total population to this date few monitoring studies have been performed on a cordatus reproduction magniez 1983 is the only one who studied the gonado somatic index gsi that is the proportion of ash free gonads dry weight over the ash free body dry weight therefore directly linked to the accumulation of energy into the reproduction buffer according to magniez 1983 reproduction can occur if the gsi reaches at least 0 07 this condition was used in our model to control the ability of the female to reproduce when time comes the gonadosomatic index gsi was only attributed to females and was estimated for each month with this equation kooijman 2010 section 4 10 eq 4 89 gsi time of accumulatio n k m g f 3 f ϰ g y ve 1 ϰ f 3 k j u h p l m 2 s m 3 where the time of accumulation is the number of days spent since the end of the reproduction period k m is the somatic maintenance rate

is constant from march to may for the individuals at anse du halage and they only spawn once a year magniez 1983 schatt and féral 1996 poulin 1996 after each monthly step the model checks the gsi value for each female if the gsi reaches the 0 07 threshold at the onset of the period march reproduction is triggered for this considered female according to the literature when reproducing females invest around 52 of their reproductive organs energy into reproduction magniez 1983 this energy is released during the three months when spawning occurs that is the gsi of the female will decrease by 52 of its initial value over the 3 months period so a decrease of one third of 52 per month with gsi gsistart 0 52 gsistart 3 where gsistart is the level of gonadal index at the onset of reproduction in parallel the usual ur change in energy density in the reproduction buffer outside of the reproduction period no unit is set to 0 for the three months while ur energy density in the reproduction buffer is forced to decrease in a similar fashion to the gsi 2ur ur start 0 52 ur start 3 with ur start being the reproduction buffer at the start of the period reproduction induces the introduction of 27 embryos in average in the system magniez 1983 added proportionally along the three months 9 per month background mortality no specific adult mortality rates are mentioned in the literature as no cause have been defined precisely background population mortality annual rates were estimated based on size frequency distribution provided by mespoulhé 1992 and using the formula from ebert 2013 n t n0 e m t with n t the population size at time t n0 the initial population size m the mortality rate and t the time in months two yearly mortality rates were defined one for juveniles 41 and one for adults 24 a percentage of embryos mortality in the pouches was calculated based on data from poulin 1996 determining an egg survival of 65 this mortality is associated to the fact that when the first juveniles start leaving the maternal pouches at the beginning of january they push aside the protecting spikes of the pouch and eggs remaining in the brood are no longer protected and die magniez 1980 mortality induced by temperatures as no precise information is available to accurately describe a cordatus temperature tolerance three different types of sensitivity were designed to cover different hypothesis fig d 2 based on experimental results obtained in the kerguelen islands personal observation mortality gradient due to temperature was applied to the population for temperatures comprised between 8 and 12 c over 12 c all individuals are considered to die in the model as none survived in the experiment 1 a vulnerable type was defined with population death rates of 25 35 and 45 when the sea urchins are exposed to temperatures respectively reaching 8 9 5 and 11 c during two consecutive months 2 the resistant type was defined with a mortality rate 15 lower than the vulnerable one for the same temperature thresholds e g 10 instead of 25 population mortality at 8 c for similar exposure duration i e two months 3 the intermediate type is similar to the resistant type but individuals are considered to die after one month of exposure to each temperature instead of two fig d 2 density dependant regulation population density autoregulates through competition for food resources this procedure relies on the monitoring of population density in relation to the carrying capacity and allows to stabilize the model the model calculates the current population density and quantifies the competition effect on food availability depending on how far from the carrying capacity k the population density p is and updates food availability in accordance it is considered that at each timestep a certain amount of food is available in the environment fenv but according to population size competition for food fc quantified food competition is present and influences effective food availability feff with feff fenv fc following goedegebuure et al 2018 feff and fenv are contained between 0 and 1 fc is calculated with the following equations if p 1 9 k then fc 1 f env 1 p 2 k p if p 1 9 k then fc 1 f env 1 p k 10 fc is positive if p k and feff tends to its maximal value 1 with a decreasing population size as fc becomes very low and tends to 1 fenv when p k fc turns negative and makes feff decrease with the minimal value reached at p 2 k two equations are used because if p 2 k the first formula gives an error due to a division by 0 and if p 2 k then the formula gives the untrue result of less competition with a bigger population hence the use of 1 9 as a pivot value competition is only effective if food availability is less than the maximum hence the use of 1 fenv in the equation 2 5 summary of model parameterization and sensitivity analysis the model was constructed following the ecological and physiological observations available in the literature for a cordatus these observations are summarised in the following table table 3 once these elements added the ageing submodel and the carrying capacity parameters for which no in situ observations are defined were calibrated until obtaining a model stable in time over several centuries the sensitivity of the model to different parameters was tested this sensitivity analysis also served as a first form of validation in the absence of wider means of validation initial population number inter individuals variation coefficient juvenile and adult background mortalities number of eggs produced per female during a reproduction event and egg survival rate were each applied variations of 30 20 10 10 20 and 30 table 3 the influence of changes in these parameter values was assessed on the average population density ind m2 the average juvenile adult ratio the average physical length the average reserve energy and the average structural length variation over the period of 200 years for each analysis models were replicated 100 times a model was considered to crash when the population is not stable and collapses entirely before the end of the simulation period the proportion of crashes relates to the number of crashes counted for 100 simulations i e for 15 crashes and 100 simulations the proportion is 15 100 15 13 due to computing time limitations the analysis was stopped when reaching a proportion higher than 66 of crashes indicated by a black cross in appendix e the model sensitivity to the gsi threshold assumption was tested with the upper and lower values of the gsi calculated at the onset of reproduction in magniez 1983 the minimum value did not impact the model at all but the higher threshold value prevented most of the females from reproducing results not presented 2 6 forcing environmental variables 2 6 1 temperature in the frame of deb theory temperature influences metabolic rates following the arrhenius function which defines the range of temperatures that affect enzyme performance considering that metabolic rates are controlled by enzymes that are set inactive beyond an optimal temperature tolerance kooijman 2010 thomas and bacher 2018 the arrhenius response is characterized by five parameters that describe the species tolerance range the arrhenius temperature ta the temperature at the upper and lower limits of the species tolerance range th and tl respectively and the arrhenius temperature beyond upper and lower limits of the tolerance range tah and tal respectively in our study the available information is not sufficient to define the complete relationship between temperature and metabolic performances and the temperature correction factor tc is only calculated using one of the five arrhenius parameter ta in k following the equation τ t τ exp ta tref ta t with τ a given metabolic rate tref the reference temperature 293 k 20 c t the environmental temperature in kelvin and exp ta tref ta t being the temperature correction factor tc the correction is applied to the metabolic rates v k m k j ḧa table 1 temperatures recorded since 1993 at port aux français another site in the gulf of morbihan show a clear 6 year cycle of increasing and decreasing temperatures appendix a the 2012 2018 temperature dataset selected as input forcing variable in the model therefore constitutes an interesting proxy of temperature conditions at anse du halage which includes a complete overview of the environmental variability at the station however it is important to take this choice into consideration during interpretation of results as it needs to be differentiated from a cycle that would be inherent to the biology of the species 2 6 2 food resources in deb theory the energy is supplied to the reserve of the organism through ingestion proportional to food availability represented in the model by a functional response f from 0 to 1 food assimilation ṗa fig 3a is proportional to the surface of the structure of each individual and contributes to the filling of the reserve compartment e fig 3a the functional response f was calibrated using the values of organic carbon oc content in sediment as a percentage of dry weight of sediment at the station anse du halage at the end of each month available in delille and bouvy 1989 the maximum value of 1 for f corresponds here to the maximum value of organic carbon content that was found 6 94 and a f minimum of 0 corresponds to 0 oc 2 7 model projection 2 7 1 present day conditions at anse du halage to assess the influence of varying environmental conditions on model outputs after being constructed for the site anse du halage the model was implemented in two other sites ile haute and port couvreux where a cordatus is reported in high densities poulin 1996 fig 1 the implementation to these two other stations was done with contrasting temperatures from the proteker programme as previously explained in 2 1 food conditions at these two sites are not available and were estimated at the end of the summer to be 50 to 30 of the organic carbon values measured at anse du halage according to the comparative study of delille et al 1979 these rates were applied to yearlong conditions fig a 2 models were launched for a period of 200 years 2 7 2 future conditions two future scenarios predicting environmental conditions for 2100 were used based on the ipcc scenario rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively optimistic and pessimistic scenarios ipcc 5th report accessed at https www esrl noaa gov psd ipcc ocn in august 2019 coarse ipcc predictions 1 x1 resolution of chlorophyll a concentration were used to roughly evaluate potential changes of food availability on the east coast of the kerguelen island in future conditions scenario rcp 2 6 shows an average decrease of 10 of current food resources availability while scenario rcp 8 5 shows an average decrease of 20 fig d 3 as for temperature we defined rcp 2 6 with a linear increase of 1 1 c and 1 7 c for rcp 8 5 models were launched for a period of 30 years 3 results 3 1 the individual based model variations in energy allocated to the reserve and the maturation buffer are the main controls of individual development monthly variations ue and ur x here stands for d x d t were simulated over one year under present day environmental conditions fig 4 energy in the reserve fig 4a shows variations between 2 5 and 8 on average no unit with maximum range values reaching 5 8 and 13 7 this shows a relative constant energy density inside the reserve throughout the year with however a noticeable increase from october to december and a sharp decrease from december to january fig 4a according to deb theory kooijman 2010 the more energy is stored inside the reserve through food assimilation the more it can be distributed to other compartments and the more energy can be assimilated into the reserve anew availability of food resources for a cordatusis the highest in december f 1 fig a 2 it is assimilated and stored as energy into the reserve based on the energy available in the reserve at the end of december energy is supplied in january to other compartments such as the reproduction buffer fig 4b and growth fig fa while the individual ingests the food available to replenish its reserve anew as food availability decreases in january f 0 748 the reserve loses energy fig 4a because the individual cannot assimilate as much energy as the amount transferred to other compartments the energy density entering the reproduction buffer fig 4b of mature females varies between 0 and 4 9 on average in the course of the year with a maximum of 10 7 the rate of energy input increases at an average pace of 1 1 per month from october to the onset of the reproduction period in march when it decreases and remains null until the end of the spawning period in june then energy starts accumulating again until the next reproduction period during the three months of the spawning period from march to may no energy is allocated from the reserve to the reproduction buffer and the energy stored in this buffer is progressively delivered to gametes only females that are mature in march undergo reproduction and deliver the energy contained in the reproductive buffer to the gametes females that become mature during the reproduction period undergo a normal increase of the energy in the reproduction buffer which explains the small increasing trend observed during the march may period fig 4b 3 2 the population model 3 2 1 modelled population dynamics at the calibration site based on the individual model population dynamics were simulated over a time period of 30 years showing a constant population density comprised between 120 and 220 individuals per square metre overall the population structure remains constant through time but with well marked yearly variations mainly in juvenile density fig 5 juveniles indeed represent around 83 of the total population density and show important yearly variations due to 1 important seasonal reproductive outputs causing a surge in population density 2 strong mortality rates causing gradual decreases in the population 3 the transfer of the large juvenile cohort to the adult population after around 3 years and 4 the influence of inter individual competition for food limiting population densities and even causing its decrease in contrast the adult population is much more stable relative to the juvenile one with lower density values around 40 individuals per square metre both juvenile and adult population fluctuations follow a general 6 year pattern displayed over the 30 years of simulations rectangle fig 5 this pattern is linked to temperature cycles over the same time span and includes two sharp decline in population density over a 6 year cycle t symbol fig 5 which corresponds to high temperatures rising above 8 c during two consecutive months and causing mortality rates of 10 of the entire population 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis different parameter settings for the model initiation may result in very diverging outputs appendix e it also influences model stability and population collapse in particular overall the initial number of individuals and the level of the inter individual variation coefficient are parameters that have little influence on model stability and low proportion of population crashes may result in addition model outputs do not differ significantly between simulations increase in juvenile and adult mortality levels will also have little influence on model outputs but decreasing mortality levels will induce a population burst followed by a strong competition for food and a consequent population collapse amongst all the parameters set at the model initialisation egg number and egg survival are the most important determining model stability as they directly control juvenile density high juvenile densities induced by a low background juvenile mortality and a high number of eggs and egg survival always result in fast population collapses as a result of high competition for food between individuals as population density increases the amount of food available for each individual decreases and individuals start starving to death in contrast a reduction in the number of juveniles causes a reduction in the average population density due to a strong mortality rate of juveniles it does not imply model instability and the proportion of modelled population crashes is always lower than 15 the reduction of population density also strongly influences the average amount of energy available for each individual the more energy is available the more individuals can grow in structural length 3 2 3 projections of the population dynamics model to other sites the dynamic population model built at anse du halage was implemented appendix g for the two sites of ile haute inside the morbihan bay and port couvreux outside the morbihan bay both models were simulated twice with initial estimates of 50 and 30 of food availability f compared to anse du halage fh temperature inputs were based on local temperature variations recorded at the two sites model outputs predict lower population densities at both sites compared to anse du halage and interestingly similar ratios between juveniles and adults table 4 these results are consistent with density values found in the literature which give between 100 and 136 individuals m2 at ile haute and 50 to 168 ind m2 at port couvreux mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 the different observed density values reported in publications for port couvreux may be due to contrasting conditions that locally prevail amongst the three small embayments of that locality poulin 1996 this has recently been confirmed by our personal observations in the field saucède 2020 model outputs suggest a strong influence of food availability on population densities controlled by inter individual competition for food accordingly simulations predict a drop in density values at port couvreux when food resources decrease at 30 of fh while density values are relatively stable at ile haute in comparison table 4a this mainly affects juvenile densities and results in a lower population ratio table 4b temperatures recorded at the two sites inside the morbihan bay anse du halage and ile haute are close to each other and slightly higher than outside the bay at port couvreux fig a 1 contrasting results were therefore expected between port couvreux and the two other sites on the contrary temperatures may not be contrasting enough between sites to affect population structure and density confidence intervals overlap between all sites for values of both population density and juveniles adults ratio table 4 3 2 4 population dynamics under future predictions of climate change population structure and density were simulated and implemented for scenarios of temperature and food resources changes based on ipcc scenarios rcp 2 6 and 8 5 and for populations of resistant intermediate and vulnerable organisms fig 6 population dynamics are all predicted to be affected by both scenarios fig 6d 6g with overall population densities predicted to be four to seven times lower than current population predictions population structures are also predicted to be affected by a lower contribution of juveniles to overall population densities the respective effects of temperature fig 6b and resource availability fig 6c were simulated independently under temperature change only fig 6b model predictions are close to model outputs in which both variables are combined fig 6g with a strong decrease in average population density compared to present day conditions fig 6a the effect of changes in resources availability only fig 6c is less marked with population densities showing a close pattern to present day models fig 6a models therefore predict a stronger effect of temperature changes on populations with population densities of vulnerable organisms predicted as very low less than one tenth of present day densities on average populations of vulnerable organisms are even predicted to go extinct in only 30 years of simulation fig 6f 6i populations of organisms with intermediate sensitivity fig 6e 6h are more resilient and withstand over 30 years of simulation in some cases but they collapse at the end of the period under ipcc scenario rcp 8 5 overall densities are very low around 20 or less individuals per square metre on average 3 3 population mortality under present day and future predictions under present day conditions fig 7 b background mortality and ageing are the main causes that affect population mortality each year respectively 65 to 90 and 5 8 to 9 high temperatures and starvation have sporadic effects on mortality high mortality due to high temperatures only happened in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and starvation contributes at the highest to 10 of overall mortality depending on the year over the course of a year fig 7a background mortality and ageing affect the population every month while high temperatures over 8 c cause the death of half of the population in march and april starvation is responsible for the death of a weak proportion of the population in november and december only austral summer in link with the competition for food resources of the increasing population during this productive and warm period under both future scenarios fig 7e 7f mortality levels are low compared to present day model fig 7b which is mostly due to small predicted population densities background and ageing mortalities are therefore very low starvation is not a cause of mortality anymore while high temperatures cause mortality of individuals before they may starve to death when comparing between model predictions under scenario rcp 8 5 for changes in food availability only fig 7c temperature change only fig 7d and the combined variables fig 7f temperature clearly appears as the main cause of mortality at the same level as background mortality 4 discussion 4 1 potential and limitations of the deb ibm approach in the present work a deb ibm model was built for a cordatus based on our current knowledge of this vulnerable endemic species of the kerguelen plateau on site monitoring and experiments on species tolerance to changing environmental conditions remains challenging issues in the kerguelen islands and in the southern ocean in general difficulties are owed to the sensitivity of specimens magniez 1983 schatt 1985 mespoulhé 1992 and the inherent ecological characteristics models can constitute a powerful tool for antarctic research as they can provide additional support to experimental knowledge and infer the impact of broad scale climate change on populations the potential of the present mechanistic modelling approach resides in its capacity to model the physiology of organisms as a response to environmental factors using deb models for the representation of individual components within the ibm enables to upscale a dynamic model to an entire population railsback and grimm 2019 as a function of two changing abiotic factors temperature and food resources applying such a model to a sub antarctic benthic and brooding species is challenging and had never been performed so far the present work shows the feasibility and relevance of the deb ibm approach to study southern ocean species like a cordatus relevant results were obtained both at the individual and populations levels first simulations showed the characteristic annual evolution of energy dynamics in the organism fig 4 appendix f and second population structure and density dynamics were modelled over an extended period of time decoupling juvenile and adult populations table 4 fig 6 fig 7 projections to other sites also show the potential application of the model to other areas for which environmental data are available future models give an insight and add some clues to assess the potential impact of climate change and predict the biotic response of populations models however still need some improvements including complementary data on species ecophysiology the model was also shown to be sensitive to mortality rates and some parameters egg number and egg survival settings while some population characteristics initial population densities and inter individual variability have little effects appendix e 4 2 limitations to the deb individual model the dynamic population model built in this work uses outputs from the deb model developed for a cordatus guillaumot 2019 which allows to represent as faithfully as possible the physiological dynamics of individuals during their entire life cycle the goodness of fit of the deb model shows that estimated parameters accurately described observed data however collecting additional data at the different stages of the organism s life cycle and under different conditions of temperature and food availability would contribute to improving further model accuracy and parameter predictions in particular data on environmental settings and species ecophysiology are still needed to improve the accuracy and relevance of the following parameters 4 2 1 the arrhenius function and the optimal temperature range in deb theory the arrhenius function determines the optimal temperature range of the organism s metabolism as a response to enzymatic tolerance kooijman 2010 thomas and bacher 2018 in the present work calculation of the arrhenius function relies on fragmental datasets the ascending part of the arrhenius curve that is the temperature range in which faster metabolic rates are determined by higher temperatures was estimated but values are still missing for the descending slope i e the temperature range beyond the optimal temperatures in which the metabolic rates slow down with higher temperatures kooijman 2010 the present model assumes that higher temperatures favour more suitable conditions with no limit appendix f which has to be corrected arbitrarily using our personal field and experimental observations on the echinoid ecology fig d 2 further experiments should help improve the calculation of the arrhenius function they would consist in measurements of respiratory rates as a function of temperature variations e g uthicke et al 2014 and will enable more accurate simulations of a cordatus ecophysiology and the direct effect of temperature on the organism s metabolism a prerequisite to better model population mortality 4 2 2 age size and growth estimates most parameters used in the deb model were taken from the literature and experimental studies except for some of them that were assumed based on physiological traits of counterparts in particular organisms maximum age growth rate and size are not sufficiently known due to difficulties in setting up long term experiments in the kerguelen islands the relationship between echinoid growth size and shape cannot be assessed based on growth lines measurement because there is no linear relationship between echinoid size and age ebert 1975 and because resorption may occur during periods of starvation brockington et al 2001 ingels et al 2012 the most reliable method would consist in monitoring organisms growth through time using tagging methods ebert 2013 however such an approach is time consuming and challenging as even small measurement errors may have a significant effect on results ebert 2013 and no experimental data are available so far former studies mespoulhé 1992 showed that after 4 to 5 years specimens of a cordatus only slowly increase in size and echinoids test tend to become distorted a common feature in large spatangoid echinoids in which test plates tend to overlap while body size does not increase anymore mespoulhé 1992 however this slow growth rate in aged specimens could also result from other causes affecting optimal food intake for instance at the calibration site of anse du halage a study of echinoid cohorts suggests that few individuals grow older than six years old poulin and féral 1994 overall the absence or nearly absence of growth in old invertebrate organisms makes age estimates delicate to assess in the present model based on the combination of the ageing sub model and other mortality processes most individuals are calibrated to die within the assumed maximum age before 6 years old although some individuals may reach over ten years old due to the chosen stochasticity introduced in the sub model juveniles inside brood pouches were assumed to grow at a constant and same rate as adults but it has sometimes been assumed that the brooded young may already feed and develop at a faster rate schatt 1985 schatt and féral 1996 at this stage the offspring is particularly fragile and needs protection in the brood pouches to survive which prevents any monitoring of growth rates and feeding behaviours magniez 1983 schatt 1985 mespoulhé 1992 4 3 ecological relevance of the ibm population model upscaling the deb individual model to the population level in the ibm enables to simulate population structure and dynamics as a response to temperature and food resource availability in particular the ibm enables to predict the targetted effect of environmental changes on the population at the different life stages of individuals additional environmental data would help enhance ibm reliability and improve our knowledge of populations and environmental conditions in remote areas field works are also subject to uncertainties due to the species burrowing habit which renders the assessment of population structure difficult the brittleness of specimens also limiting counting replicates magniez 1980 mespoulhé 1992 important variations in population densities were noted across studies guille and lasserre 1979 mespoulhé 1992 poulin 1996 personal observations for a same site which may suggest either important variations in population density and structure through time which was however refuted by poulin and féral 1994 or important biases in sampling due to the aggregative behaviour of individuals and the patchiness of distribution patterns poulin 1996 the sensitivity analysis appendix e showed that the model is not very much dependant on assumptions made on initial population densities because the model density dependant regulation operates through intra specific competition for food resources only there is no agonistic behaviour amongst conspecific individuals as it was reported in other echinoid species e g echinometra sp shulman 1990 and there is no evidence of competition for space in a cordatus based on field observation intra specific competition in shallow water echinoids is a common phenomenon under food limited conditions stevenson mitchell and davies 2015 mcclanahan and kurtis 1991 stated that in echinometra mathaei when predation pressure and intra specific competition are low populations increase without limitation and regulation operates through a decrease in food availability for individuals the same could hold true for a cordatus as well intra specific competition for oxygen could also have a regulatory effect ferguson et al 2013 since a cordatus shows a high oxygen consumption rate guille and lasserre 1979 magniez and féral 1988 in muddy substrates specimens are usually observed unburied positioned onto the sediment instead of underneath which was often interpreted as a result of difficulties to breath inside fine sediments the sensitivity analysis also showed that the number of eggs produced by females is a controlling parameter of model stability as well there is a high variability in the number of eggs produced amongst females from 9 to 106 eggs per female personal communication from p magniez taking into account such a variability would introduce an enhanced stochasticity in the population dynamics model if implemented and linked to each female s reproductive buffer ur and gsi values martin et al 2010 e g for zebrafish in beaudouin et al 2015 finally the model was also shown to be sensitive to background mortality appendix e although monitoring mortality rates in the field is challenging such data would greatly enhance the reliability of the ibm in general the sensitivity tests showed that the model works with the current quality and quantity of data available for this species in this habitat however on the matter of the temporal resolution our model needs to be expanded and further consolidated and we consider this element as a limitation to our work in its current state appendix c 4 3 1 modelled food resources the organic content of sediments is one of the main food resources for detritus feeders and sediment swallowers like a cordatus snelgrove and butman 1994 and antarctic echinoids michel et al 2016 in the present model the organic carbon content of sediments was used as a proxy for food availability for a cordatus intra specific competition for food has a stronger effect on resources availability than seasonal variations in resource availability this is in line with ecological evidences that populations of a cordatus survive periods of low food resources that prevail during the austral winter high seasonality in food resources is a common feature of polar ecosystems and species have long adapted their diet accordingly de ridder and lawrence 1982 michel et al 2016 this has been shown in antarctic benthic invertebrates such as shallow water brachiopods peck et al 2005 cnidarians orejas et al 2001 and echinoids brockington et al 2001 ingels et al 2012 for instance the antarctic sea urchin sterechinus neumayeri is believed to be capable of mobilizing energy from gut tissues gonads and the body wall during the austral winter brockington et al 2001 a strategy that may have been evolved in a cordatus as well magniez 1983 shrinking and resorption which are sometimes hypothesized as a survival mechanism in other echinoids facing long periods of starvation are phenomena which are still understudied david and néraudeau 1989 ebert 2013 and have not been verified in a cordatus in the present model starvation results in the redirection of the energy flow exclusively toward maintenance of structure at the expense of other compartments although magniez 1983 observed a decrease in gonadal material after the reproduction period it is very small in females 0 3 and slightly bigger in males 1 6 and the exact cause has not been studied it is not known whether this decrease in gonadal material can be directly attributed to a reabsorption for survival purposes or some other mechanism the use of previously stored energy in the different compartments to sustain the maintenance of structure is assumed to be non existent in our model such starvation processes could be tested in future implementation provided sufficient data is obtained through experimental setups observing the phenomenon the two scenarios of future food availability were based on coarse ipcc and noaa projection models for the region these simulations and associated outputs are here considered as conceivable scenarios of the influence of food and temperature changes on population dynamics they are used as a proof of concept and are by no means considered as definite and reliable scenarios of population dynamics in the future future accurate predictions should imply the integration of complex mechanisms influencing the production transport and deposition of organic matter in the ocean the possibility of species to adapt to changing environmental conditions and more experimental data are needed to integrate the detailed influence of temperature on physiological processes first observations suggest a low response toward the applied changes in food availability in comparison with the influence of temperature however it cannot be concluded that the species would not be affected by future conditions in food resources in the area 4 3 2 temperature resilience important differences were obtained between population structures and densities depending on future scenarios and model projections made for contrasting food resources and temperature most importantly the resistant population model of a cordatus at anse du halage is predicted to sustain the expected changes in temperature and food resources under both future scenarios although population density is also predicted to be strongly reduced in contrast the vulnerable population model predicts population extinction after a few decades of simulation this implies that a precise evaluation of the species resilience to temperatures is needed for more robust and decisive models moreover antarctic echinoids were shown to present varied responses to ocean warming depending on species and life stages with higher vulnerability to warm temperatures in juveniles than in adults ingels et al 2012 such a contrast suggests that more data could help fine tune the present model 4 4 relevance of the deb ibm approach for southern ocean studies deb ibm models are being developed for various applications and research fields they are considered a powerful tool for environmental risk assessment such as the effect of toxicity e g beaudouin et al 2015 david et al 2019 vlaeminck et al 2019 and the impact of environmental changes on population dynamics e g malishev et al 2018 saraiva et al 2014 thomas and bacher 2018 goedegebuure et al 2018 they can also be used to predict the behaviour of microbial systems jayathilake et al 2017 or bring to light underlying mechanisms of life history strategies e g gatti petitgas and huret 2017 the deb model brings ontogenetic and phenotypic variations to the population model while the ibm brings stochasticity population dynamics e g competition for food as well as learning and interaction mechanisms deangelis et al 1991 martin et al 2012 to complement the model the potential of the deb ibm approach resides in the combination of both models to predict population dynamics as a response to changing environmental conditions i e at the individual level in the deb model and at population level in the ibm in the present work the deb ibm was used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of a cordatus populations applications could be further developed to address conservation issues such as the designation of priority areas and the definition of management plan strategies vast areas of the french southern territories have recently been placed under enhanced protection of a national nature reserve based on experts knowledge and ecoregionalisation approaches koubbi et al 2010 fabri ruiz et al 2020 most areas however could not have benefited from thorough benthic field studies and ecological models can represent interesting tools to assess the relevance of defined protection areas for target species and ecosystems such models can be useful when drafting management plan strategies for determining favored ship traffic routes or areas where human activities can be implemented in coastal areas of the national nature reserve of the french southern territories dynamic population models allow testing different ecological scenarios in a quite straightforward way to illustrate research designs and proposals they can provide some clues to investigate the potential effect of environmental changes on key species for which conservation efforts should be directed in a short to long term strategy fulton et al 2015 dynamic models can also prove useful for adaptable conservation strategies like the designation of dynamic protected areas as a consequence of changing environments and ecosystems finally dynamic models could be further

24681,sustainable pest control strategies hinge on the knowledge of movement ecology within the agricultural landscape where contrasted habitat qualities intermingle thereby influencing arthropod dispersal hence habitat manipulation in space and time can be a lever for action to control pests with regard to landscape compositional constraints in this study we examined the role of grassland arrangements in field colonisation by soil dwelling pests within a dynamic agricultural landscape and discussed the implications for pest management with a focus on wireworms for this purpose we proposed a framework combining i a spatially explicit and mechanistic model describing the pest population dynamics in both aerial and soil compartments involved along its life cycle and ii spatiotemporal representations of various landscape contexts we addressed the role of grassland in plot history in plot neighbourhood or in both history and neighbourhood our results show that species with a short life cycle are more responsive to changes in land use and that the neighbourhood effect strongly relies on dispersal mechanisms random vs directed movements we also highlight how the arrangement of grassy landscape elements in space and time can mitigate crop infestation by soil dwelling pests thereby emphasizing the relevance of managing grassland regimes once informed by critical pest life traits our approach opens avenue for the exploration of the spatiotemporal land use manipulation meant for pest management future research consists in the exploration of suppressive patterns in simplified but realistic agricultural landscapes generated under agronomic constraints at the farm or landscape scales keywords pest control population dynamics landscape dynamics reservoir sink connectivity reaction diffusion advection model land use change wireworm click beetle 1 introduction targeting a sustainable crop protection freed from its reliance on pesticides requires a better understanding of field colonisation processes driving pest population dynamics looking for environmental friendly strategies for pest control reemphasizes the importance of movement ecology indeed insect pest habitats are fragmented rendering dispersal a key process determining pest population dynamics at the agricultural landscape scale this suggests that agricultural landscape is a relevant scale for designing pest resilient agroecosystems that minimise the use of pesticides bourhis et al 2017 bourhis et al 2015 tscharntke and brandl 2004 such a pest control approach should account for processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales thereby requiring an extensive knowledge about pest ecology the survival of species hinges on their ability to detect and reach suitable resources when necessary in their life cycle dunning et al 1992 vasseur et al 2013 interestingly a few studies have suggested that some insects effectively move between asynchronous land uses depending on resource availability aviron et al 2018 bressan et al 2010 men et al 2004 habitat connectivity in space and time martensen et al 2017 moilanen and hanski 2001 taylor et al 1993 is thus a pivotal driver of pest dispersal success in dynamic agricultural landscapes consequently the spatial and temporal arrangement of land uses can be a lever for action to control species abundances with regard to landscape compositional constraints fischer and lindenmayer 2007 jonsson et al 2010 parisey et al 2016 polasky et al 2008 roques and hamel 2007 with and king 2001 in that elateridae can be considered as relevant model organisms blackshaw et al 2017 wireworms the larvae of click beetles coleoptera elateridae of which there are more than 10 000 species in about 400 genera known worldwide are amongst the most notorious soil dwelling pests balachowsky and mesnil 1935 miles 1942 traugott et al 2015 elaterid pest species are capable of exploiting both cultivated and uncultivated areas in the agricultural mosaic milosavljević et al 2016 consequently understanding their movement from sources that sustain important populations i e uncultivated areas to vulnerable crops is central in the development of pest management strategies the larvae undergo a number of instars and the complete elaterid life cycle varies between two to five years balachowsky and mesnil 1935 furlan 1998 miles 1942 sufyan et al 2013 in europe agriotes spp are the most harmful species they attack the roots and tubers of a wide range of crops thereby inflicting severe economic damage in potatoes maize and vegetable production and may even threaten perennial crops such as soft fruits or orchards traugott et al 2015 though scarce and fragmented knowledge regarding the biology and the ecology of agriotes spp indicates that uncropped field margins and areas are the most favourable habitat for wireworms and act as reservoirs from which they disperse into adjacent crops blackshaw et al 2017 based on correlative approaches some studies have attempted to unravel relationships between larvae or adult abundances or densities and landscape features benefer et al 2012 blackshaw and vernon 2006 l furlan et al 2017a hermann et al 2013 kozina et al 2015 poggi et al 2018a saussure et al 2015 altogether these studies shed light on the potential for a dynamic landscape to shape wireworm populations however while providing insights of the main factors responsible for wireworm or click beetle density levels such approaches fail in describing the mechanisms driving pest colonisation and subsequently in elucidating the source sink ecological processes that operate at the landscape scale the main objective of our study was to examine the role of grasslands in field colonisation by soil dwelling pests within a dynamic agricultural landscape and discuss its implications for pest management with a focus on wireworms for this purpose we first developed a spatially explicit and mechanistic model describing the pest population dynamics in both aerial and soil compartments involved along its life cycle larvae and adult mortality larval development oviposition and adult movements diffusion and advection were the main processes considered model parameterisation stems from an extensive review of the literature dealing with the biology and ecology of wireworms then landscape elements comprising grasslands and vulnerable habitats cropped fields were characterised by their carrying capacity combining these two framework components we investigated the interplay of landscape spatiotemporal dynamics considering grasslands as pest sources and of species specific traits e g life cycle duration on field infestation levels as illustrated by the conceptual diagram fig 1 we also highlighted how the balance between diffusion and advection movements drives the population flows on both sides of the boundaries between grassland and field crops finally we demonstrated that spatiotemporal connectivity between grasslands significantly affects the pest infestation levels within crops providing new insights into the role of grasslands in pest infestation in a dynamic agricultural mosaic our findings bring an original contribution to the search for innovative landscape scale strategies for pest management 2 material and methods 2 1 population dynamics model insect pests considered in this study cause crop damage during larval development in soil but disperse as adults by walk and flight both the aboveground and the belowground compartments were explicitly considered the population dynamics was derived along two spatial dimensions x x y through a set of reaction advection diffusion equations modelling the following biological and ecological mechanisms the emergence of adults from mature larvae the adult random and directed motions the oviposition the adult mortality the larval development and the larval density dependant mortality briefly adults oviposit at a constant rate π thereby increasing the belowground population that ages at a constant velocity c undergoing a density dependant mortality wireworms reaching the critical age mc emerge as adults that disperse across the landscape to find resources and suitable habitat the model can be formalised as a system of partial differential equations for t 0 and 0 m mc t a x t τ t b x t m c d δ x a x t u x t x a x t μ a a x t 1 t b x t m c m b x t m μ b b x t k x t β b x t m 2 with the dynamical boundary conditions w r t the maturation variable t b x t 0 π a x t μ b b x t k x t β b x t 0 3 t b x t m c c m b x t m c τ t b x t m c μ b b x t k x t β b x t m c 4 here b x t 0 m c b x t m d m represents the total belowground population δ x x 2 y 2 is the laplace operator diffusion over x x x y and m are the advection operators over x and m the maturity dimension where x y m denote the partial derivatives with respect to x y and m model parameters and their meaning are described in table 1 model interpretation is fully presented in the following paragraphs the state variables a and b respectively denote the density of click beetles aboveground and the density of wireworms in soil actually b encapsulates all belowground development stages larval instars pupae and is referred to as wireworms thereafter for the sake of simplification the dynamical condition at m 0 eq 3 reflects both the oviposition and the growth of individuals who did not start to mature while the condition in m m c eq 4 takes into account the accumulation of individuals in the last class of maturation before emergence as initial conditions the aboveground population was set to zero and the age distribution of larvae was obtained from a preliminary model simulation run over 15 years on a homogeneous landscape the model was solved using operator splitting press et al 2007 chapter 20 3 3 alternating direction implicit method solves the diffusion press et al 2007 chapter 20 3 2 while a forward euler scheme is used for the reaction terms and an upwind scheme for the advection terms press et al 2007 chapter 20 1 we considered the spatial domain under study as a closed system i e equal inflowing and outflowing pest populations thereby applying neumann reflecting boundary conditions at the edges of the spatial domain all developments were made with the r programming language r core team 2018 2 1 1 adult emergence and motions click beetles emerge during spring in accordance we defined their emergence rate as a time dependeent function τ t cf 2 2 and suppl material 1 in eq 1 as recent findings suggested that wireworms do not move from field to field schallhart et al 2011 we considered that only adults contribute to the spatial redistribution of populations we assumed that adult motions included two components a random component expressed through the diffusion term in eq 1 involving d the homogeneous diffusion coefficient and a directed component expressed through the advection term in eq 1 and involving u the advection velocity regarding the latter component we assumed that click beetles move across the landscape based on the habitat quality they perceive in their neighbourhood we defined the local habitat quality h x t as a function of local carrying capacities k x t 5 h x t k x t k m i n k m a x k m i n where kmax resp kmin refers to the most favourable resp unfavourable habitat for wireworms as did bourhis et al 2017 we derived the perception of the landscape habitat quality noted h p x t from a convolution of a perception kernel linear inverse distance weighting filter with the mapping of local habitat quality 6 h p x t x i ϵ ω x x i γ 1 x x i γ h x i t d x i x i ϵ ω x x i γ 1 x x i γ d x i with ω the whole spatial domain and γ the distance beyond which habitat quality is no longer perceived by click beetles finally the advection velocity 7 u x t v m a x x h p x t m a x x h p x t reaches its maximum speed vmax where the gradient of the potential function h p x t is maximum 2 1 2 oviposition although the oviposition rate may vary amongst habitats brian 1947 it was assumed here independent of space i e land use and associated carrying capacity and constant over the whole duration of the adult life new borns fall within the belowground population with age 0 eq 3 2 1 3 adult mortality a constant mortality rate μ a was applied to the aboveground compartment of the model 2 1 4 larval development the belowground population distributes along an ageing axis the population ages according to a constant coefficient c when reaching the critical maturity m c larvae can emerge as click beetles 2 1 5 larval mortality uncultivated areas such as grasslands or grassy strips are acknowledged as favourable habitats for both adults and larvae of click beetles brian 1947 miles 1942 providing sufficient food and humid conditions roebuck et al 1947 therefore wireworm populations thrive in these areas on the contrary wireworm populations reach much lower infestation levels in cropped fields where they nevertheless damage vulnerable crops miles 1942 in our model we assumed that the carrying capacity k x t is a proxy for habitat quality and that larval mortality relies on a constant component μ b weighted by a density dependent factor while the constant component provides a stationary annual dynamics within the landscape the density dependent term ensures that the population dynamics is centred on the carrying capacity the exponent β controls the dynamics inertia i e the speed at which the local population converges towards the local carrying capacity for the sake of simplicity larval mortality was independent of the age note that the reaction term departs from the canonical logistic growth model as the density dependence applies on larval mortality only rather than on larval population growth rate which also depends on adult oviposition rate emphasising that population is limited by larval competition for food rather than by adult competition for oviposition sites 2 2 model parameterisation 2 2 1 land use dependent carrying capacities k g and k c we considered two types of land use grasslands known as favourable habitats furlan 2004 parker and howard 2001 and cropped fields regarding grasslands we set the carrying capacity k g to 2000 individuals per square metre thereafter ind m² based on field studies carried out before the common access to chemical pesticides roebuck et al 1947 ross et al 1947 salt and hollick 1944 based on a thorough study of two pastures at least 10 year old and regularly cut for hay salt and hollick 1944 estimated densities about 850 and 2000 ind m² locally they even observed densities reaching 6000 ind m² in both pastures within other pastures less intensively sampled they found about 2500 ind m² on average roebuck et al 1947 studied intensively the infestation level of an old meadow and determined a density of about 300 ind m² by the hand sorting method following salt and hollick 1944 who consider that this method underestimates densities by two thirds the actual infestation could be of about 1000 ind m² ross et al 1947 studied six permanent pastures grazed and regularly hayed and assessed a density of about 1000 ind m² in cropped fields we set the carrying capacity k c to 120 ind m² i e about one order of magnitude smaller than k g and fairly close to values indicated by roebuck 1924 indeed roebuck 1924 studied the decline of wireworm populations in newly set up crop fields with repeated ploughing and found average population density of 102 80 56 and 32 ind m² the 1rst 2nd 3rd and 4rth year after ploughing from grass respectively 2 2 2 belowground population maturation c wireworm species differ greatly from one another in their biology and ecology furlan 2005 ritter and richter 2013 in particular as regards the duration of their biological cycle in france four species from the genus agriotes are responsible for most economical crop damage amongst them a lineatus a obscurus and a sputator predominantly present in the northern regions exhibit a long life cycle duration of larval stage of about 4 years whereas a sordidus mainly found in south western regions exhibits a short life cycle duration of larval stage of about 2 years in our study we set the duration of the larval stage c 1 at 2 years for short life cycle species and at 4 years for long life cycle species 2 2 3 emergence rate studies relative to the date of emergence of agriotes click beetles are fairly consistent for instance in austria landl et al 2010 observed that the emergence of a lineatus began at the end of april which is concordant with the observations of other authors from eastern europe and from western canada vernon et al 2001 regarding a ustulatus a lineatus and a obscurus parker and howard 2001 in united kingdom reported emergences starting at mid april and adults being captured until mid july hence they probably emerged until mid june while in germany sufyan et al 2007 observed that the swarming period lasted from late april to the end of august for a lineatus and a obscurus although most authors reported two periods of adult activity one main in may and one weaker in june july landl et al 2010 sufyan et al 2007 we simply modelled adult emergence as a continuous process spanning over a period governed by the cumulative degree days see supplementary material 1 in our study the emergence of click beetles spans from late april to the beginning of june with a peak of emergence located towards the middle of the period of emergence i e mid may over this period all wireworms at the critical age have emerged see supplementary material 1 fig a1b 2 2 4 belowground mortality μ b β two main model parameters govern the larval mortality namely the mortality rate μb and the inertia exponent β the mortality rate was determined by means of a preliminary optimisation procedure before each simulation given all other parameter values such that larval density oscillated yearly around the carrying capacity in any homogeneous landscape β was estimated empirically to 0 2 from infestation data collected in arable lands by roebuck 1924 over 8 years as shown in a sensitivity analysis see supplementary material 2 despite scarce knowledge on this parameter β it has a significant effect on the model output and its estimation would probably deserve further attention 2 2 5 adult dispersion d vmax literature provides a limited amount of information regarding click beetle dispersal in particular diffusion and advection processes can seldom be disentangled brian 1947 observed that a obscurus and a lineatus but not a sputator frequently flew in a glass cage experiment crozier et al 2003 reported that these species can be strong fliers able to perform mass flights travelling approximately 5 to 10 km h for distances ranging from less than 1 m to 100 m on one occasion and with an average flight covering 2 to 3 m more recently blackshaw and hicks 2013 concluded that agriotes spp disperse widely and may originate from adjacent fields many studies have attempted to provide quantitative estimates of click beetle dispersal capacity generally using mark recapture experiments with pheromone traps blackshaw et al 2017 recaptured individuals a lineatus a obscurus a sputator at 1 m from release point after 1 h and at 30 m after 19 h schallhart et al 2009 studied the isotopic signature of a obscurus beetles captured in pheromone traps located in a grassland adjacent to a maize field 13 of individuals captured 80 m inside the grassland plot had a signature characteristic of their maize field origin based on this knowledge we set the diffusion coefficient to 72 m² day hence producing a mean dispersion radius of 15 m in one day 21 m in two days etc shigesada and kawasaki 1997 page 38 the advection speed was set to 10 m day 2 2 6 perceptual range γ we assumed that adult click beetles could perform directed motions as responses to distant stimuli e g olfactory stimuli advection processes may result from foraging for food or laying sites from searching for a sexual partner etc in our model we described advection at the population level as a tendency to move along a gradient of increasing habitat quality expressed in terms of carrying capacities in particular as wireworms thrive in grasslands we expect adult click beetles to disperse preferentially towards nearby grassy areas we set the perceptual range i e the distance beyond which habitat quality is no longer perceived by click beetles to 10 m this estimated value mainly stems from studies dealing with pheromone attractiveness for click beetles since it is the only advection process for which literature provides some guidance sufyan et al 2007 assessed the range of attractiveness of pheromone traps for both species a lineatus and a obscurus through a mark recapture experiment they recaptured 60 and 10 of beetles in pheromone traps placed at 2 and 60 m from their release point respectively in a later experiment sufyan et al 2011 estimated the maximum distance of perception of a pheromone trap to be around 15 20 m blackshaw et al 2018 studied the attractive range of traps baited with a obscurus pheromone to male beetles in both still air and wind conditions they found that the attraction distance was less than 5 m in still air but increased with airflow 2 2 7 aboveground population mortality μa adult life expectancy varies amongst studies brian 1947 observed that longevity of a obscurus on various crops ranged from 69 to 84 days for females and from 45 to 75 days for males regarding a ustulatus hinkin 1983 reported an average longevity of 28 days for females and 19 days for males while furlan 1996 measured an adult lifespan of 24 sd 5 days for females more recently hicks and blackshaw 2008 as well as blackshaw et al 2017 performed mark release experiments on click beetles they showed respectively that adults males and females combined can survive for at least 45 and 25 days accordingly in our model based on these elements and in accordance with our own field observations we set the adult average lifespan to 25 days for both sexes 2 2 8 oviposition rate π most authors have studied oviposition under laboratory conditions brian 1947 found an average fecundity ranging from 30 to 150 a obscurus depending on the crop flax potato and wheat were associated with low fecundity while grasslands of lolium festuca and agrostis were associated with high fecundity miles and cohen 1941 cohen 1942 and furlan 1996 reported an average number of eggs laid per female of 109 in a obscurus min 78 max 186 103 in a obscurus and 78 in a ustulatus sd 27 9 min 52 max 140 accordingly we considered fecundity to be of 80 eggs per female over its lifespan 25 days as mentioned in the previous paragraph considering that sex ratio tends towards 1 1 blackshaw et al 2017 furlan 1996 the oviposition rate was set to 80 2 25 1 6 eggs per capita per day 2 3 landscape contexts we defined four landscape contexts fig 2 and fig 3 to investigate the processes driving the colonisation of vulnerable habitats cropped fields characterised by a habitat quality lower than the one associated with grasslands favourable habitats the first three contexts are shown in fig 2 a homogeneous cropped field cultivated over 2 years fig 2a a grassland in the field history fig 2b or in the neighbourhood of the cropped field fig 2c finally fig 3 describes the fourth context where we compared two dynamic landscapes ω1 and ω2 exhibiting the same duration of land use over time landscape composition but through contrasted spatial configurations 3 results 3 1 population dynamics in a homogeneous landscape context fig 4 shows the dynamics of above and belowground populations in the simple case of a homogeneous landscape fig 2a comprising vulnerable cropped fields only simulation starts in winter with a null aboveground population and a larval density at equilibrium hence 120 individuals per square metre until the emergence of adults the only process at stake is larval mortality which reduces the belowground population to about 90 individuals per square metre adults emerge in early spring producing an increase in the aboveground population density with a peak value determined by i the density of mature larvae at the onset of the emergence period ii climate and iii adult life expectancy it is followed by a decrease resulting from the constant mortality rate μa about 65 days after the last emergence the aboveground population becomes extinct this pattern repeats over the years after adults have emerged they disperse and lay eggs thus refilling the belowground population compartment that increases reaches a maximum at the end of the oviposition period and then decreases due to larval mortality after a few years a stationary pattern occurs 3 2 wireworm dynamics with grassland in field history the effect of a grassland in field history fig 2b on the wireworm population density is illustrated on fig 5 for two pest life cycle durations 2 years short life cycle and 4 years long life cycle both dynamics exhibit the periodic behaviour described in the previous section 3 1 at time 0 the field is converted to grassland which translates into an important rise in habitat quality resulting in a subsequent wireworm population increase in fig 5 we compare the dynamics of a short life cycle population and a long life cycle population the amplitudes of intra annual oscillations are more important for the former on one hand the proportion of the belowground population that emerges as adults is larger in the case of a short life cycle about half the population emerges each year than in that of a long life cycle about a quarter emerges each year given that oviposition rate is independent from life cycle duration in our model the increase in wireworm density is greater for short cycle species on the other hand once the aboveground population has vanished high larval density results in a strong mortality until the next laying period in summary short life cycle wireworms react more promptly to changes in habitat quality thereby leading to higher infestation levels in temporary grasslands conversely after grassland conversion into crop wireworm density reaches more quickly the new current carrying capacity kc in the case of short cycle species note that these conclusions stem from our model hypotheses where a difference in life cycle duration results in different mortality rates land use carrying capacities and oviposition rates being unchanged 3 3 wireworm dynamics in a field with a newly set up grassland in its neighbourhood we simulated the effect of the conversion of half of a crop field into permanent grassland fig 2c fig 6 shows the wireworm density along a direction orthogonal to the grassland crop field border 40 m on both sides over a period of 10 years and for a range of values of the diffusion coefficient d the maximal advection speed vmax and the perceptual range γ diffusion tends to homogenise wireworm densities in space while advection entails population movements from low towards high carrying capacity places in fig 6a only diffusion applies wireworm densities increase from kc 120 ind m² towards kg 2000 ind m² along the 10 years on the side covered with grassland adult click beetle diffusion results in an increase in wireworm density in the adjacent cropped field with an intensity that vanishes away from the ecotone in the next six panels figs 6b g diffusion and advection have antagonistic effects advection fosters population displacements from low towards high quality habitat whereas diffusion promotes a homogenisation of the densities during the transient period before reaching equilibrium density in the grassland the set up of a grassland can have opposite effects on wireworm density in crop depending on the advection strength figs 6b d indeed a high maximal advection speed vmax results in a reduction of wireworm density inside the cropped field due to advection effect exceeding diffusion effect for low maximal advection speed the opposite occurs thus 5 years after grassland set up wireworm density can be greater fig 6b similar fig 6c or lower fig 6d than the initial density in the crop changes in perceptual range have similar effects than changes in maximal advection speed figs 6b g a mechanistic effect of the population redistribution must be noted here unlike advection diffusion is an inherently density dependant process as population increases within the grassland so does the diffusion intensity mechanically the neighbourhood effect of grassland is therefore changing throughout the season as diffusion takes more control over the redistribution 3 4 effect of spatiotemporal distribution of grasslands on wireworm densities we considered two dynamic landscape contexts ω1 and ω2 spanning over four years fig 3 landscape composition over time i e the proportions of cropped field and grassland over the duration of the virtual experiment remains unchanged while spatial configurations differ the land cover within plot a is identical over the years in ω1 and ω2 however the mean wireworm densities differ all along the four year period final densities deviate by 10 indeed in ω1 wireworm density increases in plot b the first two years due to a favourable habitat grassland subsequently when plot a turns into grassland whereas plot b switches to cropped field both advection and diffusion induce aboveground population movements from plot b to plot a resulting in a meaningful wireworm increase once oviposition has been completed that combines with the expansion of wireworm density due to the high carrying capacity associated with grassland in ω2 simultaneous evolution of densities in plots a and b do not favour any population flows 4 discussion 4 1 model relevance and novelty insect pests inflict severe damage to agricultural crops in spite of the intense use of agrochemical inputs in fragmented and changing environment as most agricultural landscapes are the movement of insect pests has a strong influence on their abundance and spatiotemporal distribution hence the extent of the inflicted crop damage mazzi and dorn 2012 thus understanding dispersal mechanisms may help design effective pest management strategies here we developed a spatially explicit mechanistic model to describe the population dynamics of insect pests inflicting crop damage while developing in soil and spreading across the landscape as adults we accounted for both aboveground and belowground population dynamics to date few studies have considered the link between both compartments though many species of ecological and economic importance have both above and belowground life cycle stages benefer et al 2012 therefore our developments could serve in investigations dealing with a wide variety of soil dwelling insect pests combined with spatial representations of dynamic landscape contexts our population dynamics model enables the investigation of the spatial redistribution of populations over time given the spatial distribution of habitat quality and species life history traits dispersal ability life cycle duration etc we thus provide an appropriate framework to study how the arrangement of grassy landscape elements in space and time can mitigate crop infestation by soil dwelling pests 4 2 the dynamics of grassland as reservoirs or sources of pests in our results we highlight 3 2 the influence of the legacy of previous land uses on the current wireworm infestation level this is well documented in plant sciences e g regarding soil suppressiveness bailey et al 2009 postma et al 2010 effects of biofumigation matthiessen and kirkegaard 2006 etc here we show that given its habitat favourability the presence of a grassland in plot history entails the build up of wireworm populations and acts as a reservoir fig 5 interestingly species life history traits mitigate the changes in population density in response to land use change indeed short life cycle species may be more responsive to land use change fig 5 at a broader spatial scale landscape context 3 3 the wireworm population response to the presence of a grassland in an adjacent field relies on the pest life traits dispersal ability life cycle duration habitat quality and habitat patch dynamics local habitat quality governs the wireworm density in the field core whereas density in borders results from the diffusion and advection of click beetles between habitats over time fig 6 when advection is high the inner edge of a low quality habitat is temporary depleted at the expense of the adjacent higher quality habitat however diffusion which tends to homogenise density usually plays the opposite effect hence wireworm density is ruled by the trade off between these two antagonistic dispersal mechanisms in a grassland where wireworm density has reached the local carrying capacity diffusion at the ecotones will be high and sustain the colonisation of neighbouring crops therefore the presence of a temporary versus permanent grassland in the neighbourhood may significantly change the outcome in terms of spatial distribution of wireworm populations if advection is strong and grasslands highly favourable temporary grasslands may act as pseudo sinks while permanent grasslands act as sources for click beetle populations this clearly emphasizes the relevance of managing grassland regimes 4 3 implications in terms of pest management strategies our study outlines the complex link between pest colonisation patterns within the agricultural mosaic and the entanglement of habitats the results presented in 3 4 also fig 3 and fig 7 clearly support that the spatiotemporal arrangement of grasslands opens avenues for the management of soil dwelling insect pests as stated in previous studies habitat manipulation can be successfully implemented to enhance the effectiveness of natural enemies landis et al 2000 and mitigate the impacts of invasive arthropod pests jonsson et al 2010 yet here we emphasize the importance of the dynamics of land use spatial configurations for example click beetle spillover between a grassland and a neighbouring cropped field depends on the population replenishment in the favourable habitat a recently installed grassland may act as a pseudo sink whereas a permanent grassland may act as a source this finding evidences that depending on the spatiotemporal dynamics of habitat distribution the role of a particular landscape element can switch from favourable to detrimental to pest population in fields consequently pest management strategies relying on habitat spatial connectivity also call for the consideration of spatiotemporal continuity or discontinuity our modelling framework helps apprehending the effects of agroecological infrastructures green veins grassy strips etc on pest communities grassy landscape elements are well known reservoirs for beneficial organisms blackshaw et al 2017 but can also increase wireworm pressure our modelling approach is precious to identify the appropriate grassland management regime that provides the best trade off to balance wireworm damage and a bundle of ecosystem services such as sustaining natural pest control prevention against soil erosion etc hermann et al 2013 regarding the broad spatial and temporal scales related to the functioning of agroecosystems frameworks enabling virtual experiments provide a relevant if not unique way to anticipate the complex trade off between beneficial and detrimental effects associated with the adoption of agri environmental schemes 4 4 limitations and perspectives the reaction diffusion advection model we conceived to explore the main mechanisms at stake in the colonisation of vulnerable crops at the landscape scale is parsimonious model parameters were set based on a comprehensive review of literature dealing with the biology and the ecology of click beetles and their larvae nevertheless knowledge gaps complicated the parameterisation step for instance knowledge on click beetle dispersal is still rudimentary and though it has been evidenced that they can move across adjacent plots schallhart et al 2009 some unpublished research suggest they may disperse on a much wider scale than currently mentioned lorenzo furlan et al 2017b personal communication dispersal patterns between uncultivated areas grasslands and cropped fields remain insufficiently documented moreover in our approach we used the carrying capacity as a proxy for habitat quality however most experimental data we found date back to the first half of the twentieth century roebuck 1924 roebuck et al 1947 ross et al 1947 salt and hollick 1949 salt and hollick 1944 and limit to grasslands their current accuracy can be questioned given changes in habitat properties and possibly in pest life history traits that have occurred since then further experiments to assess the carrying capacities associated with the main land uses occurring in the current agricultural landscapes are definitely required furthermore we did not explicitly consider crop management practices within our modelling framework but rather treated them as an implicit component of the habitat quality associated with each land use however there is clear evidence that farming practices influence insect abundance see for example puech et al 2014 and kladivko 2001 soil cultivation directly affects the number and size of wireworms salt and hollick 1949 interestingly furlan et al 2020 demonstrated that an accurate ploughing timing of meadows when rotation includes meadows provides an efficient management tactic to prevent soil pest damage to maize crops thus combining virtuous cropping practices and a relevant strategy for the spatiotemporal arrangement of grasslands derived from our modelling framework may provide a holistic integrated pest management approach as well as a credible alternative to chemical pesticides in accordance with the principles of the european directive 2009 128 ec on the sustainable use of pesticides barzman et al 2015 furlan et al 2017b furlan et al 2017a finally in our study we examined various situations dealing with the presence of grassland in plot history legacy effect or neighbourhood neighbourhood effect as well as in dynamic landscape contexts spatiotemporal effect such analytic landscape contexts allowed to address the role of grassland as sources of soil dwelling pests yet clearly do not reflect the real complexity of the agricultural mosaic that stems from stakeholder decisions under agronomical economical socio technical constraints the representation of agroecosystems is still a research issue poggi et al 2018b and some model representations encompass more or less explicitly these constraints bareille et al 2020 martel et al 2017 ricci et al 2018 hence a next research avenue consists in the exploration of suppressive patterns in simplified but realistic agricultural landscapes generated under agronomic constraints at the farm or landscape scales 5 conclusion using mechanistic modelling we illustrated how species life history traits interact with spatiotemporal arrangement of habitats in agricultural landscapes to shape pest abundances in vulnerable crops through neighbouring effect legacy effect or their interaction the distribution of grassy elements across the landscape has discernible effects on wireworm abundance in crops we showed here that such endeavour is knowledge hungry as it must be informed by some critical pest traits but also a measurable alternative to a chemically driven crop protection our modelling framework allowed us to explore the ecosystem service of crop pest reduction that grasslands could provide through their ecological role on legacy effect and movements of pest populations pseudo sink vs source obviously other ecosystem services provided by grasslands such as conservation biological control could be integrated in a common framework offering exciting perspectives for the management of the trade offs in a bundle of services and to

over a period governed by the cumulative degree days we formalised the emergence rate as a temperature dependent functional response let s note a1 1 θ c u m t j 0 θ j θ b a s e t θ j θ b a s e where θcum stands for the cumulated number of degree days starting arbitrarily in january θbase is the temperature below which degree days are not accounted for set to 10 c in accordance with findings from furlan 2004 furlan 1998 who showed that no larval development happened below this threshold value denoting θstart resp θend the minimal resp maximal number of cumulated degree days above resp below

in the scope of this study we averaged the daily temperatures in le rheu brittany france over a 10 year period 2008 to 2017 and we chose the values of θstart and θend that corresponded to late april and beginning of june april 23rd and june 8th in accordance with published studies landl et al 2010 parker and howard 2001 sufyan et al 2007 villeneuve latour 2011 the functional response for the emergence rate and the proportion of emerged adults along time applied to our temperature dataset are illustrated on fig a1 appendix 2 sensitivity analysis we carried out a morris sensitivity analysis morris 1991 to study the effect of model parameters on the speed at which the wireworm population density converges toward the carrying capacity of a given land cover for this purpose we considered the situation where a cultivated crop with carrying capacity kc is converted to grassland with carrying capacity kg initially the wireworm density equals the crop carrying capacity kc we applied our population dynamics model 2 1 and defined as an output metric the time required for the wireworm density to reach the mean density between kc and kg amongst the model parameters five were suspected of influencing the process of interest the oviposition rate π the advection coefficient along the maturity dimension c the aboveground mortality rate μa the grassland carrying capacity kg and the exponent associated with the belowground density dependent mortality β ranges of value assigned to these parameters are reported in table 1 last column other parameters were set to their nominal value table 1 except μb that was assessed using a preliminary optimisation procedure as mentioned in 2 2 fig a2 shows the standard deviation σ versus the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects associated with each of the five parameters investigated parameters kg and μa have a very low overall influence on the output metric on the contrary the parameter c has a significant linear influence while parameters π and β exhibit a non linear influence possibly with interactions on the output metric thus despite scarce knowledge on this parameter β driving the strength of the legacy effect it has a significant effect on the output metric we investigated and its estimation would probably deserve further attention 
24681,sustainable pest control strategies hinge on the knowledge of movement ecology within the agricultural landscape where contrasted habitat qualities intermingle thereby influencing arthropod dispersal hence habitat manipulation in space and time can be a lever for action to control pests with regard to landscape compositional constraints in this study we examined the role of grassland arrangements in field colonisation by soil dwelling pests within a dynamic agricultural landscape and discussed the implications for pest management with a focus on wireworms for this purpose we proposed a framework combining i a spatially explicit and mechanistic model describing the pest population dynamics in both aerial and soil compartments involved along its life cycle and ii spatiotemporal representations of various landscape contexts we addressed the role of grassland in plot history in plot neighbourhood or in both history and neighbourhood our results show that species with a short life cycle are more responsive to changes in land use and that the neighbourhood effect strongly relies on dispersal mechanisms random vs directed movements we also highlight how the arrangement of grassy landscape elements in space and time can mitigate crop infestation by soil dwelling pests thereby emphasizing the relevance of managing grassland regimes once informed by critical pest life traits our approach opens avenue for the exploration of the spatiotemporal land use manipulation meant for pest management future research consists in the exploration of suppressive patterns in simplified but realistic agricultural landscapes generated under agronomic constraints at the farm or landscape scales keywords pest control population dynamics landscape dynamics reservoir sink connectivity reaction diffusion advection model land use change wireworm click beetle 1 introduction targeting a sustainable crop protection freed from its reliance on pesticides requires a better understanding of field colonisation processes driving pest population dynamics looking for environmental friendly strategies for pest control reemphasizes the importance of movement ecology indeed insect pest habitats are fragmented rendering dispersal a key process determining pest population dynamics at the agricultural landscape scale this suggests that agricultural landscape is a relevant scale for designing pest resilient agroecosystems that minimise the use of pesticides bourhis et al 2017 bourhis et al 2015 tscharntke and brandl 2004 such a pest control approach should account for processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales thereby requiring an extensive knowledge about pest ecology the survival of species hinges on their ability to detect and reach suitable resources when necessary in their life cycle dunning et al 1992 vasseur et al 2013 interestingly a few studies have suggested that some insects effectively move between asynchronous land uses depending on resource availability aviron et al 2018 bressan et al 2010 men et al 2004 habitat connectivity in space and time martensen et al 2017 moilanen and hanski 2001 taylor et al 1993 is thus a pivotal driver of pest dispersal success in dynamic agricultural landscapes consequently the spatial and temporal arrangement of land uses can be a lever for action to control species abundances with regard to landscape compositional constraints fischer and lindenmayer 2007 jonsson et al 2010 parisey et al 2016 polasky et al 2008 roques and hamel 2007 with and king 2001 in that elateridae can be considered as relevant model organisms blackshaw et al 2017 wireworms the larvae of click beetles coleoptera elateridae of which there are more than 10 000 species in about 400 genera known worldwide are amongst the most notorious soil dwelling pests balachowsky and mesnil 1935 miles 1942 traugott et al 2015 elaterid pest species are capable of exploiting both cultivated and uncultivated areas in the agricultural mosaic milosavljević et al 2016 consequently understanding their movement from sources that sustain important populations i e uncultivated areas to vulnerable crops is central in the development of pest management strategies the larvae undergo a number of instars and the complete elaterid life cycle varies between two to five years balachowsky and mesnil 1935 furlan 1998 miles 1942 sufyan et al 2013 in europe agriotes spp are the most harmful species they attack the roots and tubers of a wide range of crops thereby inflicting severe economic damage in potatoes maize and vegetable production and may even threaten perennial crops such as soft fruits or orchards traugott et al 2015 though scarce and fragmented knowledge regarding the biology and the ecology of agriotes spp indicates that uncropped field margins and areas are the most favourable habitat for wireworms and act as reservoirs from which they disperse into adjacent crops blackshaw et al 2017 based on correlative approaches some studies have attempted to unravel relationships between larvae or adult abundances or densities and landscape features benefer et al 2012 blackshaw and vernon 2006 l furlan et al 2017a hermann et al 2013 kozina et al 2015 poggi et al 2018a saussure et al 2015 altogether these studies shed light on the potential for a dynamic landscape to shape wireworm populations however while providing insights of the main factors responsible for wireworm or click beetle density levels such approaches fail in describing the mechanisms driving pest colonisation and subsequently in elucidating the source sink ecological processes that operate at the landscape scale the main objective of our study was to examine the role of grasslands in field colonisation by soil dwelling pests within a dynamic agricultural landscape and discuss its implications for pest management with a focus on wireworms for this purpose we first developed a spatially explicit and mechanistic model describing the pest population dynamics in both aerial and soil compartments involved along its life cycle larvae and adult mortality larval development oviposition and adult movements diffusion and advection were the main processes considered model parameterisation stems from an extensive review of the literature dealing with the biology and ecology of wireworms then landscape elements comprising grasslands and vulnerable habitats cropped fields were characterised by their carrying capacity combining these two framework components we investigated the interplay of landscape spatiotemporal dynamics considering grasslands as pest sources and of species specific traits e g life cycle duration on field infestation levels as illustrated by the conceptual diagram fig 1 we also highlighted how the balance between diffusion and advection movements drives the population flows on both sides of the boundaries between grassland and field crops finally we demonstrated that spatiotemporal connectivity between grasslands significantly affects the pest infestation levels within crops providing new insights into the role of grasslands in pest infestation in a dynamic agricultural mosaic our findings bring an original contribution to the search for innovative landscape scale strategies for pest management 2 material and methods 2 1 population dynamics model insect pests considered in this study cause crop damage during larval development in soil but disperse as adults by walk and flight both the aboveground and the belowground compartments were explicitly considered the population dynamics was derived along two spatial dimensions x x y through a set of reaction advection diffusion equations modelling the following biological and ecological mechanisms the emergence of adults from mature larvae the adult random and directed motions the oviposition the adult mortality the larval development and the larval density dependant mortality briefly adults oviposit at a constant rate π thereby increasing the belowground population that ages at a constant velocity c undergoing a density dependant mortality wireworms reaching the critical age mc emerge as adults that disperse across the landscape to find resources and suitable habitat the model can be formalised as a system of partial differential equations for t 0 and 0 m mc t a x t τ t b x t m c d δ

and m are the advection operators over x and m the maturity dimension where x y m denote the partial derivatives with respect to x y and m model parameters and their meaning are described in table 1 model interpretation is fully presented in the following paragraphs the state variables a and b respectively denote the density of click beetles aboveground and the density of wireworms in soil actually b encapsulates all belowground development stages larval instars pupae and is referred to as wireworms thereafter for the sake of simplification the dynamical condition at m 0 eq 3 reflects both the oviposition and the growth of individuals who did not start to mature while the condition in m m c eq 4 takes into account the accumulation of individuals in the last class of maturation before emergence as initial conditions the aboveground population was set to zero and the age distribution of larvae was obtained from a preliminary model simulation run over 15 years on a homogeneous landscape the model was solved using operator splitting press et al 2007 chapter 20 3 3 alternating direction implicit method solves the diffusion press et al 2007 chapter 20 3 2 while a forward euler scheme is used for the reaction terms and an upwind scheme for the advection terms press et al 2007 chapter 20 1 we considered the spatial domain under study as a closed system i e equal inflowing and outflowing pest populations thereby applying neumann reflecting boundary conditions at the edges of the spatial domain all developments were made with the r programming language r core team 2018 2 1 1 adult emergence and motions click beetles emerge during spring in accordance we defined their emergence rate as a time dependeent function τ t cf 2 2 and suppl material 1 in eq 1 as recent findings suggested that wireworms do not move from field to field schallhart et al 2011 we considered that only adults contribute to the spatial redistribution of populations we assumed that adult motions included two components a random component expressed through the diffusion term in eq 1 involving d the homogeneous diffusion coefficient and a directed component expressed through the advection term in eq 1 and involving u the advection velocity regarding the latter component we assumed that click beetles move across the landscape based on the habitat quality they perceive in their neighbourhood we defined the local habitat quality h x t as a function of local carrying capacities k x t 5 h x t k x t k m i n k m a x k m i n where kmax resp kmin refers to the most favourable resp unfavourable habitat for wireworms as did bourhis et al 2017 we derived the perception of the landscape habitat quality noted h p x t from a convolution of a perception kernel linear inverse distance weighting filter with the mapping of local habitat quality 6 h p x t x i ϵ ω x x i γ 1 x x i γ h x i t d x i x i ϵ ω x x i γ 1 x x i γ d x i with ω the whole spatial domain and γ the distance beyond which habitat quality is no longer perceived by click beetles finally the advection velocity 7 u x t v m a x x h p x t m a x x h p x t reaches its maximum speed vmax where the gradient of the potential function h p x t is maximum 2 1 2 oviposition although the oviposition rate may vary amongst habitats brian 1947 it was assumed here independent of space i e land use and associated carrying capacity and constant over the whole duration of the adult life new borns fall within the belowground population with age 0 eq 3 2 1 3 adult mortality a constant mortality rate μ a was applied to the aboveground compartment of the model 2 1 4 larval development the belowground population distributes along an ageing axis the population ages according to a constant coefficient c when reaching the critical maturity m c larvae can emerge as click beetles 2 1 5 larval mortality uncultivated areas such as grasslands or grassy strips are acknowledged as favourable habitats for both adults and larvae of click beetles brian 1947 miles 1942 providing sufficient food and humid conditions roebuck et al 1947 therefore wireworm populations thrive in these areas on the contrary wireworm populations reach much lower infestation levels in cropped fields where they nevertheless damage vulnerable crops miles 1942 in our model we assumed that the carrying capacity k x t is a proxy for habitat quality and that larval mortality relies on a constant component μ b weighted by a density dependent factor while the constant component provides a stationary annual dynamics within the landscape the density dependent term ensures that the population dynamics is centred on the carrying capacity the exponent β controls the dynamics inertia i e the speed at which the local population converges towards the local carrying capacity for the sake of simplicity larval mortality was independent of the age note that the reaction term departs from the canonical logistic growth model as the density dependence applies on larval mortality only rather than on larval population growth rate which also depends on adult oviposition rate emphasising that population is limited by larval competition for food rather than by adult competition for oviposition sites 2 2 model parameterisation 2 2 1 land use dependent carrying capacities k g and k c we considered two types of land use grasslands known as favourable habitats furlan 2004 parker and howard 2001 and cropped fields regarding grasslands we set the carrying capacity k g to 2000 individuals per square metre thereafter ind m² based on field studies carried out before the common access to chemical pesticides roebuck et al 1947 ross et al 1947 salt and hollick 1944 based on a thorough study of two pastures at least 10 year old and regularly cut for hay salt and hollick 1944 estimated densities about 850 and 2000 ind m² locally they even observed densities reaching 6000 ind m² in both pastures within other pastures less intensively sampled they found about 2500 ind m² on average roebuck et al 1947 studied intensively the infestation level of an old meadow and determined a density of about 300 ind m² by the hand sorting method following salt and hollick 1944 who consider that this method underestimates densities by two thirds the actual infestation could be of about 1000 ind m² ross et al 1947 studied six permanent pastures grazed and regularly hayed and assessed a density of about 1000 ind m² in cropped fields we set the carrying capacity k c to 120 ind m² i e about one order of magnitude smaller than k g and fairly close to values indicated by roebuck 1924 indeed roebuck 1924 studied the decline of wireworm populations in newly set up crop fields with repeated ploughing and found average population density of 102 80 56 and 32 ind m² the 1rst 2nd 3rd and 4rth year after ploughing from grass respectively 2 2 2 belowground population maturation c wireworm species differ greatly from one another in their biology and ecology furlan 2005 ritter and richter 2013 in particular as regards the duration of their biological cycle in france four species from the genus agriotes are responsible for most economical crop damage amongst them a lineatus a obscurus and a sputator predominantly present in the northern regions exhibit a long life cycle duration of larval stage of about 4 years whereas a sordidus mainly found in south western regions exhibits a short life cycle duration of larval stage of about 2 years in our study we set the duration of the larval stage c 1 at 2 years for short life cycle species and at 4 years for long life cycle species 2 2 3 emergence rate studies relative to the date of emergence of agriotes click beetles are fairly consistent for instance in austria landl et al 2010 observed that the emergence of a lineatus began at the end of april which is concordant with the observations of other authors from eastern europe and from western canada vernon et al 2001 regarding a ustulatus a lineatus and a obscurus parker and howard 2001 in united kingdom reported emergences starting at mid april and adults being captured until mid july hence they probably emerged until mid june while in germany sufyan et al 2007 observed that the swarming period lasted from late april to the end of august for a lineatus and a obscurus although most authors reported two periods of adult activity one main in may and one weaker in june july landl et al 2010 sufyan et al 2007 we simply modelled adult emergence as a continuous process spanning over a period governed by the cumulative degree days see supplementary material 1 in our study the emergence of click beetles spans from late april to the beginning of june with a peak of emergence located towards the middle of the period of emergence i e mid may over this period all wireworms at the critical age have emerged see supplementary material 1 fig a1b 2 2 4 belowground mortality μ b β two main model parameters govern the larval mortality namely the mortality rate μb and the inertia exponent β the mortality rate was determined by means of a preliminary optimisation procedure before each simulation given all other parameter values such that larval density oscillated yearly around the carrying capacity in any homogeneous landscape β was estimated empirically to 0 2 from infestation data collected in arable lands by roebuck 1924 over 8 years as shown in a sensitivity analysis see supplementary material 2 despite scarce knowledge on this parameter β it has a significant effect on the model output and its estimation would probably deserve further attention 2 2 5 adult dispersion d vmax literature provides a limited amount of information regarding click beetle dispersal in particular diffusion and advection processes can seldom be disentangled brian 1947 observed that a obscurus and a lineatus but not a sputator frequently flew in a glass cage experiment crozier et al 2003 reported that these species can be strong fliers able to perform mass flights travelling approximately 5 to 10 km h for distances ranging from less than 1 m to 100 m on one occasion and with an average flight covering 2 to 3 m more recently blackshaw and hicks 2013 concluded that agriotes spp disperse widely and may originate from adjacent fields many studies have attempted to provide quantitative estimates of click beetle dispersal capacity generally using mark recapture experiments with pheromone traps blackshaw et al 2017 recaptured individuals a lineatus a obscurus a sputator at 1 m from release point after 1 h and at 30 m after 19 h schallhart et al 2009 studied the isotopic signature of a obscurus beetles captured in pheromone traps located in a grassland adjacent to a maize field 13 of individuals captured 80 m inside the grassland plot had a signature characteristic of their maize field origin based on this knowledge we set the diffusion coefficient to 72 m² day hence producing a mean dispersion radius of 15 m in one day 21 m in two days etc shigesada and kawasaki 1997 page 38 the advection speed was set to 10 m day 2 2 6 perceptual range γ we assumed that adult click beetles could perform directed motions as responses to distant stimuli e g olfactory stimuli advection processes may result from foraging for food or laying sites from searching for a sexual partner etc in our model we described advection at the population level as a tendency to move along a gradient of increasing habitat quality expressed in terms of carrying capacities in particular as wireworms thrive in grasslands we expect adult click beetles to disperse preferentially towards nearby grassy areas we set the perceptual range i e the distance beyond which habitat quality is no longer perceived by click beetles to 10 m this estimated value mainly stems from studies dealing with pheromone attractiveness for click beetles since it is the only advection process for which literature provides some guidance sufyan et al 2007 assessed the range of attractiveness of pheromone traps for both species a lineatus and a obscurus through a mark recapture experiment they recaptured 60 and 10 of beetles in pheromone traps placed at 2 and 60 m from their release point respectively in a later experiment sufyan et al 2011 estimated the maximum distance of perception of a pheromone trap to be around 15 20 m blackshaw et al 2018 studied the attractive range of traps baited with a obscurus pheromone to male beetles in both still air and wind conditions they found that the attraction distance was less than 5 m in still air but increased with airflow 2 2 7 aboveground population mortality μa adult life expectancy varies amongst studies brian 1947 observed that longevity of a obscurus on various crops ranged from 69 to 84 days for females and from 45 to 75 days for males regarding a ustulatus hinkin 1983 reported an average longevity of 28 days for females and 19 days for males while furlan 1996 measured an adult lifespan of 24 sd 5 days for females more recently hicks and blackshaw 2008 as well as blackshaw et al 2017 performed mark release experiments on click beetles they showed respectively that adults males and females combined can survive for at least 45 and 25 days accordingly in our model based on these elements and in accordance with our own field observations we set the adult average lifespan to 25 days for both sexes 2 2 8 oviposition rate π most authors have studied oviposition under laboratory conditions brian 1947 found an average fecundity ranging from 30 to 150 a obscurus depending on the crop flax potato and wheat were associated with low fecundity while grasslands of lolium festuca and agrostis were associated with high fecundity miles and cohen 1941 cohen 1942 and furlan 1996 reported an average number of eggs laid per female of 109 in a obscurus min 78 max 186 103 in a obscurus and 78 in a ustulatus sd 27 9 min 52 max 140 accordingly we considered fecundity to be of 80 eggs per female over its lifespan 25 days as mentioned in the previous paragraph considering that sex ratio tends towards 1 1 blackshaw et al 2017 furlan 1996 the oviposition rate was set to 80 2 25 1 6 eggs per capita per day 2 3 landscape contexts we defined four landscape contexts fig 2 and fig 3 to investigate the processes driving the colonisation of vulnerable habitats cropped fields characterised by a habitat quality lower than the one associated with grasslands favourable habitats the first three contexts are shown in fig 2 a homogeneous cropped field cultivated over 2 years fig 2a a grassland in the field history fig 2b or in the neighbourhood of the cropped field fig 2c finally fig 3 describes the fourth context where we compared two dynamic landscapes ω1 and ω2 exhibiting the same duration of land use over time landscape composition but through contrasted spatial configurations 3 results 3 1 population dynamics in a homogeneous landscape context fig 4 shows the dynamics of above and belowground populations in the simple case of a homogeneous landscape fig 2a comprising vulnerable cropped fields only simulation starts in winter with a null aboveground population and a larval density at equilibrium hence 120 individuals per square metre until the emergence of adults the only process at stake is larval mortality which reduces the belowground population to about 90 individuals per square metre adults emerge in early spring producing an increase in the aboveground population density with a peak value determined by i the density of mature larvae at the onset of the emergence period ii climate and iii adult life expectancy it is followed by a decrease resulting from the constant mortality rate μa about 65 days after the last emergence the aboveground population becomes extinct this pattern repeats over the years after adults have emerged they disperse and lay eggs thus refilling the belowground population compartment that increases reaches a maximum at the end of the oviposition period and then decreases due to larval mortality after a few years a stationary pattern occurs 3 2 wireworm dynamics with grassland in field history the effect of a grassland in field history fig 2b on the wireworm population density is illustrated on fig 5 for two pest life cycle durations 2 years short life cycle and 4 years long life cycle both dynamics exhibit the periodic behaviour described in the previous section 3 1 at time 0 the field is converted to grassland which translates into an important rise in habitat quality resulting in a subsequent wireworm population increase in fig 5 we compare the dynamics of a short life cycle population and a long life cycle population the amplitudes of intra annual oscillations are more important for the former on one hand the proportion of the belowground population that emerges as adults is larger in the case of a short life cycle about half the population emerges each year than in that of a long life cycle about a quarter emerges each year given that oviposition rate is independent from life cycle duration in our model the increase in wireworm density is greater for short cycle species on the other hand once the aboveground population has vanished high larval density results in a strong mortality until the next laying period in summary short life cycle wireworms react more promptly to changes in habitat quality thereby leading to higher infestation levels in temporary grasslands conversely after grassland conversion into crop wireworm density reaches more quickly the new current carrying capacity kc in the case of short cycle species note that these conclusions stem from our model hypotheses where a difference in life cycle duration results in different mortality rates land use carrying capacities and oviposition rates being unchanged 3 3 wireworm dynamics in a field with a newly set up grassland in its neighbourhood we simulated the effect of the conversion of half of a crop field into permanent grassland fig 2c fig 6 shows the wireworm density along a direction orthogonal to the grassland crop field border 40 m on both sides over a period of 10 years and for a range of values of the diffusion coefficient d the maximal advection speed vmax and the perceptual range γ diffusion tends to homogenise wireworm densities in space while advection entails population movements from low towards high carrying capacity places in fig 6a only diffusion applies wireworm densities increase from kc 120 ind m² towards kg 2000 ind m² along the 10 years on the side covered with grassland adult click beetle diffusion results in an increase in wireworm density in the adjacent cropped field with an intensity that vanishes away from the ecotone in the next six panels figs 6b g diffusion and advection have antagonistic effects advection fosters population displacements from low towards high quality habitat whereas diffusion promotes a homogenisation of the densities during the transient period before reaching equilibrium density in the grassland the set up of a grassland can have opposite effects on wireworm density in crop depending on the advection strength figs 6b d indeed a high maximal advection speed vmax results in a reduction of wireworm density inside the cropped field due to advection effect exceeding diffusion effect for low maximal advection speed the opposite occurs thus 5 years after grassland set up wireworm density can be greater fig 6b similar fig 6c or lower fig 6d than the initial density in the crop changes in perceptual range have similar effects than changes in maximal advection speed figs 6b g a mechanistic effect of the population redistribution must be noted here unlike advection diffusion is an inherently density dependant process as population increases within the grassland so does the diffusion intensity mechanically the neighbourhood effect of grassland is therefore changing throughout the season as diffusion takes more control over the redistribution 3 4 effect of spatiotemporal distribution of grasslands on wireworm densities we considered two dynamic landscape contexts ω1 and ω2 spanning over four years fig 3 landscape composition over time i e the proportions of cropped field and grassland over the duration of the virtual experiment remains unchanged while spatial configurations differ the land cover within plot a is identical over the years in ω1 and ω2 however the mean wireworm densities differ all along the four year period final densities deviate by 10 indeed in ω1 wireworm density increases in plot b the first two years due to a favourable habitat grassland subsequently when plot a turns into grassland whereas plot b switches to cropped field both advection and diffusion induce aboveground population movements from plot b to plot a resulting in a meaningful wireworm increase once oviposition has been completed that combines with the expansion of wireworm density due to the high carrying capacity associated with grassland in ω2 simultaneous evolution of densities in plots a and b do not favour any population flows 4 discussion 4 1 model relevance and novelty insect pests inflict severe damage to agricultural crops in spite of the intense use of agrochemical inputs in fragmented and changing environment as most agricultural landscapes are the movement of insect pests has a strong influence on their abundance and spatiotemporal distribution hence the extent of the inflicted crop damage mazzi and dorn 2012 thus understanding dispersal mechanisms may help design effective pest management strategies here we developed a spatially explicit mechanistic model to describe the population dynamics of insect pests inflicting crop damage while developing in soil and spreading across the landscape as adults we accounted for both aboveground and belowground population dynamics to date few studies have considered the link between both compartments though many species of ecological and economic importance have both above and belowground life cycle stages benefer et al 2012 therefore our developments could serve in investigations dealing with a wide variety of soil dwelling insect pests combined with spatial representations of dynamic landscape contexts our population dynamics model enables the investigation of the spatial redistribution of populations over time given the spatial distribution of habitat quality and species life history traits dispersal ability life cycle duration etc we thus provide an appropriate framework to study how the arrangement of grassy landscape elements in space and time can mitigate crop infestation by soil dwelling pests 4 2 the dynamics of grassland as reservoirs or sources of pests in our results we highlight 3 2 the influence of the legacy of previous land uses on the current wireworm infestation level this is well documented in plant sciences e g regarding soil suppressiveness bailey et al 2009 postma et al 2010 effects of biofumigation matthiessen and kirkegaard 2006 etc here we show that given its habitat favourability the presence of a grassland in plot history entails the build up of wireworm populations and acts as a reservoir fig 5 interestingly species life history traits mitigate the changes in population density in response to land use change indeed short life cycle species may be more responsive to land use change fig 5 at a broader spatial scale landscape context 3 3 the wireworm population response to the presence of a grassland in an adjacent field relies on the pest life traits dispersal ability life cycle duration habitat quality and habitat patch dynamics local habitat quality governs the wireworm density in the field core whereas density in borders results from the diffusion and advection of click beetles between habitats over time fig 6 when advection is high the inner edge of a low quality habitat is temporary depleted at the expense of the adjacent higher quality habitat however diffusion which tends to homogenise density usually plays the opposite effect hence wireworm density is ruled by the trade off between these two antagonistic dispersal mechanisms in a grassland where wireworm density has reached the local carrying capacity diffusion at the ecotones will be high and sustain the colonisation of neighbouring crops therefore the presence of a temporary versus permanent grassland in the neighbourhood may significantly change the outcome in terms of spatial distribution of wireworm populations if advection is strong and grasslands highly favourable temporary grasslands may act as pseudo sinks while permanent grasslands act as sources for click beetle populations this clearly emphasizes the relevance of managing grassland regimes 4 3 implications in terms of pest management strategies our study outlines the complex link between pest colonisation patterns within the agricultural mosaic and the entanglement of habitats the results presented in 3 4 also fig 3 and fig 7 clearly support that the spatiotemporal arrangement of grasslands opens avenues for the management of soil dwelling insect pests as stated in previous studies habitat manipulation can be successfully implemented to enhance the effectiveness of natural enemies landis et al 2000 and mitigate the impacts of invasive arthropod pests jonsson et al 2010 yet here we emphasize the importance of the dynamics of land use spatial configurations for example click beetle spillover between a grassland and a neighbouring cropped field depends on the population replenishment in the favourable habitat a recently installed grassland may act as a pseudo sink whereas a permanent grassland may act as a source this finding evidences that depending on the spatiotemporal dynamics of habitat distribution the role of a particular landscape element can switch from favourable to detrimental to pest population in fields consequently pest management strategies relying on habitat spatial connectivity also call for the consideration of spatiotemporal continuity or discontinuity our modelling framework helps apprehending the effects of agroecological infrastructures green veins grassy strips etc on pest communities grassy landscape elements are well known reservoirs for beneficial organisms blackshaw et al 2017 but can also increase wireworm pressure our modelling approach is precious to identify the appropriate grassland management regime that provides the best trade off to balance wireworm damage and a bundle of ecosystem services such as sustaining natural pest control prevention against soil erosion etc hermann et al 2013 regarding the broad spatial and temporal scales related to the functioning of agroecosystems frameworks enabling virtual experiments provide a relevant if not unique way to anticipate the complex trade off between beneficial and detrimental effects associated with the adoption of agri environmental schemes 4 4 limitations and perspectives the reaction diffusion advection model we conceived to explore the main mechanisms at stake in the colonisation of vulnerable crops at the landscape scale is parsimonious model parameters were set based on a comprehensive review of literature dealing with the biology and the ecology of click beetles and their larvae nevertheless knowledge gaps complicated the parameterisation step for instance knowledge on click beetle dispersal is still rudimentary and though it has been evidenced that they can move across adjacent plots schallhart et al 2009 some unpublished research suggest they may disperse on a much wider scale than currently mentioned lorenzo furlan et al 2017b personal communication dispersal patterns between uncultivated areas grasslands and cropped fields remain insufficiently documented moreover in our approach we used the carrying capacity as a proxy for habitat quality however most experimental data we found date back to the first half of the twentieth century roebuck 1924 roebuck et al 1947 ross et al 1947 salt and hollick 1949 salt and hollick 1944 and limit to grasslands their current accuracy can be questioned given changes in habitat properties and possibly in pest life history traits that have occurred since then further experiments to assess the carrying capacities associated with the main land uses occurring in the current agricultural landscapes are definitely required furthermore we did not explicitly consider crop management practices within our modelling framework but rather treated them as an implicit component of the habitat quality associated with each land use however there is clear evidence that farming practices influence insect abundance see for example puech et al 2014 and kladivko 2001 soil cultivation directly affects the number and size of wireworms salt and hollick 1949 interestingly furlan et al 2020 demonstrated that an accurate ploughing timing of meadows when rotation includes meadows provides an efficient management tactic to prevent soil pest damage to maize crops thus combining virtuous cropping practices and a relevant strategy for the spatiotemporal arrangement of grasslands derived from our modelling framework may provide a holistic integrated pest management approach as well as a credible alternative to chemical pesticides in accordance with the principles of the european directive 2009 128 ec on the sustainable use of pesticides barzman et al 2015 furlan et al 2017b furlan et al 2017a finally in our study we examined various situations dealing with the presence of grassland in plot history legacy effect or neighbourhood neighbourhood effect as well as in dynamic landscape contexts spatiotemporal effect such analytic landscape contexts allowed to address the role of grassland as sources of soil dwelling pests yet clearly do not reflect the real complexity of the agricultural mosaic that stems from stakeholder decisions under agronomical economical socio technical constraints the representation of agroecosystems is still a research issue poggi et al 2018b and some model representations encompass more or less explicitly these constraints bareille et al 2020 martel et al 2017 ricci et al 2018 hence a next research avenue consists in the exploration of suppressive patterns in simplified but realistic agricultural landscapes generated under agronomic constraints at the farm or landscape scales 5 conclusion using mechanistic modelling we illustrated how species life history traits interact with spatiotemporal arrangement of habitats in agricultural landscapes to shape pest abundances in vulnerable crops through neighbouring effect legacy effect or their interaction the distribution of grassy elements across the landscape has discernible effects on wireworm abundance in crops we showed here that such endeavour is knowledge hungry as it must be informed by some critical pest traits but also a measurable alternative to a chemically driven crop protection our modelling framework allowed us to explore the ecosystem service of crop pest reduction that grasslands could provide through their ecological role on legacy effect and movements of pest populations pseudo sink vs source obviously other ecosystem services provided by grasslands such as conservation biological control could be integrated in a common framework offering exciting perspectives for the management of the trade offs in a bundle of services and to

over a period governed by the cumulative degree days we formalised the emergence rate as a temperature dependent functional response let s note a1 1 θ c u m t j 0 θ j θ b a s e t θ j θ b a s e where θcum stands for the cumulated number of degree days starting arbitrarily in january θbase is the temperature below which degree days are not accounted for set to 10 c in accordance with findings from furlan 2004 furlan 1998 who showed that no larval development happened below this threshold value denoting θstart resp θend the minimal resp maximal number of cumulated degree days above resp below

in the scope of this study we averaged the daily temperatures in le rheu brittany france over a 10 year period 2008 to 2017 and we chose the values of θstart and θend that corresponded to late april and beginning of june april 23rd and june 8th in accordance with published studies landl et al 2010 parker and howard 2001 sufyan et al 2007 villeneuve latour 2011 the functional response for the emergence rate and the proportion of emerged adults along time applied to our temperature dataset are illustrated on fig a1 appendix 2 sensitivity analysis we carried out a morris sensitivity analysis morris 1991 to study the effect of model parameters on the speed at which the wireworm population density converges toward the carrying capacity of a given land cover for this purpose we considered the situation where a cultivated crop with carrying capacity kc is converted to grassland with carrying capacity kg initially the wireworm density equals the crop carrying capacity kc we applied our population dynamics model 2 1 and defined as an output metric the time required for the wireworm density to reach the mean density between kc and kg amongst the model parameters five were suspected of influencing the process of interest the oviposition rate π the advection coefficient along the maturity dimension c the aboveground mortality rate μa the grassland carrying capacity kg and the exponent associated with the belowground density dependent mortality β ranges of value assigned to these parameters are reported in table 1 last column other parameters were set to their nominal value table 1 except μb that was assessed using a preliminary optimisation procedure as mentioned in 2 2 fig a2 shows the standard deviation σ versus the absolute mean μ of the elementary effects associated with each of the five parameters investigated parameters kg and μa have a very low overall influence on the output metric on the contrary the parameter c has a significant linear influence while parameters π and β exhibit a non linear influence possibly with interactions on the output metric thus despite scarce knowledge on this parameter β driving the strength of the legacy effect it has a significant effect on the output metric we investigated and its estimation would probably deserve further attention 
24682,mosquitoes are vectors of numerous pathogens that cause infectious diseases and they pose a significant global health burden as a result as such more reliable field relevant models to study mosquito population dynamics and life history traits such as development time and survival of mosquito larva would be of great value in aedes mosquitoes progression through early life stages is known to be density dependent despite its importance density dependence is largely ignored or oversimplified in many existing simulation models leading to less accurate predictions of development and survival during the early life stages furthermore density dependence is frequently assumed to impact only larval survival and not development time in models despite empirical evidence for density dependent development here we develop a discrete time model of mosquito larval population dynamics which accounts for density impacts on both survival and development time we demonstrate the validity of our model using publicly available semi field data of larval density and pupation time across a six month experiment using our model we found that incorporating density dependence during larval development is important to the accurate prediction of mosquito pupation this is especially true when considering density dependent development time for mosquito larva as opposed to density dependent larval survival we determined that the incorporation of simple functional forms to describe density dependence in simulation models gives improved prediction results over models that ignore density dependence entirely such simple functional forms can easily be incorporated into existing models and thus help improve field relevant models of mosquito population dynamics particularly in aedes and other container inhabiting mosquitoes that are known to experience density dependence during larval development keywords density dependence aedes mosquitoes mosquito development time mathematical model population dynamics 1 introduction mosquitoes pose a significant global health burden they are responsible for millions of cases of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria and dengue each year who 2018 bhatt et al 2013 a vast amount of time money and effort is spent on methods to control mosquitoes in 2016 the u s center for disease control budgeted 222 million to fight zika and the who estimates that 3 1 billion was spent on combating malaria in 2017 tavernise 2016 who 2018 global efforts to reduce diseases spread by mosquitoes primarily involve insecticides but mosquitoes are now becoming resistant to many common insecticides ranson and lissenden 2016 there is a need for new and innovative ways to decrease the size and geographic distribution of mosquito populations to that end efforts to better understand mosquito population dynamics have increased with hopes of finding ways to exploit those dynamics through control measures mosquitoes go through several life stages before emerging as adults the duration of each life stage is dependent on species but the order of progression is similar for most species first an adult mosquito will lay a batch of eggs which depending on environmental factors and species can include up to as many as 200 eggs hancock et al 2016a after hatching in water juvenile mosquitoes go through four larval stages instars followed by a pupal stage after the pupal stage the mosquitoes emerge from the water as adults in the adult stage the female mosquitoes require bloodmeals in order for their eggs to develop klowden and briegel 1994 the source of bloodmeals depend on the mosquito species but some mosquitoes preferentially bite humans which facilitates mosquito borne disease spread harrington et al 2001 ponlawat and harrington 2005 in some mosquito populations progression through developmental stages is regulated by density dependence a process of nonlinear feedback that may affect survival development fecundity and other life history characteristics for example there is significant evidence that for mosquitoes in the genus aedes there is density dependence in survival and development time briegel and timmermann 2001 couret et al 2014 hancock et al 2016a aedes are container inhabiting mosquitoes meaning they lay eggs in small containers which can be natural or man made the amount of resources available in the small containers is limited so survival and development times change with respect to density as a result of competition laboratory studies have shown a significant increase in development time for large increases in density in one study of aedes albopictus an increase in larvae of a factor of five led to a doubling of development time briegel and timmermann 2001 a study of aedes aegypti showed an increase in development time by approximately 50 when increasing the density by a factor of eight couret et al 2014 mathematical models have long been used to study mosquito populations ross 1911 and spread of mosquito borne disease macdonald 1957 ross 1911 reiner et al 2013 in such models processes are often simplified so that studies may focus on specific questions for instance in many mosquito borne disease models only the susceptible and infectious adult mosquitoes are included and all other life stages are ignored in a review of mathematical modeling of mosquitoes that looked at 388 papers reiner et al 2013 found that only 45 explicitly modeled the aquatic stages without the aquatic stages density dependence is typically not explicitly included many more recent models still ignore larval stages and consider constant birth rate with no density dependence e g agusto et al 2017 dodero rojas et al 2020 kamiya et al 2020 olawoyin and kribs 2020 sanchez et al 2018 zhang and wang 2020 in the past decade it has become more common for modeling studies to include density dependence however the form in which it appears and the stages which it affects vary density dependent birth is common with or without the explicit larval stages and typically is found in the form of a logistic term e g abdelrazec and gumel 2017 cardona salgado et al 2020 iftikhar et al 2020 lega et al 2017 liu et al 2020b a pliego pliego et al 2020 rafikov et al 2019 suarez et al 2020 zhang and lui 2020 other models consider a density dependent death rate which increases with reduced resources natiello and solari 2020 or with greater density as measured by population size e g el moustaid and johnson 2019 haramboure et al 2020 marini et al 2019 tran et al 2020 pasquali et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 robert et al 2014 excluding density dependence in models or making faulty assumptions about how density dependence affects a population could impede a model s ability to describe the system appropriately models that do include density dependence typically introduce it as an effect on survival often the process is simplified by only considering non linear emergence or non linear death in particular in the review by reiner et al 2013 most of the models which incorporated density did so in the birth term in the form of logistic growth with carrying capacity some others considered a density dependent death term in early work bellows 1981 shows the importance of density in survival of beetles compared to constant survival this work examines multiple functions which determine the proportion of beetles surviving from the density in legros et al 2009 the authors examine the model form that bellows determined as most flexible equation 2a in table 1 of the present work using experimental survival of larval stages to identify the density dependent and independent parameters they find that there are multiple parameter sets that give similar fits but conclude evidence of the importance of density in survival density dependence may alter other life history traits in addition to survival such as development time in comparison to effects on survival very little mathematical modeling work has considered density in development time one notable exception is work by hancock et al 2016a using an extensive semi field experiment they analyze how dynamical changes in the density of larvae affect the variation of development times among cohorts of mosquitoes in particular they constructed a data fitted statistical model to estimate the number of larvae pupating each week this modeling study follows work aimed at empirically exploring the relationship between larval density and development time in ae aegypti such as the study by couret et al 2014 in which the authors found that density is an important factor because it alters the amount of food available to each larva which in turn increases development time in the present work we aim to develop a simple treatment of density dependence in the larval population that is sufficient to capture the dynamics of mosquito pupation we examine the impact of density dependence on both larval development time and survival specifically we consider how development of aedes aegypti in a semi field cage experimental population is impacted by the density of the population this data was generated from an extensive and laborious experiment and is not indicative of data that is available for many studies thus we construct a simple mathematical model to estimate the number of larvae that pupate based in part on the density of larvae in the population we use this model to determine the best way to incorporate density dependence into models in a simple way we begin by reviewing the results of hancock et al 2016a and describe how we utilize their data for our study then we outline our underlying discrete model of pupation including density dependence and larval age next we present results for fitting several variations of the model to the data from hancock et al 2016a finally we discuss these results and their implications for future studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we build upon work by hancock et al 2016a in which the authors conducted an extensive semi field experiment using their experimental data they model number of pupae and timing of pupation based on larval density details of their full methodology can be found in hancock et al 2016a in short the authors monitor the number of larvae and pupae over a six month period three times per week they feed the female mosquitoes and allow them to lay eggs into a single container in the semi field cage the eggs are collected and incubated for hatching upon hatching all larvae are placed together into the same larval container in the semi field cage three times a week the total larvae are counted while newly emerged pupae are counted daily using the number pupating each day as their output variable they fit the distribution of larval development time for cohorts grouped by week they use a markov chain monte carlo metropolis hasting algorithm and estimate 40 total parameters the mean and standard deviation of a shifted gamma distribution for each of 20 weeks in addition they estimate the larval survival rate for each day by extrapolating daily survival based on the three observations of total larval population each week they compare the total number predicted to pupate on a given day compared to the actual number recorded fig 1 gold and red lines in the present work an additional major component of their results is how density dependence in the larvae population affects wolbachia invasion which is beyond the scope of this paper hancock et al 2016a we use raw data reported in the hancock et al 2016a study in two ways first each new cohort in our model is determined from the number of new larvae input into the container on a particular day second we estimate parameters by comparing the reported number of mosquitoes pupating on each day that pupation was reported to our model output fig s1 our model is formulated to test different density functions using the data from hancock et al 2016a so we do not consider the egg stage because the experimental data removes the eggs hatches them elsewhere and returns the larvae in their paper a different gamma distribution is fit specifically to the data from each week the change in the resulting gamma distribution for each week is how they determine the effects of density we instead consider a single functional form for all weeks with density as an input thus what is experienced by the larvae changes based on density but individuals encountering the same density are impacted identically we consider various functional forms for the density input and how to incorporate them described in detail in the next section in order to compare these models we calculate the error between the number of predicted pupae appearing each day and the number of new pupae observed we consider our computation of their error as a best case scenario as we use a model with many fewer parameters utilizing a single function for pupation we do not expect to be able to fit the data as precisely we will use our computed error of the data in hancock et al 2016a throughout this paper to compare all model selections note that in the present study we consider in our calculations of error only nineteen of the twenty fitted gamma distributions in the work of hancock et al 2016a we omit the first gamma distribution fitted in their work as it is completely separated from the rest and appears differently in the data set 2 2 model formulation we develop a discrete time model of mosquito development from the first larval stage through pupation we explicitly account for groups of larvae appearing on the same day by including age structured compartments for larvae in the model we track each cohort separately we use the term cohort to refer to a group of larvae hatching on the same day we denote each cohort with a superscript and denote model time with a subscript e g l j i is the number of larvae remaining in the i th cohort on day j fig 2 for example l 7 3 represents the number of larvae in the third cohort alive on day 7 using the data provided we have 54 cohorts which we label from 1 to 54 in order of time of birth each day some larvae are lost to mortality the timing of pupation is dictated by a function of larval age and larval density once larvae have pupated we reduce the number of larvae accordingly we compare the number pupated each day in our discrete model with experimental data on pupation in fig 2 we show a schematic of the model structure for three representative cohorts we consider several variations to our model we begin with a simple form without density dependence but where larval age is the only factor determining development time to the pupal stage survival is accounted for in this variation through the probability of daily survival s which varies between 0 and 1 we denote this variation a for age then we investigate adding density dependence into the model without removing age as a factor in development time denoted variation ad for age and density we consider seven possible functions to incorporate density into our discrete model table 1 as the goal is to find a simple functional form to include in simulation models we then consider removing the impacts of age on development time denoted variation d for density as it is more common to assume density dependence alters survival and not development time we consider variations ad and d with density impacting either development time or daily survival we consider impacts on development time and survival separately to better understand the individual impacts of density on development and survival without either being influenced by the other 2 3 larval development time without density as a baseline variation a we fit the pupation output from our model without including larval density we assume that in the absence of density dependent factors the probability of pupating on a given day follows a fixed distribution we considered several distributions including gamma negative binomial normal poisson and exponential as the choice of distribution had little impact on our results fig s2 we chose to focus on the gamma distribution for consistency of comparison to previous work we restrict larvae such that they cannot pupate until the fifth day which we represent by g t t i 4 where the value of t i is the day cohort i hatches and fit the mean and variance of the gamma distribution we fit a single gamma distribution for all weeks which assumes a single underlying distribution of pupation time in the absence of density in addition we set constraints on the mean and variance in order for the distribution to be biologically relevant specifically we constrain the variance of the gamma distribution to be above 0 5 and the mean of the gamma distribution to be between 1 and 35 days such that after the shift the mean pupation time is between 5 and 39 days 2 4 larval development time with density to incorporate the impact of density dependence we let the function f d t be the fraction of larvae that pupate at time t 1 where d t is the total larval density at time t table 1 we incorporate this function in both variations ad and d with effects on either development time or survival to include development time with variation ad we multiply f d t by the gamma distribution which extends development time for example l t i is the number of larvae from cohort i alive on day t and p t i is the number of pupae that pupate from larval cohort i on day t the model for cohort i can be written is as follows l t 1 i s l t i 1 f d t g t t i 4 p t 1 i s l t i f d t g t t i 4 where g t t i 4 is the cumulative gamma distribution at time t t i 4 we restrict pupation prior to day 5 such that if t t i 5 then g t t i 4 0 this is due to the assumption that all larvae need a minimum time prior to pupation which we take to be 5 days hancock et al 2016a when considering density dependent survival rather than development time for variation ad we incorporate density dependence into the probability of survival this amounts to a subtle mathematical change where f d t replaces s from the previous model as shown by l t 1 i f d t l t i 1 g t t i 4 p t 1 i f d t l t i g t t i 4 for variation d we remove the gamma distribution so that the larval age does not impact development time instead we replace the gamma distribution with the density function and include the survival constant s as given by l t 1 i s l t i 1 f d t p t 1 i s l t i f d t however in the case of variation d with density dependent survival our function for fraction of larvae that pupate becomes a constant ρ l t 1 i f d t l t i 1 ρ p t 1 i f d t l t i ρ 2 5 functional forms for density dependence for the incorporation of density f d t we consider seven different functional forms listed in table 1 all of these forms are adapted from bellows 1981 to ensure that f 0 1 this equates to the assumption that in the absence of larvae there would be no effect of density bellows 1981 uses these forms to show the importance of density in survival of beetles compared to constant survival the author examines multiple functions which determine the proportion of beetles surviving daily based on the density we use adjusted forms of the functions to modify development time and survival of larvae in mosquitoes as population size approaches infinity all of these forms approach zero 2 6 history of density dependence to begin we consider the larval density d t only on the day immediately prior to pupation in this case d t is the total number of larvae on day t 1 in fig 2 d t assuming the simplest form for a given day is listed at the bottom for each day we also considered history of density across various time periods from 2 to 36 days for example a history of three days means that we averaged the number of larvae present on days t 3 t 2 and t 1 if we consider the illustrative example in fig 2 on day 6 both cohort l 1 and l 2 are able to pupate as they have survived the minimum five day period prior to pupation if we consider a history of three days then we sum up all larvae on days 3 4 and 5 and then divide by three i e to compute d 3 4 5 d 3 l 2 1 s l 2 2 s d 4 l 3 1 s l 3 2 s l 4 3 d 5 l 4 1 s 1 f d 2 3 4 g 1 l 4 2 s l 4 3 s d 3 4 5 d 3 d 4 d 5 3 notice that on day 5 new larvae enter the population through the term l 4 3 rather than survival of larvae from previous days as in other terms this is the only appearance of new larvae in this example shown in fig 2 in our simulations new larvae enter the population according to the data in addition to a simple average described above we also considered weighting the density differently e g giving more weight to most recent history however we did not see significant differences fig s3 thus in this work when we refer to density history we use a simple arithmetic average 2 7 parameter estimation the number of parameters varies with the complexity of the model variation we run three different variations table 3 in order to compare the importance of larval age and larval density variation a is without any consideration of density larvae pupate solely based on larval age i e the time since hatching we fit three parameters in this variation the survival constant and the mean and standard deviation of the gamma distribution in variation ad we include both effects of larval age and larval density in this variation we fit three to five parameters the survival constant in the case when density affects development time the mean and variance of the gamma distribution and one or two parameters related to the density functions in variation d we only include density as there is no dependence on larval age in other words we do not assume there is an underlying distribution of time until pupation in this variation we fit two or three parameters a constant on survival or development time and one or two parameters related to the density functions recall that we consider two versions of variation ad and d one with the density function effecting development time and the other effecting survival if the density function does not impact survival the probability of survival is constant for each functional form and variation we fit the daily pupation count from our model with the recorded daily pupation counts from the data we use the fminsearch function in matlab to minimize the root mean squared error from fifty different initial values under a set of constraints our initial values come from latin hypercube sampling lhs of each parameter range our lhs divides each parameter range into 50 segments and only a single value is chosen per segment we choose bounds for the initial values which are narrower than our optimization constraints for instance we choose the initial values of the standard deviation of the gamma distribution between 0 5 and 30 but during the optimization algorithm the constraint given to fminsearch is such that it may choose any value greater than 0 5 for the standard deviation of the gamma distribution see table 2 for the full list of bounds and constraints we record the final error and optimized parameters after fminsearch terminated the algorithm terminated either if it had converged to a local minimum or if it had reached the maximum iterations allowed in fig s4 we show box plots of all 50 values recorded the bar indicates the minimum error found among all 50 runs where fig 3 only includes the bar indicating the minimum error of all 50 runs for the remainder of this work we report only the minimum error in order to compare the different density functions we use the aikake information criteria aic given by aic n log ϵ i 2 n 2 k where k is the number of parameters in the model n is the sample size of the data and ϵ i is the error of the model on the i th day burnham and anderson 2004 the aic evaluates goodness of fit but penalizes for using more parameters which is important as we consider both one and two parameter density functions the number of parameters k differs by variation as discussed above the sample size n is more complicated the data set of pupation data from hancock et al 2016a includes 172 days of pupation data however as pupation is a biological process dependent on time and environment these 172 time points are not truly independent of each other thus we consider n to be the effective sample size which we take to be n 172 d where d is the number of days included in the density history we consider a history length of one day initially and then also consider 2 to 36 days of history in other words if there are d days effecting the outcome then we would expect that two data points d days apart would be independent which leads to 172 d independent samples finally the ϵ i 2 n is also an estimated value for all models so we include one extra parameter in all aic calculations burnham and anderson 2004 2 8 model implementation all results were implemented in matlab version 2016b the latin hypercube sampling was implemented using the matlab command lhs with the upper and lower bound shifted to the values described in table 2 for each variation of the model we looped through the 50 initial values created with the latin hypercube sampling and ran the fminsearch to minimize the root mean squared error the full code is available on github https github com melody289 simple functional density 3 results we fit our model to the semi field cage data by considering the three variations of the model a larval age structured model without density dependence ad larval age structured model with density dependence and d non age structured model with density dependence we consider the impact of larval density on two components of the model development time and larval survival 3 1 minimum root mean squared error for comparison for a baseline comparison we calculated the root mean squared error for variation a which excludes the impact of larval density in this case all larvae only pupate based on larval age incorporated as a gamma distribution from time since hatching the best fit model without density has a root mean squared error of 290 fig 1 to compare to previous work we calculate a root mean squared error of approximately 132 from the fits reported in hancock et al 2016a these two values are used as comparisons against the variations in which larval density in development time and survival are included given the higher complexity of the model in hancock et al 2016a we expect the error from their fit to be lower than from the models in our simpler and more broadly implementable framework 3 2 both larval age and larval density are important for modeling realistic pupation times we found that the model that included both larval age structure and density dependence impacting development time variation ad provided the best model fit to the data importantly the model without any density dependence was generally the worst fit to the data fig 3 in particular this model predicted no pupation after day 145 despite observed pupation until day 174 fig 1 additionally the model including both larval age structure and density dependent development time variation ad captured the temporal trends in pupation observed in the data much better than the model with density alone variation d which only captures average behavior of the trends in pupation observed in the data fig s5 furthermore the model with density dependent survival and no age structure variation d provided a better fit to the data than the model with age structure alone variation a or age structure and density dependent survival variation ad fig 3 we consider a simple incorporation of larval density dependence on development time via changes to the daily probability of pupation furthermore we assume that larval density dependence is only dependent on density of larvae from the previous day in this context we consider each of the seven functional forms found in table 1 for the incorporation of larval density the minimum root mean square error is lower for nearly all formulations incorporating larval density dependence on development time both with and without the underlying gamma distribution based on larval age fig 3 blue bars the exception is function 1b when density dependence alone is considered variation d all two parameter functions result in similar minimum root mean square error values although 2b slightly outperforms the others there is significantly more variation in the root mean square error for the functions with a single parameter describing density dependence than those with two parameters fig 3 amongst the one parameter functions describing density dependence function 1c is the best and in some cases has an error comparable to those of the two parameter functions there is less variation between functional forms when larval density impacts the survival term the best overall for describing survival is function 2b with variation d fig 3c survival as a function of density has a lower root mean squared error in all cases than in the model without density fig 3a and yellow bars in fig 3b c density in survival does not follow the temporal trend well in variation ad the peaks and low points of pupation have no correlation to the actual data or they are flat without much variation fig s5 in variation d our model results are more similar to the data in that the noise is greater than in other cases however it does not show high enough peaks and pupation ceases much earlier than in the data fig s6 3 3 larval density is important for realistic variation in timing to pupation unlike with experimental data our mathematical model allows us to study properties of individual cohorts such as the distribution of pupation times without the inclusion of larval density variation a every cohort pupates similarly with no variation figs 4 s6 in contrast with the inclusion of larval density variations ad and d the amount of variation on time to pupation extends as the larval density in the experiment increases fig 4 middle panels without effects of larval age and only including effects of larval density variation d the time to pupation becomes more varied by the amount of larvae fig 4 bottom panel this is particularly evident when larval density impacts development time furthermore when no larval density is included variation a the larvae finish pupating well before the actual end of pupation seen in the data indicating the importance of larval density figs 1 s6 3 4 density dependent development time leads to a better model fit to data than density dependent survival in every case except function 1b in variation d including density dependent development time has a lower minimum root mean squared error than density dependent survival fig 3 only in variation d does density dependent survival have root mean squared error comparable to density dependent development time for two parameter functions this is not true with one parameter functions comparing the temporal trends density dependent development time is much closer to the overall trend of the data than density dependent survival fig s5 this suggests that including density effects on development time is more accurate than including it on survival of larvae 3 5 larval density from the previous day best predicts pupation next we expand on variations that include larval density variations ad and d and consider history beyond a single day from 2 to 36 days recall in these cases the input to the density function is the average total larval density of all days considered note that if a cohort has been alive for fewer days than the length of history then for that cohort we only average the days on which the cohort was alive the density functions with two parameters have similar error in each of the variations fig 5 overall the two parameter functions have lower error when both larval density and larval age are included in development time variation ad compared with larval density alone in development time variation d the lowest error observed is around 168 for all two parameter density functions which occurs when we include 20 days of larval density history in the average for function 2c however including other lengths of history produce similar error density dependent survival does best in the case of variation d for functions 2a and 2b without the age structure this is consistent with bellows 1981 as they looked at these functions applied to survival and found that generally the data for survival fit better with functions 2a and 2b as with simpler history the density independent case variation a is always worse than the two parameter density functions regardless of the history considered the exception is function 1b with density dependent development time which performs similarly to variation a under most histories fig 5 3 6 the history of larval density is likely important despite an absence of signal in our data while fitting the experimental data we find that larval density from only the previous day no history predicts pupation time best however there are several potential reasons why there could be importance of a history of larval density that is masked including i the implicit incorporation of history dependence due to the continuity of the experiment and ii noise in the experimental data to test the latter we created simulated data from a chosen underlying larval density function and added noise to varying degrees we then attempted to recover the density history used we find that at lower levels of noise we can recover the accurate number of days of larval density used but at greater amounts of noise we can no longer determine this value figs 6 s7 it is possible that the noise in the experimental data is above this threshold 3 7 two parameter density functions outperform one parameter density functions in general we aim to choose a more parsimonious model but have models that differ in the number of parameters we focus on the best one parameter and two parameter density functions functions 1 c and 2 b respectively and compare aic with varying lengths of history the aic gives a penalty for the extra parameters so we can compare between the one and two parameter density functions the sample size however is not independent as we vary the length of density history so we cannot compare aic values with different history lengths despite this we can compare between functions when considering the same history length as all functions have the same sample size in that case in order to visually compare aic we consider a relative aic where we divide all aic by the largest value for a given density history with this penalty the best one parameter function function 1 c is relatively better than the best two parameter function function 2 b for both variations ad and d when more than six days of history are included fig 7 prior to six days of density history the two parameter function 2 b is better than 1 c if we then look at function 1 c and 2 b with a penalty for the number of parameters by using the aic we see that given any length of history density dependent development time captures the number of larvae that pupate better than density dependent survival when longer history is considered then density dependent survival with variation d using function 1 c is second best but putting the exact same density function on development time is still better fig 7 generally larval density alone on development time variation d has the smallest error when extra parameters are penalized fig 7 4 discussion in this paper we developed a modeling approach to investigate the importance of multiple facets of density dependent development and survival on the pupation of ae aegypti mosquitoes we showed that overall the inclusion of density dependent effects improved the model s fit to the data however choices of functional form the life process directly impacted and inclusion of larval density history all played a role in the quality of the model fit while the importance of density in the life cycle of ae aegypti has long been known inclusion of density dependence in modeling studies often lies at the extremes of complexity very simple dye 1984 bellows 1981 or very complex magori et al 2009 focks et al 1993 hancock et al 2016a herein we examined density dependence through a model of intermediate complexity to help bridge the gap between the extremes when comparing density dependent survival against density dependent development we found that the model with density dependent development better described the data this is an important result that adds to the growing body of literature emphasizing the importance of density dependent ae aegypti development hancock et al 2016a couret et al 2014 until recently the focus on density dependence in ae aegypti has been primarily on survival bellows 1981 dye 1984 legros et al 2009 walsh et al 2011 2013 while understanding density dependent survival of mosquito populations is important the failure to properly characterize density dependent effects on mosquito development could have severe consequences on efforts to eliminate or reduce mosquito populations modeling studies assessing the feasibility of population reduction strategies indicate that density dependent regulation of survival could impede success of strategies in which lethality occurs in early larval stages phuc et al 2007 atkinson et al 2007 and that the functional form of density dependent feedback could influence the success of control approaches robert et al 2012 other modeling studies have shown that the success of population replacement or reduction replacement combination strategies may depend upon the form and strength of density dependent regulation robert et al 2014 okamoto et al 2014 huang et al 2011 hancock et al 2016b these studies have focused on the impact of density dependent larval mortality on control strategies studies aimed at understanding the role that density dependent development could play in population control have been less numerous and many of those studies utilize complex models that consider numerous biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to larval development and other life stages magori et al 2009 okamoto et al 2013 focks et al 1993 our work emphasizes that density dependent development should be considered alongside density dependent survival in studies aimed at understanding the impacts of mosquito control measures overall we showed that the density dependent functions with two parameters provided a better fit than those with only one parameter even when penalizing the two parameter functions for the additional parameter this result is in agreement with previous studies aimed at assessing simple models of density dependence in particular the work of bellows 1981 from which the density dependent functional forms were taken showed that the two parameter models were generally better at describing the data analyzed in that work our results here and those of studies prior to the present one indicate that the complex nature of the population response to density is difficult to describe in a parsimonious way however the two parameter functions in density dependent development time were able to reproduce the general trends observed in the data of hancock et al 2016a fig s5 furthermore the simplicity of the two parameter functions considered in our model should allow for a fairly straightforward application of our model to other data sets whereas the complex nature of the model in hancock et al 2016a requires data at a resolution that may be finer than many studies can produce while we found that variation a in which no density is included provided a worse fit than the other variations we considered each of the remaining two variations had its own advantages future work with this model should choose the variation that is most appropriate for the study being conducted variation ad does better at describing the shape of the distribution of pupation timing but using density alone variation d may be sufficient if timing of pupation is not as important in this case the total pupation across the experiment is similar although the temporal trends of pupation are not captured overall variation d acts more like an average while variation ad captures more temporal trends an estimate of the total pupation across an interval may be sufficient for some studies while more nuanced temporal trends may be required in other cases in our analysis of the impact of density history on larval development and survival we found that in general inclusion of density counts across multiple previous days did not improve the fit of the model to the data when compared to only including the density of the previous day furthermore we found this result to hold even when we weighted density differently i e allowing for density of the most recent days to be more important than that of earlier days this was surprising because previous studies suggest that impacts of density should be cumulative walsh et al 2012 2013 that is a larva s response to density should be a function of the density of the population over its lifetime not just on the day before it pupates as our investigation suggests it may be that the variability in the data prevented proper analysis of the cumulative effects of density while our results did not produce the expected outcome we feel that this topic is still important to consider in future empirical statistical and modeling studies if density dependent responses are assumed to be dependent only on the previous day s population modeling studies aimed at investigating population control strategies will misrepresent the impacts of control measures if density responses are indeed cumulative this is particularly true of control measures that involve releasing additional mosquitoes into the population such as genetic strategies or strategies involving the release of wolbachia infected mosquitoes we have focused on the role of density dependence in intra specific competition primarily within a single species we have touched on potential impact in a population with the introduction of a similar genetic make up such as wolbachia infected mosquitoes we hypothesize that density dependence could have a more nuanced role in inter specific competition between similar species that are known to occasionally inhabit the same area such as ae albopictus and ae aegypti in such a case other competition factors such as food availability would also need to be included murrell and juliano 2014 while the work presented here underscores the importance of considering density dependent emergence in ae aegypti populations we emphasize that our results have some limitations namely this analysis was performed on a single data set from one study in which the quality of the data was exceptional beyond what is produced from many similar studies one goal of this work was to produce a model that provides a simplistic description of density dependent emergence in mosquito populations so that the model can be easily adapted to different data unfortunately we found a lack of similar available data sets on which to test our model s robustness it will be important to validate this model across data sets to improve its functionality our work is intended to investigate the impacts of different types of density dependence in juvenile stages as one goal of this study is to compare among these types we aimed to reduce the influence of additional factors thus our work does not consider the role of abiotic influences such as temperature and humidity on population regulation nor does it consider density dependence in every life stage supported by empirical work for example temperature and its fluctuations are known to impact multiple mosquito life history traits such as mortality rates and development time carrington et al 2013 couret et al 2014 marini et al 2016 variation in population density can sometimes be due to either environmental variability or density dependence and disentangling relative contributions of each can be difficult thus considering individual and combined effects of both is important saitoh and cohen 2018 in hancock et al 2016a the authors note that they observe a relationship between water temperature and larval development in the data importantly they find the correlation with temperature much weaker than that with larval density thus we focus on larval density as a primary factor and do not consider other dependencies here they also find that fecundity is influenced by density dependence however our work is focused on feedback specific to juvenile stages which resulted in an extensive study on its own future work should consider the impact of density dependence in the juvenile stages on adult fecundity as well the influence of temperature humidity and other environmental variables on these processes future extensions of our model could also lead to the development of spatial models aimed at investigating interactions between density dependence and spatial heterogeneity and continuous time analogs to the work here both of these avenues while important are beyond the scope of the present study in this study we focused our analysis on ae aegypti mosquitoes which are important vectors of pathogens and are known to experience density dependent population regulation in the juvenile stages with some species specific modifications our analysis can be extended to other mosquito species particularly other container inhabiting mosquito species that experience density dependent regulation in the juvenile stages such as aedes albopictus culex pipiens culex quinquefasciatus and culex tarsalis all of which have been implicated in pathogen transmission vezzani 2007 goddard et al 2002 gratz 2004 a number of other aedes and culex species are also container inhabiting and likely to be regulated by density dependence in the juvenile stages vezzani 2007 efforts to model density dependence in these mosquito populations have been similar to those for ae aegypti in which models are simplified and density dependence when included is most often in mortality terms in juvenile mosquitoes erickson et al 2010 tran et al 2013 bowman et al 2005 ahumada et al 2004 ewing et al 2016 our results will likely contribute to improvements in modeling density dependence in multiple container inhabiting mosquitoes in addition to ae aegypti although differences in parameterization of the life history traits must be considered when applying these results to other species 4 1 conclusion our model and the present work follow a decades long history aimed at investigating the importance of density dependence in ae aegypti populations via both empirical and modeling studies our model lies near the center of a spectrum of complexity at one extreme many of the complex models consider explicit day to day changes in survival and emergence and require high resolution data to validate at the other extreme are models that are more simplistic and generally aimed at studying density dependence primarily from a qualitative perspective with its intermediate level of complexity our model will be a useful tool both for studying density dependence with data at high or low resolutions and for investigating interesting theoretical questions the present work has underscored that density dependence in ae aegypti populations is a complex process that impacts both survival and development of larvae that density dependent emergence was more important to consider in our study than density dependent survival is an important significant result that needs to be investigated

24682,mosquitoes are vectors of numerous pathogens that cause infectious diseases and they pose a significant global health burden as a result as such more reliable field relevant models to study mosquito population dynamics and life history traits such as development time and survival of mosquito larva would be of great value in aedes mosquitoes progression through early life stages is known to be density dependent despite its importance density dependence is largely ignored or oversimplified in many existing simulation models leading to less accurate predictions of development and survival during the early life stages furthermore density dependence is frequently assumed to impact only larval survival and not development time in models despite empirical evidence for density dependent development here we develop a discrete time model of mosquito larval population dynamics which accounts for density impacts on both survival and development time we demonstrate the validity of our model using publicly available semi field data of larval density and pupation time across a six month experiment using our model we found that incorporating density dependence during larval development is important to the accurate prediction of mosquito pupation this is especially true when considering density dependent development time for mosquito larva as opposed to density dependent larval survival we determined that the incorporation of simple functional forms to describe density dependence in simulation models gives improved prediction results over models that ignore density dependence entirely such simple functional forms can easily be incorporated into existing models and thus help improve field relevant models of mosquito population dynamics particularly in aedes and other container inhabiting mosquitoes that are known to experience density dependence during larval development keywords density dependence aedes mosquitoes mosquito development time mathematical

estimates that 3 1 billion was spent on combating malaria in 2017 tavernise 2016 who 2018 global efforts to reduce diseases spread by mosquitoes primarily involve insecticides but mosquitoes are now becoming resistant to many common insecticides ranson and lissenden 2016 there is a need for new and innovative ways to decrease the size and geographic distribution of mosquito populations to that end efforts to better understand mosquito population dynamics have increased with hopes of finding ways to exploit those dynamics through control measures mosquitoes go through several life stages before emerging as adults the duration of each life stage is dependent on species but the order of progression is similar for most species first an adult mosquito will lay a batch of eggs which depending on environmental factors and species can include up to as many as 200 eggs hancock et al 2016a after hatching in water juvenile mosquitoes go through four larval stages instars followed by a pupal stage after the pupal stage the mosquitoes emerge from the water as adults in the adult stage the female mosquitoes require bloodmeals in order for their eggs to develop klowden and briegel 1994 the source of bloodmeals depend on the mosquito species but some mosquitoes preferentially bite humans which facilitates mosquito borne disease spread harrington et al 2001 ponlawat and harrington 2005 in some mosquito populations progression through developmental stages is regulated by density dependence a process of nonlinear feedback that may affect survival development fecundity and other life history characteristics for example there is significant evidence that for mosquitoes in the genus aedes there is density dependence in survival and development time briegel and timmermann 2001 couret et al 2014 hancock et al 2016a aedes are container inhabiting mosquitoes meaning they lay eggs in small containers which can be natural or man made the amount of resources available in the small containers is limited so survival and development times change with respect to density as a result of competition laboratory studies have shown a significant increase in development time for large increases in density in one study of aedes albopictus an increase in larvae of a factor of five led to a doubling of development time briegel and timmermann 2001 a study of aedes aegypti showed an increase in development time by approximately 50 when increasing the density by a factor of eight couret et al 2014 mathematical models have long been used to study mosquito populations ross 1911 and spread of mosquito borne disease macdonald 1957 ross 1911 reiner et al 2013 in such models processes are often simplified so that studies may focus on specific questions for instance in many mosquito borne disease models only the susceptible and infectious adult mosquitoes are included and all other life stages are ignored in a review of mathematical modeling of mosquitoes that looked at 388 papers reiner et al 2013 found that only 45 explicitly modeled the aquatic stages without the aquatic stages density dependence is typically not explicitly included many more recent models still ignore larval stages and consider constant birth rate with no density dependence e g agusto et al 2017 dodero rojas et al 2020 kamiya et al 2020 olawoyin and kribs 2020 sanchez et al 2018 zhang and wang 2020 in the past decade it has become more common for modeling studies to include density dependence however the form in which it appears and the stages which it affects vary density dependent birth is common with or without the explicit larval stages and typically is found in the form of a logistic term e g abdelrazec and gumel 2017 cardona salgado et al 2020 iftikhar et al 2020 lega et al 2017 liu et al 2020b a pliego pliego et al 2020 rafikov et al 2019 suarez et al 2020 zhang and lui 2020 other models consider a density dependent death rate which increases with reduced resources natiello and solari 2020 or with greater density as measured by population size e g el moustaid and johnson 2019 haramboure et al 2020 marini et al 2019 tran et al 2020 pasquali et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 robert et al 2014 excluding density dependence in models or making faulty assumptions about how density dependence affects a population could impede a model s ability to describe the system appropriately models that do include density dependence typically introduce it as an effect on survival often the process is simplified by only considering non linear emergence or non linear death in particular in the review by reiner et al 2013 most of the models which incorporated density did so in the birth term in the form of logistic growth with carrying capacity some others considered a density dependent death term in early work bellows 1981 shows the importance of density in survival of beetles compared to constant survival this work examines multiple functions which determine the proportion of beetles surviving from the density in legros et al 2009 the authors examine the model form that bellows determined as most flexible equation 2a in table 1 of the present work using experimental survival of larval stages to identify the density dependent and independent parameters they find that there are multiple parameter sets that give similar fits but conclude evidence of the importance of density in survival density dependence may alter other life history traits in addition to survival such as development time in comparison to effects on survival very little mathematical modeling work has considered density in development time one notable exception is work by hancock et al 2016a using an extensive semi field experiment they analyze how dynamical changes in the density of larvae affect the variation of development times among cohorts of mosquitoes in particular they constructed a data fitted statistical model to estimate the number of larvae pupating each week this modeling study follows work aimed at empirically exploring the relationship between larval density and development time in ae aegypti such as the study by couret et al 2014 in which the authors found that density is an important factor because it alters the amount of food available to each larva which in turn increases development time in the present work we aim to develop a simple treatment of density dependence in the larval population that is sufficient to capture the dynamics of mosquito pupation we examine the impact of density dependence on both larval development time and survival specifically we consider how development of aedes aegypti in a semi field cage experimental population is impacted by the density of the population this data was generated from an extensive and laborious experiment and is not indicative of data that is available for many studies thus we construct a simple mathematical model to estimate the number of larvae that pupate based in part on the density of larvae in the population we use this model to determine the best way to incorporate density dependence into models in a simple way we begin by reviewing the results of hancock et al 2016a and describe how we utilize their data for our study then we outline our underlying discrete model of pupation including density dependence and larval age next we present results for fitting several variations of the model to the data from hancock et al 2016a finally we discuss these results and their implications for future studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we build upon work by hancock et al 2016a in which the authors conducted an extensive semi field experiment using their experimental data they model number of pupae and timing of pupation based on larval density details of their full methodology can be found in hancock et al 2016a in short the authors monitor the number of larvae and pupae over a six month period three times per week they feed the female mosquitoes and allow them to lay eggs into a single container in the semi field cage the eggs are collected and incubated for hatching upon hatching all larvae are placed together into the same larval container in the semi field cage three times a week the total larvae are counted while newly emerged pupae are counted daily using the number pupating each day as their output variable they fit the distribution of larval development time for cohorts grouped by week they use a markov chain monte carlo metropolis hasting algorithm and estimate 40 total parameters the mean and standard deviation of a shifted gamma distribution for each of 20 weeks in addition they estimate the larval survival rate for each day by extrapolating daily survival based on the three observations of total larval population each week they compare the total number predicted to pupate on a given day compared to the actual number recorded fig 1 gold and red lines in the present work an additional major component of their results is how density dependence in the larvae population affects wolbachia invasion which is beyond the scope of this paper hancock et al 2016a we use raw data reported in the hancock et al 2016a study in two ways first each new cohort in our model is determined from the number of new larvae input into the container on a particular day second we estimate parameters by comparing the reported number of mosquitoes pupating on each day that pupation was reported to our model output fig s1 our model is formulated to test different density functions using the data from hancock et al 2016a so we do not consider the egg stage because the experimental data removes the eggs hatches them elsewhere and returns the larvae in their paper a different gamma distribution is fit specifically to the data from each week the change in the resulting gamma distribution for each week is how they determine the effects of density we instead consider a single functional form for all weeks with density as an input thus what is experienced by the larvae changes based on density but individuals encountering the same density are impacted identically we consider various functional forms for the density input and how to incorporate them described in detail in the next section in order to compare these models we calculate the error between the number of predicted pupae appearing each day and the number of new pupae observed we consider our computation of their error as a best case scenario as we use a model with many fewer parameters utilizing a single function for pupation we do not expect to be able to fit the data as precisely we will use our computed error of the data in hancock et al 2016a throughout this paper to compare all model selections note that in the present study we consider in our calculations of error only nineteen of the twenty fitted gamma distributions in the work of hancock et al 2016a we omit the first gamma distribution fitted in their work as it is completely separated from the rest and appears differently in the data set 2 2 model formulation we develop a discrete time model of mosquito development from the first larval stage through pupation we explicitly account for groups of larvae appearing on the same day by including age structured compartments for larvae in the model we track each cohort separately we use the term cohort to refer to a group of larvae hatching on the same day we denote each cohort with a superscript and denote model time with a subscript e g l j i is the number of larvae remaining in the i th cohort on day j fig 2 for example l 7 3 represents the number of larvae in the third cohort alive on day 7 using the data provided we have 54 cohorts which we label from 1 to 54 in order of time of birth each day some larvae are lost to mortality the timing of pupation is dictated by a function of larval age and larval density once larvae have pupated we reduce the number of larvae accordingly we compare the number pupated each day in our discrete model with experimental data on pupation in fig 2 we show a schematic of the model structure for three representative cohorts we consider several variations to our model we begin with a simple form without density dependence but where larval age is the only factor determining development time to the pupal stage survival is accounted for in this variation through the probability of daily survival s which varies between 0 and 1 we denote this variation a for age then we investigate adding density dependence into the model without removing age as a factor in development time denoted variation ad for age and density we consider seven possible functions to incorporate density into our discrete model table 1 as the goal is to find a simple functional form to include in simulation models we then consider removing the impacts of age on development time denoted variation d for density as it is more common to assume density dependence alters survival and not development time we consider variations ad and d with density impacting either development time or daily survival we consider impacts on development time and survival separately to better understand the individual impacts of density on development and survival without either being influenced by the other 2 3 larval development time without density as a baseline variation a we fit the pupation output from our model without including larval density we assume that in the absence of density dependent factors the probability of pupating on a given day follows a fixed distribution we considered several distributions including gamma negative binomial normal poisson and exponential as the choice of distribution had little impact on our results fig s2 we chose to focus on the gamma distribution for consistency of comparison to previous work we restrict larvae such that they cannot pupate until the fifth day which we represent by g t t i 4 where the value of t i is the day cohort i hatches and fit the mean and variance of the gamma distribution we fit a single gamma distribution for all weeks which assumes a single underlying distribution of pupation time in the absence of density in addition we set constraints on the mean and variance in order for the distribution to be biologically relevant specifically we constrain the variance of the gamma distribution to be above 0 5 and the mean of the gamma distribution to be between 1 and 35 days such that after the shift the mean pupation time is between 5 and 39 days 2 4 larval development time with density to incorporate the impact of density dependence we let the function f d t be the fraction of larvae that pupate at time t 1 where d t is the total larval density at time t table 1 we incorporate this function in both variations ad and d with effects on either development time or survival to include development time with variation ad we multiply f d t by the gamma distribution which extends development time for example l t i is the number of larvae from cohort i alive on day t and p t i is the number of pupae that pupate from larval cohort i on day t the model for cohort i can be written is as follows l t 1 i s l t i 1 f d t g t t i 4 p t 1 i s l t i f d t g t t i 4 where g t t i 4 is the cumulative gamma distribution at time t t i 4 we restrict pupation prior to day 5 such that if t t i 5 then g t t i 4 0 this is due to the assumption that all larvae need a minimum time prior to pupation which we take to be 5 days hancock et al 2016a when considering density dependent survival rather than development time for variation ad we incorporate density dependence into the probability of survival this amounts to a subtle mathematical change where f d t replaces s from the previous model as shown by l t 1 i f d t l t i 1 g t t i 4 p t 1 i f d t l t i g t t i 4 for variation d we remove the gamma distribution so that the larval age does not impact development time instead we replace the gamma distribution with the density function and include the survival constant s as given by l t 1 i s l t i 1 f d t p t 1 i s l t i f d t however in the case of variation d with density dependent survival our function for fraction of larvae that pupate becomes a constant ρ l t 1 i f d t l t i 1 ρ p t 1 i f d t l t i ρ 2 5 functional forms for density dependence for the incorporation of density f d t we consider seven different functional forms listed in table 1 all of these forms are adapted from bellows 1981 to ensure that f 0 1 this equates to the assumption that in the absence of larvae there would be no effect of density bellows 1981 uses these forms to show the importance of density in survival of beetles compared to constant survival the author examines multiple functions which determine the proportion of beetles surviving daily based on the density we use adjusted forms of the functions to modify development time and survival of larvae in mosquitoes as population size approaches infinity all of these forms approach zero 2 6 history of density dependence to begin we consider the larval density d t only on the day immediately prior to pupation in this case d t is the total number of larvae on day t 1 in fig 2 d t assuming the simplest form for a given day is listed at the bottom for each day we also considered history of density across various time periods from 2 to 36 days for example a history of three days means that we averaged the number of larvae present on days t 3 t 2 and t 1 if we consider the illustrative example in fig 2 on day 6 both cohort l 1 and l 2 are able to pupate as they have survived the minimum five day period prior to pupation if we consider a history of three days then we sum up all larvae on days 3 4 and 5 and then divide by three i e to compute d 3 4 5 d 3 l 2 1 s l 2 2 s d 4 l 3 1 s l 3 2 s l 4 3 d 5 l 4 1 s 1 f d 2 3 4 g 1 l 4 2 s l 4 3 s d 3 4 5 d 3 d 4 d 5 3 notice that on day 5 new larvae enter the population through the term l 4 3 rather than survival of larvae from previous days as in other terms this is the only appearance of new larvae in this example shown in fig 2 in our simulations new larvae enter the population according to the data in addition to a simple average described above we also considered weighting the density differently e g giving more weight to most recent history however we did not see significant differences fig s3 thus in this work when we refer to density history we use a simple arithmetic average 2 7 parameter estimation the number of parameters varies with the complexity of the model variation we run three different variations table 3 in order to compare the importance of larval age and larval density variation a is without any consideration of density larvae pupate solely based on larval age i e the time since hatching we fit three parameters in this variation the survival constant and the mean and standard deviation of the gamma distribution in variation ad we include both effects of larval age and larval density in this variation we fit three to five parameters the survival constant in the case when density affects development time the mean and variance of the gamma distribution and one or two parameters related to the density functions in variation d we only include density as there is no dependence on larval age in other words we do not assume there is an underlying distribution of time until pupation in this variation we fit two or three parameters a constant on survival or development time and one or two parameters related to the density functions recall that we consider two versions of variation ad and d one with the density function effecting development time and the other effecting survival if the density function does not impact survival the probability of survival is constant for each functional form and variation we fit the daily pupation count from our model with the recorded daily pupation counts from the data we use the fminsearch function in matlab to minimize the root mean squared error from fifty different initial values under a set of constraints our initial values come from latin hypercube sampling lhs of each parameter range our lhs divides each parameter range into 50 segments and only a single value is chosen per segment we choose bounds for the initial values which are narrower than our optimization constraints for instance we choose the initial values of the standard deviation of the gamma distribution between 0 5 and 30 but during the optimization algorithm the constraint given to fminsearch is such that it may choose any value greater than 0 5 for the standard deviation of the gamma distribution see table 2 for the full list of bounds and constraints we record the final error and optimized parameters after fminsearch terminated the algorithm terminated either if it had converged to a local minimum or if it had reached the maximum iterations allowed in fig s4 we show box plots of all 50 values recorded the bar indicates the minimum error found among all 50 runs where fig 3 only includes the bar indicating the minimum error of all 50 runs for the remainder of this work we report only the minimum error in order to compare the different density functions we use the aikake information criteria aic given by aic n log ϵ i 2 n 2 k where k is the number of parameters in the model n is the sample size of the data and ϵ i is the error of the model on the i th day burnham and anderson 2004 the aic evaluates goodness of fit but penalizes for using more parameters which is important as we consider both one and two parameter density functions the number of parameters k differs by variation as discussed above the sample size n is more complicated the data set of pupation data from hancock et al 2016a includes 172 days of pupation data however as pupation is a biological process dependent on time and environment these 172 time points are not truly independent of each other thus we consider n to be the effective sample size which we take to be n 172 d where d is the number of days included in the density history we consider a history length of one day initially and then also consider 2 to 36 days of history in other words if there are d days effecting the outcome then we would expect that two data points d days apart would be independent which leads to 172 d independent samples finally the ϵ i 2 n is also an estimated value for all models so we include one extra parameter in all aic calculations burnham and anderson 2004 2 8 model implementation all results were implemented in matlab version 2016b the latin hypercube sampling was implemented using the matlab command lhs with the upper and lower bound shifted to the values described in table 2 for each variation of the model we looped through the 50 initial values created with the latin hypercube sampling and ran the fminsearch to minimize the root mean squared error the full code is available on github https github com melody289 simple functional density 3 results we fit our model to the semi field cage data by considering the three variations of the model a larval age structured model without density dependence ad larval age structured model with density dependence and d non age structured model with density dependence we consider the impact of larval density on two components of the model development time and larval survival 3 1 minimum root mean squared error for comparison for a baseline comparison we calculated the root mean squared error for variation a which excludes the impact of larval density in this case all larvae only pupate based on larval age incorporated as a gamma distribution from time since hatching the best fit model without density has a root mean squared error of 290 fig 1 to compare to previous work we calculate a root mean squared error of approximately 132 from the fits reported in hancock et al 2016a these two values are used as comparisons against the variations in which larval density in development time and survival are included given the higher complexity of the model in hancock et al 2016a we expect the error from their fit to be lower than from the models in our simpler and more broadly implementable framework 3 2 both larval age and larval density are important for modeling realistic pupation times we found that the model that included both larval age structure and density dependence impacting development time variation ad provided the best model fit to the data importantly the model without any density dependence was generally the worst fit to the data fig 3 in particular this model predicted no pupation after day 145 despite observed pupation until day 174 fig 1 additionally the model including both larval age structure and density dependent development time variation ad captured the temporal trends in pupation observed in the data much better than the model with density alone variation d which only captures average behavior of the trends in pupation observed in the data fig s5 furthermore the model with density dependent survival and no age structure variation d provided a better fit to the data than the model with age structure alone variation a or age structure and density dependent survival variation ad fig 3 we consider a simple incorporation of larval density dependence on development time via changes to the daily probability of pupation furthermore we assume that larval density dependence is only dependent on density of larvae from the previous day in this context we consider each of the seven functional forms found in table 1 for the incorporation of larval density the minimum root mean square error is lower for nearly all formulations incorporating larval density dependence on development time both with and without the underlying gamma distribution based on larval age fig 3 blue bars the exception is function 1b when density dependence alone is considered variation d all two parameter functions result in similar minimum root mean square error values although 2b slightly outperforms the others there is significantly more variation in the root mean square error for the functions with a single parameter describing density dependence than those with two parameters fig 3 amongst the one parameter functions describing density dependence function 1c is the best and in some cases has an error comparable to those of the two parameter functions there is less variation between functional forms when larval density impacts the survival term the best overall for describing survival is function 2b with variation d fig 3c survival as a function of density has a lower root mean squared error in all cases than in the model without density fig 3a and yellow bars in fig 3b c density in survival does not follow the temporal trend well in variation ad the peaks and low points of pupation have no correlation to the actual data or they are flat without much variation fig s5 in variation d our model results are more similar to the data in that the noise is greater than in other cases however it does not show high enough peaks and pupation ceases much earlier than in the data fig s6 3 3 larval density is important for realistic variation in timing to pupation unlike with experimental data our mathematical model allows us to study properties of individual cohorts such as the distribution of pupation times without the inclusion of larval density variation a every cohort pupates similarly with no variation figs 4 s6 in contrast with the inclusion of larval density variations ad and d the amount of variation on time to pupation extends as the larval density in the experiment increases fig 4 middle panels without effects of larval age and only including effects of larval density variation d the time to pupation becomes more varied by the amount of larvae fig 4 bottom panel this is particularly evident when larval density impacts development time furthermore when no larval density is included variation a the larvae finish pupating well before the actual end of pupation seen in the data indicating the importance of larval density figs 1 s6 3 4 density dependent development time leads to a better model fit to data than density dependent survival in every case except function 1b in variation d including density dependent development time has a lower minimum root mean squared error than density dependent survival fig 3 only in variation d does density dependent survival have root mean squared error comparable to density dependent development time for two parameter functions this is not true with one parameter functions comparing the temporal trends density dependent development time is much closer to the overall trend of the data than density dependent survival fig s5 this suggests that including density effects on development time is more accurate than including it on survival of larvae 3 5 larval density from the previous day best predicts pupation next we expand on variations that include larval density variations ad and d and consider history beyond a single day from 2 to 36 days recall in these cases the input to the density function is the average total larval density of all days considered note that if a cohort has been alive for fewer days than the length of history then for that cohort we only average the days on which the cohort was alive the density functions with two parameters have similar error in each of the variations fig 5 overall the two parameter functions have lower error when both larval density and larval age are included in development time variation ad compared with larval density alone in development time variation d the lowest error observed is around 168 for all two parameter density functions which occurs when we include 20 days of larval density history in the average for function 2c however including other lengths of history produce similar error density dependent survival does best in the case of variation d for functions 2a and 2b without the age structure this is consistent with bellows 1981 as they looked at these functions applied to survival and found that generally the data for survival fit better with functions 2a and 2b as with simpler history the density independent case variation a is always worse than the two parameter density functions regardless of the history considered the exception is function 1b with density dependent development time which performs similarly to variation a under most histories fig 5 3 6 the history of larval density is likely important despite an absence of signal in our data while fitting the experimental data we find that larval density from only the previous day no history predicts pupation time best however there are several potential reasons why there could be importance of a history of larval density that is masked including i the implicit incorporation of history dependence due to the continuity of the experiment and ii noise in the experimental data to test the latter we created simulated data from a chosen underlying larval density function and added noise to varying degrees we then attempted to recover the density history used we find that at lower levels of noise we can recover the accurate number of days of larval density used but at greater amounts of noise we can no longer determine this value figs 6 s7 it is possible that the noise in the experimental data is above this threshold 3 7 two parameter density functions outperform one parameter density functions in general we aim to choose a more parsimonious model but have models that differ in the number of parameters we focus on the best one parameter and two parameter density functions functions 1 c and 2 b respectively and compare aic with varying lengths of history the aic gives a penalty for the extra parameters so we can compare between the one and two parameter density functions the sample size however is not independent as we vary the length of density history so we cannot compare aic values with different history lengths despite this we can compare between functions when considering the same history length as all functions have the same sample size in that case in order to visually compare aic we consider a relative aic where we divide all aic by the largest value for a given density history with this penalty the best one parameter function function 1 c is relatively better than the best two parameter function function 2 b for both variations ad and d when more than six days of history are included fig 7 prior to six days of density history the two parameter function 2 b is better than 1 c if we then look at function 1 c and 2 b with a penalty for the number of parameters by using the aic we see that given any length of history density dependent development time captures the number of larvae that pupate better than density dependent survival when longer history is considered then density dependent survival with variation d using function 1 c is second best but putting the exact same density function on development time is still better fig 7 generally larval density alone on development time variation d has the smallest error when extra parameters are penalized fig 7 4 discussion in this paper we developed a modeling approach to investigate the importance of multiple facets of density dependent development and survival on the pupation of ae aegypti mosquitoes we showed that overall the inclusion of density dependent effects improved the model s fit to the data however choices of functional form the life process directly impacted and inclusion of larval density history all played a role in the quality of the model fit while the importance of density in the life cycle of ae aegypti has long been known inclusion of density dependence in modeling studies often lies at the extremes of complexity very simple dye 1984 bellows 1981 or very complex magori et al 2009 focks et al 1993 hancock et al 2016a herein we examined density dependence through a model of intermediate complexity to help bridge the gap between the extremes when comparing density dependent survival against density dependent development we found that the model with density dependent development better described the data this is an important result that adds to the growing body of literature emphasizing the importance of density dependent ae aegypti development hancock et al 2016a couret et al 2014 until recently the focus on density dependence in ae aegypti has been primarily on survival bellows 1981 dye 1984 legros et al 2009 walsh et al 2011 2013 while understanding density dependent survival of mosquito populations is important the failure to properly characterize density dependent effects on mosquito development could have severe consequences on efforts to eliminate or reduce mosquito populations modeling studies assessing the feasibility of population reduction strategies indicate that density dependent regulation of survival could impede success of strategies in which lethality occurs in early larval stages phuc et al 2007 atkinson et al 2007 and that the functional form of density dependent feedback could influence the success of control approaches robert et al 2012 other modeling studies have shown that the success of population replacement or reduction replacement combination strategies may depend upon the form and strength of density dependent regulation robert et al 2014 okamoto et al 2014 huang et al 2011 hancock et al 2016b these studies have focused on the impact of density dependent larval mortality on control strategies studies aimed at understanding the role that density dependent development could play in population control have been less numerous and many of those studies utilize complex models that consider numerous biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to larval development and other life stages magori et al 2009 okamoto et al 2013 focks et al 1993 our work emphasizes that density dependent development should be considered alongside density dependent survival in studies aimed at understanding the impacts of mosquito control measures overall we showed that the density dependent functions with two parameters provided a better fit than those with only one parameter even when penalizing the two parameter functions for the additional parameter this result is in agreement with previous studies aimed at assessing simple models of density dependence in particular the work of bellows 1981 from which the density dependent functional forms were taken showed that the two parameter models were generally better at describing the data analyzed in that work our results here and those of studies prior to the present one indicate that the complex nature of the population response to density is difficult to describe in a parsimonious way however the two parameter functions in density dependent development time were able to reproduce the general trends observed in the data of hancock et al 2016a fig s5 furthermore the simplicity of the two parameter functions considered in our model should allow for a fairly straightforward application of our model to other data sets whereas the complex nature of the model in hancock et al 2016a requires data at a resolution that may be finer than many studies can produce while we found that variation a in which no density is included provided a worse fit than the other variations we considered each of the remaining two variations had its own advantages future work with this model should choose the variation that is most appropriate for the study being conducted variation ad does better at describing the shape of the distribution of pupation timing but using density alone variation d may be sufficient if timing of pupation is not as important in this case the total pupation across the experiment is similar although the temporal trends of pupation are not captured overall variation d acts more like an average while variation ad captures more temporal trends an estimate of the total pupation across an interval may be sufficient for some studies while more nuanced temporal trends may be required in other cases in our analysis of the impact of density history on larval development and survival we found that in general inclusion of density counts across multiple previous days did not improve the fit of the model to the data when compared to only including the density of the previous day furthermore we found this result to hold even when we weighted density differently i e allowing for density of the most recent days to be more important than that of earlier days this was surprising because previous studies suggest that impacts of density should be cumulative walsh et al 2012 2013 that is a larva s response to density should be a function of the density of the population over its lifetime not just on the day before it pupates as our investigation suggests it may be that the variability in the data prevented proper analysis of the cumulative effects of density while our results did not produce the expected outcome we feel that this topic is still important to consider in future empirical statistical and modeling studies if density dependent responses are assumed to be dependent only on the previous day s population modeling studies aimed at investigating population control strategies will misrepresent the impacts of control measures if density responses are indeed cumulative this is particularly true of control measures that involve releasing additional mosquitoes into the population such as genetic strategies or strategies involving the release of wolbachia infected mosquitoes we have focused on the role of density dependence in intra specific competition primarily within a single species we have touched on potential impact in a population with the introduction of a similar genetic make up such as wolbachia infected mosquitoes we hypothesize that density dependence could have a more nuanced role in inter specific competition between similar species that are known to occasionally inhabit the same area such as ae albopictus and ae aegypti in such a case other competition factors such as food availability would also need to be included murrell and juliano 2014 while the work presented here underscores the importance of considering density dependent emergence in ae aegypti populations we emphasize that our results have some limitations namely this analysis was performed on a single data set from one study in which the quality of the data was exceptional beyond what is produced from many similar studies one goal of this work was to produce a model that provides a simplistic description of density dependent emergence in mosquito populations so that the model can be easily adapted to different data unfortunately we found a lack of similar available data sets on which to test our model s robustness it will be important to validate this model across data sets to improve its functionality our work is intended to investigate the impacts of different types of density dependence in juvenile stages as one goal of this study is to compare among these types we aimed to reduce the influence of additional factors thus our work does not consider the role of abiotic influences such as temperature and humidity on population regulation nor does it consider density dependence in every life stage supported by empirical work for example temperature and its fluctuations are known to impact multiple mosquito life history traits such as mortality rates and development time carrington et al 2013 couret et al 2014 marini et al 2016 variation in population density can sometimes be due to either environmental variability or density dependence and disentangling relative contributions of each can be difficult thus considering individual and combined effects of both is important saitoh and cohen 2018 in hancock et al 2016a the authors note that they observe a relationship between water temperature and larval development in the data importantly they find the correlation with temperature much weaker than that with larval density thus we focus on larval density as a primary factor and do not consider other dependencies here they also find that fecundity is influenced by density dependence however our work is focused on feedback specific to juvenile stages which resulted in an extensive study on its own future work should consider the impact of density dependence in the juvenile stages on adult fecundity as well the influence of temperature humidity and other environmental variables on these processes future extensions of our model could also lead to the development of spatial models aimed at investigating interactions between density dependence and spatial heterogeneity and continuous time analogs to the work here both of these avenues while important are beyond the scope of the present study in this study we focused our analysis on ae aegypti mosquitoes which are important vectors of pathogens and are known to experience density dependent population regulation in the juvenile stages with some species specific modifications our analysis can be extended to other mosquito species particularly other container inhabiting mosquito species that experience density dependent regulation in the juvenile stages such as aedes albopictus culex pipiens culex quinquefasciatus and culex tarsalis all of which have been implicated in pathogen transmission vezzani 2007 goddard et al 2002 gratz 2004 a number of other aedes and culex species are also container inhabiting and likely to be regulated by density dependence in the juvenile stages vezzani 2007 efforts to model density dependence in these mosquito populations have been similar to those for ae aegypti in which models are simplified and density dependence when included is most often in mortality terms in juvenile mosquitoes erickson et al 2010 tran et al 2013 bowman et al 2005 ahumada et al 2004 ewing et al 2016 our results will likely contribute to improvements in modeling density dependence in multiple container inhabiting mosquitoes in addition to ae aegypti although differences in parameterization of the life history traits must be considered when applying these results to other species 4 1 conclusion our model and the present work follow a decades long history aimed at investigating the importance of density dependence in ae aegypti populations via both empirical and modeling studies our model lies near the center of a spectrum of complexity at one extreme many of the complex models consider explicit day to day changes in survival and emergence and require high resolution data to validate at the other extreme are models that are more simplistic and generally aimed at studying density dependence primarily from a qualitative perspective with its intermediate level of complexity our model will be a useful tool both for studying density dependence with data at high or low resolutions and for investigating interesting theoretical questions the present work has underscored that density dependence in ae aegypti populations is a complex process that impacts both survival and development of larvae that density dependent emergence was more important to consider in our study than density dependent survival is an important significant result that needs to be investigated

24683,understanding biodiversity pressures associated with recreation and tourism is a major challenge for conservation planning and landscape management while estimates of landscape use are often collected using mechanisms such as park entry fees and traffic density estimates these data do not provide substantial detail about the spatial location or intensity of recreation and tourism across biodiversity management areas to better predict patterns of recreation and tourism likelihood to support conservation planning we used social network data from facebook flickr google strava and wikilocs along with a suite of remote sensing derived environmental covariates in a maximum entropy maxent presence only modelling framework social network samples were compiled and processed to reduce sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation road access climate data and remote sensing covariates describing vegetation greenness disturbance topography and moisture were used as predictor variables in the maxent modelling framework our focus site was a grizzly bear ursus arctos management area in west central alberta canada individual models were developed for each social network dataset as well as a combined model including all the samples mean cross validated auc partial roc and true skill statistics tss were used to evaluate model accuracy results indicated that the covariates proposed were able to best model strava and wikilocs activity tss 0 69 and 0 50 respectively while samples from flickr or the combination of all social networks were least accurate tss 0 32 the access covariate was most important for maxent training gain across a number of social network models highlighting the importance of access for recreation and tourism likelihood the summer heat moisture index and normalized burn ratio were also useful spatial covariates in many predictions recreation and tourism likelihood maps were combined with grizzly bear telemetry data to examine how recreation and tourism may affect grizzly bear behaviour all social network models found a similar influence on grizzly bear behaviour with increasing recreation and tourism use resulting in decreased foraging behaviour and increased rapid movement suggesting that the models developed here are useful tools for predicting grizzly bear behaviour and planning conservation strategies for the species keywords social network grizzly bear maximum entropy models submitted to ecological modelling 1 introduction understanding habitat pressures on biodiversity is critical for species conservation and management threats to health condition and ultimately the survival of species depends on understanding stresses and disturbances to existing habitats in the yellowhead region of alberta canada anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity have been associated with land use change forestry operations mining exploration and urbanization for large charismatic species in this region such as grizzly bears ursus arctos it is not only these more recognisable pressures that have been related to their population status boulanger and stenhouse 2014 cristescu et al 2016 but also recreation and tourism activities to view the species and operate within their habitat penteriani et al 2017 motorized recreation hiking hunting and other outdoor activities all of which are prevalent throughout the area can modify habitat and influence wildlife pickering and hill 2007 and are often difficult to quantify understanding and mapping the geographic extent and temporal patterns of eco tourism and recreational activities can be challenging broad statistics such as national park entry counts hunting licences and traffic density on roads offer some insights but they do not provide geospatial information that can be meaningfully related to species movement or behaviour yang et al 2014 advances in big data analyses driven by citizen science initiatives cooper et al 2007 and more recently by social network analytics bernetti et al 2019 allow human movement especially in locations of high tourism value to be examined at finer spatial and temporal resolutions geotagged photographs and text data offer an additional stream of geospatial information that when harnessed could improve understanding of the extent of recreation and tourism use in these ecosystems as well as which areas may host more activities than others as a result the use of citizen science and geotagged social network data have the potential to train and validate environmental models driven by geospatial data citizen science data have been increasingly incorporated in scientific research as they become more prevalent zheng et al 2017 used photographs of water features whose colour and turbidity could be described these images were uploaded by volunteers then geotagged and used as quantitative information to monitor surface water quality in several provinces in china which provided more than 250 reports to aid water management assessments glasgow et al 2016 used smartphones to collect time activity data to assess long term personal exposure to air pollution using gps data from participants phones and analysing their movement through cities the study assessed the length of time that participants were exposed to outdoor pollution it concluded that positional information from smartphones could feasibly integrate time activity data into long term and large scale studies of exposure to air pollution vich et al 2017 assessed participants commuting and activity behaviour using smartphone tracking data to understand their movement in barcelona spain they found that people with similar professions and socio economic backgrounds had similar travel behaviour and use of different spaces in the city while these examples demonstrate how citizen science data can be mined to inform and better understand impacts of the environment on human health or behaviour all require users to upload specific information via an app for subsequent analysis more recently the availability of social network data offers an additional perspective for leveraging citizen science initiatives using big data tools geotagged social network data can be mined and integrated into scientific applications and analyses this position and activity information is made available by providers based on data supplied by consenting users as a result a huge amount of geospatial data can be extracted from these applications which offer observations an order of magnitude greater than that from user specified citizen science data uploads harnessing these data to develop train and validate models is a new and potentially beneficial approach to modelling human movement and use of space studies using social network data include that of bernetti et al 2019 who assessed the suitability of forest stands for a range of ecosystem services based on the aesthetic appreciation gauged from the number of photographs uploaded to the social network site flickr using geospatial metadata in the imagery they modelled the number of images per unit area using a variety of other datasets including land cover terrain and access using a maximum entropy modelling approach maxent phillips et al 2017 phillips and dudik 2008 which is well suited to this type of data due to its requirement for presence only rather than presence absence data they found that forest stands with the most image counts per metre were associated with certain tree species combinations biomass and access similarly yan et al 2018 modelled the distribution of tourists at certain locations in san diego usa based on geotagged social model information they proposed a method where maxent modelling was used to determine geographic distributions of tourists to facilitate crisis management the distribution of tourists at each site was modelled based on factors such as land use elevation and road and transit access using maxent they then assessed which of these spatial variables were sensitive to changes in tourist numbers which provided insight into the suitability of movement during or after a disaster situation analysis of a range of studies table 1 indicate that flickr is the image based social network platform most commonly used while twitter is the text based platform most mined with respect to modelling approaches numerical summaries such as the number of tweets or images provide continuous data analogous to abundance data in an ecological context while sign in or check in data provide presence based data when viewed in this light regression based approaches that correlate social network data with spatially explicit environmental information including land cover and elevation are possible statistical approaches have ranged from correlation to geographically weighted regression and specific modelling frameworks from water movement to sediment transport table 1 given the success of maxent for predicting likelihood with presence only data for animal species phillips and dudik 2008 it is reasonable to suggest it could also be useful for modelling recreation and tourism likelihood from presence based social media use by compiling data from actively used social network platforms table 1 as well as general use e g facebook and recreation based app services designed for tracking movement routes e g strava there is significant potential to understand spatial patterns of recreation and tourism within tourism and biodiversity hotspots the principle objective of this study therefore was to predict and evaluate patterns of social network activity as a proxy for recreation and tourism using a maxent model parameterised from a variety of remote sensing based climate and land cover covariates using the yellowhead region a grizzly bear management area in western canada as the study site we demonstrated how these newly developed recreation likelihood maps can be used in the context of analysing human influence on grizzly bear movement and behaviour grizzly bears were designated as a threatened species in alberta in 2010 with declines attributed to habitat deterioration and high human caused mortality coogan et al 2018 the yellowhead region has one of the highest population densities of grizzly bears in the province of alberta with an estimated population of 74 95 confidence interval 56 98 in 2014 stenhouse et al 2015 grizzly bear densities are highest in the rocky mountains and foothills to the west of the yellowhead region where human activity is lower festa bianchet 2010 we highlight the importance of maintaining up to date layers of human habitat pressures in dynamic and shared landscapes for conservation efforts aimed at successful co existence 2 methods 2 1 study area the yellowhead region of west central alberta canada is a management area in which recovery efforts for grizzly bears a threatened species have been underway since 2008 fig 1 geography and land use in this region are highly diverse but follow a distinct east west gradient western portions consist of alpine and sub alpine sections of the canadian rocky mountains while central and eastern portions consist of montane forest as well as upper and lower foothills natural regions committee 2006 a substantial percentage 30 5 of the western mountain portion lies within jasper national park berman et al 2018 which is subject to low levels of anthropogenic landscape disturbance nielsen et al 2009 but high levels of human use the central and eastern portions of the study area are highly fragmented due to a long history of wildfire and anthropogenic disturbance primarily oil and gas exploration agriculture timber harvesting and coal mining road networks in the western portion are generally limited to valley bottoms while central and eastern portions have abundant all season access primarily related to resource development berman et al 2019 motorized and non motorized trail networks in the region are also abundant and cover a wide range of elevations 2 2 grizzly bear data grizzly bear location data were collected using followit lindesburg sweden gps radio collars televit simplex and tellus models from 2010 to 2015 with 1 hour fix rate intervals data from 45 bears 24 male and 21 female were used grizzly bears were captured and handled following methods identified by cattet et al 2003 i e culvert traps and aerial darting in accordance with criteria of the canadian council of animal care with annual research permits provided by the university of saskatchewan animal care committee 20 010 016 and university of alberta animal care aup00000436 on average gps telemetry location data were accurate to at least 10 m k graham fri research pers comm 2 3 social network data data were compiled from flickr facebook google strava and wikilocs in december 2018 to extract the locations and intensity of social network activity within the yellowhead study area table 2 all cumulative data available from social networks from the start of data collection to the end of 2018 were downloaded and each network s dataset had specific intensity related metrics we used python based application programming interfaces for all platforms except wikilocs which required downloading data manually flickr data were sampled using a 0 005 degree grid with 500 m buffers within which the total number of unique users was summed to represent intensity of activity for facebook data all check ins at specified named locations were compiled with location coordinates for google data the total number of reviews at specified named locations was summed for strava data all recorded segments i e tracks were extracted using an iterative multiple scale search approach stelmach and beddow 2016 and the number of efforts per segment was summed for wikilocs all available gps tracks were downloaded to include start and end locations as well as the total number of times the trail had been downloaded each dataset was then rescaled 0 1 relative to the maximum intensity observed for that dataset within the study area finally a combined dataset was produced by creating a 30 m grid over the study area and summing the rescaled values of all five social network platforms for each grid cell to minimize the influence of spatial autocorrelation and environmental bias boakes et al 2010 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we spatially filtered and subsampled occurrences from each social network such that occurrences were at least 5 km apart fig 1 using the spthin package of r software r core team 2019 with n 5 aiello lammens et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 this process was repeated so all social network samples could be merged into a single presence dataset studies at national scales have used a 10 km rule for spatial filtering but due to the smaller size of our study area we used 5 km to reduce the potential for spatial autocorrelation while maximizing occurrence numbers in the sample 2 4 environmental covariates a variety of environmental covariates were derived from publicly available remote sensing data and other data sources and resampled to 30 m table 3 climate data averages from 1971 to 2000 for the yellowhead region were obtained from climateab v3 21 software wang et al 2016 which provides a database of interpolated climate data for alberta indices derived from climateab software included the summer heat moisture shm index the ratio between mean warmest month temperature and mean summer precipitation as well as the temperature difference td index the difference in mean temperatures between the warmest and coldest month the normalized burn ratio nbr key and benson 2006 as well as tasselled cap tc wetness brightness and greenness products were calculated using landsat time series data from 2006 to 2015 crist 1985 hasan et al 2014 huang et al 2002 topographic position reu et al 2013 elevation and wetness indices schmidt 2003 were derived using globally available terrain models farr et al 2007 the sky view factor which is the percentage of sky hemisphere obstructed by the surrounding land surface böhner and antonić 2009 häntzschel et al 2005 was calculated using the sky view factor module in saga gis v2 2 1 climate variables were included to provide covariates that could detail landscape level seasonality and provide pertinent seasonal drivers of vegetation change such as precipitation and temperature landsat times series derived covariates such as nbr and tc indices provide detail of variations in forest structure and vegetation while elevation covariates topographic position and wetness describe the influence of terrain characteristics on locations a variable representing human access was included based on the large amount of literature that identifies road access as a driver of biodiversity pressures on grizzly bears benítez lópez et al 2010 benn and herrero 2002 boulanger and stenhouse 2014 graham et al 2010 grilo et al 2010 proctor et al 2020 roever et al 2008 schwartz et al 2006 human access was calculated as an index based on the proximity density and intensity of motorized and non motorized access features within a 12 km radius this radius was chosen to represent the maximum distance at which an urban area would influence wildlife and habitat directly access features were mapped by the government of alberta 2017 and the method developed by kearney et al 2019 was used to weight access features and calculate the final index lastly the sky view factor was included to assess the importance of viewscapes for recreation and tourism with the underlying expectation that vast open viewscapes may increase suitability for human access 2 5 maxent modelling distributions of recreation and tourism likelihood using data from various social network platforms were modelled using maxent v3 3 3k 1 1 https biodiversityinformatics amnh org open source maxent software designed to model species geographic distributions merow et al 2013 phillips et al 2017 2006 2004 phillips and dudik 2008 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 a comprehensive explanation of the maxent modelling framework and its ecological foundations is presented by elith et al 2011 in summary maxent uses environmental covariates and presence only sample locations to constrain potential likelihood distributions constraints promote statistical similarities amongst model predictions and underlying occurrence data which are then used alongside background values to maximize entropy thus generating a relative likelihood map of species or in the case of this study social network use tinoco et al 2009 since maxent is a presence only model it reduces challenges associated with unreliable absence records jiménez valverde et al 2008 and has been used to model many species distributions of varying extents and for a variety of organisms monterroso et al 2009 tinoco et al 2009 tittensor et al 2009 models are generated iteratively starting with a uniform distribution iterations increase the probability of sample locations for the species being analysed i e training gain model iterations continue until either the specified maximum number of iterations is reached or the increase in training gain in consecutive iterations does not exceed a convergence threshold maxent can consider several types of predictor features including linear quadratic hinge threshold and product elith et al 2011 linear features the simplest type are continuous environmental variables quadratic features are the squared value of linear features while product features are the product of pairs of all continuous covariates phillips et al 2006 both hinge and threshold features increase maxent s ability to model the response of target species based on the covariates being used hinge features model piecewise linear responses phillips et al 2006 have been shown to markedly improve model performance phillips and dudik 2008 make threshold features redundant elith et al 2011 and help to form non linear smoothed functions merow et al 2013 based on the success of hinge features for maxent modelling they were the only feature type included in this analysis maxent uses regularization to select the features that contribute the most to model fit merow et al 2013 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudik 2008 burnham and anderson 2002 highlighted conceptual similarities amongst regularization akaike s information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion noting that all use complexity penalties and likelihood measures regularization efficiently selects useful features from large predictor pools and reduces overfitting by penalizing based on coefficient magnitudes to reduce their influence on model outputs tibshirani 1996 this helps to reduce the influence of non informative covariates protect against overfitting and reduce the need for complex parameterization the most important set of uncorrelated covariates was selected and the regularization multiplier was fine tuned using the maxentvariableselection package of r jueterbock et al 2016 to avoid overfitting occurrence samples regularization multipliers from 2 to 4 in increments of 0 5 were tested the correlation threshold was set to 0 8 in which only the covariate with the highest contribution score was selected amongst correlated variable sets the variable contribution threshold was set to 5 below which covariates were excluded from models the best performing model was chosen based on the lowest scores of aic for small sample size aicc warren and seifert 2011 the final seven modelling parameters used in this analysis are detailed in table 4 2 5 1 model evaluation and validation all models were evaluated based on the cross validated mean area under receiver operating characteristic roc also referred to as the area under curve auc from model iterations since maxent is a presence only model background locations also known as pseudo absences were randomly selected uniformly across the study area model fits were evaluated by comparing the sensitivity to 1 specificity liu et al 2005 auc which equals the probability that a randomly selected presence location will be ranked higher than a randomly chosen background location phillips et al 2006 was calculated for each model replicate and the mean of all model replicates auc values range from 0 5 random ranking to 1 0 perfect ranking elith 2000 proposed that auc values 0 75 can be considered useful mean auc aucm was calculated from all model replicates the partial roc proc ratio and the true skill statistic tss were also calculated using independent test data due to concern about auc s ability to evaluate predictive models gonzález fernández et al 2018 lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 data were split 70 30 for training and testing respectively the proc ratio was calculated by assessing significance values obtained by bootstrapping replicates to generate distributions of the ratio of observed to null expectations the mean proc ratio was calculated three times from 500 replicates each of which used 50 of all available points for testing with allowable omission errors of 5 10 and 15 respectively gonzález fernández et al 2018 peterson et al 2008 allowable errors of 5 20 have been proposed peterson et al 2008 and due to the potential variation in spatial accuracy of occurrence data from handheld devices we chose to present results for several allowable error percentages the tss was calculated to evaluate whether model results were better than random tss values range from 1 to 1 and values 0 indicate that model results are no better than random while a value of 1 indicates perfect model performance allouche et al 2006 the nichetoolbox package of r was used to calculate proc and tss osorio olvera et al 2020 individual remote sensing and geospatial covariates in the maxent models were evaluated using jackknife techniques elith et al 2011 monterroso et al 2009 to determine their importance for explaining the sample distributions observed this involved iterating models with variables in isolation and with single variables omitted to understand their individual effects on regularized training gain this process was performed for all covariates and models 2 6 grizzly bear behaviour we examined the usefulness of the recreation likelihood layers in the context of grizzly bear behaviour to do so we examined grizzly bear behavioural states inferred by state space models hidden markov models hmms to assess how recreation and tourism likelihood maps from maxent models could be used to examine how recreation and tourism influence grizzly bear behaviour the movehmm package of r was used to build the hmms michelot et al 2016 state space models use gps tracks of animal movement and assign probabilities of each unobserved behavioural state to each gps location based on the observed movement state of the animal using step length distance between successive gps fixes and turning angle angle of deflection between the current and previous gps step michelot et al 2016 for this analysis grizzly bear gps data collected at 1 hour intervals were divided into behavioural states preliminary analysis comparing two state and three state models demonstrated that a three state model fit the data better therefore a three state model was used which corresponded roughly to the states of resting or intense foraging foraging or slow travel and travelling farhadinia et al 2020 as follows state 1 resting short step lengths and high turning angles stationary or slow movement state 2 foraging moderate step lengths and varied turning angles moderate speed undirected movement state 3 travelling long step lengths and low turning angles fast speed directed movement grizzly bears were analysed by year 72 total bear years step lengths were modelled using a gamma distribution and turning angles were modelled using a von mises distribution since hmms can be sensitive to initial parameter values models were iterated 25 times using initial values randomly selected from the range of plausible values to ensure model stability after fitting the model grizzly bear steps were assigned to the most likely state using a viterbi algorithm farhadinia et al 2020 models were created for each social network layer and model fit was assessed by checking pseudo residuals for normality farhadinia et al 2020 stationary state probability which represents the probability of being in a state through time was calculated for each movement state for each social network layer 3 results 3 1 maxent modelling auc results indicated that maxent was able to provide better than random likelihood distributions for all social network datasets individually as well as their combination table 5 fig 2 environmental covariates best explained observed sample distributions for strava and wikilocs achieving the highest aucm of 0 87 and 0 81 respectively flickr had the lowest aucm of all social network datasets 0 63 followed by facebook aucm 0 69 and google aucm 0 72 strava and wikilocs had the highest tss 0 69 and 0 50 respectively both flickr and the combination of all social networks had the lowest tss 0 32 strava and wikilocs had the highest proc ratio for 5 10 and 15 allowable error thresholds table 5 the combination of all social network datasets had an aucm of 0 66 output maps representing the mean likelihood for each of the five individual networks and their combined dataset varied fig 3 model jackknifing quantified the regularized training gain for individual variables fig 4 for the combined social network dataset the shm index increased training gain the most out of all covariates thus providing the most useful information when used in isolation the nbr from landsat spectral data indicative of forest structure was the most useful remote sensing covariate and also yielded the largest loss of training gain when omitted from the model inclusion and omission of access in the combined model had the least influence on training gain in the individual models shm again increased training gain for the facebook and flickr models omission of shm and access reduced training gain the most for flickr while omission of nbr reduced training gain the most for facebook access also had considerable influence on the training gain of flickr in the individual models unlike in the combined model access had the largest influence on training gain for google models when used in isolation and omitted followed by shm omission of landsat spectral data in the google model had negligible influence on training gain the importance of nbr was again highlighted as when used in isolation increased training gain most for both strava and wikilocs omission of access from these models yielded the greatest loss of training gain for all models omission of climate variables such as degree days and climate td resulted in negligible loss of training gain 3 2 grizzly bear behaviour the three states of grizzly bear movement varied by location in the region fig 5 figure s1 movement states were distinct with non overlapping confidence intervals and were consistent amongst social networks table s1 pseudo residuals supported a good model fit figure s2 stationary state probability plots fig 6 showed similar results for all social networks with a steady decrease in the use of the landscape by grizzly bears for eating and resting state 1 as recreational and tourism use increased this was most evident for the combined model and least evident for the google network model in comparison foraging state 2 and travelling state 3 behaviours usually increased as recreational use increased for all social networks the probabilities changed the most for the travelling state state 3 fast directed movement which increased as recreation and tourism use increased for all social networks regarding the consistency of model predictions of behaviour google and the combined model had the most consistent behaviour predictions while flickr were most variable fig 6 4 discussion this analysis used a variety of social network datasets in a maxent modelling framework to map recreation likelihood distributions of social network use across the yellowhead region of alberta results indicate that there is potential to use this type of social network location data from various sources to map areas synonymous with recreation and tourism use and thus human presence using social network data as a proxy for human presence maxent provided likelihood distributions of recreation and tourism that highlight locations with greater probability of human presence and provide insight into which environmental covariates make these locations more favourable the use of grizzly bear gps telemetry data highlighted relationships between bear movement behaviour and recreation likelihood which indicates that these datasets could be used together to help understand how human presence may influence behaviour of species at risk in a shared landscape to our knowledge this is the first analysis to relate fine scale spatial patterns of social network use to animal behavioural responses 4 1 maxent modelling based on model fit strava and wikilocs data were the networks most associated with measured environmental conditions followed by google facebook and flickr the combination of all social network data yielded the lowest overall auc suggesting that each social network dataset has unique components which may provide valuable insights into network use model outputs from strava and wikilocs show some of the most distinct patterns of use strava is used by mountain bikers runners and other outdoor enthusiasts to both self assess and promote their achievements as a result users generate the data uploaded to strava and wikilocs and are more likely to verify the location quality these datasets to which users deliberately uploaded spatial data had the highest accuracy metrics which indicated the best model fit in most individual models access was a highly important covariate that provided information that other covariates lacked for example strava recreation likelihood maps clearly highlight valley bottoms near the town of jasper where road networks and trails are prevalent wikilocs showed the same pattern but also in more rural communities in the east of the study area thus highlighting the importance of infrastructure for human movement and that of the access covariate for regularized training gain in these models more access promotes travel to these locations and for an area such as the yellowhead which contains landmarks such as jasper national park and the icefields parkway access is an extremely important characteristic for recreation and tourism in most network datasets the lowest recreation likelihoods are found in the high elevation mountain regions in the west this could indicate that barriers to access could inhibit recreation and tourism the most thus decreasing the potential for human animal interactions results of sonter et al 2016 indicated that greater visitation to protected areas was associated with increased trail density amongst other landscape attributes which supports theories that accessibility is a primary driver of recreation and tourism use one limitation of the access covariate is that many social network samples were likely uploaded from access routes or parking lots even if taken or collected elsewhere it is likely that all users do not upload to social network platforms from these highly travelled areas due to their lack of internet connectivity access networks in the yellowhead region are also known to change rapidly outside of parks and protected areas which must be recognized when interpreting results networks to which users uploaded general location information flickr facebook google for a variety of purposes yielded lower accuracy metrics in these cases data uploads and communication with networks is likely to be a function of cell phone and internet access for example google shows ubiquitous use in more rural communities and townships that have widespread internet availability but much lower use in the mountainous areas of the rocky mountains location information in these networks is multi use and generally non specific the distribution of flickr data is similar to that of google data in the eastern portion however with a few pockets of less interest from a photographic standpoint in contrast however many photos on flickr are tagged as views of the rocky mountains which increases the number of times images are identified as such even though these areas may be less accessible environmental covariates such as nbr and shm may better indicate why particular locations were more suitable for human use than others both shm as a combined indicator of temperature and precipitation and nbr indicative of forest structure are related to forest vegetation productivity and prevailing forest conditions recreation likelihoods consistently increased as shm increased when modelling both strava and wikilocs data indicating that areas with more variation in seasonal temperatures may be more conducive to recreation an important consideration with these data is that this study averaged remote sensing climate covariates and social network data over the study period consequently it ignored changes in land use cover or human activity over time recognizing that social network data were not created specifically to represent tourism behaviours or provide data for research is important ruths and pfeffer 2014 age gender longley et al 2015 tenkanen et al 2017 and education biases hausmann et al 2017b are present within these data which requires methods that account for specific social network algorithms access constraints and nonhuman data accounts bots amongst other characteristics social network users with extremely positive or negative experiences are more likely to post than those with moderate experiences tatar et al 2014 while responses to posts may differ depending on users relationships murphy et al 2007 these phenomena related to word of mouth have implications for the choice of location and intensity of use of particular areas for recreation tham et al 2013 which makes them important considerations for conservation planning for example hausmann et al 2018 and wood et al 2013 found that social network data could be used to explore and monitor preferences for biodiversity and human activities which gives managers potential insight into methods for monitoring prevailing tourism interests likewise using social network data to estimate and measure visitation to parks and protected areas has shown promise and may also provide relevant details about the uses and value of recreational lands heikinheimo et al 2017 sessions et al 2016 tenkanen et al 2017 leveraging social network data to incorporate public preference for biodiversity to promote and support conservation planning is also promising hausmann et al 2017a 4 2 grizzly bear behaviour our behaviour results suggested that bears had higher probabilities of being in a travelling state while in areas of greater recreation and tourism likelihood this result is consistent with previous studies in which the rate of grizzly bear movement was shown to increase near trails ladle et al 2019 and roads roever et al 2010 particularly when roads were visible parsons et al 2020 conversely the models show that bears are more likely to be in a resting foraging or eating state state 1 in areas away from recreation and tourism bears may modify their activity patterns to use areas of high recreation likelihood more when human use is low e g at night we did not however analyse temporal relationships which sonter et al 2016 highlight as being an important consideration for conservation decision making wildlife have been frequently observed to choose areas perceived as safe when resting while tolerating areas of greater risk when travelling saher and schmiegelow 2005 animals may also increase movement rates in response to risk or disturbance ladle et al 2019 prokopenko et al 2017 ladle et al 2019 found that rates of grizzly bear movement increased near trails with both motorized and non motorized activity but that responses were greater with increasing likelihood of motorized activity in our study state 2 responses moderate speed undirected movement mimicked those of state 3 rapid directed movement more closely than those of state 1 suggesting that even moderate increases in recreation and tourism use triggers changes in movement and behaviour while this result may have been due to humans recreating in low quality foraging habitat we argue it is unlikely many of the popular recreation sites and trails in this area travel through productive lowland areas that would be high quality foraging habitat for grizzly bears in the absence of humans the relationship between the travelling state state 3 and recreation likelihood was the least pronounced and consistent amongst social networks this may be due to the travelling state being a hybrid of foraging and movement states as well as having a wider variety of ecological interpretations in the landscape trends in travelling may also be associated with predicted recreation and tourism likelihood in the rocky mountains the social networks whose data layers predicted high likelihood in the rocky mountains flickr facebook also predicted a positive correlation with state 2 moderate movement thus these trends may be due in part to underlying differences in elevation between social network platforms as travelling may be easier in valleys than mountainous regions similar patterns in grizzly bear behaviour between our results and the literature demonstrate that social network data can be used to estimate the propensity for human use and its potential effects on grizzly bear movement spatial representations of recreation and tourism likelihood could help delineate areas in a landscape that are safer or riskier for bears which would afford managers a way to understand where the risk of recreation and tourism pressure is higher the potential to incorporate seasonality and temporal patterns into grizzly bear movement data and recreation likelihood could help delineate high risk areas in the landscape throughout the year and increase the amount of information available for conservation efforts for grizzly bears to further investigate how human activity derived from social networks influences grizzly bears future studies could examine how human presence and activity influence bear diurnality physiological function and wariness in a shared landscape connections between environmental suitability for humans and bears are important for managing human wildlife interactions and provide a way to map areas that may be more prone to anthropogenic habitat pressures integrating these findings and continuing to combine social network data with environmental covariates as a proxy for human use potential could be a way to map human use effectively at the landscape level 5 conclusions and perspectives this study proposed a novel method for mapping tourism and recreation likelihood and related their spatial distributions to patterns of grizzly bear movement behaviour using a maxent modelling framework we outlined that all included social networks generated better than random likelihood distributions strava and wikilocs both networks where users deliberately uploaded spatial data had the highest accuracy metrics and were most associated with environmental covariates this could indicate that purposeful spatial data uploads may yield more accurate sample data for future modelling approaches covariates including nbr and access were found to be particularly valuable for explaining sample distributions highlighting that landscape vegetation structure and access to tourism and recreation locations are highly important variables to consider in landscape level analyses recreation and tourism likelihoods from maxent models were compared with telemetry data from grizzly bear collars indicating a decreased use of the landscape for eating and resting as recreation and tourism likelihood increased to our knowledge this is the first analysis to use social network data to evaluate fine scale spatial patterns of social network use related to animal behavioural responses these data could be particularly powerful for improving knowledge of spatial distributions and intensities of recreation and tourism across biodiversity management areas the approach developed in this study could help improve understanding and mapping of recreation and tourism patterns as well as provide insights into which environmental drivers could be important for improving conservation and land management these newly developed likelihood distributions of recreation and tourism can be combined with species movement and behaviour studies to better manage human habitat pressures and identify areas of greater interaction risk in dynamic landscapes such as the yellowhead region of alberta doing so could help promote specific conservation strategies such as managing human access during important animal life cycle events or developing wildlife and tourism corridors likewise analysis of social networks at different times of the year could help identify where habitat pressures are highest each season promoting the use of these networks within parks to understand recreation and tourism movements better with the ultimate goal of improving conservation management would help keep data layers of human habitat pressures in dynamic landscapes up to date and facilitate maintaining the best available data for conservation

24683,understanding biodiversity pressures associated with recreation and tourism is a major challenge for conservation planning and landscape management while estimates of landscape use are often collected using mechanisms such as park entry fees and traffic density estimates these data do not provide substantial detail about the spatial location or intensity of recreation and tourism across biodiversity management areas to better predict patterns of recreation and tourism likelihood to support conservation planning we used social network data from facebook flickr google strava and wikilocs along with a suite of remote sensing derived environmental covariates in a maximum entropy maxent presence only modelling framework social network samples were compiled and processed to reduce sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation road access climate data and remote sensing covariates describing vegetation greenness disturbance topography and moisture were used as predictor variables in the maxent modelling framework our focus site was a grizzly bear ursus arctos management area in west central alberta canada individual models were developed for each social network dataset as well as a combined model including all the samples mean cross validated auc partial roc and true skill statistics tss were used to evaluate model accuracy results indicated that the covariates proposed were able to best model strava and wikilocs activity tss 0 69 and 0 50 respectively while samples from flickr or the combination of all social networks were least accurate tss 0 32 the access covariate was most important for maxent training gain across a number of social network models highlighting the importance of access for recreation and tourism likelihood the summer heat moisture index and normalized burn ratio were also useful spatial covariates in many predictions recreation and tourism likelihood maps were combined with grizzly bear telemetry data to examine how recreation and tourism may affect grizzly bear behaviour all social network models found a similar influence on grizzly bear behaviour with increasing recreation and tourism use resulting in decreased foraging behaviour and increased rapid movement suggesting that the models developed here are useful tools for predicting grizzly bear behaviour and planning conservation strategies for the species keywords social network grizzly bear maximum entropy models submitted to ecological modelling 1 introduction understanding habitat pressures on biodiversity is critical for species conservation and management threats to health condition and ultimately the survival of species depends on understanding stresses and disturbances to existing habitats in the yellowhead region of alberta canada anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity have been associated with land use change forestry operations mining exploration and urbanization for large charismatic species in this region such as grizzly bears ursus arctos it is not only these more recognisable pressures that have been related to their population status boulanger and stenhouse 2014 cristescu et al 2016 but also recreation and tourism activities to view the species and operate within their habitat penteriani et al 2017 motorized recreation hiking hunting and other outdoor activities all of which are prevalent throughout the area can modify habitat and influence wildlife pickering and hill 2007 and are often difficult to quantify understanding and mapping the geographic extent and temporal patterns of eco tourism and recreational activities can be challenging broad statistics such as national park entry counts hunting licences and traffic density on roads offer some insights but they do not provide geospatial information that can be meaningfully related to species movement or behaviour yang et al 2014 advances in big data analyses driven by citizen science initiatives cooper et al 2007 and more recently by social network analytics bernetti et al 2019 allow human movement especially in locations of high tourism value to be examined at finer spatial and temporal resolutions geotagged photographs and text data offer an additional stream of geospatial information that when harnessed could improve understanding of the extent of recreation and tourism use in these ecosystems as well as which areas may host more activities than others as a result the use of citizen science and geotagged social network data have the potential to train and validate environmental models driven by geospatial data citizen science data have been increasingly incorporated in scientific research as they become more prevalent zheng et al 2017 used photographs of water features whose colour and turbidity could be described these images were uploaded by volunteers then geotagged and used as quantitative information to monitor surface water quality in several provinces in china which provided more than 250 reports to aid water management assessments glasgow et al 2016 used smartphones to collect time activity data to assess long term personal exposure to air pollution using gps data from participants phones and analysing their movement through cities the study assessed the length of time that participants were exposed to outdoor pollution it concluded that positional information from smartphones could feasibly integrate time activity data into long term and large scale studies of exposure to air pollution vich et al 2017 assessed participants commuting and activity behaviour using smartphone tracking data to understand their movement in barcelona spain they found that people with similar professions and socio economic backgrounds had similar travel behaviour and use of different spaces in the city while these examples demonstrate how citizen science data can be mined to inform and better understand impacts of the environment on human health or behaviour all require users to upload specific information via an app for subsequent analysis more recently the availability of social network data offers an additional perspective for leveraging citizen science initiatives using big data tools geotagged social network data can be mined and integrated into scientific applications and analyses this position and activity information is made available by providers based on data supplied by consenting users as a result a huge amount of geospatial data can be extracted from these applications which offer observations an order of magnitude greater than that from user specified citizen science data uploads harnessing these data to develop train and validate models is a new and potentially beneficial approach to modelling human movement and use of space studies using social network data include that of bernetti et al 2019 who assessed the suitability of forest stands for a range of ecosystem services based on the aesthetic appreciation gauged from the number of photographs uploaded to the social network site flickr using geospatial metadata in the imagery they modelled the number of images per unit area using a variety of other datasets including land cover terrain and access using a maximum entropy modelling approach maxent phillips et al 2017 phillips and dudik 2008 which is well suited to this type of data due to its requirement for presence only rather than presence absence data they found that forest stands with the most image counts per metre were associated with certain tree species combinations biomass and access similarly yan et al 2018 modelled the distribution of tourists at certain locations in san diego usa based on geotagged social model information they proposed a method where maxent modelling was used to determine geographic distributions of tourists to facilitate crisis management the distribution of tourists at each site was modelled based on factors such as land use elevation and road and transit access using maxent they then assessed which of these spatial variables were sensitive to changes in tourist numbers which provided insight into the suitability of movement during or after a disaster situation analysis of a range of studies table 1 indicate that flickr is the image based social network platform most commonly used while twitter is the text based platform most mined with respect to modelling approaches numerical summaries such as the number of tweets or images provide continuous data analogous to abundance data in an ecological context while sign in or check in data provide presence based data when viewed in this light regression based approaches that correlate social network data with spatially explicit environmental information including land cover and elevation are possible statistical approaches have ranged from correlation to geographically weighted regression and specific modelling frameworks from water movement to sediment transport table 1 given the success of maxent for predicting likelihood with presence only data for animal species phillips and dudik 2008 it is reasonable to suggest it could also be useful for modelling recreation and tourism likelihood from presence based social media use by compiling data from actively used social network platforms table 1 as well as general use e g facebook and recreation based app services designed for tracking movement routes e g strava there is significant potential to understand spatial patterns of recreation and tourism within tourism and biodiversity hotspots the principle objective of this study therefore was to predict and evaluate patterns of social network activity as a proxy for recreation and tourism using a maxent model parameterised from a variety of remote sensing based climate and land cover covariates using the yellowhead region a grizzly bear management area in western canada as the study site we demonstrated how these newly developed recreation likelihood maps can be used in the context of analysing human influence on grizzly bear movement and behaviour grizzly bears were designated as a threatened species in alberta in 2010 with declines attributed to habitat deterioration and high human caused mortality coogan et al 2018 the yellowhead region has one of the highest population densities of grizzly bears in the province of alberta with an estimated population of 74 95 confidence interval 56 98 in 2014 stenhouse et al 2015 grizzly bear densities are highest in the rocky mountains and foothills to the west of the yellowhead region where human activity is lower festa bianchet 2010 we highlight the importance of maintaining up to date layers of human habitat pressures in dynamic and shared landscapes for conservation efforts aimed at successful co existence 2 methods 2 1 study area the yellowhead region of west central alberta canada is a management area in which recovery efforts for grizzly bears a threatened species have been underway since 2008 fig 1 geography and land use in this region are highly diverse but follow a distinct east west gradient western portions consist of alpine and sub alpine sections of the canadian rocky mountains while central and eastern portions consist of montane forest as well as upper and lower foothills natural regions committee 2006 a substantial percentage 30 5 of the western mountain portion lies within jasper national park berman et al 2018 which is subject to low levels of anthropogenic landscape disturbance nielsen et al 2009 but high levels of human use the central and eastern portions of the study area are highly fragmented due to a long history of wildfire and anthropogenic disturbance primarily oil and gas exploration agriculture timber harvesting and coal mining road networks in the western portion are generally limited to valley bottoms while central and eastern portions have abundant all season access primarily related to resource development berman et al 2019 motorized and non motorized trail networks in the region are also abundant and cover a wide range of elevations 2 2 grizzly bear data grizzly bear location data were collected using followit lindesburg sweden gps radio collars televit simplex and tellus models from 2010 to 2015 with 1 hour fix rate intervals data from 45 bears 24 male and 21 female were used grizzly bears were captured and handled following methods identified by cattet et al 2003 i e culvert traps and aerial darting in accordance with criteria of the canadian council of animal care with annual research permits provided by the university of saskatchewan animal care committee 20 010 016 and university of alberta animal care aup00000436 on average gps telemetry location data were accurate to at least 10 m k graham fri research pers comm 2 3 social network data data were compiled from flickr facebook google strava and wikilocs in december 2018 to extract the locations and intensity of social network activity within the yellowhead study area table 2 all cumulative data available from social networks from the start of data collection to the end of 2018 were downloaded and each network s dataset had specific intensity related metrics we used python based application programming interfaces for all platforms except wikilocs which required downloading data manually flickr data were sampled using a 0 005 degree grid with 500 m buffers within which the total number of unique users was summed to represent intensity of activity for facebook data all check ins at specified named locations were compiled with location coordinates for google data the total number of reviews at specified named locations was summed for strava data all recorded segments i e tracks were extracted using an iterative multiple scale search approach stelmach and beddow 2016 and the number of efforts per segment was summed for wikilocs all available gps tracks were downloaded to include start and end locations as well as the total number of times the trail had been downloaded each dataset was then rescaled 0 1 relative to the maximum intensity observed for that dataset within the study area finally a combined dataset was produced by creating a 30 m grid over the study area and summing the rescaled values of all five social network platforms for each grid cell to minimize the influence of spatial autocorrelation and environmental bias boakes et al 2010 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 we spatially filtered and subsampled occurrences from each social network such that occurrences were at least 5 km apart fig 1 using the spthin package of r software r core team 2019 with n 5 aiello lammens et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 this process was repeated so all social network samples could be merged into a single presence dataset studies at national scales have used a 10 km rule for spatial filtering but due to the smaller size of our study area we used 5 km to reduce the potential for spatial autocorrelation while maximizing occurrence numbers in the sample 2 4 environmental covariates a variety of environmental covariates were derived from publicly available remote sensing data and other data sources and resampled to 30 m table 3 climate data averages from 1971 to 2000 for the yellowhead region were obtained from climateab v3 21 software wang et al 2016 which provides a database of interpolated climate data for alberta indices derived from climateab software included the summer heat moisture shm index the ratio between mean warmest month temperature and mean summer precipitation as well as the temperature difference td index the difference in mean temperatures between the warmest and coldest month the normalized burn ratio nbr key and benson 2006 as well as tasselled cap tc wetness brightness and greenness products were calculated using landsat time series data from 2006 to 2015 crist 1985 hasan et al 2014 huang et al 2002 topographic position reu et al 2013 elevation and wetness indices schmidt 2003 were derived using globally available terrain models farr et al 2007 the sky view factor which is the percentage of sky hemisphere obstructed by the surrounding land surface böhner and antonić 2009 häntzschel et al 2005 was calculated using the sky view factor module in saga gis v2 2 1 climate variables were included to provide covariates that could detail landscape level seasonality and provide pertinent seasonal drivers of vegetation change such as precipitation and temperature landsat times series derived covariates such as nbr and tc indices provide detail of variations in forest structure and vegetation while elevation covariates topographic position and wetness describe the influence of terrain characteristics on locations a variable representing human access was included based on the large amount of literature that identifies road access as a driver of biodiversity pressures on grizzly bears benítez lópez et al 2010 benn and herrero 2002 boulanger and stenhouse 2014 graham et al 2010 grilo et al 2010 proctor et al 2020 roever et al 2008 schwartz et al 2006 human access was calculated as an index based on the proximity density and intensity of motorized and non motorized access features within a 12 km radius this radius was chosen to represent the maximum distance at which an urban area would influence wildlife and habitat directly access features were mapped by the government of alberta 2017 and the method developed by kearney et al 2019 was used to weight access features and calculate the final index lastly the sky view factor was included to assess the importance of viewscapes for recreation and tourism with the underlying expectation that vast open viewscapes may increase suitability for human access 2 5 maxent modelling distributions of recreation and tourism likelihood using data from various social network platforms were modelled using maxent v3 3 3k 1 1 https biodiversityinformatics amnh org open source maxent software designed to model species geographic distributions merow et al 2013 phillips et al 2017 2006 2004 phillips and dudik 2008 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 a comprehensive explanation of the maxent modelling framework and its ecological foundations is presented by elith et al 2011 in summary maxent uses environmental covariates and presence only sample locations to constrain potential likelihood distributions constraints promote statistical similarities amongst model predictions and underlying occurrence data which are then used alongside background values to maximize entropy thus generating a relative likelihood map of species or in the case of this study social network use tinoco et al 2009 since maxent is a presence only model it reduces challenges associated with unreliable absence records jiménez valverde et al 2008 and has been used to model many species distributions of varying extents and for a variety of organisms monterroso et al 2009 tinoco et al 2009 tittensor et al 2009 models are generated iteratively starting with a uniform distribution iterations increase the probability of sample locations for the species being analysed i e training gain model iterations continue until either the specified maximum number of iterations is reached or the increase in training gain in consecutive iterations does not exceed a convergence threshold maxent can consider several types of predictor features including linear quadratic hinge threshold and product elith et al 2011 linear features the simplest type are continuous environmental variables quadratic features are the squared value of linear features while product features are the product of pairs of all continuous covariates phillips et al 2006 both hinge and threshold features increase maxent s ability to model the response of target species based on the covariates being used hinge features model piecewise linear responses phillips et al 2006 have been shown to markedly improve model performance phillips and dudik 2008 make threshold features redundant elith et al 2011 and help to form non linear smoothed functions merow et al 2013 based on the success of hinge features for maxent modelling they were the only feature type included in this analysis maxent uses regularization to select the features that contribute the most to model fit merow et al 2013 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudik 2008 burnham and anderson 2002 highlighted conceptual similarities amongst regularization akaike s information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion noting that all use complexity penalties and likelihood measures regularization efficiently selects useful features from large predictor pools and reduces overfitting by penalizing based on coefficient magnitudes to reduce their influence on model outputs tibshirani 1996 this helps to reduce the influence of non informative covariates protect against overfitting and reduce the need for complex parameterization the most important set of uncorrelated covariates was selected and the regularization multiplier was fine tuned using the maxentvariableselection package of r jueterbock et al 2016 to avoid overfitting occurrence samples regularization multipliers from 2 to 4 in increments of 0 5 were tested the correlation threshold was set to 0 8 in which only the covariate with the highest contribution score was selected amongst correlated variable sets the variable contribution threshold was set to 5 below which covariates were excluded from models the best performing model was chosen based on the lowest scores of aic for small sample size aicc warren and seifert 2011 the final seven modelling parameters used in this analysis are detailed in table 4 2 5 1 model evaluation and validation all models were evaluated based on the cross validated mean area under receiver operating characteristic roc also referred to as the area under curve auc from model iterations since maxent is a presence only model background locations also known as pseudo absences were randomly selected uniformly across the study area model fits were evaluated by comparing the sensitivity to 1 specificity liu et al 2005 auc which equals the probability that a randomly selected presence location will be ranked higher than a randomly chosen background location phillips et al 2006 was calculated for each model replicate and the mean of all model replicates auc values range from 0 5 random ranking to 1 0 perfect ranking elith 2000 proposed that auc values 0 75 can be considered useful mean auc aucm was calculated from all model replicates the partial roc proc ratio and the true skill statistic tss were also calculated using independent test data due to concern about auc s ability to evaluate predictive models gonzález fernández et al 2018 lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 data were split 70 30 for training and testing respectively the proc ratio was calculated by assessing significance values obtained by bootstrapping replicates to generate distributions of the ratio of observed to null expectations the mean proc ratio was calculated three times from 500 replicates each of which used 50 of all available points for testing with allowable omission errors of 5 10 and 15 respectively gonzález fernández et al 2018 peterson et al 2008 allowable errors of 5 20 have been proposed peterson et al 2008 and due to the potential variation in spatial accuracy of occurrence data from handheld devices we chose to present results for several allowable error percentages the tss was calculated to evaluate whether model results were better than random tss values range from 1 to 1 and values 0 indicate that model results are no better than random while a value of 1 indicates perfect model performance allouche et al 2006 the nichetoolbox package of r was used to calculate proc and tss osorio olvera et al 2020 individual remote sensing and geospatial covariates in the maxent models were evaluated using jackknife techniques elith et al 2011 monterroso et al 2009 to determine their importance for explaining the sample distributions observed this involved iterating models with variables in isolation and with single variables omitted to understand their individual effects on regularized training gain this process was performed for all covariates and models 2 6 grizzly bear behaviour we examined the usefulness of the recreation likelihood layers in the context of grizzly bear behaviour to do so we examined grizzly bear behavioural states inferred by state space models hidden markov models hmms to assess how recreation and tourism likelihood maps from maxent models could be used to examine how recreation and tourism influence grizzly bear behaviour the movehmm package of r was used to build the hmms michelot et al 2016 state space models use gps tracks of animal movement and assign probabilities of each unobserved behavioural state to each gps location based on the observed movement state of the animal using step length distance between successive gps fixes and turning angle angle of deflection between the current and previous gps step michelot et al 2016 for this analysis grizzly bear gps data collected at 1 hour intervals were divided into behavioural states preliminary analysis comparing two state and three state models demonstrated that a three state model fit the data better therefore a three state model was used which corresponded roughly to the states of resting or intense foraging foraging or slow travel and travelling farhadinia et al 2020 as follows state 1 resting short step lengths and high turning angles stationary or slow movement state 2 foraging moderate step lengths and varied turning angles moderate speed undirected movement state 3 travelling long step lengths and low turning angles fast speed directed movement grizzly bears were analysed by year 72 total bear years step lengths were modelled using a gamma distribution and turning angles were modelled using a von mises distribution since hmms can be sensitive to initial parameter values models were iterated 25 times using initial values randomly selected from the range of plausible values to ensure model stability after fitting the model grizzly bear steps were assigned to the most likely state using a viterbi algorithm farhadinia et al 2020 models were created for each social network layer and model fit was assessed by checking pseudo residuals for normality farhadinia et al 2020 stationary state probability which represents the probability of being in a state through time was calculated for each movement state for each social network layer 3 results 3 1 maxent modelling auc results indicated that maxent was able to provide better than random likelihood distributions for all social network datasets individually as well as their combination table 5 fig 2 environmental covariates best explained observed sample distributions for strava and wikilocs achieving the highest aucm of 0 87 and 0 81 respectively flickr had the lowest aucm of all social network datasets 0 63 followed by facebook aucm 0 69 and google aucm 0 72 strava and wikilocs had the highest tss 0 69 and 0 50 respectively both flickr and the combination of all social networks had the lowest tss 0 32 strava and wikilocs had the highest proc ratio for 5 10 and 15 allowable error thresholds table 5 the combination of all social network datasets had an aucm of 0 66 output maps representing the mean likelihood for each of the five individual networks and their combined dataset varied fig 3 model jackknifing quantified the regularized training gain for individual variables fig 4 for the combined social network dataset the shm index increased training gain the most out of all covariates thus providing the most useful information when used in isolation the nbr from landsat spectral data indicative of forest structure was the most useful remote sensing covariate and also yielded the largest loss of training gain when omitted from the model inclusion and omission of access in the combined model had the least influence on training gain in the individual models shm again increased training gain for the facebook and flickr models omission of shm and access reduced training gain the most for flickr while omission of nbr reduced training gain the most for facebook access also had considerable influence on the training gain of flickr in the individual models unlike in the combined model access had the largest influence on training gain for google models when used in isolation and omitted followed by shm omission of landsat spectral data in the google model had negligible influence on training gain the importance of nbr was again highlighted as when used in isolation increased training gain most for both strava and wikilocs omission of access from these models yielded the greatest loss of training gain for all models omission of climate variables such as degree days and climate td resulted in negligible loss of training gain 3 2 grizzly bear behaviour the three states of grizzly bear movement varied by location in the region fig 5 figure s1 movement states were distinct with non overlapping confidence intervals and were consistent amongst social networks table s1 pseudo residuals supported a good model fit figure s2 stationary state probability plots fig 6 showed similar results for all social networks with a steady decrease in the use of the landscape by grizzly bears for eating and resting state 1 as recreational and tourism use increased this was most evident for the combined model and least evident for the google network model in comparison foraging state 2 and travelling state 3 behaviours usually increased as recreational use increased for all social networks the probabilities changed the most for the travelling state state 3 fast directed movement which increased as recreation and tourism use increased for all social networks regarding the consistency of model predictions of behaviour google and the combined model had the most consistent behaviour predictions while flickr were most variable fig 6 4 discussion this analysis used a variety of social network datasets in a maxent modelling framework to map recreation likelihood distributions of social network use across the yellowhead region of alberta results indicate that there is potential to use this type of social network location data from various sources to map areas synonymous with recreation and tourism use and thus human presence using social network data as a proxy for human presence maxent provided likelihood distributions of recreation and tourism that highlight locations with greater probability of human presence and provide insight into which environmental covariates make these locations more favourable the use of grizzly bear gps telemetry data highlighted relationships between bear movement behaviour and recreation likelihood which indicates that these datasets could be used together to help understand how human presence may influence behaviour of species at risk in a shared landscape to our knowledge this is the first analysis to relate fine scale spatial patterns of social network use to animal behavioural responses 4 1 maxent modelling based on model fit strava and wikilocs data were the networks most associated with measured environmental conditions followed by google facebook and flickr the combination of all social network data yielded the lowest overall auc suggesting that each social network dataset has unique components which may provide valuable insights into network use model outputs from strava and wikilocs show some of the most distinct patterns of use strava is used by mountain bikers runners and other outdoor enthusiasts to both self assess and promote their achievements as a result users generate the data uploaded to strava and wikilocs and are more likely to verify the location quality these datasets to which users deliberately uploaded spatial data had the highest accuracy metrics which indicated the best model fit in most individual models access was a highly important covariate that provided information that other covariates lacked for example strava recreation likelihood maps clearly highlight valley bottoms near the town of jasper where road networks and trails are prevalent wikilocs showed the same pattern but also in more rural communities in the east of the study area thus highlighting the importance of infrastructure for human movement and that of the access covariate for regularized training gain in these models more access promotes travel to these locations and for an area such as the yellowhead which contains landmarks such as jasper national park and the icefields parkway access is an extremely important characteristic for recreation and tourism in most network datasets the lowest recreation likelihoods are found in the high elevation mountain regions in the west this could indicate that barriers to access could inhibit recreation and tourism the most thus decreasing the potential for human animal interactions results of sonter et al 2016 indicated that greater visitation to protected areas was associated with increased trail density amongst other landscape attributes which supports theories that accessibility is a primary driver of recreation and tourism use one limitation of the access covariate is that many social network samples were likely uploaded from access routes or parking lots even if taken or collected elsewhere it is likely that all users do not upload to social network platforms from these highly travelled areas due to their lack of internet connectivity access networks in the yellowhead region are also known to change rapidly outside of parks and protected areas which must be recognized when interpreting results networks to which users uploaded general location information flickr facebook google for a variety of purposes yielded lower accuracy metrics in these cases data uploads and communication with networks is likely to be a function of cell phone and internet access for example google shows ubiquitous use in more rural communities and townships that have widespread internet availability but much lower use in the mountainous areas of the rocky mountains location information in these networks is multi use and generally non specific the distribution of flickr data is similar to that of google data in the eastern portion however with a few pockets of less interest from a photographic standpoint in contrast however many photos on flickr are tagged as views of the rocky mountains which increases the number of times images are identified as such even though these areas may be less accessible environmental covariates such as nbr and shm may better indicate why particular locations were more suitable for human use than others both shm as a combined indicator of temperature and precipitation and nbr indicative of forest structure are related to forest vegetation productivity and prevailing forest conditions recreation likelihoods consistently increased as shm increased when modelling both strava and wikilocs data indicating that areas with more variation in seasonal temperatures may be more conducive to recreation an important consideration with these data is that this study averaged remote sensing climate covariates and social network data over the study period consequently it ignored changes in land use cover or human activity over time recognizing that social network data were not created specifically to represent tourism behaviours or provide data for research is important ruths and pfeffer 2014 age gender longley et al 2015 tenkanen et al 2017 and education biases hausmann et al 2017b are present within these data which requires methods that account for specific social network algorithms access constraints and nonhuman data accounts bots amongst other characteristics social network users with extremely positive or negative experiences are more likely to post than those with moderate experiences tatar et al 2014 while responses to posts may differ depending on users relationships murphy et al 2007 these phenomena related to word of mouth have implications for the choice of location and intensity of use of particular areas for recreation tham et al 2013 which makes them important considerations for conservation planning for example hausmann et al 2018 and wood et al 2013 found that social network data could be used to explore and monitor preferences for biodiversity and human activities which gives managers potential insight into methods for monitoring prevailing tourism interests likewise using social network data to estimate and measure visitation to parks and protected areas has shown promise and may also provide relevant details about the uses and value of recreational lands heikinheimo et al 2017 sessions et al 2016 tenkanen et al 2017 leveraging social network data to incorporate public preference for biodiversity to promote and support conservation planning is also promising hausmann et al 2017a 4 2 grizzly bear behaviour our behaviour results suggested that bears had higher probabilities of being in a travelling state while in areas of greater recreation and tourism likelihood this result is consistent with previous studies in which the rate of grizzly bear movement was shown to increase near trails ladle et al 2019 and roads roever et al 2010 particularly when roads were visible parsons et al 2020 conversely the models show that bears are more likely to be in a resting foraging or eating state state 1 in areas away from recreation and tourism bears may modify their activity patterns to use areas of high recreation likelihood more when human use is low e g at night we did not however analyse temporal relationships which sonter et al 2016 highlight as being an important consideration for conservation decision making wildlife have been frequently observed to choose areas perceived as safe when resting while tolerating areas of greater risk when travelling saher and schmiegelow 2005 animals may also increase movement rates in response to risk or disturbance ladle et al 2019 prokopenko et al 2017 ladle et al 2019 found that rates of grizzly bear movement increased near trails with both motorized and non motorized activity but that responses were greater with increasing likelihood of motorized activity in our study state 2 responses moderate speed undirected movement mimicked those of state 3 rapid directed movement more closely than those of state 1 suggesting that even moderate increases in recreation and tourism use triggers changes in movement and behaviour while this result may have been due to humans recreating in low quality foraging habitat we argue it is unlikely many of the popular recreation sites and trails in this area travel through productive lowland areas that would be high quality foraging habitat for grizzly bears in the absence of humans the relationship between the travelling state state 3 and recreation likelihood was the least pronounced and consistent amongst social networks this may be due to the travelling state being a hybrid of foraging and movement states as well as having a wider variety of ecological interpretations in the landscape trends in travelling may also be associated with predicted recreation and tourism likelihood in the rocky mountains the social networks whose data layers predicted high likelihood in the rocky mountains flickr facebook also predicted a positive correlation with state 2 moderate movement thus these trends may be due in part to underlying differences in elevation between social network platforms as travelling may be easier in valleys than mountainous regions similar patterns in grizzly bear behaviour between our results and the literature demonstrate that social network data can be used to estimate the propensity for human use and its potential effects on grizzly bear movement spatial representations of recreation and tourism likelihood could help delineate areas in a landscape that are safer or riskier for bears which would afford managers a way to understand where the risk of recreation and tourism pressure is higher the potential to incorporate seasonality and temporal patterns into grizzly bear movement data and recreation likelihood could help delineate high risk areas in the landscape throughout the year and increase the amount of information available for conservation efforts for grizzly bears to further investigate how human activity derived from social networks influences grizzly bears future studies could examine how human presence and activity influence bear diurnality physiological function and wariness in a shared landscape connections between environmental suitability for humans and bears are important for managing human wildlife interactions and provide a way to map areas that may be more prone to anthropogenic habitat pressures integrating these findings and continuing to combine social network data with environmental covariates as a proxy for human use potential could be a way to map human use effectively at the landscape level 5 conclusions and perspectives this study proposed a novel method for mapping tourism and recreation likelihood and related their spatial distributions to patterns of grizzly bear movement behaviour using a maxent modelling framework we outlined that all included social networks generated better than random likelihood distributions strava and wikilocs both networks where users deliberately uploaded spatial data had the highest accuracy metrics and were most associated with environmental covariates this could indicate that purposeful spatial data uploads may yield more accurate sample data for future modelling approaches covariates including nbr and access were found to be particularly valuable for explaining sample distributions highlighting that landscape vegetation structure and access to tourism and recreation locations are highly important variables to consider in landscape level analyses recreation and tourism likelihoods from maxent models were compared with telemetry data from grizzly bear collars indicating a decreased use of the landscape for eating and resting as recreation and tourism likelihood increased to our knowledge this is the first analysis to use social network data to evaluate fine scale spatial patterns of social network use related to animal behavioural responses these data could be particularly powerful for improving knowledge of spatial distributions and intensities of recreation and tourism across biodiversity management areas the approach developed in this study could help improve understanding and mapping of recreation and tourism patterns as well as provide insights into which environmental drivers could be important for improving conservation and land management these newly developed likelihood distributions of recreation and tourism can be combined with species movement and behaviour studies to better manage human habitat pressures and identify areas of greater interaction risk in dynamic landscapes such as the yellowhead region of alberta doing so could help promote specific conservation strategies such as managing human access during important animal life cycle events or developing wildlife and tourism corridors likewise analysis of social networks at different times of the year could help identify where habitat pressures are highest each season promoting the use of these networks within parks to understand recreation and tourism movements better with the ultimate goal of improving conservation management would help keep data layers of human habitat pressures in dynamic landscapes up to date and facilitate maintaining the best available data for conservation

ecosystem impacts and climate change firmer understandings of the tradeoffs between sectors and stakeholders are warranted water quality changes via thermal pollution can have impacts on aquatic ecosystems as water temperature has a direct impact on body temperature for most fishes beitinger et al 2000 thermoelectric power plants that utilize open loop cooling typically pose the largest threat to water quality via thermal pollution from cooling water in particular quantifying and modeling the direct impact of thermal pollution on aquatic ecosystems has until recently been a gap in the literature logan and stillwell 2018a furthermore the water quality impacts from temperature change are expected to create shifts in the spatial distribution of some fish species pandit et al 2017 previous work by logan and stillwell 2018b demonstrated the creation of temperature duration curves tdcs in relation to thermoelectric power plant thermal pollution tdcs are a visual tool that model the temperature conditions of a waterway over a given time and downstream distance much like flow duration curves fdcs are used to show flow conditions over time logan and stillwell 2018b previously quantification or modelling of thermal pollution within a biological context has been scarce additionally thermal pollution s impact on aquatic ecosystems can be viewed as an externality of the electricity generation process with tradeoffs between electricity production and thus associated thermal pollution and aquatic ecosystem degradation via reduced fish populations occurring the quantification of these tradeoffs is another gap in the literature which should be addressed to aid energy water biology nexus decision making within ecosystem services frameworks han et al 2020 note that many nexus studies lack analysis of the interactions of economic social and environmental impacts in this work a direct biologic use of tdcs in population assessments and economic analyses is

forefront phdcs are presented as an exceedance probability for fish community population values following the forms commonly used for water quality standards see vogel and fennessey 1995 temperature

using benefits transfer methodology the method is demonstrated using a meta analysis of electric power research institute epri fish population and temperature data collected at the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river using the meta analysis of empirical data for plume conditions and ambient conditions within the waterway an additional scenario in which the power plant must mitigate the temperature output by 1 1 c is presented this temperature change was chosen as 1 0 c is the point at which some species react to temperature shifts kennedy 2004 the results of this study show how the values of electricity generation and fish populations change with the constraints of plume conditions ambient conditions and the 1 1 c temperature mitigation scenario by including an economic application of phdcs this work demonstrates one method by which decision makers can monetarily interpret the environmental impact of power generation on aquatic ecosystems such work serves to inform decision makers and power plant operators seeking to balance electricity generation and aquatic ecosystem environmental impact in particular thermal limits administered by regulators could also be accompanied by economic impact assessments based on the realized and or potential loss to local fish populations 2 background 2 1 water temperature and fish as temperature is a major regulator of life cycles kennedy 2004 changes in water temperature can disrupt aquatic ecosystems coutant 1987 poole and berman 2001 temperature tolerance has long been a staple in understanding fish behavior beitinger et al 2000 fish behavior is linked to habitat selection with behavioral changes attributed to stress and or stimuli beitinger 1990 furthermore temperature is a resource within the water column magnuson et al 1979 thus fish might seek optimal temperature conditions as part of habitat selection within the context of optimal temperature conditions thermal pollution can be viewed as a stress to the system and the risk of exceeding thermal preferences are quantifiable logan and stillwell 2018a temperature is tied to other resources within aquatic habitats such that temperature changes affect dissolved oxygen content a study by abdi et al 2020 demonstrated the improvements in fish habitat associated with thermal river restoration and increased dissolved oxygen content such studies demonstrate there is a tradeoff in resource quality and fish populations such tradeoffs can be further analyzed within the context of thermoelectric power plant electricity production water quality e

electricity generation via operating criteria and the relationship to downstream water quality e g temperature can be assessed from the lens of impacts to fish populations for additional information on ecosystem services and benefits transfer methodology refer to a 1 building off of the quantification of risk and resources habitat time series analysis has been presented in the literature with planning and management applications 2 2 habitat time series analysis use of habitat metrics for time series analysis is commonly used in environmental design standard applications castellarin et al 2013 such as determining minimum flow requirements and instream flow water rights milhous et al 1990 time series analysis of biological data as outlined in milhous et al 1990 generates a weighted usable area wua as a function of physical habitat and streamflow also referred to as a habitat duration curve hdc in vogel and fennessey 1995 and relative suitability index in payne 2003 wuas are discrete values that relate the relative amount of usable habitat metric within a waterway bovee 1982 milhous 1984 previously presented the concept of habitat and streamflow functions as surrogates for the production function commonly used in economic analyses in environmental analyses the production function can be used as a valuation method and has been applied frequently in fisheries management studies armstrong et al 2016 wuas should be thought of as an index for comparison e g percentage of habitat loss and not a true reflection of direct habitat units e g fish per m 2 payne 2003 when generating hdcs the habitat and species metrics used can include a variety of data such as water velocity and pool depth and population size fecundity and biomass respectively selecting metrics as useful measures of performance for the species of interest is important for assessing biologic sustainability milhous et al 1990 in the conceptualization of hdcs the graphs of streamflow discharge versus time and relative habitat metric versus discharge are necessary typically the habitat metrics are averaged or weighted to generate a weighted usable habitat on a scale of 0 to 1 for use in the generation of an hdc and associated weighted usable area vogel and fennessey 1995 present a simplified development of an hdc which is a component of the instream flow incremental method commonly used by the u s fish and wildlife service the graph of an hdc can be used to demonstrate when water resources flow are limiting integrated to determine relative changes in habitat over time or as comparative analysis between flow scenarios milhous et al 1990 recent work by ceola et al 2018 expands the hdc literature demonstrating a habitat suitability duration curve with application in ecologically and hydrologically homogeneous catchments 3 methodology in the case of thermoelectric power generation thermal pollution and its impact on aquatic ecosystems can be viewed as an externality of the electricity generation process the tradeoff between electricity production and thus associated thermal pollution and aquatic ecosystem degradation via reduced fish populations can be quantified and used as a decision making tool within ecosystem services frameworks using fish populations and tdcs for the shawnee fossil plant phdcs were generated and an economic analysis was completed as a demonstration using benefits transfer methodology 3 1 power plant data and temperature duration curves the shawnee fossil plant sfp located near paducah kentucky on the ohio river is a baseload coal fired power plant using open loop cooling technology and has been the focus of previous work by logan and stillwell 2018a b in this work tdcs were generated for a 1000 m section of river and a temperature range of 16 to 50 c following the methods outlined in logan and stillwell 2018b u s energy information administration eia and united states geological survey usgs data concerning power plant cooling water flow discharge and temperature and river flow discharge respectively were used to generate tdcs fig 1 demonstrates the tdcs for the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river using 26 years of summer data of the maximum temperature differential between intake and effluent δ t and average discharge for each year plume conditions are the conditions found within the thermal plume and ambient conditions are the expected waterway conditions in the absence of thermal pollution for the 26 years of available at time of study feasible data the average δ t was 6 9 c see a 2 for more on power plant and river data cormix an epa approved mixing software with special emphasis on power plant mixing zone dynamics doneker and jirka 1991 2002 was used to generate plume and mixing dynamics see a 2 matlab was utilized for curve fit analysis and creation of tdcs as described in logan and stillwell 2018b probability distributions were analyzed based on cormix output of ambient and plume dimensions and temperature conditions following logan and stillwell 2018a using the probability distributions of temperature versus downstream distances e g probable plume size and δ t conditions an average across the river channel for the chosen downstream distance 1000 m is used to generate one probability of exceedance curve p t for 0 56 c intervals within the full temperature range of the ambient and plume data the trapezoidal rule was used to find the area under each exceedance curve and a singular tdc is created following eq 1 logan and stillwell 2018b 1 p t j 0 1000 p x d x 1000 where p x is the probability of exceedance curve 1000 is the total downstream distance m and j is the temperature range of interest t l o w e r to t u p p e r over the full temperature data range tdcs follow the form of flow duration curves fdcs which are commonly used in hydrologic analysis of waterways streamflow discharge data over a given time period are used to generate a waterway s fdc a cumulative frequency curve which demonstrates the percentage of time a discharge is expected to occur or be exceeded over that specified time period searcy 1959 in a similar fashion tdcs represent the cumulative frequency of temperature conditions over a given time period with a collection of yearly eia data being analogous to the summer season reading fig 1 a temperature of 32 c is expected to be equaled or exceeded under ambient conditions slightly over 20 of the time in the ohio river at the sfp location for the same 32 c temperature under plume conditions the exceedance jumps to roughly 60 of the time for a complete demonstration of the data and methods used to generate the tdcs refer to logan and stillwell 2018b 3 2 fish and temperature data biological data were cross referenced across epri studies through the ohio river ecological research program orerp to find suitable data availability at the location of the sfp the ohio river is a major river providing both aquatic species habitat stark 2013 and cooling water for thermoelectric power plants butz et al 1974 fish are an appropriate biological indicator species for river ecosystems as they spend their entire life cycles in the water and fish species tend to have wide population ranges making them easy to sample orsanco 2016 to demonstrate phdcs fish populations recorded as catch per effort cpe km by epri were used abundance population level is considered to be a larger indicator of the effect a species has on the local ecosystem than presence absence ehrlén and morris 2015 the freely available epri data consist of yearly studies as part of orerp with specific power plants featured in different years the sfp was included in seven years since 2005 at the time of study in each yearly study three upstream and three downstream sampling events occur in june august and october and include physical parameters such as water temperature water clarity and conductivity and fish species name and population reported as cpe for more information on epri data refer to a 3 for this work the water temperature and cpe data were retained for reference preston and white 1978 noted that the lower reaches of the ohio river contained the highest fish biomass per unit area compared to upper river reaches 3 3 population versus temperature plots to generate population versus temperature curves following the form of thermal performance curves tpcs 40 population values 6 values per year 3 upstream and 3 downstream per year less the november data points from 2009 recorded as cpe were plotted against the corresponding temperature condition on average the temperature differential between upstream and downstream temperature was 2 0 c warmer downstream and the cpe value differed by an average of 100 fish more fish upstream for this study the cpe value is interpreted to be a population value as the downstream distance of interest 1000 m in this study is equivalent to the cpe measurement per 1000 m a downward sloping line was best fit to the data following a linear regression p 0 02 r 2 0 13 as shown in fig 2 a rosner outlier test was performed on the 40 cpe versus temperature data points with results indicating that no outliers exist in the cpe dataset note that the two largest cpe values were recorded in the upstream portion of the river although temperature is not the only determinant of population even small temperature changes can have an impact on aquatic species as noted by kennedy 2004 thus a value of r 2 0 13 is interpreted as a correlation between temperature and fish but other factors also contribute to the presence or absence of individuals within the aquatic ecosystem which are inherently complex with multiple factors interacting to create a complete habitat in this analysis temperature is isolated as the variable of interest in predicting total fish population however temperature is not the only indicator of fish presence analysis of biological and physicochemical data collected in the epri studies see a 4 and a 5 suggest a non negligible correlation between population and flow but reinforces a greater correlation with temperature this conclusion is confirmed by studies such as lessard and hayes 2002 which found temperature to be the most important predictor of species richness within a michigan waterway affected by small dams thus in this study temperature is isolated as the variable of interest however exercise caution when using temperature alone as a predictor of population values another suggested metric for comparison is species specific populations for species with narrow or cold water temperature tolerances affected by thermal pollution other species could serve as opportunists and thrive at higher temperatures in the river phdcs could be used to demonstrate the effect of temperature on such opportunists as well as invasive species that can thrive in thermally altered waterways such as at thermoelectric power plant sites emde et al 2016 for a range of temperature conditions all species present in a system will have varied and partially or fully overlapped species specific tpcs like tpcs the shape in fig 2 demonstrates the relationship between a habitat variable temperature and response fish population to capture uncertainty in the analysis the standard error se from the linear regression of population versus temperature data points was used as were the resulting curves generated from the uncertainty bands of se to solve for additional phdcs fish populations can vary widely due to species interactions and environmental factors shelton and mangel 2011 thus uncertainty analysis was applied to reflect such factors to analyze population data eq 2 was followed 2 n j i 1 n n i j where n i j is the total number of individuals in population i at temperature j and n j is the sum of all populations at temperature condition j in this work only the total fish population is considered within the waterway thus i 1 but eq 2 is presented to allow for future analysis either at the species level where i represents individual species or across multiple populations mussels fish etc all population values are for the sfp location as reported in the epri data only within plume and ambient conditions are considered for a 1000 m river segment in this analysis three possible waterway temperature conditions j exist of which the thermally reduced plume conditions represent a scenario in which the power plant must mitigate the temperature output by 1 1 c a 1 1 c shift in δ t was chosen as 1 0 c is the point at which some species react to temperature shifts kennedy 2004 each condition is listed and described below ac ambient conditions j δ t 0 c pc empirical data plume conditions j δ t 6 9 c rc thermally reduced plume conditions j δ t 5 8 c thermally reduced conditions rc correspond to a reduction in δ t as outlined in section 3 6 while empirical data plume conditions pc correspond to the plume conditions expected using eia data 3 4 generation of population habitat duration curves to generate a phdc both a tpc and tdc are necessary the form of a tdc follows that of flow duration curves see logan and stillwell 2018b flow duration curves are typically presented as the complement to the cumulative distribution function cdf for streamflow vogel and fennessey 1994 also referred to in some literature as 1 cdf thus the form of a tdc fig 1 is the complement of the cdf for temperature in a waterway to solve for the probability of exceeding a given population value b or threshold as presented in the form of tpcs fig 2 eqs 3a and 3b were used 3a p n i j b p t n i 1 t t n i 2 3b p n i j b p t n i 1 e p t n i 2 e where n i j is total number of individuals in population i at temperature j with a desired population threshold b and t n i 1 is the temperature along the tpc at which the maximum population value occurs and t n i 2 is the temperature along the tpc at which the threshold population value n i j occurs solving eq 3a requires finding the probability of exceedance values associated with t n i 1 and t n i 2 on the tdc and subtracting the difference following eq 3b the above equations represent an expected temperature range on the tdc which correlates to a population threshold b that is exceeded over the expected temperature range note that since the tpc in this study is linear the population threshold b is compared to the maximum population at the lowest temperature which occurs at p e 100 see fig 3 if the tpc was parabolic as discussed in a 6 two occurrences of n i j would exist along the curve and would be used to solve for p n i b using a generated phdc the value p n i b which is an expected population value corresponds to an individual p e moving forward the population value associated with p n i j b will be referred to as λ in future equations a graphical representation of eqs 3a and 3b is presented in fig 3 these curves were used to generate the phdcs specific for this study refer to a 6 for additional figures demonstrating phdc generation using a parabolic tpc phdcs graphically demonstrate the probability of exceedance for population values such that at a given p e value the population is expected to be equivalent or greater than the corresponding population value since the temperature range of tpcs in this study is smaller than the total temperature range of the tdcs the phdcs reflect a probability of exceedance value above which the population is expected to be zero defining habitat related thresholds is consistent with past work on hdc conceptualizations e g capra et al 1995 when interpreting phdcs the area under a phdc corresponds to the total expected availability of temperature as a resource over the entire summer season also known as a weighted usable area wua as described in section 2 2 integration of phdcs is an existing method for quantifying the impact of different conditions bovee 1982 effectively curve integration produces a quantification of available resource or habitat metric for this study temperature as a resource for fish populations comparison of the change in area under the curve under different thermal regimes shows the relative loss or gain in temperature as a resource for the population of interest the wua is a comparative metric for the temperature conditions for fish population over the summer season in the given river reach following wua literature following water quality index duration curves vogel and fennessey 1995 the phdcs also demonstrate the probability of exceedance for a given population value the comparison of ambient conditions expected versus plume conditions thermally elevated via phdc integration provides relative comparison metrics specific to this location but the method applies broadly in any resource species scenario refer to section 3 3 and a 6 for more on tpcs 3 5 valuation of fish species and populations using benefits transfer methodology the monetary valuation of fish species from other studies is applied to this work refer to a 1 for more information one method to assess fish economically is using the replacement cost per individual replacement cost can represent the cost to replace an endemic individual with one grown at a hatchery predicated upon the idea that power plants can have a direct effect on fish mortality replacing fish from affected populations is a simple indicator of the possible environmental damages associated with thermal pollution southwick lotfus 2017 southwick and loftus 2003 present a thorough catalog of fish replacement cost by species family and u s region replacement costs are intuitive and simple to calculate however the replacement cost of a resource can seriously underestimate or overestimate the value that people gain from that resource brown 2017 other economic preference valuation methods estimate the true value people have for fish known as their willingness to pay wtp johnston et al 2006 completed a meta analysis of wtp values for a range of recreational fishes and found that the average wtp per fish was 22 57 converted to 2017 dollars to match with electricity price data in section 3 7 with a range of 0 06 to 822 36 for this study the average wtp as found in johnston et al 2006 was utilized with sensitivity analysis completed over a range of replacement cost and wtp values a comparison of replacement cost and wtp values for select species found in the ohio river is presented in table 1 the total population value follows eq 4a which can be down scaled to a species level for a more species specific assessment under a given temperature condition using eq 4b in this study a holistic population value is assessed via a sensitivity analysis on price per individual with the range in value per individual fish assessed at the minimum and maximum value as presented in table 1 4a f v i j λ r i k i 4b f v j i 1 n f v i j where f v i j is the monetary value of population i under condition j in λ is the total population i under condition j where λ is defined in section 3 4 as the population value associated with p n i j b and j is defined in section 3 3 r i is the value for population i per individual as defined in table 1 k i is the non use value for population i and n is the total number of populations of interest one in this analysis fish as discussed in section 5 2 i could represent specific species that sum to a total population value if a species specific assessment is of interest due to the difficulty in identifying site specific non use values of individual fish species the k i term is neglected in the calculations presented here but included in the equation for clarity and use in future applications see section 5 following eq 4b the summation of all f v i j values for a given phdc probability of exceedance value produces the community level monetary value of all populations mussels fish etc under condition j to generate a dollar value for a given population of fish the minimum and maximum value as found in table 1 were used to complete a sensitivity analysis the average wtp reported by johnston et al 2006 was used as the average value for the population found at the sfp in the absence of more species and community specific economic data in a broader context the use of a resource and the value of using that resource are important factors in valuing fisheries particularly in light of sustainable management practices blicharska and rönnbäck 2018 gentner and bur 2010 note that commercial and recreational per fish values can differ further complicating the desire to define fish by a single use value in this study both replacement cost and use value wtp were included but it is acknowledged that other valuations exist 3 6 power plant generation and discharge temperature assuming all other operational conditions remain the same power plant cooling water thermodynamics are governed by a mass and energy balance following eq 5 5 q h 2 o m c δ t where q h 2 o kj hr is the heat rate m kg hr is the discharge flow rate c kj kg c is the specific heat of water and δ t c is the temperature differential between intake and effluent the overall power plant thermal efficiency for a coal fired power plant is tied to the heat loss through cooling water and heat loss to air through the exhaust see urieli 2010 and martín 2012 for thorough power plant thermodynamics discussions using eq 5 and a constant power plant efficiency the tradeoff between cooling water flow rate and cooling water discharge temperature e g thermal pollution δ t was determined the tradeoff equation is simplified here but work by others such as cook et al 2015 and koch and vögele 2013 follow a similar thermodynamic balance the operational efficiency of the sfp was assumed to be 33 η 0 33 which is consistent with average eia reported efficiency via average operating heat rate for coal fired power plants energy information administration 2018a further examination of eia form 923 data for the sfp shows variability monthly post 2010 and annually prior to 2010 in terms of efficiency thus a static efficiency is used to represent average conditions note that for this analysis efficiency and operational conditions are held constant and assumed to be the average operating conditions for a summer season in reality efficiency water flow rates and generation fluctuate tidwell et al 2019 typically heat rates are used to solve for efficiency such that the total fuel input of coal q t o t a l is divided between electricity generation q g e n and losses to condenser cooling water q h 2 o and flue gas q a i r following eq 6 and fig 4 6 q t o t a l q g e n q h 2 o q a i r where q t o t a l q g e n q h 2 o and q a i r are in kj hr to validate the efficiency assumptions and solve for the relative percentage of heat load parsed between q a i r and q h 2 o data from martín 2012 and grubert et al 2012 were used energy heat losses via flue gas to the air q a i r while non negligible are roughly one sixth the heat loss via condenser cooling water q h 2 o see fig 1 in grubert et al 2012 comparing heat rate values for coal fired power plants a 10 heat rate loss via air and other small losses was assumed for the sfp comparing heat rate losses to water a loss of 57 is assumed for the sfp heat rate values in units of kj kwh are presented in table 2 while the kj kwh heat rates remain essentially constant during operation the electricity production in kwh can change the fixed generation water and air relationship is used to determine the loss in electricity generation from shifting δ t while holding discharge flow rate constant to solve for changes in δ t while holding the flow rate m constant eq 5 following martín 2012 was used generation was calculated for the summer season defined by the eia as april through september e g one half of a full year using eia reported data on discharge flow rate m kg hr and δ t as discussed in section 3 1 the expected summer losses of electricity generation when δ t is reduced rc was calculated as indicated by a shift in the tdc for the sfp to shift a tdc the shift is applied to post cormix data during curve fit analysis in matlab for more on the curve fit analysis refer to logan and stillwell 2018a the years of available data generated similar plume shapes and temperature decay with even spread among shapes and sizes to reduce computational complexity any changes to plume mixing mechanics as a result of reducing δ t at the power plant scale are assumed to be within the bounds of uncertainty presented in logan and stillwell 2018a as such shifting the tdc by incremental temperature values while still capturing a predicted shift in tdcs and resultant phdcs is possible without the need to replicate cormix prediction files to generate new plume mixing characteristics additionally 2d averaged downstream cross sections are utilized to produce a tdc for a 1000 m river section thus any greater accuracy provided by completing additional cormix runs would potentially be negated in the distance averaged creation of the tdcs average sfp data for 26 years were used to calculate q g e n and uncertainty is reported as a range using the sem on the 26 years of generation data with resulting q g e n values 3 7 valuation of power plant generation to determine the estimated net value of a power plant producing 1 mwh of electricity the wholesale price of electricity mwh less the marginal cost of that same mwh was used the economic loss expected when a power plant reduces their mwh output was found following eq 7 the expected summer losses in value from decreasing the δ t associated with thermal effluent when all other operational conditions were held constant was found 7 p v j g j w m where p v j is the monetary value of generation under conditions j in g j is the generation in mwh of under conditions j w is the wholesale price of electricity in mwh and m is the marginal cost of electricity in mwh price paid to the power plant per mwh less the cost to produce electricity per mwh provides a estimated per mwh value for electricity generation in order to find the per mwh value wholesale price fuel cost and operations and maintenance cost were assessed the wholesale summer april september 2017 price of electricity as reported by the intercontinental exchange for the hub closest to the sfp within the midwest region averaged 38 56 per mwh with a range of 27 00 to 81 75 per mwh weighted average values energy information administration 2018b the sem for weighted average values over the summer season was 1 44 and was used to generate upper and lower uncertainty bounds on the expected wholesale price of electricity using national renewable energy laboratory data for 2017 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 the range in fuel costs for coal fired power plants were 20 to 25 per mwh and the variable operations and maintenance costs were 5 to 9 per mwh these numbers bring the total range e g uncertainty in marginal cost fuel cost plus operations and maintenance cost for coal fired electricity generation to 25 to 34 per mwh average 29 50 per mwh though variation exists in regional pricing specific generator operations etc using 38 56 per mwh wholesale price and 29 50 per mwh marginal cost the sfp s value is estimated to be 9 06 per mwh under average conditions for a summer season using 2017 price data using the sem the range in value is 3 12 to 15 00 per mwh to calculate the expected loss in value from a decrease in δ t the lost generation in mwh was multiplied by the expected value price of 9 06 per mwh electricity prices are dependent on demand environmental factors and more but overall the expected pricing structure is likely to stay closer to the expected average as opposed to the extremes for a baseload coal fired power plant additionally electricity dispatch is optimized to help stabilize cost and price trends while maintaining efficient electricity supply to the grid federal energy regulatory comission 2015 4 results following eqs 3a and 3b using population versus temperature curves modeled after tpcs see fig 2 and tdcs see fig 1 phdcs were produced see fig 5 for fish located near the sfp on the ohio river three temperature conditions ac pc rc as defined in section 3 3 were analyzed 4 1 population habitat duration curves the area under the phdcs represents the relative availability of temperature within the waterway under ambient ac plume pc and thermally reduced rc conditions comparison of the phdcs under ac and pc demonstrates that the available thermal resource temperature or usable habitat area as defined by population is reduced such that approximately 31 of the thermal resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions as compared to ambient river conditions when the thermal pollution in the plume is reduced by 1 1 c by reducing δ t under rc approximately 22 of the thermal resource becomes unavailable as compared to ambient conditions in this analysis 4 2 comparison of population values under different thermal conditions a p e value of 50 was selected for method demonstration purposes but any p e of interest could be selected for regulatory frameworks refer to section 5 while under different sets of environmental conditions the population of fish could increase or decrease it is assumed that the phdcs presented in fig 5 are indicative of a typical summer season under ambient conditions the expected population is at least 175 individuals for 50 of the season where p e is a proxy for the time in a season under plume conditions δ t 6 9 c the expected populations at the same p e declines to 119 individuals decreasing the plume δ t by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions δ t 5 8 c the expected population is 134 individuals ranges were found when all uncertainty conditions were applied on the population data using se and tdcs using sem and are reported in table 3 4 3 economic valuation of fish via phdcs under ambient conditions the expected fish population has a higher number of individuals and correspondingly has a higher economic value using the average wtp of 22 57 the population has a value of 3 950 under ambient water conditions when thermal pollution from the power plant is assessed the population decreases and has a value of 2 686 if the sfp reduces thermal pollution by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions the fish population increases in value compared to expected thermal pollution conditions with a value of 3 024 a summary of values with uncertainty ranges is presented in table 3 the range in expected population monetary value applies all uncertainty conditions including the range in replacement cost and wtp as found in table 1 and uncertainty ranges associated with fig 5 4 4 economic valuation of power generation the expected electricity generation over the summer season for the sfp following the methods presented in section 3 6 averaged 3 76 mmwh under plume conditions when the δ t is reduced by 1 1 c under the scenario of thermally reduced conditions holding all other operational conditions constant including cooling water withdrawal discharge rate the expected generation was 3 16 mmwh this change reflects a 16 reduction in electricity generation under thermally constrained operating conditions solving for summer value via eq 7 the value of 34 054 000 is reduced to 28 604 000 when the δ t is reduced by 1 1 c this translates to a loss of 5 450 000 under thermally constrained conditions a comparison of generation and value with uncertainty bounds is found in table 3 5 discussion ambient river conditions ac and thermoelectric power plant plume conditions pc that cause thermal pollution are compared for a population of fish using population habitat duration curves phdcs for the plume conditions empirical data were analyzed for normal operating conditions δ t 6 9 c and the analysis was repeated under the scenario of thermally constrained conditions rc where the average δ t was reduced by 1 1 c δ t 5 8 c phdcs visually and mathematically demonstrate the availability of thermal resources water temperature in waterways using adapted thermal performance curves tpcs and temperature duration curves tdcs the shawnee fossil plant sfp on the ohio river was used as a demonstration site for the tdcs necessary for phdc creation in this analysis roughly 31 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions as compared to ambient conditions even when the thermal pollution from the sfp was reduced by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions 22 of the temperature resource is still unavailable as compared to ambient conditions visual comparison of the different phdcs highlights the shift in temperature both with respect to a decreased range in relation to the tpc and overall decrease in resource availability this resource reduction is due to the compression of temperature availability over the temperature range of the fish community under thermal pollution conditions as shown in the tdcs for plume and thermally reduced conditions as shown in fig 5 plume conditions drastically reduce the availability of optimal temperature conditions to make specific cross species comparisons of expected populations individual tpcs would need to be analyzed to plot the phdcs each population threshold on the tpc is associated with a temperature range on the associated tdcs expected population values for economic analysis use a p e value of 50 the p e value could be selected by biologists to provide a minimum viable population mvp particularly if timing of temperature extremes and other environmental disturbances are known vélez espino and koops 2012 found that the mean mvp for many freshwater fish species was 272 adults although the total population level drops to 0 at a p e of 100 due to the shape of the tpc is each scenario it is assumed that avoidance by the individual fish will be employed as a coping strategy during brief temperature extremes though temperature still has a large impact on the overall and long term fish community see section 2 additionally the epri data used for the meta analysis do not necessarily reflect total populations but are indicative of population and temperature trends see sections 3 2 and 3 3 and the appendix this analysis involves a baseload coal fired power plant on a large river but the method applies to other situations under different power plant conditions the reduction in thermal resources could become larger particularly if a power plant operates using a larger δ t value difference between intake and discharge cooling water temperature as the temperature differential is a large factor in the form of a tdc logan and stillwell 2018b the operational conditions of a power plant are expected to largely influence the produced phdc increasingly engineers are being asked to make waterway conservation and improvement recommendations for a variety of issues including fish passage and maintaining habitat vogel and fennessey 1995 tools like phdcs could be used in tandem with tdcs to conduct site and species specific investigations of the affects of thermal pollution in waterways as a way to model predict and monitor such population and diversity changes it is important to note that wuas while respected by many and used by the u s fish and wildlife service as a comparative metric for habitat availability gallagher 1999 do not present a direct correlation between fish biomass and habitat suitability mathur et al 1985 the discrepancy can be attributed in large part to the typical derivation of wuas from multiple habitat metrics simultaneously e g depth velocity temperature and flow where all metrics are given equal weight mathur et al 1985 in some cases all habitat metrics are given a relative 0 to 1 weighting see bovee bovee 1982 such that the tpcs presented in this work would present temperature as a variable against which a scale of 0 to 1 were plotted for suitability in this study the relationship between number of individuals population and temperature was isolated to avoid arbitrary weighting of habitat variables that would in nature not interact in equal weight as temperature is noted as a large factor in species response to habitat coutant 1987 kennedy 2004 poole and berman 2001 the use of wuas is justified in this study furthermore rüger et al 2005 note that habitat suitability studies are useful for ecological impact assessments and can aid in water management frameworks 5 1 expanded use of population habitat duration curves in planning and management applications particularly concerning species populations and diversity phdcs can serve as a useful ecological model to assess the relative availability of temperature as a resource not only can different conditions be compared among a population but cross species comparisons can also be assessed particularly when critical assessment of species specific tpcs is made with river warming likely under climate change scenarios fish species particularly those species with lower temperature preferences will likely be affected sinokrot and stefan 1992 temperature shifts and thus changes in habitat can cause shifts in population distributions chapman 2009 reductions in usable habitat space can have similar effects like changes in biodiversity and food web structures mchugh et al 2015 changes in population could lead to localized and regional disruptions in diversity and dominance patterns as shown by daufresne and boët 2007 because temperature has been shown to be one of the most important factors influencing fish behavior and abundance buisson et al 2008 using phdcs as a measure of thermal resources to indicate the likelihood of finding fish species is useful extending beyond examining communities or species specific populations phdcs could be used to assess different life stages of the same species in life stage assessments care should be taken in using the appropriate months and data to distinguish spawning fish juvenile fish and adult fish milhous 1986 such population monitoring could be compared against future conditions predicted as a result of climate change scenario analysis under given thermal conditions would provide insight into localized climate change planning efforts to take phdcs another step further phdcs using temperature as a resource could be coupled with phdcs using flow discharge to provide insight into projected impacts of droughts and climate change scenarios as mentioned previously pools when available under low to adequate flow conditions serve as thermal refuge for fish species in times of severe temperature conditions foster et al 2001 considering water flow to be a resource in the same manner as temperature phdcs could be used to compare both resources individually with the combined results indicative of overall habitat conditions bovee 1982 presents methods to combine stream metrics of interest with wuas to provide more holistic water quality assessments in a study of the northeastern united states stewart et al 2013 found that almost 30 of thermoelectric power plant generated heat ends up in rivers further demonstrating the need for adaptable tools to assess thermal pollution in riverine ecosystems while direct quantification of the risk of exceeding species thermal preferences is valuable logan and stillwell 2018a phdcs refocus decision making on temperature as a relative resource within waterways as described by milhous 1986 habitat time series analyses are principally used for water management decisions instead of addressing fish under varying flow regimes the temperature based phdcs could address varying temperature regimes particularly in regards to changing cooling water flow rates and temperatures variability in a tdc will produce variability in the resultant phdc and scenarios of power plant effluent could be compared against the relative loss or gain in thermal resources such as is demonstrated in this work increasing power plant cooling water flow rates can decrease the thermal impact on rivers from power plant effluent following thermodynamics as shown in eq 5 which could prove to be a useful tradeoff depending on future climate conditions in regards to water temperature miara et al 2017 and during times of drought mu et al 2020 however water scarcity concerns might reduce the amount of water available for cooling purposes ganguli et al 2017 stillwell and webber 2013 negating the potential temperature flow rate tradeoff nevertheless phdcs could provide a useful comparison of such tradeoffs in adapting to climate change concerning thermoelectric power plants in regulatory settings temperature as a resource could serve as a useful metric by which planning and management could be complemented regulations aimed at protecting aquatic species such as the cwa 316 a could use phdcs to provide comparable metrics for population levels for example populations of fish are known to be mobile and thermal avoidance of adverse temperature conditions can occur metrics for balancing thermoelectric power plant thermal pollution with desired populations of indigenous or endangered species could come in a form such as an expected population of 300 individuals for no less than 35 of a season for example such population levels could be used to determine mvps or correlate to the number of adults necessary for successful reproduction likewise the wua for phdcs could complement similar frameworks such that the desired wua analogous to the availability of temperature is reduced by no more than a certain percentage regulatory mixing zones rmz are commonly described as varied and plentiful in terms of how they are defined and measured incorporating tdcs and phdcs into the analysis of a protection and propagation of balanced and indigenous populations as is required by npdes thermal variance permits could be beneficial henley 1995 calls for strategic planning in the ohio river particularly in the monitoring of fish populations and phdcs could aid in such efforts 5 1 1 limitations of the current study with climate change both water temperature and flow are likely to be affected pyne and poff 2017 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 and with environmental change altered species distribution and abundance patterns are expected ehrlén and morris 2015 simultaneous consideration of the effects of temperature and flow on fish species has been the focus of prior work such as by wenger et al 2011 in this work flow is used as an input to cormix to generate tdcs and therefore the combined effects of flow and temperature cannot be fully uncoupled the comparative extension of phdcs beyond isolating temperature as the only resource over which fish compete is proposed in regards to temperature as an individual factor precise monthly or weekly calculations could be completed given appropriate data availability in the present form the translation of eia yearly summer data as a comparable dataset to a summer season is not ideal but is warranted given a lack of more precise data this translation also follows past work by logan and stillwell 2018a b in terms of fish population data it is important to note that the consideration of fish populations as static or instantaneous numbers during a season is not ideal as current population levels are dependent on both past and present habitat conditions orth 1987 future use of phdcs could include more targeted timing analysis of temperature intensity and duration of localized thresholds throughout a season following the general framework outlined by capra et al 1995 large seasonal abundances of fish within river reaches can be indicative of episodic events lohner and dixon 2013 thus using data collected over several years without young of year populations provides a more stable indicator of expected community population conditions see a 4 5 2 application of population habitat duration curves in economic tradeoff analysis using phdcs as a method by which to complete economic analysis is a suggested application of the tool presented in this study particularly for ecosystem services analyses as such a tradeoff analysis of the value of electricity generation and the value of fish populations was completed by calculating expected loss and gain in dollars the tradeoff analysis has been framed in equivalent terms oftentimes ecosystem services are used as the accounting unit in environmental economics and policy but ecosystem services can be difficult to adequately value boyd and banzhaf 2007 this analysis shows the replacement cost for fish using a range of species specifically four species which were found at the study site and for which replacement cost data were available within a complex river ecosystem which may undervalue the holistic ecosystem services of the ohio river at the shawnee fossil plant other fish species are present in the system as well as non fish aquatic species which could result in a different monetary valuation in terms of using replacement cost a study by strange et al 2004 compared the restocking value via replacement cost using hatcheries data of fish lost due to entrainment and impingement with that of equivalent habitat restoration for the same size of fish population loss termed the habitat based replacement cost method strange et al 2004 assert that simply restocking lost fish every year is not ecologically equivalent to maintaining natural populations e g restocking versus allowing natural reproduction of the natural population strange et al 2004 found that the cost to replace a community of fish was on the order of 200 000 dollars but to conserve and replace the necessary habitat space to prevent the loss of fish cost on the order of 25 000 000 additionally natural fish populations include unique diversity and richness relationships at the community level that might not otherwise be available from hatcheries fish e g not all wild species are grown in hatcheries strange et al 2004 news reports discuss the failings of hatchery raised fish to provide equivalently adapted fish as replacements in natural ecosystems goldfarb 2014 as for reported monetary damages to fish populations as a result of thermal pollution or other pollution e g chemical events news articles also vary widely for example one news report valued a fish kill in iowa at 8 000 for 53 500 fish associated press 2016 while another article for iowa valued 58 000 fish at just over 10 000 000 sutterman 2012 thus a large range in value exists for fish kills of the same size within the same state the infamous 2009 black river fish kill in which an estimated 218 000 fish died as a result of manure pollution resulted in a 75 000 fine to the farm deemed responsible for the incident gross 2017 variation in estimated damages in news reports comes from the type of fish killed and the methods data used for valuation e g replacement cost versus habitat based replacement cost versus wtp the direct dollars to dollars comparison of electricity generation and fish populations can aid in future ecosystem services studies and particularly in fish kill assessments for example the natural resources defense council has placed an annual damage pricetag of 30 million on fish kills at the bay shore power plant located on lake erie lyndersen 2011 the economic valuation completed by gentner consulting group utilized fisheries data and benefits transfer methodology to monetarily assess the damages from impingement and entrainment at the bay shore facility gentner and bur 2010 as such there is precedent for this current economic valuation study and the economic comparison of power plants and the associated damages to fisheries this work adds to the literature by developing a tool specifically phdcs via thermal performance curves and temperature duration curves to assess expected population changes as a result of changing thermal pollution the phdc method is demonstrated for a fish population at the sfp location in the ohio river to accurately scale the economic damages by species from thermal pollution a full understanding of all the species present and their respective population estimates and monetary value would be necessary species specific population information is available in the orerp studies conducted by epri but this work focuses on the total fish community to demonstrate the phdc method for reference an impingement study at power plants along the ohio river indicated that millions of individuals are impinged on intake structures annually electric power research institute 2009b such large numbers indicate that many fishes are affected by power plants every year and population scaling might be necessary when using the epri data set for the fish population at the sfp the loss in value from reduced electricity generation p v p c p v r c was compared to the gain in population i value f v i r c f v i p c when the sfp thermal pollution was reduced by 1 1 c using the average values from table 3 the reduction in thermal pollution assuming all other operational conditions remain the same translates to a 5 450 000 loss in value for the sfp for the summer season this same reduction in thermal pollution translates to a meager 338 gain in the value of the fish population strictly by the numbers the monetary loss in electricity generation is several orders of magnitude higher than the monetary gain in fish populations keeping in mind that the average wtp was used in this work a cursory extrapolation in which species of special interest exist at the sfp with a maximum wtp value of 822 36 as reported in johnston et al 2006 the loss becomes 12 335 this extrapolated value does not take into account the variation in fish value across species nor is it based on the habitat based replacement cost value as discussed in strange et al 2004 when put into context of the entire ohio river aquatic community e g more than just fishes the change in economic value of the aquatic community might approach that of electricity generation what is presented in this study is a way to value populations monetarily using a meta analysis of fish population dependent on temperature conditions as expressed in tpcs future calculations could include any known habitat based replacement cost method values following the suggestions of strange et al 2004 by assessing the tradeoff at the population level e g isolating temperature and population monetary assessment of ecosystems in which keystone endangered and or commercially important species are present could be completed tools that support management and conservation efforts are important now more than ever as conservation needs grow while resources decline zohmann et al 2013 furthermore understanding the costs and benefits before species are lost will allow for better management of ecosystems meador and frey 2018 using phdcs both direct and indirect damage to aquatic communities could be quantified given adequate data to give a more complete picture for proactive species conservation efforts schirpke et al 2018 studied the environmental and socio economic effects of payments for ecosystem services and such a tool could be combined with phdcs as a method to fund conservation efforts by providing tools for the proactive quantification of ecosystem goods and services e g fish conservation efforts might not need to rely as heavily on reactive assessments of damages already done thus providing better success in maintaining and improving waterways in the study by gentner and bur 2010 the authors analyzed not only the predator fish species of interest but also quantified the loss in prey species that would otherwise be available to support walleye a fish critical to lake erie recreational fisheries similar to the approach presented here gentner and bur 2010 do not include non use values of fish inclusion of such data in this study could increase the total economic value of fish further enhancing the economic tradeoff analysis additionally the methods presented in this study are for a 1000 m downstream section of river assuming plume or ambient conditions as discussed in logan and stillwell 2018a even small scale changes within a waterway can affect the remainder of the waterbody if the thermal plume associated with the sfp causes fish to leave the system within the entire river channel with the effects extending beyond the 1000 m downstream distance then the economic loss to the system from thermal pollution would be greater than expressed in section 4 3 in locations where fish populations are larger or more valuable e g lake erie yellow perch and or power plant produced thermal pollution is greater the monetary damages might approach the same order of magnitude as power generation revenue loss the tradeoff between power generation with potentially several orders of magnitude greater revenue as compared to equivalent fish population loss highlights why regulations such as the cwa 316 a are necessary if left to market devices alone power plants would have little to no incentive to monitor or reduce thermal pollution in waterways regulations that protect aquatic life are typically enacted with a holistic ecosystem view in mind as opposed to discrete monetization of individual species or communities in fields such as ecosystem services refer to a 1 the value of an ecosystem as a whole is greater than the sum of the parts furthermore regulations have been shown to boost the economy a study of 10 years of federal regulations showed that the net benefits of environmental regulation outweighed the implementation costs and associated fines to industry spross 2013 additionally regulations can serve as the drivers of efficiency and innovation johnstone et al 2017 such that more environmentally friendly technologies are created to meet avoid regulations proactive assessment of ecosystem goods and services will be possible potentially reducing the retroactive costs of environmental conservation and mitigation efforts this valuation provides a tool for analysis and direct comparisons between operational conditions temperature of intake versus effluent can be weighed against holistic ecosystem valuation adding to tdcs as a tool for rmz definition logan and stillwell 2018b phdcs provide another method by which decision makers can assess current conditions at a power plant and compare those conditions to predicted or scenario based future conditions integration of phdcs into regulatory decision making is a worthy discussion point for future ecosystem valuation studies 5 2 1 emission taxes as a policy tool for optimal tradeoff between electricity generation and fish populations convincing power plants or the large scale companies that own them to pay for damages caused to local aquatic ecosystems from thermal pollution would be challenging even with an associated ecosystem services component climate change predictions and environmental sustainability what incentives do power plants have to reduce pollution likewise people have less incentive to reduce environmental damages in the present as the social cost will be incurred by future generations hanley et al 2007 to provide such incentives a market approach with an appropriate monetization scheme might be necessary though regulatory standards were favored prior to the 1970s a shift in thinking towards market based approaches has since occurred li and shi 2017 in a market approach economic variables become the incentive to reduce pollution callan and thomas 2010 as such value is assigned to an environmental aspect in this work fish populations are used as a proxy for aquatic ecosystem sustainability and thus a price is assigned to environmental pollution though four types of market based instruments exist a common one is the pollution charge which falls under the polluter pays principle in economic theory callan and thomas 2010 a special type of pollution charge is the product charge which is essentially a unit charge on a good e g electricity from which the production generates an externality e g loss to fish populations from thermal pollution an alternative to a product charge is an emission charge an emission charge is a price per unit of pollution e g temperature increase from thermal pollution that leads polluters to internalize the externalities of production so they are economically incentivized to lower pollution emissions hanley et al 2007 from an economic standpoint if a power plant is charged a certain tax per increase in temperature above ambient δ t then the power plant can choose to pay those taxes or invest in pollution abatement strategies e g a cooling tower and thus the power plant will choose a welfare maximizing investment in cooling technology transaction costs would include considerations like increased need for regulatory reporting and additional workforce and or equipment to monitor δ t in a more complete fashion than is currently reported using a tax there is the potential for power plants to pass through additional costs to consumers by increasing electricity prices that provides consumers with appropriate incentives to reduce the electricity use that leads to environmentally damaging power production an emission tax could be applied at the power plant level using tools such as temperature duration curves logan and stillwell 2018b or population habitat duration curves for economic tradeoff analysis a power plant could be assessed for current ambient tdc and above ambient tdc conditions and a certain desired percentage change above ambient tdc conditions could be taxed as an incentive to reduce thermal pollution alternatively the value of local aquatic populations could be assessed via the methods outlined in this work and a direct tax that matches the loss in value of local fish populations could be assessed this tax approach assumes a system with perfect information additionally productivity e g electricity generation even within the united states is widely dispersed between a range of power plants with unique operating and localized conditions when dealing with productivity dispersion the response to environmental taxes might differ greatly li and shi 2017 a tax while effective at internalizing the environmental damages of pollution to the company level instead of the damages being externalities does increase the marginal cost of production in an effort to induce abatement li and shi 2017 thus market forces will interact such that the marginal cost of electricity will become a driver of how much electricity is produced and by which producers e g thermal polluters vs non thermal polluters the shift in production caused by a thermal pollution tax might be similar to how other forces such as fuel costs and air pollution externalities affect the levelized cost of electricity especially from a policy perspective rhodes et al 2017 6 conclusion using a meta analysis of fish population and temperature data the creation and application of population habitat duration curves phdcs using the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river as a study site was demonstrated in particular comparison between ambient river conditions and two thermal effluent plume conditions empirical conditions from data where δ t 6 9 c and a scenario of thermally reduced conditions where δ t 5 8 c highlighted the availability of temperature as a resource the results show that for the fish population 31 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions for thermally reduced conditions representing a lower δ t 22 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable phdcs demonstrate the effect thermal pollution can have on aquatic populations in planning and management settings phdcs can be incorporated into habitat and population monitoring where temperature is a resource of concern e g as a quality metric or resource quantity metric comparison of populations in climate change scenario analysis could serve to inform decisions made now which will impact waterways in the future phdcs can aid in regulatory mixing zone analysis by serving as a quantifiable metric to set site specific expected population and or temperature guidelines as a specific application of phdcs a dollar value was applied to the increase in expected fish populations over the summer season when shifting from plume conditions to thermally reduced conditions as compared to the value of power plant electricity generation decreasing thermal pollution by 1 1 c increased the summer value of the fish population by 338 with the same shift in thermal pollution all other power plant operational conditions remaining constant economically the expected loss in electricity generation was valued at 5 450 000 scaling the method to a full aquatic community and incorporating non use value and habitat based replacement cost values for fish could prove to place the economic value of electricity generation and aquatic ecosystem populations closer in comparison additionally phdcs could serve useful in scenario analyses of the tradeoffs in power plant discharge flow rates and thermal pollution δ t particularly under climate change scenarios furthermore phdcs provide a proactive method to value fish as opposed to reactive valuations e g after fish kill events after which conservation efforts might be less effective credit authorship contribution statement

appendix a1 ecosystem services and benefits transfer methodology krugman and wells 2005 state that the most serious external costs to modern lifestyle are those associated with environmental damages e g loss of ecosystem functions and or resources many studies focus on ecosystem services as a metric by which society can monetarily value an ecosystem and its resource flows boyd and banzhaf 2007 recent work by hanes et al 2018 incorporates ecosystem services into the food energy water nexus demonstrating the need for such tradeoff analyses in the nexus space inherently ecosystem valuation involves tradeoffs between society and nature often with sustainability as a component of human welfare farber et al 2002 furthermore the tradeoffs between ecosystem services and economic services cause much of the debate surrounding valuation of the ecosystem bolgrien et al 2005 decision making concerning water resources in particular has often relied upon the inclusion of cost benefit analysis but with increasingly visible and pressing externalities such analyses are becoming inherently more complex freeman iii et al 2014 natural resources and environmental attributes provide flows of services to people such as a commercial fishery in a resource rich water body freeman iii et al 2014 here it is noted that in the context of fish in a river an ecosystem service is the fishability of the river and fish would be considered an ecosystem good bergstrom and loomis 2017 furthermore fish population trends especially as evidenced by long term monitoring programs can improve fishery management plans lohner and dixon 2013 tying fish species directly back to biodiversity and ecosystem services via valuation methods bergstrom and loomis 2017 found that 25 of river restoration valuations are focused on fish further emphasizing the economic importance of fish in ecosystem valuation discussions benefits transfer methodology common for u s riverine ecosystems bergstrom and loomis 2017 is a useful method by which to quantify the value of fish in a river system it is important to note that the total value of fish in a river includes use value and non use value the use value includes the on site recreational benefit of fishing consumption and direct economic gains e g commercial fishing whereas the non use value includes aspects like the benefit of knowing the fish exist in the river bergstrom and loomis 2017 benefits transfer methodology has been commonly used within environmental regulation and policy since the 1980s but current practices emphasize the need for value adjustments between studies freeman iii et al 2014 several methods exist for assigning monetary values to fishes and fish populations replacement cost is found as the cost of providing an ecosystem service using an artificial substitute for an element of nature that provides a naturally occurring ecosystem service sundberg 2004 for fish replacement cost is equal to the fishery hatchery costs of adding an individual fish to a stream such as in southwick lotfus 2017 applying nonmarket values obtained from one study to another study e g willingness to pay for recreational fishing at one lake to a study on another lake is also common freeman iii et al 2014 recreational use studies e g creel surveys can provide insight into management strategies for fisheries schell et al 1996 while providing fish population and popularity information fish kill assessments such as the procedures outlined in southwick and loftus 2003 can be used to economically quantify existing fish populations other methods for valuing recreational fishing include the travel cost method and contingent valuation cameron 1992 the overall concept of benefits transfer is highlighted here to provide additional background for the use of fish kill assessments and replacement cost in this study the true social value of an incremental amount of a natural resource is defined as marginal wtp in the case of fish that is the maximum amount of money people would be willing to pay to increase the population of the fish by one unit marginal wtp can be estimated with stated preference valuation methods that use hypothetical survey questions or revealed preference valuation methods that use data on actual human decisions such as where and how much to go fishing the estimate in johnston et al 2006 use revealed preference methods to estimate use value marginal wtp for having one more fish a2 power plant and river data data for the shawnee fossil plant sfp were collected from the energy information administration eia forms 767 and 923 such data included the intake temperature and effluent temperature reported 1985 2009 or interpreted 2010 2014 as a seasonal summer maximum cooling water discharge flow rates were also utilized reported as yearly averages in forms 767 and 923 in total 26 years of data were available and feasible as reported by the eia 1985 2014 with the year 2014 being the most recent year available in entirety at the time of this study river data were collected from the united states geological survey stream gage gage no 03611500 located at metropolis il within two miles upstream of the sfp average seasonal summer discharge paired to match the years of feasible data for the sfp was used in this study simplifying assumptions to complete cormix runs were made for the river including a manning s n of 0 025 average wind speed of 2 m s and a rectangular river cross section with variable depth and fixed width 1220 m as is consistent with logan and stillwell 2018a river channel geometry followed continuity using the fixed width discharge and rating curve usgs stream gage data and velocity data from the ohio river valley water sanitation commission orsanco to determine the plume geometry and mixing dynamics for each year of data cormix software was utilized cormix is considered to be an empirical model as data input is grouped and used to identify relationships among variables davis 1999 using empirical data input cormix completes length scale analysis to classify flow and determine the correct hydrodynamic equations for plume trajectory in general length scale models assess the comparative importance of variables of force in length terms and based on those comparative relationships classify flow davis 1999 cormix assumes steady state conditions unless otherwise specified by the user for mixing behavior as well as turbulent mixing conditions e g sufficiently large reynolds number doneker and jirka 2007 a3 population data fish population and water temperature data at the shawnee fossil plant from the electric power research institute s epri ohio river ecological research program orerp were used orerp produces yearly studies at power plant locations with particular interest in thermal pollution and fish populations years in which the sfp was studied include 2005 2006 2007 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 electric power research institute 2007 2008 2009a 2012 2014 2016 2017 within each yearly orerp study three upstream and downstream sampling events were completed typically in june august and october though in 2009 the sampling months were june august and november for certain data at the sfp electric power research institute 2012 using data from june to october is consistent with past work on the ohio river by thomas et al 2004 to avoid complication from inclusion of two cold water data points in the analysis the data from november for 2009 were removed for the meta analysis completed in this work additionally only electrofishing data were used which were collected in 500 m sections for consistency in data analysis only the catch events that were conducted using boat electrofishing were analyzed population data in the epri reports are presented in a variety of ways with catch per effort cpe km presented for upstream and downstream sampling in the results section values for plume and ambient conditions were reported as cpe values were reported as number of individuals per km the tdcs presented in this work are for a 1000 m 1 km downstream distance a4 additional population information from literature the shawnee fossil plant is located in ohio river navigational pool 53 illinois department of natural resources 2017 informing additional fish population information a report by henley 1995 using 1978 1987 data noted that pool 53 had one of the largest fish biomass estimates due to suitable flood plain and channel topography mean creel survey values per pool in the ohio river reported by henley 1995 varied in range depending on the species fish per acre values are also reported by henley 1995 and specific to pool 53 the most common species is gizzard shad at over 14 000 fish acre and bluegill and drum are also abundant at 170 and 207 fish acre respectively in the epri meta analysis gizzard shad threadfin shad and emerald shiner were removed from total population counts as the young of year yoy for those species appear as relative population boons unrelated to the overall community composition and makeup of the remaining fish community epri provides such normal community level population counts as cpe and the orerp analyses include data with and without gizzard shad threadfin shad and emerald shiner in henley 1995 species of interest like largemouth bass and black crappie have expected populations of 22 and 63 fish acre which is much smaller than the expected value for gizzard shad as such the removal of the three yoy populations is justifiable when concerned with stable economically viable populations of fishes of interest converting the study site area of 1000 m downstream distance length of river with a river width of 1 220 m width of river gives a total study area of approximately 1 220 000 m 2 a study of fish abundance on the ohio river using hydroacoustic estimates by hartman et al 2000 found that total fish populations ranged from 11 543 to 14 962 fish per 6 130 5 m 2 lock chamber scaling these values to the total study site 1 220 000 m 2 the population range is 2 297 000 to 2 977 000 total fish a preston and white 1978 study reports 181 000 total fish for the lower reach of the ohio river using the smithland no 50 and no 52 locks providing further insight into expected population ranges for fish note that the numbers reported in hartman et al 2000 were for lock chambers on the upper ohio river not at pool 53 overall literature values for expected fish populations vary widely presumably due to sampling methods timing and other factors the literature values reported above are merely presented as additional information with the potential for incorporation into future population assessments and or as scaling factors a5 temperature and other biological physicochemical data in addition to temperature readings upstream and downstream of power plant outfalls data collected for orerp studies included habitat characteristics e g percent boulder cobble gravel and sand specific conductance μ s cm mean monthly flow cfs water clarity mm and dissolved oxygen ppm in each year correlation analysis was completed between cpe as well as biomass and temperature habitat characteristics and river flow individually some years show positive neutral or negative correlation between fish population and temperature in completing the meta analysis the linear regression of population as a function of temperature was significant p 0 02 thus interannual data might be capturing large scale trends over time whereas intrannual sampling might be more dependent on specific seasonal influences within the habitat the significance of intrannual upstream versus downstream differences in dissolved oxygen flow water clarity and specific conductance also varied year to year in the orerp reports at the sfp completing a linear regression on dissolved oxygen flow clarity and specific conductance versus population for all years of available data less the november data points from 2009 following the same approach as for temperature versus population the relationship between flow and population was found to be significant p 0 03 r 2 0 11 water clarity did fit a second order polynomial inverted parabola trend r 2 0 11 but the trend was not significant p 0 12 thus flow and temperature were considered to be the most important factors affecting fish population at the sfp within the interannual meta analysis conducted for the purposes of demonstrating the effect of temperature on population temperature was isolated as the variable of interest for use in the creation of phdcs from tpcs and tdcs a study by lessard and hayes 2002 found temperature to be the most important predictor of fish species richness within michigan waterways affected by small dams henley 1995 noted that for some species with lower thermal tolerances e g striped bass temperature appeared to impact the number of older individuals in sampling events during summer collection rijnsdorp et al 2009 also discuss the effects of temperature on fish populations but note that at the community level changes in population as a result of temperature changes could be indicative of trophic interactions among species within the community a6 thermal performance curves the inclusion of fig a 6 is for reference for differently shaped tpcs such as an arbitrary parabolic tpc in literature tpcs can take many shapes with a curve resembling an inverted parabola with gentle upward trend toward the optimal temperature and rapid decline past the optimal temperature being commonly reported schulte et al 2011 in the main text the tpc was linear in shape it is possible that by including only the months of june august and october in the meta analysis of population versus temperature that the linear tpc is actually the trailing end of a larger inverted parabola shaped tpc however such conjecture is not warranted given the unavailability of winter time population and temperature data for the study location particularly given that summer e g warm water temperatures is the season of interest the tpc generated in this work is not necessarily indicative of mortality rates due to temperature but rather relates the likelihood of finding fish the meta analysis of epri data reveals small population values for the location of interest and could be an artifact of sampling methods or conditions note that in reality many species coexist at the location of interest with varied and overlapping species specific tpcs and potentially larger population values than were captured in epri data collection could be present additionally care should be taken when using tpcs particularly in climate change studies as suggested in section 5 1 with regard to the time scale of interest as well as the shape of the tpcs schulte et al 2011 the meta analysis in this work is intended to inform the generation of tpcs but the focus is on the method development and usefulness of phdcs in economic analyses supplementary material supplementary material associated with this article can be found

24684,water resources management and the interaction between society and the environment are an integral part of the energy water nexus thermal pollution from thermoelectric power plants poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems particularly in regards to optimal water temperature regimes for sustaining fish populations to quantify and address the tradeoffs in power plant electricity generation and associated thermal pollution from cooling water discharges on aquatic populations population habitat duration curves phdcs were generated the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river and specific fish populations were assessed with regard to water temperature dynamics following the concept of thermal performance curves electric power research institute biological data were used to demonstrate the relationship between temperature and fish population using those biological data and temperature duration curves phdcs were generated which can be used as ecological models in decision making frameworks and economic analyses the tradeoff in loss of electricity generation and gain of ecosystem value via fish populations is presented for a 1 1 c change in thermal pollution phdcs

ecosystem impacts and climate change firmer understandings of the tradeoffs between sectors and stakeholders are warranted water quality changes via thermal pollution can have impacts on aquatic ecosystems as water temperature has a direct impact on body temperature for most fishes beitinger et al 2000 thermoelectric power plants that utilize open loop cooling typically pose the largest threat to water quality via thermal pollution from cooling water in particular quantifying and modeling the direct impact of thermal pollution on aquatic ecosystems has until recently been a gap in the literature logan and stillwell 2018a furthermore the water quality impacts from temperature change are expected to create shifts in the spatial distribution of some fish species pandit et al 2017 previous work by logan and stillwell 2018b demonstrated the creation of temperature duration curves tdcs in relation to thermoelectric power plant thermal pollution tdcs are a visual tool that model the temperature conditions of a waterway over a given time and downstream distance much like flow duration curves fdcs are used to show flow conditions over time logan and stillwell 2018b previously quantification or modelling of thermal pollution within a biological context has been scarce additionally thermal pollution s impact on aquatic ecosystems can be viewed as an externality of the electricity generation process with tradeoffs between electricity production and thus associated thermal pollution and aquatic ecosystem degradation via reduced fish populations occurring the quantification of these tradeoffs is another gap in the literature which should be addressed to aid energy water biology nexus decision making within ecosystem services frameworks han et al 2020 note that many nexus studies lack analysis of the interactions of economic social and environmental impacts in this work a direct biologic use of tdcs in population assessments and economic analyses is

forefront phdcs are presented as an exceedance probability for fish community population values following the forms commonly used for water quality standards see vogel and fennessey 1995 temperature

using benefits transfer methodology the method is demonstrated using a meta analysis of electric power research institute epri fish population and temperature data collected at the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river using the meta analysis of empirical data for plume conditions and ambient conditions within the waterway an additional scenario in which the power plant must mitigate the temperature output by 1 1 c is presented this temperature change was chosen as 1 0 c is the point at which some species react to temperature shifts kennedy 2004 the results of this study show how the values of electricity generation and fish populations change with the constraints of plume conditions ambient conditions and the 1 1 c temperature mitigation scenario by including an economic application of phdcs this work demonstrates one method by which decision makers can monetarily interpret the environmental impact of power generation on aquatic ecosystems such work serves to inform decision makers and power plant operators seeking to balance electricity generation and aquatic ecosystem environmental impact in particular thermal limits administered by regulators could also be accompanied by economic impact assessments based on the realized and or potential loss to local fish populations 2 background 2 1 water temperature and fish as temperature is a major regulator of life cycles kennedy 2004 changes in water temperature can disrupt aquatic ecosystems coutant 1987 poole and berman 2001 temperature tolerance has long been a staple in understanding fish behavior beitinger et al 2000 fish behavior is linked to habitat selection with behavioral changes attributed to stress and or stimuli beitinger 1990 furthermore temperature is a resource within the water column magnuson et al 1979 thus fish might seek optimal temperature conditions as part of habitat selection within the context of optimal temperature conditions thermal pollution can be viewed as a stress to the system and the risk of exceeding thermal preferences are quantifiable logan and stillwell 2018a temperature is tied to other resources within aquatic habitats such that temperature changes affect dissolved oxygen content a study by abdi et al 2020 demonstrated the improvements in fish habitat associated with thermal river restoration and increased dissolved oxygen content such studies demonstrate there is a tradeoff in resource quality and fish populations such tradeoffs can be further analyzed within the context of thermoelectric power plant electricity production water quality e

planning and management applications 2 2 habitat time series analysis use of habitat metrics for time series analysis is commonly used in environmental design standard applications castellarin et al 2013 such as determining minimum flow requirements and instream flow water rights milhous et al 1990 time series analysis of biological data as outlined in milhous et al 1990 generates a weighted usable area wua as a function of physical habitat and streamflow also referred to as a habitat duration curve hdc in vogel and fennessey 1995 and relative suitability index in payne 2003 wuas are discrete values that relate the relative amount of usable habitat metric within a waterway bovee 1982 milhous 1984 previously presented the concept of habitat and streamflow functions as surrogates for the production function commonly used in economic analyses in environmental analyses the production function can be used as a valuation method and has been applied frequently in fisheries management studies armstrong et al 2016 wuas should be thought of as an index for comparison e g percentage of habitat loss and not a true reflection of direct habitat units e g fish per m 2 payne 2003 when generating hdcs the habitat and species metrics used can include a variety of data such as water velocity and pool depth and population size fecundity and biomass respectively selecting metrics as useful measures of performance for the species of interest is important for assessing biologic sustainability milhous et al 1990 in the conceptualization of hdcs the graphs of streamflow discharge versus time and relative habitat metric versus discharge are necessary typically the habitat metrics are averaged or weighted to generate a weighted usable habitat on a scale of 0 to 1 for use in the generation of an hdc and associated weighted usable area vogel and fennessey 1995 present a simplified development of an hdc which is a component of the instream flow incremental method commonly used by the u s fish and wildlife service the graph of an hdc can be used to demonstrate when water resources flow are limiting integrated to determine relative changes in habitat over time or as comparative analysis between flow scenarios milhous et al 1990 recent work by ceola et al 2018 expands the hdc literature demonstrating a habitat suitability duration curve with application in ecologically and hydrologically homogeneous catchments 3 methodology in the case of thermoelectric power generation thermal pollution and its impact on aquatic ecosystems can be viewed as an externality of the electricity generation process the tradeoff between electricity production and thus associated thermal pollution and aquatic ecosystem degradation via reduced fish populations can be quantified and used as a decision making tool within ecosystem services frameworks using fish populations and tdcs for the shawnee fossil plant phdcs were generated and an economic analysis was completed as a demonstration using benefits transfer methodology 3 1 power plant data and temperature duration curves the shawnee fossil plant sfp located near paducah kentucky on the ohio river is a baseload coal fired power plant using open loop cooling technology and has been the focus of previous work by logan and stillwell 2018a b in this work tdcs were generated for a 1000 m section of river and a temperature range of 16 to 50 c following the methods outlined in logan and stillwell 2018b u s energy information administration eia and united states geological survey usgs data concerning power plant cooling water flow discharge and temperature and river flow discharge respectively were used to generate tdcs fig 1 demonstrates the tdcs for the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river using 26 years of summer data of the maximum temperature differential between intake and effluent δ t and average discharge for each year plume conditions are the conditions found within the thermal plume and ambient conditions are the expected waterway conditions in the absence of thermal pollution for the 26 years of available at time of study feasible data the average δ t was 6 9 c see a 2 for more on power plant and river data cormix an epa approved mixing software with special emphasis on power plant mixing zone dynamics doneker and jirka 1991 2002 was used to generate plume and mixing dynamics see a 2 matlab was utilized for curve fit analysis and creation of tdcs as described in logan and stillwell 2018b probability distributions were analyzed based on cormix output of ambient and plume dimensions and temperature conditions following logan and stillwell 2018a using the probability distributions of temperature versus downstream distances e g probable plume size and δ t conditions an average across the river channel for the chosen downstream distance 1000 m is used to generate one probability of exceedance curve p t for 0 56 c intervals within the full temperature range of the ambient and plume data the trapezoidal rule was used to find the area under each exceedance curve and a singular tdc is created following eq 1 logan and stillwell 2018b 1 p t j 0 1000 p x d x 1000 where p x is the probability of exceedance curve 1000 is the total downstream distance m and j is the temperature range of interest t l o w e r to t u p p e r over the full temperature data range tdcs follow the form of flow duration curves fdcs which are commonly used in hydrologic analysis of waterways streamflow discharge data over a given time period are used to generate a waterway s fdc a cumulative frequency curve which demonstrates the percentage of time a discharge is expected to occur or be exceeded over that specified time period searcy 1959 in a similar fashion tdcs represent the cumulative frequency of temperature conditions over a given time period with a collection of yearly eia data being analogous to the summer season reading fig 1 a temperature of 32 c is expected to be equaled or exceeded under ambient conditions slightly over 20 of the time in the ohio river at the sfp location for the same 32 c temperature under plume conditions the exceedance jumps to roughly 60 of the time for a complete demonstration of the data and methods used to generate the tdcs refer to logan and stillwell 2018b 3 2 fish and temperature data biological data were cross referenced across epri studies through the ohio river ecological research program orerp to find suitable data availability at the location of the sfp the ohio river is a major river providing both aquatic species habitat stark 2013 and cooling water for thermoelectric power plants butz et al 1974 fish are an appropriate biological indicator species for river ecosystems as they spend their entire life cycles in the water and fish species tend to have wide population ranges making them easy to sample orsanco 2016 to demonstrate phdcs fish populations recorded as catch per effort cpe km by epri were used abundance population level is considered to be a larger indicator of the effect a species has on the local ecosystem than presence absence ehrlén and morris 2015 the freely available epri data consist of yearly studies as part of orerp with specific power plants featured in different years the sfp was included in seven years since 2005 at the time of study in each yearly study three upstream and three downstream sampling events occur in june august and october and include physical parameters such as water temperature water clarity and conductivity and fish species name and population reported as cpe for more information on epri data refer to a 3 for this work the water temperature and cpe data were retained for reference preston and white 1978 noted that the lower reaches of the ohio river contained the highest fish biomass per unit area compared to upper river reaches 3 3 population versus temperature plots to generate population versus temperature curves following the form of thermal performance curves tpcs 40 population values 6 values per year 3 upstream and 3 downstream per year less the november data points from 2009 recorded as cpe were plotted against the corresponding temperature condition on average the temperature differential between upstream and downstream temperature was 2 0 c warmer downstream and the cpe value differed by an average of 100 fish more fish upstream for this study the cpe value is interpreted to be a population value as the downstream distance of interest 1000 m in this study is equivalent to the cpe measurement per 1000 m a downward sloping line was best fit to the data following a linear regression p 0 02 r 2 0 13 as shown in fig 2 a rosner outlier test was performed on the 40 cpe versus temperature data points with results indicating that no outliers exist in the cpe dataset note that the two largest cpe values were recorded in the upstream portion of the river although temperature is not the only determinant of population even small temperature changes can have an impact on aquatic species as noted by kennedy 2004 thus a value of r 2 0 13 is interpreted as a correlation between temperature and fish but other factors also contribute to the presence or absence of individuals within the aquatic ecosystem which are inherently complex with multiple factors interacting to create a complete habitat in this analysis temperature is isolated as the variable of interest in predicting total fish population however temperature is not the only indicator of fish presence analysis of biological and physicochemical data collected in the epri studies see a 4 and a 5 suggest a non negligible correlation between population and flow but reinforces a greater correlation with temperature this conclusion is confirmed by studies such as lessard and hayes 2002 which found temperature to be the most important predictor of species richness within a michigan waterway affected by small dams thus in this study temperature is isolated as the variable of interest however exercise caution when using temperature alone as a predictor of population values another suggested metric for comparison is species specific populations for species with narrow or cold water temperature tolerances affected by thermal pollution other species could serve as opportunists and thrive at higher temperatures in the river phdcs could be used to demonstrate the effect of temperature on such opportunists as well as invasive species that can thrive in thermally altered waterways such as at thermoelectric power plant sites emde et al 2016 for a range of temperature conditions all species present in a system will have varied and partially or fully overlapped species specific tpcs like tpcs the shape in fig 2 demonstrates the relationship between a habitat variable temperature and response fish population to capture uncertainty in the analysis the standard error se from the linear regression of population versus temperature data points was used as were the resulting curves generated from the uncertainty bands of se to solve for additional phdcs fish populations can vary widely due to species interactions and environmental factors shelton and mangel 2011 thus uncertainty analysis was applied to reflect such factors to analyze population data eq 2 was followed 2 n j i 1 n n i j where n i j is the total number of individuals in population i at temperature j and n j is the sum of all populations at temperature condition j in this work only the total fish population is considered within the waterway thus i 1 but eq 2 is presented to allow for future analysis either at the species level where i represents individual species or across multiple populations mussels fish etc all population values are for the sfp location as reported in the epri data only within plume and ambient conditions are considered for a 1000 m river segment in this analysis three possible waterway temperature conditions j exist of which the thermally reduced plume conditions represent a scenario in which the power plant must mitigate the temperature output by 1 1 c a 1 1 c shift in δ t was chosen as 1 0 c is the point at which some species react to temperature shifts kennedy 2004 each condition is listed and described below ac ambient conditions j δ t 0 c pc empirical data plume conditions j δ t 6 9 c rc thermally reduced plume conditions j δ t 5 8 c thermally reduced conditions rc correspond to a reduction in δ t as outlined in section 3 6 while empirical data plume conditions pc correspond to the plume conditions expected using eia data 3 4 generation of population habitat duration curves to generate a phdc both a tpc and tdc are necessary the form of a tdc follows that of flow duration curves see logan and stillwell 2018b flow duration curves are typically presented as the complement to the cumulative distribution function cdf for streamflow vogel and fennessey 1994 also referred to in some literature as 1 cdf thus the form of a tdc fig 1 is the complement of the cdf for temperature in a waterway to solve for the probability of exceeding a given population value b or threshold as presented in the form of tpcs fig 2 eqs 3a and 3b were used 3a p n i j b p t n i 1 t t n i 2 3b p n i j b p t n i 1 e p t n i 2 e where n i j is total number of individuals in population i at temperature j with a desired population threshold b and t n i 1 is the temperature along the tpc at which the maximum population value occurs and t n i 2 is the temperature along the tpc at which the threshold population value n i j occurs solving eq 3a requires finding the probability of exceedance values associated with t n i 1 and t n i 2 on the tdc and subtracting the difference following eq 3b the above equations represent an expected temperature range on the tdc which correlates to a population threshold b that is exceeded over the expected temperature range note that since the tpc in this study is linear the population threshold b is compared to the maximum population at the lowest temperature which occurs at p e 100 see fig 3 if the tpc was parabolic as discussed in a 6 two occurrences of n i j would exist along the curve and would be used to solve for p n i b using a generated phdc the value p n i b which is an expected population value corresponds to an individual p e moving forward the population value associated with p n i j b will be referred to as λ in future equations a graphical representation of eqs 3a and 3b is presented in fig 3 these curves were used to generate the phdcs specific for this study refer to a 6 for additional figures demonstrating phdc generation using a parabolic tpc phdcs graphically demonstrate the probability of exceedance for population values such that at a given p e value the population is expected to be equivalent or greater than the corresponding population value since the temperature range of tpcs in this study is smaller than the total temperature range of the tdcs the phdcs reflect a probability of exceedance value above which the population is expected to be zero defining habitat related thresholds is consistent with past work on hdc conceptualizations e g capra et al 1995 when interpreting phdcs the area under a phdc corresponds to the total expected availability of temperature as a resource over the entire summer season also known as a weighted usable area wua as described in section 2 2 integration of phdcs is an existing method for quantifying the impact of different conditions bovee 1982 effectively curve integration produces a quantification of available resource or habitat metric for this study temperature as a resource for fish populations comparison of the change in area under the curve under different thermal regimes shows the relative loss or gain in temperature as a resource for the population of interest the wua is a comparative metric for the temperature conditions for fish population over the summer season in the given river reach following wua literature following water quality index duration curves vogel and fennessey 1995 the phdcs also demonstrate the probability of exceedance for a given population value the comparison of ambient conditions expected versus plume conditions thermally elevated via phdc integration provides relative comparison metrics specific to this location but the method applies broadly in any resource species scenario refer to section 3 3 and a 6 for more on tpcs 3 5 valuation of fish species and populations using benefits transfer methodology the monetary valuation of fish species from other studies is applied to this work refer to a 1 for more information one method to assess fish economically is using the replacement cost per individual replacement cost can represent the cost to replace an endemic individual with one grown at a hatchery predicated upon the idea that power plants can have a direct effect on fish mortality replacing fish from affected populations is a simple indicator of the possible environmental damages associated with thermal pollution southwick lotfus 2017 southwick and loftus 2003 present a thorough catalog of fish replacement cost by species family and u s region replacement costs are intuitive and simple to calculate however the replacement cost of a resource can seriously underestimate or overestimate the value that people gain from that resource brown 2017 other economic preference valuation methods estimate the true value people have for fish known as their willingness to pay wtp johnston et al 2006 completed a meta analysis of wtp values for a range of recreational fishes and found that the average wtp per fish was 22 57 converted to 2017 dollars to match with electricity price data in section 3 7 with a range of 0 06 to 822 36 for this study the average wtp as found in johnston et al 2006 was utilized with sensitivity analysis completed over a range of replacement cost and wtp values a comparison of replacement cost and wtp values for select species found in the ohio river is presented in table 1 the total population value follows eq 4a which can be down scaled to a species level for a more species specific assessment under a given temperature condition using eq 4b in this study a holistic population value is assessed via a sensitivity analysis on price per individual with the range in value per individual fish assessed at the minimum and maximum value as presented in table 1 4a f v i j λ r i k i 4b f v j i 1 n f v i j where f v i j is the monetary value of population i under condition j in λ is the total population i under condition j where λ is defined in section 3 4 as the population value associated with p n i j b and j is defined in section 3 3 r i is the value for population i per individual as defined in table 1 k i is the non use value for population i and n is the total number of populations of interest one in this analysis fish as discussed in section 5 2 i could represent specific species that sum to a total population value if a species specific assessment is of interest due to the difficulty in identifying site specific non use values of individual fish species the k i term is neglected in the calculations presented here but included in the equation for clarity and use in future applications see section 5 following eq 4b the summation of all f v i j values for a given phdc probability of exceedance value produces the community level monetary value of all populations mussels fish etc under condition j to generate a dollar value for a given population of fish the minimum and maximum value as found in table 1 were used to complete a sensitivity analysis the average wtp reported by johnston et al 2006 was used as the average value for the population found at the sfp in the absence of more species and community specific economic data in a broader context the use of a resource and the value of using that resource are important factors in valuing fisheries particularly in light of sustainable management practices blicharska and rönnbäck 2018 gentner and bur 2010 note that commercial and recreational per fish values can differ further complicating the desire to define fish by a single use value in this study both replacement cost and use value wtp were included but it is acknowledged that other valuations exist 3 6 power plant generation and discharge temperature assuming all other operational conditions remain the same power plant cooling water thermodynamics are governed by a mass and energy balance following eq 5 5 q h 2 o m c δ t where q h 2 o kj hr is the heat rate m kg hr is the discharge flow rate c kj kg c is the specific heat of water and δ t c is the temperature differential between intake and effluent the overall power plant thermal efficiency for a coal fired power plant is tied to the heat loss through cooling water and heat loss to air through the exhaust see urieli 2010 and martín 2012 for thorough power plant thermodynamics discussions using eq 5 and a constant power plant efficiency the tradeoff between cooling water flow rate and cooling water discharge temperature e g thermal pollution δ t was determined the tradeoff equation is simplified here but work by others such as cook et al 2015 and koch and vögele 2013 follow a similar thermodynamic balance the operational efficiency of the sfp was assumed to be 33 η 0 33 which is consistent with average eia reported efficiency via average operating heat rate for coal fired power plants energy information administration 2018a further examination of eia form 923 data for the sfp shows variability monthly post 2010 and annually prior to 2010 in terms of efficiency thus a static efficiency is used to represent average conditions note that for this analysis efficiency and operational conditions are held constant and assumed to be the average operating conditions for a summer season in reality efficiency water flow rates and generation fluctuate tidwell et al 2019 typically heat rates are used to solve for efficiency such that the total fuel input of coal q t o t a l is divided between electricity generation q g e n and losses to condenser cooling water q h 2 o and flue gas q a i r following eq 6 and fig 4 6 q t o t a l q g e n q h 2 o q a i r where q t o t a l q g e n q h 2 o and q a i r are in kj hr to validate the efficiency assumptions and solve for the relative percentage of heat load parsed between q a i r and q h 2 o data from martín 2012 and grubert et al 2012 were used energy heat losses via flue gas to the air q a i r while non negligible are roughly one sixth the heat loss via condenser cooling water q h 2 o see fig 1 in grubert et al 2012 comparing heat rate values for coal fired power plants a 10 heat rate loss via air and other small losses was assumed for the sfp comparing heat rate losses to water a loss of 57 is assumed for the sfp heat rate values in units of kj kwh are presented in table 2 while the kj kwh heat rates remain essentially constant during operation the electricity production in kwh can change the fixed generation water and air relationship is used to determine the loss in electricity generation from shifting δ t while holding discharge flow rate constant to solve for changes in δ t while holding the flow rate m constant eq 5 following martín 2012 was used generation was calculated for the summer season defined by the eia as april through september e g one half of a full year using eia reported data on discharge flow rate m kg hr and δ t as discussed in section 3 1 the expected summer losses of electricity generation when δ t is reduced rc was calculated as indicated by a shift in the tdc for the sfp to shift a tdc the shift is applied to post cormix data during curve fit analysis in matlab for more on the curve fit analysis refer to logan and stillwell 2018a the years of available data generated similar plume shapes and temperature decay with even spread among shapes and sizes to reduce computational complexity any changes to plume mixing mechanics as a result of reducing δ t at the power plant scale are assumed to be within the bounds of uncertainty presented in logan and stillwell 2018a as such shifting the tdc by incremental temperature values while still capturing a predicted shift in tdcs and resultant phdcs is possible without the need to replicate cormix prediction files to generate new plume mixing characteristics additionally 2d averaged downstream cross sections are utilized to produce a tdc for a 1000 m river section thus any greater accuracy provided by completing additional cormix runs would potentially be negated in the distance averaged creation of the tdcs average sfp data for 26 years were used to calculate q g e n and uncertainty is reported as a range using the sem on the 26 years of generation data with resulting q g e n values 3 7 valuation of power plant generation to determine the estimated net value of a power plant producing 1 mwh of electricity the wholesale price of electricity mwh less the marginal cost of that same mwh was used the economic loss expected when a power plant reduces their mwh output was found following eq 7 the expected summer losses in value from decreasing the δ t associated with thermal effluent when all other operational conditions were held constant was found 7 p v j g j w m where p v j is the monetary value of generation under conditions j in g j is the generation in mwh of under conditions j w is the wholesale price of electricity in mwh and m is the marginal cost of electricity in mwh price paid to the power plant per mwh less the cost to produce electricity per mwh provides a estimated per mwh value for electricity generation in order to find the per mwh value wholesale price fuel cost and operations and maintenance cost were assessed the wholesale summer april september 2017 price of electricity as reported by the intercontinental exchange for the hub closest to the sfp within the midwest region averaged 38 56 per mwh with a range of 27 00 to 81 75 per mwh weighted average values energy information administration 2018b the sem for weighted average values over the summer season was 1 44 and was used to generate upper and lower uncertainty bounds on the expected wholesale price of electricity using national renewable energy laboratory data for 2017 national renewable energy laboratory 2017 the range in fuel costs for coal fired power plants were 20 to 25 per mwh and the variable operations and maintenance costs were 5 to 9 per mwh these numbers bring the total range e g uncertainty in marginal cost fuel cost plus operations and maintenance cost for coal fired electricity generation to 25 to 34 per mwh average 29 50 per mwh though variation exists in regional pricing specific generator operations etc using 38 56 per mwh wholesale price and 29 50 per mwh marginal cost the sfp s value is estimated to be 9 06 per mwh under average conditions for a summer season using 2017 price data using the sem the range in value is 3 12 to 15 00 per mwh to calculate the expected loss in value from a decrease in δ t the lost generation in mwh was multiplied by the expected value price of 9 06 per mwh electricity prices are dependent on demand environmental factors and more but overall the expected pricing structure is likely to stay closer to the expected average as opposed to the extremes for a baseload coal fired power plant additionally electricity dispatch is optimized to help stabilize cost and price trends while maintaining efficient electricity supply to the grid federal energy regulatory comission 2015 4 results following eqs 3a and 3b using population versus temperature curves modeled after tpcs see fig 2 and tdcs see fig 1 phdcs were produced see fig 5 for fish located near the sfp on the ohio river three temperature conditions ac pc rc as defined in section 3 3 were analyzed 4 1 population habitat duration curves the area under the phdcs represents the relative availability of temperature within the waterway under ambient ac plume pc and thermally reduced rc conditions comparison of the phdcs under ac and pc demonstrates that the available thermal resource temperature or usable habitat area as defined by population is reduced such that approximately 31 of the thermal resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions as compared to ambient river conditions when the thermal pollution in the plume is reduced by 1 1 c by reducing δ t under rc approximately 22 of the thermal resource becomes unavailable as compared to ambient conditions in this analysis 4 2 comparison of population values under different thermal conditions a p e value of 50 was selected for method demonstration purposes but any p e of interest could be selected for regulatory frameworks refer to section 5 while under different sets of environmental conditions the population of fish could increase or decrease it is assumed that the phdcs presented in fig 5 are indicative of a typical summer season under ambient conditions the expected population is at least 175 individuals for 50 of the season where p e is a proxy for the time in a season under plume conditions δ t 6 9 c the expected populations at the same p e declines to 119 individuals decreasing the plume δ t by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions δ t 5 8 c the expected population is 134 individuals ranges were found when all uncertainty conditions were applied on the population data using se and tdcs using sem and are reported in table 3 4 3 economic valuation of fish via phdcs under ambient conditions the expected fish population has a higher number of individuals and correspondingly has a higher economic value using the average wtp of 22 57 the population has a value of 3 950 under ambient water conditions when thermal pollution from the power plant is assessed the population decreases and has a value of 2 686 if the sfp reduces thermal pollution by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions the fish population increases in value compared to expected thermal pollution conditions with a value of 3 024 a summary of values with uncertainty ranges is presented in table 3 the range in expected population monetary value applies all uncertainty conditions including the range in replacement cost and wtp as found in table 1 and uncertainty ranges associated with fig 5 4 4 economic valuation of power generation the expected electricity generation over the summer season for the sfp following the methods presented in section 3 6 averaged 3 76 mmwh under plume conditions when the δ t is reduced by 1 1 c under the scenario of thermally reduced conditions holding all other operational conditions constant including cooling water withdrawal discharge rate the expected generation was 3 16 mmwh this change reflects a 16 reduction in electricity generation under thermally constrained operating conditions solving for summer value via eq 7 the value of 34 054 000 is reduced to 28 604 000 when the δ t is reduced by 1 1 c this translates to a loss of 5 450 000 under thermally constrained conditions a comparison of generation and value with uncertainty bounds is found in table 3 5 discussion ambient river conditions ac and thermoelectric power plant plume conditions pc that cause thermal pollution are compared for a population of fish using population habitat duration curves phdcs for the plume conditions empirical data were analyzed for normal operating conditions δ t 6 9 c and the analysis was repeated under the scenario of thermally constrained conditions rc where the average δ t was reduced by 1 1 c δ t 5 8 c phdcs visually and mathematically demonstrate the availability of thermal resources water temperature in waterways using adapted thermal performance curves tpcs and temperature duration curves tdcs the shawnee fossil plant sfp on the ohio river was used as a demonstration site for the tdcs necessary for phdc creation in this analysis roughly 31 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions as compared to ambient conditions even when the thermal pollution from the sfp was reduced by 1 1 c under thermally reduced conditions 22 of the temperature resource is still unavailable as compared to ambient conditions visual comparison of the different phdcs highlights the shift in temperature both with respect to a decreased range in relation to the tpc and overall decrease in resource availability this resource reduction is due to the compression of temperature availability over the temperature range of the fish community under thermal pollution conditions as shown in the tdcs for plume and thermally reduced conditions as shown in fig 5 plume conditions drastically reduce the availability of optimal temperature conditions to make specific cross species comparisons of expected populations individual tpcs would need to be analyzed to plot the phdcs each population threshold on the tpc is associated with a temperature range on the associated tdcs expected population values for economic analysis use a p e value of 50 the p e value could be selected by biologists to provide a minimum viable population mvp particularly if timing of temperature extremes and other environmental disturbances are known vélez espino and koops 2012 found that the mean mvp for many freshwater fish species was 272 adults although the total population level drops to 0 at a p e of 100 due to the shape of the tpc is each scenario it is assumed that avoidance by the individual fish will be employed as a coping strategy during brief temperature extremes though temperature still has a large impact on the overall and long term fish community see section 2 additionally the epri data used for the meta analysis do not necessarily reflect total populations but are indicative of population and temperature trends see sections 3 2 and 3 3 and the appendix this analysis involves a baseload coal fired power plant on a large river but the method applies to other situations under different power plant conditions the reduction in thermal resources could become larger particularly if a power plant operates using a larger δ t value difference between intake and discharge cooling water temperature as the temperature differential is a large factor in the form of a tdc logan and stillwell 2018b the operational conditions of a power plant are expected to largely influence the produced phdc increasingly engineers are being asked to make waterway conservation and improvement recommendations for a variety of issues including fish passage and maintaining habitat vogel and fennessey 1995 tools like phdcs could be used in tandem with tdcs to conduct site and species specific investigations of the affects of thermal pollution in waterways as a way to model predict and monitor such population and diversity changes it is important to note that wuas while respected by many and used by the u s fish and wildlife service as a comparative metric for habitat availability gallagher 1999 do not present a direct correlation between fish biomass and habitat suitability mathur et al 1985 the discrepancy can be attributed in large part to the typical derivation of wuas from multiple habitat metrics simultaneously e g depth velocity temperature and flow where all metrics are given equal weight mathur et al 1985 in some cases all habitat metrics are given a relative 0 to 1 weighting see bovee bovee 1982 such that the tpcs presented in this work would present temperature as a variable against which a scale of 0 to 1 were plotted for suitability in this study the relationship between number of individuals population and temperature was isolated to avoid arbitrary weighting of habitat variables that would in nature not interact in equal weight as temperature is noted as a large factor in species response to habitat coutant 1987 kennedy 2004 poole and berman 2001 the use of wuas is justified in this study furthermore rüger et al 2005 note that habitat suitability studies are useful for ecological impact assessments and can aid in water management frameworks 5 1 expanded use of population habitat duration curves in planning and management applications particularly concerning species populations and diversity phdcs can serve as a useful ecological model to assess the relative availability of temperature as a resource not only can different conditions be compared among a population but cross species comparisons can also be assessed particularly when critical assessment of species specific tpcs is made with river warming likely under climate change scenarios fish species particularly those species with lower temperature preferences will likely be affected sinokrot and stefan 1992 temperature shifts and thus changes in habitat can cause shifts in population distributions chapman 2009 reductions in usable habitat space can have similar effects like changes in biodiversity and food web structures mchugh et al 2015 changes in population could lead to localized and regional disruptions in diversity and dominance patterns as shown by daufresne and boët 2007 because temperature has been shown to be one of the most important factors influencing fish behavior and abundance buisson et al 2008 using phdcs as a measure of thermal resources to indicate the likelihood of finding fish species is useful extending beyond examining communities or species specific populations phdcs could be used to assess different life stages of the same species in life stage assessments care should be taken in using the appropriate months and data to distinguish spawning fish juvenile fish and adult fish milhous 1986 such population monitoring could be compared against future conditions predicted as a result of climate change scenario analysis under given thermal conditions would provide insight into localized climate change planning efforts to take phdcs another step further phdcs using temperature as a resource could be coupled with phdcs using flow discharge to provide insight into projected impacts of droughts and climate change scenarios as mentioned previously pools when available under low to adequate flow conditions serve as thermal refuge for fish species in times of severe temperature conditions foster et al 2001 considering water flow to be a resource in the same manner as temperature phdcs could be used to compare both resources individually with the combined results indicative of overall habitat conditions bovee 1982 presents methods to combine stream metrics of interest with wuas to provide more holistic water quality assessments in a study of the northeastern united states stewart et al 2013 found that almost 30 of thermoelectric power plant generated heat ends up in rivers further demonstrating the need for adaptable tools to assess thermal pollution in riverine ecosystems while direct quantification of the risk of exceeding species thermal preferences is valuable logan and stillwell 2018a phdcs refocus decision making on temperature as a relative resource within waterways as described by milhous 1986 habitat time series analyses are principally used for water management decisions instead of addressing fish under varying flow regimes the temperature based phdcs could address varying temperature regimes particularly in regards to changing cooling water flow rates and temperatures variability in a tdc will produce variability in the resultant phdc and scenarios of power plant effluent could be compared against the relative loss or gain in thermal resources such as is demonstrated in this work increasing power plant cooling water flow rates can decrease the thermal impact on rivers from power plant effluent following thermodynamics as shown in eq 5 which could prove to be a useful tradeoff depending on future climate conditions in regards to water temperature miara et al 2017 and during times of drought mu et al 2020 however water scarcity concerns might reduce the amount of water available for cooling purposes ganguli et al 2017 stillwell and webber 2013 negating the potential temperature flow rate tradeoff nevertheless phdcs could provide a useful comparison of such tradeoffs in adapting to climate change concerning thermoelectric power plants in regulatory settings temperature as a resource could serve as a useful metric by which planning and management could be complemented regulations aimed at protecting aquatic species such as the cwa 316 a could use phdcs to provide comparable metrics for population levels for example populations of fish are known to be mobile and thermal avoidance of adverse temperature conditions can occur metrics for balancing thermoelectric power plant thermal pollution with desired populations of indigenous or endangered species could come in a form such as an expected population of 300 individuals for no less than 35 of a season for example such population levels could be used to determine mvps or correlate to the number of adults necessary for successful reproduction likewise the wua for phdcs could complement similar frameworks such that the desired wua analogous to the availability of temperature is reduced by no more than a certain percentage regulatory mixing zones rmz are commonly described as varied and plentiful in terms of how they are defined and measured incorporating tdcs and phdcs into the analysis of a protection and propagation of balanced and indigenous populations as is required by npdes thermal variance permits could be beneficial henley 1995 calls for strategic planning in the ohio river particularly in the monitoring of fish populations and phdcs could aid in such efforts 5 1 1 limitations of the current study with climate change both water temperature and flow are likely to be affected pyne and poff 2017 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 and with environmental change altered species distribution and abundance patterns are expected ehrlén and morris 2015 simultaneous consideration of the effects of temperature and flow on fish species has been the focus of prior work such as by wenger et al 2011 in this work flow is used as an input to cormix to generate tdcs and therefore the combined effects of flow and temperature cannot be fully uncoupled the comparative extension of phdcs beyond isolating temperature as the only resource over which fish compete is proposed in regards to temperature as an individual factor precise monthly or weekly calculations could be completed given appropriate data availability in the present form the translation of eia yearly summer data as a comparable dataset to a summer season is not ideal but is warranted given a lack of more precise data this translation also follows past work by logan and stillwell 2018a b in terms of fish population data it is important to note that the consideration of fish populations as static or instantaneous numbers during a season is not ideal as current population levels are dependent on both past and present habitat conditions orth 1987 future use of phdcs could include more targeted timing analysis of temperature intensity and duration of localized thresholds throughout a season following the general framework outlined by capra et al 1995 large seasonal abundances of fish within river reaches can be indicative of episodic events lohner and dixon 2013 thus using data collected over several years without young of year populations provides a more stable indicator of expected community population conditions see a 4 5 2 application of population habitat duration curves in economic tradeoff analysis using phdcs as a method by which to complete economic analysis is a suggested application of the tool presented in this study particularly for ecosystem services analyses as such a tradeoff analysis of the value of electricity generation and the value of fish populations was completed by calculating expected loss and gain in dollars the tradeoff analysis has been framed in equivalent terms oftentimes ecosystem services are used as the accounting unit in environmental economics and policy but ecosystem services can be difficult to adequately value boyd and banzhaf 2007 this analysis shows the replacement cost for fish using a range of species specifically four species which were found at the study site and for which replacement cost data were available within a complex river ecosystem which may undervalue the holistic ecosystem services of the ohio river at the shawnee fossil plant other fish species are present in the system as well as non fish aquatic species which could result in a different monetary valuation in terms of using replacement cost a study by strange et al 2004 compared the restocking value via replacement cost using hatcheries data of fish lost due to entrainment and impingement with that of equivalent habitat restoration for the same size of fish population loss termed the habitat based replacement cost method strange et al 2004 assert that simply restocking lost fish every year is not ecologically equivalent to maintaining natural populations e g restocking versus allowing natural reproduction of the natural population strange et al 2004 found that the cost to replace a community of fish was on the order of 200 000 dollars but to conserve and replace the necessary habitat space to prevent the loss of fish cost on the order of 25 000 000 additionally natural fish populations include unique diversity and richness relationships at the community level that might not otherwise be available from hatcheries fish e g not all wild species are grown in hatcheries strange et al 2004 news reports discuss the failings of hatchery raised fish to provide equivalently adapted fish as replacements in natural ecosystems goldfarb 2014 as for reported monetary damages to fish populations as a result of thermal pollution or other pollution e g chemical events news articles also vary widely for example one news report valued a fish kill in iowa at 8 000 for 53 500 fish associated press 2016 while another article for iowa valued 58 000 fish at just over 10 000 000 sutterman 2012 thus a large range in value exists for fish kills of the same size within the same state the infamous 2009 black river fish kill in which an estimated 218 000 fish died as a result of manure pollution resulted in a 75 000 fine to the farm deemed responsible for the incident gross 2017 variation in estimated damages in news reports comes from the type of fish killed and the methods data used for valuation e g replacement cost versus habitat based replacement cost versus wtp the direct dollars to dollars comparison of electricity generation and fish populations can aid in future ecosystem services studies and particularly in fish kill assessments for example the natural resources defense council has placed an annual damage pricetag of 30 million on fish kills at the bay shore power plant located on lake erie lyndersen 2011 the economic valuation completed by gentner consulting group utilized fisheries data and benefits transfer methodology to monetarily assess the damages from impingement and entrainment at the bay shore facility gentner and bur 2010 as such there is precedent for this current economic valuation study and the economic comparison of power plants and the associated damages to fisheries this work adds to the literature by developing a tool specifically phdcs via thermal performance curves and temperature duration curves to assess expected population changes as a result of changing thermal pollution the phdc method is demonstrated for a fish population at the sfp location in the ohio river to accurately scale the economic damages by species from thermal pollution a full understanding of all the species present and their respective population estimates and monetary value would be necessary species specific population information is available in the orerp studies conducted by epri but this work focuses on the total fish community to demonstrate the phdc method for reference an impingement study at power plants along the ohio river indicated that millions of individuals are impinged on intake structures annually electric power research institute 2009b such large numbers indicate that many fishes are affected by power plants every year and population scaling might be necessary when using the epri data set for the fish population at the sfp the loss in value from reduced electricity generation p v p c p v r c was compared to the gain in population i value f v i r c f v i p c when the sfp thermal pollution was reduced by 1 1 c using the average values from table 3 the reduction in thermal pollution assuming all other operational conditions remain the same translates to a 5 450 000 loss in value for the sfp for the summer season this same reduction in thermal pollution translates to a meager 338 gain in the value of the fish population strictly by the numbers the monetary loss in electricity generation is several orders of magnitude higher than the monetary gain in fish populations keeping in mind that the average wtp was used in this work a cursory extrapolation in which species of special interest exist at the sfp with a maximum wtp value of 822 36 as reported in johnston et al 2006 the loss becomes 12 335 this extrapolated value does not take into account the variation in fish value across species nor is it based on the habitat based replacement cost value as discussed in strange et al 2004 when put into context of the entire ohio river aquatic community e g more than just fishes the change in economic value of the aquatic community might approach that of electricity generation what is presented in this study is a way to value populations monetarily using a meta analysis of fish population dependent on temperature conditions as expressed in tpcs future calculations could include any known habitat based replacement cost method values following the suggestions of strange et al 2004 by assessing the tradeoff at the population level e g isolating temperature and population monetary assessment of ecosystems in which keystone endangered and or commercially important species are present could be completed tools that support management and conservation efforts are important now more than ever as conservation needs grow while resources decline zohmann et al 2013 furthermore understanding the costs and benefits before species are lost will allow for better management of ecosystems meador and frey 2018 using phdcs both direct and indirect damage to aquatic communities could be quantified given adequate data to give a more complete picture for proactive species conservation efforts schirpke et al 2018 studied the environmental and socio economic effects of payments for ecosystem services and such a tool could be combined with phdcs as a method to fund conservation efforts by providing tools for the proactive quantification of ecosystem goods and services e g fish conservation efforts might not need to rely as heavily on reactive assessments of damages already done thus providing better success in maintaining and improving waterways in the study by gentner and bur 2010 the authors analyzed not only the predator fish species of interest but also quantified the loss in prey species that would otherwise be available to support walleye a fish critical to lake erie recreational fisheries similar to the approach presented here gentner and bur 2010 do not include non use values of fish inclusion of such data in this study could increase the total economic value of fish further enhancing the economic tradeoff analysis additionally the methods presented in this study are for a 1000 m downstream section of river assuming plume or ambient conditions as discussed in logan and stillwell 2018a even small scale changes within a waterway can affect the remainder of the waterbody if the thermal plume associated with the sfp causes fish to leave the system within the entire river channel with the effects extending beyond the 1000 m downstream distance then the economic loss to the system from thermal pollution would be greater than expressed in section 4 3 in locations where fish populations are larger or more valuable e g lake erie yellow perch and or power plant produced thermal pollution is greater the monetary damages might approach the same order of magnitude as power generation revenue loss the tradeoff between power generation with potentially several orders of magnitude greater revenue as compared to equivalent fish population loss highlights why regulations such as the cwa 316 a are necessary if left to market devices alone power plants would have little to no incentive to monitor or reduce thermal pollution in waterways regulations that protect aquatic life are typically enacted with a holistic ecosystem view in mind as opposed to discrete monetization of individual species or communities in fields such as ecosystem services refer to a 1 the value of an ecosystem as a whole is greater than the sum of the parts furthermore regulations have been shown to boost the economy a study of 10 years of federal regulations showed that the net benefits of environmental regulation outweighed the implementation costs and associated fines to industry spross 2013 additionally regulations can serve as the drivers of efficiency and innovation johnstone et al 2017 such that more environmentally friendly technologies are created to meet avoid regulations proactive assessment of ecosystem goods and services will be possible potentially reducing the retroactive costs of environmental conservation and mitigation efforts this valuation provides a tool for analysis and direct comparisons between operational conditions temperature of intake versus effluent can be weighed against holistic ecosystem valuation adding to tdcs as a tool for rmz definition logan and stillwell 2018b phdcs provide another method by which decision makers can assess current conditions at a power plant and compare those conditions to predicted or scenario based future conditions integration of phdcs into regulatory decision making is a worthy discussion point for future ecosystem valuation studies 5 2 1 emission taxes as a policy tool for optimal tradeoff between electricity generation and fish populations convincing power plants or the large scale companies that own them to pay for damages caused to local aquatic ecosystems from thermal pollution would be challenging even with an associated ecosystem services component climate change predictions and environmental sustainability what incentives do power plants have to reduce pollution likewise people have less incentive to reduce environmental damages in the present as the social cost will be incurred by future generations hanley et al 2007 to provide such incentives a market approach with an appropriate monetization scheme might be necessary though regulatory standards were favored prior to the 1970s a shift in thinking towards market based approaches has since occurred li and shi 2017 in a market approach economic variables become the incentive to reduce pollution callan and thomas 2010 as such value is assigned to an environmental aspect in this work fish populations are used as a proxy for aquatic ecosystem sustainability and thus a price is assigned to environmental pollution though four types of market based instruments exist a common one is the pollution charge which falls under the polluter pays principle in economic theory callan and thomas 2010 a special type of pollution charge is the product charge which is essentially a unit charge on a good e g electricity from which the production generates an externality e g loss to fish populations from thermal pollution an alternative to a product charge is an emission charge an emission charge is a price per unit of pollution e g temperature increase from thermal pollution that leads polluters to internalize the externalities of production so they are economically incentivized to lower pollution emissions hanley et al 2007 from an economic standpoint if a power plant is charged a certain tax per increase in temperature above ambient δ t then the power plant can choose to pay those taxes or invest in pollution abatement strategies e g a cooling tower and thus the power plant will choose a welfare maximizing investment in cooling technology transaction costs would include considerations like increased need for regulatory reporting and additional workforce and or equipment to monitor δ t in a more complete fashion than is currently reported using a tax there is the potential for power plants to pass through additional costs to consumers by increasing electricity prices that provides consumers with appropriate incentives to reduce the electricity use that leads to environmentally damaging power production an emission tax could be applied at the power plant level using tools such as temperature duration curves logan and stillwell 2018b or population habitat duration curves for economic tradeoff analysis a power plant could be assessed for current ambient tdc and above ambient tdc conditions and a certain desired percentage change above ambient tdc conditions could be taxed as an incentive to reduce thermal pollution alternatively the value of local aquatic populations could be assessed via the methods outlined in this work and a direct tax that matches the loss in value of local fish populations could be assessed this tax approach assumes a system with perfect information additionally productivity e g electricity generation even within the united states is widely dispersed between a range of power plants with unique operating and localized conditions when dealing with productivity dispersion the response to environmental taxes might differ greatly li and shi 2017 a tax while effective at internalizing the environmental damages of pollution to the company level instead of the damages being externalities does increase the marginal cost of production in an effort to induce abatement li and shi 2017 thus market forces will interact such that the marginal cost of electricity will become a driver of how much electricity is produced and by which producers e g thermal polluters vs non thermal polluters the shift in production caused by a thermal pollution tax might be similar to how other forces such as fuel costs and air pollution externalities affect the levelized cost of electricity especially from a policy perspective rhodes et al 2017 6 conclusion using a meta analysis of fish population and temperature data the creation and application of population habitat duration curves phdcs using the shawnee fossil plant on the ohio river as a study site was demonstrated in particular comparison between ambient river conditions and two thermal effluent plume conditions empirical conditions from data where δ t 6 9 c and a scenario of thermally reduced conditions where δ t 5 8 c highlighted the availability of temperature as a resource the results show that for the fish population 31 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable under plume conditions for thermally reduced conditions representing a lower δ t 22 of the temperature resource becomes unavailable phdcs demonstrate the effect thermal pollution can have on aquatic populations in planning and management settings phdcs can be incorporated into habitat and population monitoring where temperature is a resource of concern e g as a quality metric or resource quantity metric comparison of populations in climate change scenario analysis could serve to inform decisions made now which will impact waterways in the future phdcs can aid in regulatory mixing zone analysis by serving as a quantifiable metric to set site specific expected population and or temperature guidelines as a specific application of phdcs a dollar value was applied to the increase in expected fish populations over the summer season when shifting from plume conditions to thermally reduced conditions as compared to the value of power plant electricity generation decreasing thermal pollution by 1 1 c increased the summer value of the fish population by 338 with the same shift in thermal pollution all other power plant operational conditions remaining constant economically the expected loss in electricity generation was valued at 5 450 000 scaling the method to a full aquatic community and incorporating non use value and habitat based replacement cost values for fish could prove to place the economic value of electricity generation and aquatic ecosystem populations closer in comparison additionally phdcs could serve useful in scenario analyses of the tradeoffs in power plant discharge flow rates and thermal pollution δ t particularly under climate change scenarios furthermore phdcs provide a proactive method to value fish as opposed to reactive valuations e g after fish kill events after which conservation efforts might be less effective credit authorship contribution statement

appendix a1 ecosystem services and benefits transfer methodology krugman and wells 2005 state that the most serious external costs to modern lifestyle are those associated with environmental damages e g loss of ecosystem functions and or resources many studies focus on ecosystem services as a metric by which society can monetarily value an ecosystem and its resource flows boyd and banzhaf 2007 recent work by hanes et al 2018 incorporates ecosystem services into the food energy water nexus demonstrating the need for such tradeoff analyses in the nexus space inherently ecosystem valuation involves tradeoffs between society and nature often with sustainability as a component of human welfare farber et al 2002 furthermore the tradeoffs between ecosystem services and economic services cause much of the debate surrounding valuation of the ecosystem bolgrien et al 2005 decision making concerning water resources in particular has often relied upon the inclusion of cost benefit analysis but with increasingly visible and pressing externalities such analyses are becoming inherently more complex freeman iii et al 2014 natural resources and environmental attributes provide flows of services to people such as a commercial fishery in a resource rich water body freeman iii et al 2014 here it is noted that in the context of fish in a river an ecosystem service is the fishability of the river and fish would be considered an ecosystem good bergstrom and loomis 2017 furthermore fish population trends especially as evidenced by long term monitoring programs can improve fishery management plans lohner and dixon 2013 tying fish species directly back to biodiversity and ecosystem services via valuation methods bergstrom and loomis 2017 found that 25 of river restoration valuations are focused on fish further emphasizing the economic importance of fish in ecosystem valuation discussions benefits transfer methodology common for u s riverine ecosystems bergstrom and loomis 2017 is a useful method by which to quantify the value of fish in a river system it is important to note that the total value of fish in a river includes use value and non use value the use value includes the on site recreational benefit of fishing consumption and direct economic gains e g commercial fishing whereas the non use value includes aspects like the benefit of knowing the fish exist in the river bergstrom and loomis 2017 benefits transfer methodology has been commonly used within environmental regulation and policy since the 1980s but current practices emphasize the need for value adjustments between studies freeman iii et al 2014 several methods exist for assigning monetary values to fishes and fish populations replacement cost is found as the cost of providing an ecosystem service using an artificial substitute for an element of nature that provides a naturally occurring ecosystem service sundberg 2004 for fish replacement cost is equal to the fishery hatchery costs of adding an individual fish to a stream such as in southwick lotfus 2017 applying nonmarket values obtained from one study to another study e g willingness to pay for recreational fishing at one lake to a study on another lake is also common freeman iii et al 2014 recreational use studies e g creel surveys can provide insight into management strategies for fisheries schell et al 1996 while providing fish population and popularity information fish kill assessments such as the procedures outlined in southwick and loftus 2003 can be used to economically quantify existing fish populations other methods for valuing recreational fishing include the travel cost method and contingent valuation cameron 1992 the overall concept of benefits transfer is highlighted here to provide additional background for the use of fish kill assessments and replacement cost in this study the true social value of an incremental amount of a natural resource is defined as marginal wtp in the case of fish that is the maximum amount of money people would be willing to pay to increase the population of the fish by one unit marginal wtp can be estimated with stated preference valuation methods that use hypothetical survey questions or revealed preference valuation methods that use data on actual human decisions such as where and how much to go fishing the estimate in johnston et al 2006 use revealed preference methods to estimate use value marginal wtp for having one more fish a2 power plant and river data data for the shawnee fossil plant sfp were collected from the energy information administration eia forms 767 and 923 such data included the intake temperature and effluent temperature reported 1985 2009 or interpreted 2010 2014 as a seasonal summer maximum cooling water discharge flow rates were also utilized reported as yearly averages in forms 767 and 923 in total 26 years of data were available and feasible as reported by the eia 1985 2014 with the year 2014 being the most recent year available in entirety at the time of this study river data were collected from the united states geological survey stream gage gage no 03611500 located at metropolis il within two miles upstream of the sfp average seasonal summer discharge paired to match the years of feasible data for the sfp was used in this study simplifying assumptions to complete cormix runs were made for the river including a manning s n of 0 025 average wind speed of 2 m s and a rectangular river cross section with variable depth and fixed width 1220 m as is consistent with logan and stillwell 2018a river channel geometry followed continuity using the fixed width discharge and rating curve usgs stream gage data and velocity data from the ohio river valley water sanitation commission orsanco to determine the plume geometry and mixing dynamics for each year of data cormix software was utilized cormix is considered to be an empirical model as data input is grouped and used to identify relationships among variables davis 1999 using empirical data input cormix completes length scale analysis to classify flow and determine the correct hydrodynamic equations for plume trajectory in general length scale models assess the comparative importance of variables of force in length terms and based on those comparative relationships classify flow davis 1999 cormix assumes steady state conditions unless otherwise specified by the user for mixing behavior as well as turbulent mixing conditions e g sufficiently large reynolds number doneker and jirka 2007 a3 population data fish population and water temperature data at the shawnee fossil plant from the electric power research institute s epri ohio river ecological research program orerp were used orerp produces yearly studies at power plant locations with particular interest in thermal pollution and fish populations years in which the sfp was studied include 2005 2006 2007 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 electric power research institute 2007 2008 2009a 2012 2014 2016 2017 within each yearly orerp study three upstream and downstream sampling events were completed typically in june august and october though in 2009 the sampling months were june august and november for certain data at the sfp electric power research institute 2012 using data from june to october is consistent with past work on the ohio river by thomas et al 2004 to avoid complication from inclusion of two cold water data points in the analysis the data from november for 2009 were removed for the meta analysis completed in this work additionally only electrofishing data were used which were collected in 500 m sections for consistency in data analysis only the catch events that were conducted using boat electrofishing were analyzed population data in the epri reports are presented in a variety of ways with catch per effort cpe km presented for upstream and downstream sampling in the results section values for plume and ambient conditions were reported as cpe values were reported as number of individuals per km the tdcs presented in this work are for a 1000 m 1 km downstream distance a4 additional population information from literature the shawnee fossil plant is located in ohio river navigational pool 53 illinois department of natural resources 2017 informing additional fish population information a report by henley 1995 using 1978 1987 data noted that pool 53 had one of the largest fish biomass estimates due to suitable flood plain and channel topography mean creel survey values per pool in the ohio river reported by henley 1995 varied in range depending on the species fish per acre values are also reported by henley 1995 and specific to pool 53 the most common species is gizzard shad at over 14 000 fish acre and bluegill and drum are also abundant at 170 and 207 fish acre respectively in the epri meta analysis gizzard shad threadfin shad and emerald shiner were removed from total population counts as the young of year yoy for those species appear as relative population boons unrelated to the overall community composition and makeup of the remaining fish community epri provides such normal community level population counts as cpe and the orerp analyses include data with and without gizzard shad threadfin shad and emerald shiner in henley 1995 species of interest like largemouth bass and black crappie have expected populations of 22 and 63 fish acre which is much smaller than the expected value for gizzard shad as such the removal of the three yoy populations is justifiable when concerned with stable economically viable populations of fishes of interest converting the study site area of 1000 m downstream distance length of river with a river width of 1 220 m width of river gives a total study area of approximately 1 220 000 m 2 a study of fish abundance on the ohio river using hydroacoustic estimates by hartman et al 2000 found that total fish populations ranged from 11 543 to 14 962 fish per 6 130 5 m 2 lock chamber scaling these values to the total study site 1 220 000 m 2 the population range is 2 297 000 to 2 977 000 total fish a preston and white 1978 study reports 181 000 total fish for the lower reach of the ohio river using the smithland no 50 and no 52 locks providing further insight into expected population ranges for fish note that the numbers reported in hartman et al 2000 were for lock chambers on the upper ohio river not at pool 53 overall literature values for expected fish populations vary widely presumably due to sampling methods timing and other factors the literature values reported above are merely presented as additional information with the potential for incorporation into future population assessments and or as scaling factors a5 temperature and other biological physicochemical data in addition to temperature readings upstream and downstream of power plant outfalls data collected for orerp studies included habitat characteristics e g percent boulder cobble gravel and sand specific conductance μ s cm mean monthly flow cfs water clarity mm and dissolved oxygen ppm in each year correlation analysis was completed between cpe as well as biomass and temperature habitat characteristics and river flow individually some years show positive neutral or negative correlation between fish population and temperature in completing the meta analysis the linear regression of population as a function of temperature was significant p 0 02 thus interannual data might be capturing large scale trends over time whereas intrannual sampling might be more dependent on specific seasonal influences within the habitat the significance of intrannual upstream versus downstream differences in dissolved oxygen flow water clarity and specific conductance also varied year to year in the orerp reports at the sfp completing a linear regression on dissolved oxygen flow clarity and specific conductance versus population for all years of available data less the november data points from 2009 following the same approach as for temperature versus population the relationship between flow and population was found to be significant p 0 03 r 2 0 11 water clarity did fit a second order polynomial inverted parabola trend r 2 0 11 but the trend was not significant p 0 12 thus flow and temperature were considered to be the most important factors affecting fish population at the sfp within the interannual meta analysis conducted for the purposes of demonstrating the effect of temperature on population temperature was isolated as the variable of interest for use in the creation of phdcs from tpcs and tdcs a study by lessard and hayes 2002 found temperature to be the most important predictor of fish species richness within michigan waterways affected by small dams henley 1995 noted that for some species with lower thermal tolerances e g striped bass temperature appeared to impact the number of older individuals in sampling events during summer collection rijnsdorp et al 2009 also discuss the effects of temperature on fish populations but note that at the community level changes in population as a result of temperature changes could be indicative of trophic interactions among species within the community a6 thermal performance curves the inclusion of fig a 6 is for reference for differently shaped tpcs such as an arbitrary parabolic tpc in literature tpcs can take many shapes with a curve resembling an inverted parabola with gentle upward trend toward the optimal temperature and rapid decline past the optimal temperature being commonly reported schulte et al 2011 in the main text the tpc was linear in shape it is possible that by including only the months of june august and october in the meta analysis of population versus temperature that the linear tpc is actually the trailing end of a larger inverted parabola shaped tpc however such conjecture is not warranted given the unavailability of winter time population and temperature data for the study location particularly given that summer e g warm water temperatures is the season of interest the tpc generated in this work is not necessarily indicative of mortality rates due to temperature but rather relates the likelihood of finding fish the meta analysis of epri data reveals small population values for the location of interest and could be an artifact of sampling methods or conditions note that in reality many species coexist at the location of interest with varied and overlapping species specific tpcs and potentially larger population values than were captured in epri data collection could be present additionally care should be taken when using tpcs particularly in climate change studies as suggested in section 5 1 with regard to the time scale of interest as well as the shape of the tpcs schulte et al 2011 the meta analysis in this work is intended to inform the generation of tpcs but the focus is on the method development and usefulness of phdcs in economic analyses supplementary material supplementary material associated with this article can be found
