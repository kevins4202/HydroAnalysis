6005,flood hazard in urban areas is usually assessed by the estimations of parameters like flood extent water depths flow velocities and other related quantities these hydrodynamic variables can be computed using flood inundation numerical models the complexity of which has been analyzed in several papers in the literature however the question of how detailed a model should be in order to give reasonable results is still an open issue and no shared and general conclusions have been reached so far one of the main reasons for this is that model benchmarking is very often carried out with reference to the flooded areas extent only sometimes analyzing also the simulated water depths values and quite rarely evaluating the computed velocities this is in contrast with the main purpose of the simulation models which are from a practical point of view advanced tools for flood hazard and vulnerability assessments finally the lack of sufficient data on inundation extent and depths for the calibration and validation of the numerical models has been recognized especially in complex situations that often characterize the flood evolution in a given area due to bridge obstructions interaction with buildings and so on in this paper the performances of three different approaches to two dimensional flood modeling fully dynamic diffusive and porosity approaches have been evaluated with reference not only to the hydrodynamic variables water depths and velocities but also focusing the attention on their product and thus to the consequences associated to their different estimations on the vulnerability assessment this analysis has been focused first on a flash flood flow experiment in a simplified urban district and then to the event which occurred in the city of crotone calabria italy in 1996 the results highlight that fully dynamic modeling should be the unavoidable reference tool when the goal of the urban flood mapping activity is not limited to the evaluation of the flood prone areas extent but involves also the local estimation of flood hazard vulnerability keywords flood hazard 2 d inundation models urban areas model benchmarking vulnerability assessment 1 introduction it is generally recognized that flood management mitigation strategies and planning around the world are based on the estimation of the flood risk in terms of its location magnitude and distribution xiao et al 2017 in particular the aim of the risk based approach is to reduce the overall flood risk which can be defined as a combination of hazard vulnerability and exposure kron 2002 hazard represents the probability of a hazardous event happening in a place vulnerability is a function of the potential damage to a target due to the occurrence of the hazardous event finally exposure quantifies the presence of the target focusing the attention on direct losses only the targets can be either economic values or human lives i e thieken et al 2005 therefore one key activity that governments through dedicated institutions must carry out in order to reduce the flood effects is the prediction of flood magnitude and intensities of the various processes involved by analyzing flood scenarios including past floods and the flood hazard mapping that aims at spatially visualizing a potential endangered area following a given flood scenario macchione et al 2019a sy et al 2019 parameters generally used to denote the flood hazard include the flood extent water depth flow velocity duration propagation of water front and the rate at which the water rises de moel et al 2009 these parameters can then be linked to estimates of economic damage and loss in the affected area indeed a suitable combination of flow depth and velocity through properly devised vulnerability curves represents the potential effects of the flow on a target such as the assessment of direct potential damage to structures and buildings jakob et al 2012 mazzorana et al 2014 bermúdez and zischg 2018 milanesi et al 2018 people e g russo et al 2013 xia et al 2014 milanesi et al 2015 2016 arrighi et al 2017 and vehicles xia et al 2014 arrighi et al 2015 martínez gomariz et al 2016 a lot of technical guidelines have been proposed as well see for example aidr 2017 moreover accurate estimations of the hydrodynamic variables represent the basis used to take into account the additional element of risk related to levee breaches dazzi et al 2019 or due to the interaction of wood eventually entering the stream pulled out by landslides bank erosion and debris flow and the existing man made structures in urbanized areas such as bridge piers persi et al 2018 2019 the hydrodynamic variables mentioned above can be computed using flood inundation numerical models which are a well established approach for conducting flood risk analysis most hydrodynamic modeling approaches are implemented by employing 1 d 2 d or 1 d 2 d schematizations although one dimensional hydrodynamic models are still in widespread use for many applications e g tayefi et al 2007 cook and merwade 2009 costabile and macchione 2012 costabile et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2016 dimitriadis et al 2016 liu et al 2019 fleischmann et al 2019 the use of two dimensional models is required in built up areas to reproduce the complex multidirectional flow paths generated by urban features mignot et al 2006 apel et al 2009 yu and lane 2011 pina et al 2016 indeed flood propagation in urban areas is clearly two dimensional with peculiar features that depend on the complex interaction between the flow and the streets buildings patterns inducing multiple flow paths at crossroads and flow around or within buildings etc therefore when there are more complex river geometries and inundation flow patterns are relevant for the precise mapping of local parameters the use of a 2 d model becomes unavoidable ernst et al 2010 especially to develop emergency activities based on logistic operations and road accessibility bodoque et al 2016 yin et al 2016 arrighi et al 2019 thanks to modeling advances and the increase in computational resources and data availability in recent years it is now feasible to perform 2 d urban flood simulations at very high resolutions ozdemir et al 2013 lacasta et al 2014 liang and smith 2015 de almeida et al 2018 dazzi et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 opening up the possibility of detailed urban flood assessment leitão and de sousa 2018 moreover the use of flexible meshes is emerging which allows a fine spatial resolution in more relevant areas without an unnecessary increase of the computational costs in areas in which limited dynamics and changes are expected caviedes voullième et al 2012 hu et al 2018 bomers et al 2019b savant et al 2019 in risk analyses in urban areas two dimensional models are usually based on the shallow water equations i e mignot et al 2006 bazin et al 2014 costabile and macchione 2015 cea and bladé 2015 but the demand for computationally efficient methodologies has led to the development of simplified formulations that provide accurate solutions within the range of their applicability at a considerably high performance although the literature shows applications of several low complexity or lower fidelity flow inundation models see for example afshari et al 2018 bomers et al 2019a the two most popular examples are the so called zero inertial or diffusive wave approximation among the most recent ones see for example aricò et al 2011 dottori and todini 2013 leandro et al 2014 costabile et al 2017 caviedes voullième et al 2018 cimorelli et al 2018 savant et al 2019 and local inertial approximation e g aronica and lanza 2005 bates et al 2010 de almeida et al 2012 martins et al 2015 2017 another widely used family of models for flood analysis in urban areas is based on the shallow water equations with porosity different porosity models have been proposed in literature ranging from the so called single porosity e g soares frazão et al 2008 cea and vázquez cendón 2010 ferrari et al 2017 to the isotropic multiple porosity guinot 2012 integral porosity sanders et al 2008 özgen et al 2016a b ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 and the dual integral porosity model guinot et al 2017 the plethora of models developed for flood inundation mapping has fueled the need for comparative studies related to the performances of the models themselves assessed through benchmark tests and real world flood events in this context one of the earliest studies devoted to the benchmarking of 2 d models has been presented by hunter et al 2008 who have applied six models to a flood event in a small area in the city of glasgow the simulations have shown that urban floods are characterized by numerous shocks and transitions to supercritical flow even though these effects have been quite localized and have not influenced the overall flood dynamics moreover their results have shown limited differences in terms of simulated maximum water depths apel et al 2009 performed a comparative risk analysis study applying three different types of hydraulic and flood loss models to an event which occurred at the river mulde germany based on the performance of different model combinations the authors concluded that for that case study the 1d 2d hydraulic model in combination with the meso scale flood loss model is the best compromise for a thorough flood risk analysis in the area fewtrell et al 2011 presented a comparative study related to the application of the diffusive and local inertial approaches implemented within the lisflood fp model to a flood event in alcester uk for which high resolution terrestrial lidar data were available the authors observed similar estimates of flood elevations throughout the simulation with differences less than the errors associated with the terrestrial lidar data moreover the authors underlined the inconsistency of the simulated velocities and therefore the risk estimates although the 1 and 2 m resolution models appear to provide robust estimates of water elevations neal et al 2012 have explicitly faced the issue related to the physical complexity needed to model flood inundation the authors claimed that for gradually varying flow the fully dynamic models may be unnecessarily complex and simplified models provide good performances in terms of both water depths and velocities however they mentioned that there may be an overestimation of flood hazard when the water depths and velocities are computed separately néelz and pender 2013 presented a benchmarking of 2d software known to be applied in the uk the authors observed that the packages based on the fully dynamic equations are more suitable for risk analysis but they take long runtimes for application in large areas moreover they underlined that the simulated maximum water depths could be considered comparable while the velocity values tend to be different significant discrepancies between the fully dynamic and simplified models have been observed in terms of both water depth and flow velocities when simulating complex flow fields finally in urban flooding simulations significant differences have been observed for flow velocity especially using grid resolution greater than 2 m kvočka et al 2015 analyzed the effects of the simplified models on flood risk assessment concluding that they lead to incorrect flood level predictions in the flood simulation analysis of the flash flood events which occurred in boscastle uk in particular they claim that the simplified models can be applied only in areas characterized by mild slope and smooth terrains while for flash flood in urban areas the use of shock capturing schemes is required papaioannou et al 2016 examined the effect of different types of hydrodynamic modeling approaches in combination with several types of digital elevation models spatial resolutions for flood mapping at ungauged watersheds their results confirm that dem accuracy dominates against the modeling approach and highlight that the sophisticated 2 d approach outperforms the coupled 1d 2d one teng et al 2017 review state of the art models for determining flood inundation in their conclusions they underlined that there is no such thing as a perfect model and suggested the use of the parsimony principle which means avoiding more complication than is necessary to fulfil the objectives in a precise and realistic way the framework provided so far highlights that the question of how detailed a model should be in order to give reasonable results is still an open issue and no shared and general conclusions have been reached so far on the other hand a lot of papers even recently have remarked on the need for further tests and validations because sufficient data on inundation extent and depths for the calibration and validation of the models are lacking macchione et al 2019b molinari et al 2019 this is particular true especially if one thinks about the not particularly high complexity of the case studies simulated in the literature specifically very often the upstream discharge hydrograph is characterized by quite progressive slow varying rising and falling limbs and no specific phenomena that can influence significantly the dynamics of the flow inundation occur during the flood propagation for example to the authors knowledge excepts some studies related on experimental transient flow through bridges martínez aranda et al 2018 no real world events have been considered in the literature for which the flood inundation process has been strongly induced by the effects of bridge obstructions which can represent the main reason causing the sudden increase of the water levels and therefore provoking out of banks flows in situations like these the hydrodynamic process is much more complex and no paper in the literature shows a benchmarking study to evaluate the capability of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation finally but not of less importance it should be observed that 2d inundation models are essentially evaluated regarding the ability to accurately predict flooded areas however such observation may not be an adequate validation dataset in all cases as pointed out by zischg et al 2018 who proposed for example the validation of 2d flood models on the basis of loss data i e insurance claims rather than on the basis of inundated areas this paper tries to fill some of the gaps highlighted above in the existing literature feeding the debate described so far specifically the point of view of this work is the flood hazard assessment within the inundated area focusing on local estimations of the product between flood velocity and water depths i e unit discharge and not so much on flow velocity and water depths considered separately as usually performed in the literature furthermore it should be underlined that the unit discharges have not only an operational value as reference parameters for the quantification of the hazard degree but they are themselves the conserved variables that come out from the hydraulic simulations as a consequence for a given water depth the differences between the unit discharges computed by flood inundation models can be used as a quantitative measure to evaluate the modifications in the hydrodynamic behavior induced by simplifications in the momentum equations that characterize the low complexity modelling in respect of the fully dynamic approach therefore the focus of this work is the detailed analysis on the influence played by the physical complexity of the hydrodynamic model on local estimations of flood hazard and consequently on the potential effects of the flow on specific targets such as buildings vehicles and people the analysis will be carried out considering three models 1 a fully dynamic model hereafter identified as swe based on the swes solved using a well balanced shock capturing scheme 2 a diffusive or zero inertia model hereafter called zi 3 a porosity model hereafter identified as pm based on a shock capturing scheme that has been never considered in the studies mentioned above related to benchmarking of 2d flood inundation models the models will be firstly applied to an experimental test related to a flash flood in idealized urban districts testa et al 2007 in order to preliminarily analyze the potential discrepancies among the simulated hydrodynamic variables induced by the different physical complexities then attention will be devoted to the flood event which occurred in city of crotone calabria italy in 1996 for which detailed observed data are available the paper is organized as follows after the description of the mathematical models used here section 2 the case studies mentioned before are presented in section 3 section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the results and relative discussion finally the main conclusions of this work are reported in section 5 2 mathematical models in this section the governing equations of the fully dynamic model swe the porosity model pm and the diffusive model zi and the related numerical schemes for their solutions are presented 2 1 fully dynamic model swe the mathematical model is based on the 2 d swe that can be expressed in the following form 1 u t f x g y s where 2 3 4 5 u h h u h v f hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s 0 g h s 0 x s fx g h s 0 y s fy in which t s is time x m y m are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u m s v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration s0x m m s0y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions sfx m m sfy m m are the friction slopes in x and y directions an unstructured grid based on irregular triangular elements tin has been used to obtain the computational domain for the numerical integration of system 1 the finite volume method fvm has been applied in particular the roe scheme 1981 first order accurate in time and space has been used for the computation of the numerical fluxes the numerical integration of the shallow water equations in complex topographies requires further specific algorithms to the numerical treatment of the bottom slope of the friction slope and of the wet dry fronts for the sake of brevity only some key aspects of the model already presented in previous works macchione et al 2016 2019b costabile et al 2019 are recalled here a in order to ensure the stability of the model the time steps have been estimated according to the cfl condition courant et al 1952 b an upwind approach has been adopted to discretize the bottom variations brufau et al 2004 c a semi implicit treatment of the friction source term has been applied brufau et al 2004 costabile et al 2013 cea and bladé 2015 d a robust wet dry procedure was implemented according to the approach presented in costabile et al 2013 e finally buildings are treated as internal solid wall boundary conditions this approach is considered particularly effective for the description of flood propagation in urban areas see for example costanzo and macchione 2006 schubert and sanders 2012 bellos and tsakiris 2015 2 2 porosity model pm several approaches based on the shallow water equations with porosity have been developed in order to describe the interaction between flow and buildings reducing the overall computational cost of the simulations the single porosity sp models consider a single porosity as the fraction of the unit surface area that is not occupied by obstacles based on an isotropic approach defina 2000 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 finaud guyot et al 2010 cea and vázquez cendón 2010 petaccia et al 2010 benkhaldoun et al 2016 ferrari et al 2017 velickovic et al 2017 cozzolino et al 2018 in the isotropic multiple porosity mp approach guinot 2012 the total porosity φ is the sum of the fraction of the unit surface area that may be occupied by stagnant water and of the fraction of the unit surface area that may be occupied by moving water the integral porosity ip models presented at first in sanders et al 2008 uses an integral formulation of the swes in which there are the storage porosity as the areal fraction of the computational cell that is not occupied by buildings and the conveyance porosity as the fraction of the cell edge that is not occupied by obstacles kim et al 2015 özgen et al 2016a b bruwier et al 2017 guinot et al 2017 ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 in the dual integral porosity model dip presented in guinot et al 2017 porosity and flow variables are defined separately for control volumes and boundaries and a closure model is introduced to link control volume and boundary based flow variables in this paper a porosity model previously presented in costanzo and macchione 2006 and successively modified according to the porosity models reported in soares frazão et al 2008 and in cea and vázquez cendón 2010 has been applied the shallow water equations were modified introducing a storage porosity coefficient ϕ which is the ratio between the cell surface area subject to flood and the total cell surface area the equations 2 4 were modified as follows 6 7 8 u ϕ h ϕ h u ϕ h v f ϕ h u ϕ h u 2 g h 2 2 ϕ h u v g ϕ h v ϕ h u v ϕ h v 2 g h 2 2 also the components of source terms s are modified 9 s 0 g ϕ h s 0 x s fx 1 2 g h 2 ϕ x 1 2 h u u 2 v 2 c x l x 1 ϕ g ϕ h s 0 y s fy 1 2 g h 2 ϕ y 1 2 h v u 2 v 2 c y l y 1 ϕ in particular the term of the difference of pressure due to the variation of the porosity has been added along the x axis but in an equivalent way for the y axis as in guinot soares frazão 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 10 g h 2 2 ϕ x moreover a head loss term due to the presence of rapid geometry variations has been introduced along the x axis but in an equivalent way for the y axis as in cea and vázquez cendón 2010 11 1 2 h u u 2 v 2 c x l x 1 ϕ in which cx is the head loss coefficient and lx is the projection length of the obstruction along the x axis although the model is an isotropic one in the proposed model the storage porosity coefficient ϕ and the projection lengths of the obstructions along the x and y directions have been calculated in each cell of the domain in order to consider the anisotropy of the urban area as suggested in sanders et al 2008 for the porosity model the same numerical model and treatments applied for the fully dynamic model have been used 2 3 diffusive model zi in this paper the diffusive model previously presented in costabile et al 2017 has been applied neglecting the inertial terms the eq 1 can be written in the following way 12 13 14 h t u h x v h y 0 h x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 0 h y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 0 in which h h z where z m is the bed level the velocity components are easy to compute as shown in the following relations eqs 15 16 15 16 u h 2 3 n s ws 1 2 h e x v h 2 3 n s ws 1 2 h e y in which ex ey is the frame reference of the plane x y and 17 s ws h h x 2 h y 2 1 2 the numerical scheme used here has been already presented and discussed in costabile et al 2017 it has been developed from the storage cell methods following the approach presented by bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 it is based on an unstructured grid composed of irregular triangular elements and uses cell centred depths values to determine fluxes at interfaces moreover specific algorithms for the computation of the free surface in a cell and the management of the wet dry fronts have been developed as well all the numerical details can be found in costabile et al 2017 3 motivation and description of the selected case studies 3 1 model city flooding experiment and available data the lack of validation data from the field may be addressed using laboratory models since they provide accurate measurement of flow characteristics under controlled conditions among the available studies of urban flooding based on laboratory experiments see mignot et al 2019 for a recent review we have selected the simulation of flow propagation in an idealized urban district also known as model city flooding experiment carried out during the impact project testa et al 2007 we have chosen this test because it is still widely used in the literature to assess the models performances see for example soares frazão et al 2008 guinot 2012 jeong et al 2012 costabile and macchione 2015 xia et al 2017 ferrari et al 2019 indeed this test has been used here not so as to provide one more validation and or comparative analysis among the model simulations and experimental data as usually happens in the literature in our view this test is useful in order to discuss an example of urban flooding even though idealized from which it is possible to introduce the main contribution of this work which is that different models could provide similar inundated areas but different water depths values inside the domain and furthermore similar simulated water depths values may be associated to different estimation of hazards and vulnerability within the flooded areas in the experimental test the buildings in an urban area were represented using concrete blocks of 15 cm long edges depicted in black in fig 1 a placed in a checkerboard configuration and arranged in both a staggered and aligned manner the blocks were placed on the physical model scale 1 100 of the toce river valley that was extensively used for flood propagation experiments see cadam project to be more precise the model city was placed on a region close approximately 5 m to the upstream end of the toce river physical model three hydrographs have been considered for both the configurations for the sake of brevity only the lower hydrograph qlow has been considered here as the upstream boundary condition fig 1b 3 1 1 details of the simulations a 5 cm spacing digital elevation model dem of the toce river valley physical model was obtained by enel cesi two computational grids have been set up to run the numerical models the first unstructured grid is composed of 15 223 elements and 7687 nodes see fig 1c to give an idea about the grid size in the urban district the triangular element side is 5 cm which is one fourth of the space between two consecutive buildings evaluated along a specific row or column of the blocks this grid has been used to run both the swe and the zi for these two models the buildings have been considered as internal solid wall boundary conditions the second unstructured grid is composed of 1577 elements and 830 nodes fig 1d this grid has been used to run the pm 3 2 the case of 1996 inundation of crotone italy and available data the inundation of the city of crotone calabria italy occurred on 14th october 1996 due to the overflow of the esaro river see fig 2 for a general overview all the pluviometric and hydrological data are reported in a previous study of the authors see macchione et al 2019b and are not reported here for the sake of brevity the flood evolution provoked six fatalities and several injuries causing also the collapse of bridges and the disruption of the main communication roads including the railway traffic several buildings commercial activities and small factories registered enormous damages the values of the water depths and velocities were such that significant hazard conditions occurred in the urbanized areas see fig 3 the available observed data can be grouped essentially in two sets the first one is a collection of information extracted from the analysis of some amateur videos which mainly refers to water levels estimated near two bridges located at the beginning and in the middle of the computational domain see macchione et al 2019b the second one refers to data collected during a post event survey which consists of some estimations of the maximum water levels reached by the flow inside the urban areas re arranged according to pre fixed ranges as reported in macchione et al 2019b the bridge 1 see fig 2 was overtopped by the flow and the temporal evolution of the water levels just above the road surface of the bridge in some instant of times are available moreover the analysis of the videos allowed the authors to deduce a process of significant obstruction though not full and sudden unclogging of the bridge over time this process has been carefully modeled and the reader can refer to macchione et al 2019b for the details finally the detailed analysis of the videos highlighted that another bridge downstream bridge 2 see fig 2 was obstructed as well representing the main reason that induced the inundation of some neighborhoods located on the right hand side of the esaro river the main features that characterize this event recalled so far represent the main motivation of its choice in the light of the purpose of this work the novelty introduced by this flood event is thus represented by the possibility to provide a benchmarking study of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation in situations for which the overbank flow has been strongly influenced by the interaction of the flood with obstructed bridges 3 2 1 details of the simulations specifically four simulations have been performed using the same boundary conditions and roughness values distribution this research assumes that the roughness values are hydraulic parameters that should be estimated from land use of the studied areas as usually performed in flood hazard mapping so in this study we don t consider the strickler manning coefficient as a calibration parameter to tune the performance of the numerical models in particular we have used only one set of roughness values one for the river bed and another one for the urban areas equal for the all the models in particular the manning coefficient has been set equal to 0 0164 m1 3 s for the experimental test case according to the suggestion provided by the literature for the real flood event we have set the strickler coefficient equal to 25 m1 3 s and 15 m1 3 s for the river bed and urban area respectively two simulations refer to the application of the swe and zi models using the most refined grid the other two simulations refer to the application of the pm using both a fine and a coarse grid the four computational grids used here are shown in fig 4 in particular the most refined grid g 1 fig 4a consists of 58 712 elements having a mean area approximately equal to 57 m2 the grid is more refined in the area covered by the main channels of the two rivers resulting in a mean element area around 30 m2 and inside the urbanized districts in which the grid resolution ranges from 20 m2 neighborhood 1 in fig 2 to 40 m2 port or street 1 and 2 in fig 2 this grid has been used essentially due to the approach used for the representation of the buildings within the swe and zi models for which interior solid wall boundary conditions have been set in order to describe the flow motion among the buildings themselves therefore the small size of the elements is a consequence of the irregular contours of the buildings footprints and the alleys that characterize the studied areas the application of the pm is meaningful in those cases for which there is the need to reduce the number of the computational elements especially for reasons of computational times and machine memory limitations in order to evaluate the model performances also as a function of the grid resolution two computational domains have been set by the progressive removal of grid points from the previous grid this process has been applied only to the areas external to the river in order to favor the comparison between the swe model and pm in the areas outside the river itself for which the application of pm is meaningful so a gradual reduction of grid points density moving from the smaller computational elements river to those external to the river itself has been carried out to avoid grid quality problems i e significant variations of adjacent elements area see also costabile and macchione 2015 for this reason the out of bank areas close to the river have a nodal density greater than those far from the river itself the two reduced grids are shown in fig 4b and c the first one g 2 fig 4b is composed of about 20 000 elements with a mean element area approximately equal to 170 m2 the mean area of the computational elements ranges from 90 m2 in areas close to the esaro river neighborhood 1 and road 1 to 1000 m2 for the farthest ones port the last grid g 3 fig 4c is the coarsest one and is composed of about 13 000 elements with a mean element area approximately equal to 250 m2 the mean area of the computational elements ranges from 8000 m2 in areas close to the esaro river neighborhood 1 and road 1 to 12000 m2 for the farthest ones port the coarsening applied to the g 2 and g 3 grids may be further appreciated in fig 4d which shows the significant reduction of the number of cells having area lower than 100 m2 in respect to the g 1 grid 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of the experimental test attention has been focused on a couple of issues 1 behavior of the hydrodynamic variables water depth and velocity 2 potential effects on hazard vulnerability assessment the maximum extents of flood areas simulated by the three models are not shown here because they are very similar to each other due to topographic constraints that limit the lateral expansion of the flow therefore the comparison is not particular meaningful in this case 4 1 1 behavior of the hydrodynamic variables and flow regimes water depth and velocity the results shown in fig 5 refer to the temporal behavior of the water depths simulated by the three models using the hydrograph depicted in fig 1b as the upstream boundary condition the gauges p3 and p4 are located just upstream of the urban district and consequently they are involved in the backwater effect induced by the interaction between the flood front and idealized buildings this effect clearly is more important in p4 than in p3 because the first one is located just above the block while the second one is in the middle of two rows of blocks see fig 1a due to rapid increase of the water depths the swe is expected to provide the best simulations of the experimental data in those locations as shown in fig 5a b the pm results are less accurate than the swe ones because the presence of the urban district is taken into account only indirectly by the porosity coefficients but they somewhat show the tendency to reproduce approximately the phenomenon due to the shock capturing properties of the model the pm gives better predictions than the zi ones because these latter fail to reproduce the sudden increase of the water levels providing a poor simulation due to the absence of the inertial terms focusing the attention inside the urban district the differences among the models tend to reduce as highlighted for example by the depth hydrographs obtained in the location of the p6 p7 p8 and p9 gauges the zi predictions confirm a slight tendency in the underestimation of the results while the pm results are close to the swe ones the underestimation of the experimental data observed in p8 has been already observed by other authors see for example soares frazão et al 2008 kim et al 2014 it could be induced in part by the density of elements in that area since another simulation carried out using a more refined grid not shown here highlighted a better agreement downstream from the idealized urban district in the area close to the p10 gauge the swe seems to outperform the simplified models since it captures better the peak value and it does not work worse than the other models afterwards this time the zi results show an overestimation of the observed results while the pm underestimates the experimental water depths it may be important to underline that all three models predict faster wetting at all probes than the experimental data confirming what has been already observed in previous studies using pm and swe approaches soares frazão et al 2008 kim et al 2014 finally it is important to briefly discuss the differences among the velocities simulated by the three models even though no experimental data are available fig 6 highlights that generally the swe provides higher velocities and more steep fronts than the other two models in few locations the simplified models results are in reasonable good agreement with the swe ones see fig 6f and fig 6a for the zi and pm respectively but in several cases flow velocities simulated by the pm see fig 6c e f h and the zi 6b c d g h are significantly lower than swe ones 4 1 2 potential effects on hazard and vulnerability assessment it is interesting now to evaluate the potential effects that the differences among the hydrodynamic variables simulated by the three models could have in terms of hazard and vulnerability assessment though the analysis we are discussing refers to idealized urban districts we will show later on in this work that some conclusions obtained from this experimental test are valid also for the real world inundation event that will be discussed in the next section in particular we consider the product between the magnitude of the velocity vector v u 2 v 2 0 5 and water depth h as a hydrodynamic variable supporting hazard vulnerability assessments the temporal profiles of this product computed in the same gauge locations considered above are shown in fig 7 in the position of the p3 gauge the zi results are significantly lower than the swe and the pm ones the hv values simulated by the pm are lower than the swe accordingly to what has been already observed in the analysis of the water depths however this is not the case in the position of the p4 gauge in which the pm values are greater than those computed by the swe at least for the peak value inside the urban district the situation highlighted in the position of gauges p6 and p9 is substantially equivalent to what has been already observed for the gauge p3 on the contrary looking at the position of gauge p8 the pm predicts values significantly lower than those simulated using the swe and zi despite the slight differences observed in terms of water depths values downstream of the blocks the pm results highlight a significant underestimation of hv values in respect to the other two simulations while the zi provides values lower than the swe ones despite the higher values simulated for the water depths the percentage differences between simplified models and the swe are shown in table 1 in particular regarding the pm the hv values are relatively small only in three locations p3 p4 and p6 while significant underestimations in respect to the swe ones have been computed elsewhere with discrepancies greater than 50 in four locations and maximum differences up to 70 in p7 and p8 a similar observation can be made for the zi except for the p8 location in which the difference is small 10 the underestimation of hv values are greater than 50 in four locations and a maximum difference up to 80 in p9 finally it is interesting to discuss the behavior of the variable hv simulated by three models along some longitudinal 1 1 and 2 2 and cross sections 3 3 and 4 4 inside the urban district represented in fig 8 a along the sections 1 1 and 2 2 it may be observed that all the models describe the downstream effects induced by the interaction between the blocks and flow front however the transversal variation assumed by hv as simulated by the swe is reproduced only in part by the zi which provides a smoother profile while the behavior of the pm results is even worse along the longitudinal sections 3 and 4 the swe simulates a quite progressive decreasing behavior of hv while the zi provides an unrealistic swaying for that variable probably due to the poor hydraulic description of the phenomenon within the urban area the pm results underestimate significantly the values of hv along the sections 4 2 flood hazard assessment for the case of the 1996 inundation in the city of crotone this section is devoted to the analysis of the results of the models considering the real world inundation event that interested the city of crotone described in section 3 the analysis performed here is essentially organized in two steps in the first one attention is focused on the comparison between results of the models and the available observed data related essentially to water levels in the river and in the adjacent areas where urban districts are located in the second one we provide some numerical elaborations aimed at the evaluation of the differences in terms of flood hazard vulnerability assessment inside the city of crotone according to the simulations results obtained using the three models considered in this work prior to focusing attention on the issues cited above it is important to provide some considerations about the extent of the flooded areas simulated by the different models fig 9 represents the flooded areas obtained by the four simulations described in section 3 2 at first sight the simulations predict a comparable extent of the inundated areas in particular the zi model gives a slight underestimation 15 in respect of the swe model while the pm model predictions are substantially similar to the swe one even though a tendency to overestimate the result can be observed when moving from a fine grid 2 to a coarse grid 8 however the distribution of the water depths within the flooded areas highlighted by the contour levels maps shown in fig 9 seems to be affected by significant differences that in turn may induce one to argue that also the simulated velocity fields can be different the comparative analysis of model performances in term of water depths and velocities will be discussed in the next sections 4 2 1 comparison between model results and observed data the first analysis presented here refers to the model performances in the main channel of the esaro river near to bridge 1 and upstream of bridge 2 fig 10 a represents the comparison between the estimated water levels in specific instants of times represented by the green circles and the simulations provided by the swe and zi models obviously the pm model has no meaning here since we are discussing a situation located in the main river for which a porosity cell has no sense the temporal evolution simulated by the swe model shows some discontinuities due to the sequence of the span bridge opening used for the representation of the unblocking phenomenon more specifically we have modeled the bridge obstruction considering some cells as internal solid wall boundary conditions then we have progressively removed over time this setting turning the status of those cells from a solid wall boundary condition to a common computational cells so the sudden rising lowering of the water levels can be explained by a sudden decrease increase of the available cross section area for further details see macchione et al 2019b the zi model is less sensitive to this sudden changing but the overall behavior can be considered as comparable to that simulated by the swe model providing the same peak value and time to peak even though the lowering dynamics deduced from the video analysis is correctly reproduced only by the swe a second significant piece of information related to flow levels in the esaro river regards the maximum water level estimated in a cross section located near bridge 2 which according to the reconstruction based on the video analyses is approximately equal to 8 m bridge 2 crosses the esaro river just upstream of street 1 150 m upstream of the confluence between the esaro river and the lamps papaniciaro stream fig 10b shows the comparison between the models results and the estimated water level depicted by a green dotted line though the water levels simulated by the swe model show a greater transversal variability than that simulated by the zi model the two results can be considered comparable also in this case both the models have provided a good result since the simulated water levels are practically superimposed on the observed one the comparison between the simulated water levels and the estimated ones for both the locations shown here highlights a substantial similar good performance provided by the swe and zi models according to these results the dynamics of the flood propagation in the esaro river has been similarly simulated by the two models at least upstream of the considered bridges since no particular difference has been observed in two points located at the beginning and in the middle of the computational domain the attention now is devoted to the results obtained by all the models outside the river banks and in particular inside the urban areas in order to understand if the previous conclusion can be extended also to the adjacent areas of the main river figs 11 a and 12a highlight the points for which water levels estimations are available re arranged in pre fixed ranges we have grouped these areas in five main zones according to their locations within the domain that are listed hereafter as follows zone 1 railway station red circles in fig 11a upstream of the confluence between the esaro river and the lamps papaniciaro stream on the left zone 2 road 1 cyan circles in fig 11a located downstream of the confluence on the left zone 3 neighborhood 1 green circles in fig 11a located downstream of the confluence on the right zone 4 streets 1 and 2 orange circles in fig 12 a located on the right of the esaro river moving to the downtown zone 5 port purple circles in fig 12a on the right of the esaro river close to the sea for each zone we have provided graphs reported in figs 11 and 12 in which we have represented the simulated versus observed water levels in which the latter ones are represented by ranges of values and not by a specific value moreover for each graph we have highlighted the line of perfect agreement by a black dotted line the simulations refer not only to the swe and zi models but also to the application of the porosity model pm using both the coarse grid pmcg and a finer grid pmfg highlighted in fig 4 though the models performances can be appreciated looking at the figs 11 and 12 from which the mean error could be roughly perceived we have preferred also to provide information related to the mean absolute errors reported in table 2 in particular the quantification of the errors between the generic model m where m stands for swe zi pmfg or pmcg predictions and observed data has been computed for each zone i according to the eq 18 18 e m i j 1 n i h m j i h o j i h o j i n i in which ni is the number of the observed points in the i th zone while hm j i and ho j i are respectively the water depths computed by the model m and observed in the j th point of the i th zone specifically ho j i is the mean value of the observed range of values finally a global assessment of model performances has been carried out computing the weighted mean value of the absolute errors e m g considering the number of the observed values for each zone the models results are quite different the analysis of the error e m g highlights that the best result has been obtained by swe followed by pmfg pmcg and zi this ranking is generally confirmed by the e m i values for each zone swe performs better than the other models except for the zone 4 for which the pmfg and pmcg provided comparable results among the simplified models zi performs worse than the pm models except for the zone 5 and zone 3 for which the results are similar and for the zone 2 in which it provides errors in the middle of pmfg and pmcg the ranking of the models performances discussed so far can be further appreciated in figs 11 and 12 looking at the discrepancies in respect to the line of perfect agreement a visual comparative analysis of the results shown in fig 11 highlights that the swe model has provided the best performances in all the three considered zones the pmfg model results are in good agreement with the observations only for zone 2 fig 11f while the simulations are not particularly satisfying in the remaining two zones resulting in a tendency to overestimate fig 11g and underestimate fig 11e the estimated water levels the use of a coarse grid has led to a deterioration of the quality of the predicted results obtained using the pm model in particular fig 11j highlights the worsening in the prediction of the simulated water levels in respect to the pmfg results showing a slight tendency to underestimate the observed values for the other two zones the simulations are more or less comparable even though the pmcg results show the tendency to predict lower values than those obtained by the pmfg model especially for zone 3 fig 11j the zi model seems to provide an overall poor prediction of the observed values in particular there is a general underestimation of the results in the zones 2 and 3 fig 11l and m focusing attention on the two zones on the right closer than the previous ones to the downtown of the city of crotone the previous observations still holds the swe model has again provided the best results making a satisfactory prediction for the water level inside zone 4 see fig 12b even though there are three points for which it has predicted significant higher values than the estimated ones for zone 5 see fig 12c the pm model relative to the finer grid has provided substantially similar results to the swe model for zone 4 fig 12d but drastically underestimated the observed water levels in zone 5 fig 12e using the coarse grid the results simulated by the pm model are approximately similar to those obtained using the fine grid even though the underestimation highlighted for the pmfg result for zone 5 is more pronounced fig 12g finally the zi seems to provide poor predictions increasing the underestimations of the observed water levels in zone 4 fig 12h while the simulated water levels show some significant overestimations of the observed values in zone 5 fig 12i 4 2 2 flood hazard assessment according to models simulations this section is devoted to the analysis of models results in terms of flood hazard assessment in particular attention here is first focused on the areas shown in fig 3 where significant hazard conditions have been arisen as highlighted by consequences represented in the pictures our interest does not only lie in the maximum values assumed by water depths and velocities as simulated by the models but also the arrival time the rapidity of rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs and the persistence over time that a specific hazard condition may generate for this reason we focus on the whole hydrographs obtained by the models in terms of water depths and velocities in each area shown in fig 3 as regards the location 1 near the railway station the water depth profile simulated by the zi model is substantially similar to that provided by the swe model at least for the initial part of the hydrograph even though a not negligible overestimation can be observed later fig 13 a on the contrary the velocity profile simulated by the zi significantly underestimates the swe one for the whole duration of the event fig 13b the pm results are lower than the swe ones in terms of both the water depth and velocity profiles fig 13a b the nodal grid density between g 2 and g 3 is not so different in this area and for this reason the pmfg and pmcg simulations are quite similar in the location number 2 that belongs to road 1 the zi model confirms the previous behavior in terms of water depth profiles while the pm model results are practically superimposed on the swe ones also due to a very limited difference in terms of computational grids fig 13c this area in particular is very close to the river so it is not possible to provide significant variations of the grid element size however the temporal variation of the velocity highlights a significant difference among the models fig 13d the pmcg and zi predictions are very similar together but both provide a remarkable underestimation of the velocity profile simulated by the swe model the pmfg gives a better prediction than the previous two simulations but in any case its values are lower than the swe ones as regards locations numbers 3 and 4 both falling in the neighborhood 1 the water depth profile simulated by the zi significantly underestimates the swe ones showing also a slower arrival time of the front flow fig 13e and g moreover in fig 13e the overall behavior seems to be different showing a lower increase of the rising limb of the hydrograph and a very low variation of the water levels after the peak value in respect of the other simulations the pm results are significantly influenced by the computational grid used in particular the water depths simulated using the g2 grid pmfg are very close to the swe ones fig 13e and g also because the nodal density in this area is not particularly different from the g1 one used for swe model the use of the g3 grid significantly deteriorates the simulation in respect to the swe model resulting closer to the zi ones except for the front arrival time that is better described due to presence of the inertial terms in the momentum equations the analysis of the simulated flow velocity confirms what has been observed for the water depths highlighting even more pronounced differences fig 13f and h the locations number 5 and 6 fall in an area located in the middle between the neighborhood 1 and street 1 the zi model still continues not only to underperform for the water levels computed by the swe model fig 13i and k but also it predicts very low values of flow velocity in respect to the other simulations fig 13j and l giving a significant delay in terms of front arrival times also in these cases the computational grid plays an important role in the performances of the pm showing important discrepancies in respect to the swe results as moving from the g2 grid to the g3 one in particular the underestimation of the water level given by the pmcg is more important than that provided by the zi one fig 13k despite the flow velocities being similar to the swe ones fig 13j a similar observation can be made looking at the pmfg results since they might provide similar water levels fig 13k but significant lower values of flow velocity than the swe ones fig 13l this behavior confirms what has been already observed in the analysis of model performances related to the simulation of the experimental test section 4 1 different models could provide similar water depths values inside the domain but at the same time different values of velocity or vice versa and therefore different estimation of hazards within the flooded areas finally the location number 7 belongs to street 1 in this area the g2 and g3 grids are significantly coarser than the g1 one and therefore the application of the pm model is more meaningful here than in areas very close to the river in particular fig 13m highlights that the water levels simulated by the pmfg are not in close agreement to the swe ones as generally occurred in the previous locations moreover the velocity profile predicted by the pmfg model is very far from the swe resulting in a significant underestimation similar to that performed by the zi model 13n the zi model results confirm the previous observations regarding the lower values of both water levels and velocity in respects of the swe ones the hydrographs shown in fig 13 represent a further confirmation of what has been already deduced by the analysis of figs 11 and 12 related to the comparison with estimated maximum values in particular it seems that despite similar predictions of the inundated area extent significant local underestimations of the hydrodynamic values have been simulated by the zi and pm approaches in order to characterize the differences among the models throughout the domain the percentage variations between the zi pmfg and pmcg results and the swe ones used as benchmark have been computed in particular introducing the variables hi t vi t and hivi t that represent respectively the temporal evolution of the water depths h the module of velocity v and the product between v and h computed by the numerical models three parameters have been computed for each computational cells i δ h i max h i t m max h i t swe max h i t swe δ v i max v i t m max v i t swe max v i t swe δ h v i max hv i t m max hv i t swe max hv i t swe in which δ h i δ v i δ hv i represents the percent variations between the maximum water depth velocity or product between velocity and water depth value computed in the cell i by the model m where m stands again for the zi pmfg or pmcg and the homologous relative to the swe simulation regarding the results relative to pmfg and pmcg it should be recalled that they refer to the g 2 and g 3 grids that are coarser than the g 1 grid used for the swe model in order to provide a suitable comparison between the results relative to models running on different grids we have interpolated the hydrodynamic variables computed in the cells centroid of the coarser grid onto the g 1 grid points the values obtained for δ h i δ v i δ hv i have been grouped in 5 classes in order to have a quick comprehension of the results in particular four classes have been identified to highlight two different levels for both the underestimation and overestimation computed by a generic model m in respect to the swe model while another class has been used to identify a substantial similarity of the models results specifically when the percent variations range between 0 2 and 0 2 we have considered as comparable the result obtained by the generic model m in respect to the swe model otherwise large and significant underestimation overestimation have been detected assuming respectively the following ranges 0 6 greater than0 6 and 0 6 0 2 0 2 0 6 fig 14 shows the percent variations maps obtained for each couple of models pmfg swe pmcg swe zi swe the results show important variations in respect of the swe ones fig 14 especially in the simulation of the maximum velocity and the product hv considering the model simulations as a whole among the considered variables the water depths seem to be the most comparable ones since limited differences δ h have been obtained for large areas of the computational domain especially in the nw part however important variations exist especially near the confluence on the right of the esaro river moving to street 1 and the port these considerations hold for all the models even though some local variations can be observed in the fig 14a b c first of all the decrease of grid resolution affects the results obtained by the pm model increasing the differences in respect to the swe simulations this is evident for example looking at the areas adjacent to the esaro river on the right see for example the neighborhood 1 in which we turn from a comparable simulation to a significant underestimation of the results only by changing the grid resolution g 3 instead of g 2 and consequently the porosity coefficients as regards the zi simulations relative to the same grid used for the swe model the δ h values detect large or significant underestimation of the water depths practically in all the areas located to the right of the esaro river except some limited parts in the eastern zones of the domain fig 14c the analysis of the variations related to the other two variables v and hv are less immediate the zi results shown in fig 14f and i highlight a general large underestimation of both v and hv values except for the most upstream part of the domain the δ v and δ hv values obtained using the pm results are very far from the range identifying comparable results alternating areas in which large underestimation and overestimation occur fig 14d e g h in order to have a rough idea of the overall behavior of model simulation we focus attention on the five zones already discussed in section 4 2 1 in particular we have considered the groups of cells belonging to the areas depicted in fig 15 and for each group we have computed the percentage of cells for which the δ h δ v and δ hv values fall in the range identifying comparable results these results are reported in table 3 which permits a better clarification of what has been previously observed in the analysis of fig 14 in particular the overall results highlight that all the models give low percentages of comparable values only in few cases are the percentages greater than 50 and they refer essentially to the water depths values as regards velocities the percentage of cells for which comparable values are simulated is generally significantly lower than those relative to water depths and this situation is even worse when looking at the hv values the zi results show greater discrepancies than the pm models in respect to the swe ones in particular in zones 3 and 4 the results are completely different considering all the hydrodynamic variables h v and hv in the other three zones there is a significant discrepancy between the prediction in terms of water depths and velocities specifically the percentage of cells for which comparable values have been simulated in terms of water depths is much greater than the homologous one related to velocities this fact highlights the negative consequence associated to the use of the approximated formulation of the momentum equations that lead to a rough computation of flow velocity the discrepancy between the simulations in terms of water depths and velocities though sometimes less pronounced is also shown by the pm models results especially for the pmfg simulation among the considered hydrodynamic variables the worst results in terms of percentage of cells in which the simplified models provided results comparable to the swe ones is related to hv values this consideration holds for each model analyzed in this work the results shown in fig 14 are useful in order to give extensive information about the differences among the model simulations in terms of the variables commonly used for flood hazard assessment independently from the specific criteria used for its evaluation we think that this is important because the use of different methods can lead to different conclusions when mapping hazard vulnerability classification see for example russo et al 2013 moreover the research on this field is rapidly moving on developing more and more sophisticated criteria to be used for hazard classifications according to people vehicles and buildings however it should be interesting to discuss now the potential practical consequences that could be associated to the use of simplified models when using a specific criterion for flood hazard assessment in terms of different classes of hazard vulnerability as recalled in the introduction there are several methods available in the literature to that purpose as an example in this work we refer to criteria proposed by smith et al 2014 and recommended by aidr 2017 it has been also discussed and compared to other methods in a recent review on vehicles stability during floods bocanegra et al 2019 we have chosen this approach essentially due to its simplicity and because it takes into account the main targets exposed to flood risk once again attention is focused on the five zones represented in fig 15 the reasoning followed here is structured in two steps in the first one we have performed for each model the hazard classification as reported in fig 16 so for each cell we have a specific classification ranging from h1 to h6 next we have compared the classifications made for each cell considering the results obtained using simplified models in respect to the evaluations performed using the swe results this comparison has been organized in order 1 to compute the percentage of cells for which we have the same classification 2 to evaluate the percentage of cells for which we have an underestimation or an overestimation of hazard classification in respect to swe evaluations and 3 to detect how many hazard classes have been overestimated or underestimated a synthetic representation of this kind of comparative analysis has been reported in fig 17 in which bar plots of the results are depicted looking at zone 1 railway station fig 17a b we have obtained the same classification for a percentage of cells up to 60 70 while the class underestimations or overestimations are substantially equally distributed resulting in no more than 20 25 each fig 17a and mainly limited to a leap of only one class fig 17b these considerations are also valid for zone 2 road 1 for which the classification made according the pm simulations is in good agreement with the swe one instead the classification performed according to the zi results has led to a significant percentage of cells about 40 for which the hazard class has been underestimated fig 17c not only of one class but also of two or more classes fig 17d the effect of grid resolution on the pm is particularly important in zone 3 neighborhood 1 in this area the percentage of cells for which the same classification has been estimated by the pmcg results in respect to the swe is significantly lower that the pmfg ones resulting in a high percentage of cells in which the hazard class is underestimated fig 17e even by two or more classes fig 17f the zi model results give the worst results since the class is underestimated in the large majority of cells up to 70 with differences that are very often equal to or greater than leaps of two classes fig 17f in the last two zones the pm and zi models completely fail to reproduce the same classification performed by the swe results in particular in zone 4 streets 1 and 2 all the models results provided high percentages of cells for which the hazard class has been underestimated fig 17g ranging from 50 to 90 respectively for the pmcg and zi the number of cells for which the class underestimation is equal to or greater than 2 is significant as well fig 17h these same considerations can be applied to the analysis of zone 5 port for which the classification performed by the pm results are even poorer than those relative to zone 4 fig 17i and the hazard class is very often underestimated by more than 2 classes fig 17j 5 discussion and conclusion the numerical models aimed at the simulation of the hydraulic features of urban floods events may be grouped into three families fully dynamic models based on the swe approaches based on different physical simplification of the swe and methods based on the indirect representation of buildings using the porosity techniques in the literature several papers deal with the benchmarking of these kinds of models a careful analysis of the state of the art has highlighted that such a comparison is very often carried out with reference to the flooded areas extent only sometimes analyzing also the simulated water depths values and quite rarely evaluating the computed velocities however from a practical point of view simulation models are advanced tools for flood hazard and vulnerability assessments therefore in this paper the performances of the models mentioned above have been evaluated considering them not only with reference to the hydrodynamic variables water depths and velocities but also focusing the attention on the variable hv and to the consequences associated to their different estimations on the vulnerability assessment for this reason attention here has been firstly focused on a well known experimental test concerning a flash flood in an idealized urban district this test has been used here not so much as to provide one more validation and or comparative analysis among the model simulations and experimental data as usually happens in the literature but because it has allowed us to introduce one of the main findings of this work different models could provide similar inundated areas but different water depths values inside the domain and furthermore similar simulated water depths values may be associated to different estimation of hazards and vulnerability within the flooded areas the results obtained for the flood inundation of an idealized district highlighted that no particular differences exist among the models predictions in terms of flooded areas extent the observed hydraulic behavior of the flow is correctly reproduced only by the swe model and in a less accurate way by the pm in which no simplifications have been introduced in the momentum equations the indirect representation of the idealized buildings did not allow the model to faithfully reproduce the observed local evolution of the water depths and velocities in particular the distribution of the velocities is more uniform than those provided by the swe model this leads to a significant underestimation of flow velocities that in turn affects the estimation of hv values the zi model has not been able to provide a suitable representation of the local effects induced by the interactions between the flood flow and idealized buildings due to the intrinsic limitations represented by the absence of the inertial terms these considerations obviously require further insights and understandings that only the analysis of a real flood event can provide the inundation in the actual urban area considered here has been selected not only to increase the number of case study available in the literature for the benchmarking of 2d models but in such a way as to provide an event that has specific features not analyzed yet in particular it should be underlined that the complexity of the case studies simulated in the literature is very often not so high dealing with quite progressive slow varying discharge hydrograph without further complexity during the evolution of the event downstream for example it would be interesting to analyze a flood inundation process strongly induced by the interaction of flow and an obstructed bridge representing the main reason causing the sudden increase of the water levels and therefore the out of banks flow in situations like these that are not infrequent during a real world flood event the hydrodynamic process is much more complex and no paper in the literature shows a benchmarking study to evaluate the capability of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation an example of this kind of inundation occurred in the city of crotone in 1996 the analysis of the results has highlighted that the extent of the flooded areas are not equal despite the variations between the simplified models and swe model being not so important as for the channel flow the water levels computed by the zi model are similar to those provided by the swe one even though the zi model is not able to simulate the sudden temporal variations of the water levels induced by the clogging unclogging process of the bridges as for the urban areas the swe has provided the best prediction when comparing observed and simulated water depths the other two models provide a greater dispersion around the perfect agreement lines showing the tendency to underestimate the observed values the dispersion observed for the zi model could be explained by its intrinsic inability in the simulation of local phenomena as for the idealized urban district test case as for the pm the tendency to underestimate the observed values could be explained by the fact that local effects induced by the interaction between flow and buildings cannot be accurately simulated by the porosity coefficient as a proof of this the predictions become poorer as the grid size increase the analysis of water depths and velocities hydrographs in areas for which significant hazards have been observed confirms what has previously stated for the maximum water depths values in some points the zi model has provided significant underestimation of the water depths and velocities the pm results becomes very different from the swe ones as the grid size increases moreover it has been observed that in some locations the swe and pm results are similar in terms of water depths values but very different when comparing the flow velocities confirming what has been previously highlighted for the idealized urban districts test case the differences observed in terms of the hydrodynamic variables h and v become higher when attention is focused on the variable hv specifically it has been shown that these discrepancies lead to wrong estimations of hazard vulnerability classifications with reference to people vehicles and buildings in particular the use of simplified models could lead to significant variations when one has to determine the vulnerability class therefore according to the results shown in this work it seems that fully dynamic modeling should be the unavoidable reference tool when the goal of the urban flood inundation mapping activity is not limited to the evaluation of flood prone areas extent but involves also the local estimation of flood hazard vulnerability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6005,flood hazard in urban areas is usually assessed by the estimations of parameters like flood extent water depths flow velocities and other related quantities these hydrodynamic variables can be computed using flood inundation numerical models the complexity of which has been analyzed in several papers in the literature however the question of how detailed a model should be in order to give reasonable results is still an open issue and no shared and general conclusions have been reached so far one of the main reasons for this is that model benchmarking is very often carried out with reference to the flooded areas extent only sometimes analyzing also the simulated water depths values and quite rarely evaluating the computed velocities this is in contrast with the main purpose of the simulation models which are from a practical point of view advanced tools for flood hazard and vulnerability assessments finally the lack of sufficient data on inundation extent and depths for the calibration and validation of the numerical models has been recognized especially in complex situations that often characterize the flood evolution in a given area due to bridge obstructions interaction with buildings and so on in this paper the performances of three different approaches to two dimensional flood modeling fully dynamic diffusive and porosity approaches have been evaluated with reference not only to the hydrodynamic variables water depths and velocities but also focusing the attention on their product and thus to the consequences associated to their different estimations on the vulnerability assessment this analysis has been focused first on a flash flood flow experiment in a simplified urban district and then to the event which occurred in the city of crotone calabria italy in 1996 the results highlight that fully dynamic modeling should be the unavoidable reference tool when the goal of the urban flood mapping activity is not limited to the evaluation of the flood prone areas extent but involves also the local estimation of flood hazard vulnerability keywords flood hazard 2 d inundation models urban areas model benchmarking vulnerability assessment 1 introduction it is generally recognized that flood management mitigation strategies and planning around the world are based on the estimation of the flood risk in terms of its location magnitude and distribution xiao et al 2017 in particular the aim of the risk based approach is to reduce the overall flood risk which can be defined as a combination of hazard vulnerability and exposure kron 2002 hazard represents the probability of a hazardous event happening in a place vulnerability is a function of the potential damage to a target due to the occurrence of the hazardous event finally exposure quantifies the presence of the target focusing the attention on direct losses only the targets can be either economic values or human lives i e thieken et al 2005 therefore one key activity that governments through dedicated institutions must carry out in order to reduce the flood effects is the prediction of flood magnitude and intensities of the various processes involved by analyzing flood scenarios including past floods and the flood hazard mapping that aims at spatially visualizing a potential endangered area following a given flood scenario macchione et al 2019a sy et al 2019 parameters generally used to denote the flood hazard include the flood extent water depth flow velocity duration propagation of water front and the rate at which the water rises de moel et al 2009 these parameters can then be linked to estimates of economic damage and loss in the affected area indeed a suitable combination of flow depth and velocity through properly devised vulnerability curves represents the potential effects of the flow on a target such as the assessment of direct potential damage to structures and buildings jakob et al 2012 mazzorana et al 2014

al 2016 a lot of technical guidelines have been proposed as well see for example aidr 2017 moreover accurate estimations of the hydrodynamic variables represent the basis used to take into account the additional element of risk related to levee breaches dazzi et al 2019 or due to the interaction of wood eventually entering the stream pulled out by landslides bank erosion and debris flow and the existing man made structures in urbanized areas such as bridge piers persi et al 2018 2019 the hydrodynamic variables mentioned above can be computed using flood inundation numerical models which are a well established approach for conducting flood risk analysis most hydrodynamic modeling approaches are implemented by employing 1 d 2 d or 1 d 2 d schematizations although one dimensional hydrodynamic models are still in widespread use for many applications e g tayefi et al 2007 cook and merwade 2009 costabile and macchione 2012 costabile et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2016 dimitriadis et al 2016 liu et al 2019 fleischmann et al 2019 the use of two dimensional models is required in built up areas to reproduce the complex multidirectional flow paths generated by urban features mignot et al 2006 apel et al 2009 yu and lane 2011 pina et al 2016 indeed flood propagation in urban areas is clearly two dimensional with peculiar features that depend on the complex interaction between the flow and the streets buildings patterns inducing multiple flow paths at crossroads and flow around or within buildings etc therefore when there are more complex river geometries and inundation flow patterns are relevant for the precise mapping of local parameters the use of a 2 d model becomes unavoidable ernst et al 2010 especially to develop emergency activities based on logistic operations and road accessibility bodoque et al 2016 yin et al 2016 arrighi et al 2019 thanks to modeling advances and the increase in computational resources and data availability in recent years it is now feasible to perform 2 d urban flood simulations at very high resolutions ozdemir et al 2013 lacasta et al 2014 liang and smith 2015 de almeida et al 2018 dazzi et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 opening up the possibility of detailed urban flood assessment leitão and de sousa 2018 moreover the use of flexible meshes is emerging which allows a fine spatial resolution in more relevant areas without an unnecessary increase of the computational costs in areas in which limited dynamics and changes are expected caviedes voullième et al 2012 hu et al 2018 bomers et al 2019b savant et al 2019 in risk analyses in urban areas two dimensional models are usually based on the shallow water equations i e mignot et al 2006 bazin et al 2014 costabile and macchione 2015 cea and bladé 2015 but the demand for computationally efficient methodologies has led to the development of simplified formulations that provide accurate solutions within the range of their applicability at a considerably high performance although the literature shows applications of several low complexity or lower fidelity flow inundation models see for example afshari et al 2018 bomers et al 2019a the two most popular examples are the so called zero inertial or diffusive wave approximation among the most recent ones see for example aricò et al 2011 dottori and todini 2013 leandro et al 2014 costabile et al 2017 caviedes voullième et al 2018 cimorelli et al 2018 savant et al 2019 and local inertial approximation e g aronica and lanza 2005 bates et al 2010 de almeida et al 2012 martins et al 2015 2017 another widely used family of models for flood analysis in urban areas is based on the shallow water equations with porosity different porosity models have been proposed in literature ranging from the so called single porosity e g soares frazão et al 2008 cea and vázquez cendón 2010 ferrari et al 2017 to the isotropic multiple porosity guinot 2012 integral porosity sanders et al 2008 özgen et al 2016a b ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 and the dual integral porosity model guinot et al 2017 the plethora of models developed for flood inundation mapping has fueled the need for comparative studies related to the performances of the models themselves assessed through benchmark tests and real world flood events in this context one of the earliest studies devoted to the benchmarking of 2 d models has been presented by hunter et al 2008 who have applied six models to a flood event in a small area in the city of glasgow the simulations have shown that urban floods are characterized by numerous shocks and transitions to supercritical flow even though these effects have been quite localized and have not influenced the overall flood dynamics moreover their results have shown limited differences in terms of simulated maximum water depths apel et al 2009 performed a comparative risk analysis study applying three different types of hydraulic and flood loss models to an event which occurred at the river mulde germany based on the performance of different model combinations the authors concluded that for that case study the 1d 2d hydraulic model in combination with the meso scale flood loss model is the best compromise for a thorough flood risk analysis in the area fewtrell et al 2011 presented a comparative study related to the application of the diffusive and local inertial approaches implemented within the lisflood fp model to a flood event in alcester uk for which high resolution terrestrial lidar data were available the authors observed similar estimates of flood elevations throughout the simulation with differences less than the errors associated with the terrestrial lidar data moreover the authors underlined the inconsistency of the simulated velocities and therefore the risk estimates although the 1 and 2 m resolution models appear to provide robust estimates of water elevations neal et al 2012 have explicitly faced the issue related to the physical complexity needed to model flood inundation the authors claimed that for gradually varying flow the fully dynamic models may be unnecessarily complex and simplified models provide good performances in terms of both water depths and velocities however they mentioned that there may be an overestimation of flood hazard when the water depths and velocities are computed separately néelz and pender 2013 presented a benchmarking of 2d software known to be applied in the uk the authors observed that the packages based on the fully dynamic equations are more suitable for risk analysis but they take long runtimes for application in large areas moreover they underlined that the simulated maximum water depths could be considered comparable while the velocity values tend to be different significant discrepancies between the fully dynamic and simplified models have been observed in terms of both water depth and flow velocities when simulating complex flow fields finally in urban flooding simulations significant differences have been observed for flow velocity especially using grid resolution greater than 2 m kvočka et al 2015 analyzed the effects of the simplified models on flood risk assessment concluding that they lead to incorrect flood level predictions in the flood simulation analysis of the flash flood events which occurred in boscastle uk in particular they claim that the simplified models can be applied only in areas characterized by mild slope and smooth terrains while for flash flood in urban areas the use of shock capturing schemes is required papaioannou et al 2016 examined the effect of different types of hydrodynamic modeling approaches in combination with several types of digital elevation models spatial resolutions for flood mapping at ungauged watersheds their results confirm that dem accuracy dominates against the modeling approach and highlight that the sophisticated 2 d approach outperforms the coupled 1d 2d one teng et al 2017 review state of the art models for determining flood inundation in their conclusions they underlined that there is no such thing as a perfect model and suggested the use of the parsimony principle which means avoiding more complication than is necessary to fulfil the objectives in a precise and realistic way the framework provided so far highlights that the question of how detailed a model should be in order to give reasonable results is still an open issue and no shared and general conclusions have been reached so far on the other hand a lot of papers even recently have remarked on the need for further tests and validations because sufficient data on inundation extent and depths for the calibration and validation of the models are lacking macchione et al 2019b molinari et al 2019 this is particular true especially if one thinks about the not particularly high complexity of the case studies simulated in the literature specifically very often the upstream discharge hydrograph is characterized by quite progressive slow varying rising and falling limbs and no specific phenomena that can influence significantly the dynamics of the flow inundation occur during the flood propagation for example to the authors knowledge excepts some studies related on experimental transient flow through bridges martínez aranda et al 2018 no real world events have been considered in the literature for which the flood inundation process has been strongly induced by the effects of bridge obstructions which can represent the main reason causing the sudden increase of the water levels and therefore provoking out of banks flows in situations like these the hydrodynamic process is much more complex and no paper in the literature shows a benchmarking study to evaluate the capability of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation finally but not of less importance it should be observed that 2d inundation models are essentially evaluated regarding the ability to accurately predict flooded areas however such observation may not be an adequate validation dataset in all cases as pointed out by zischg et al 2018 who proposed for example the validation of 2d flood models on the basis of loss data i e insurance claims rather than on the basis of inundated areas this paper tries to fill some of the gaps highlighted above in the existing literature feeding the debate described so far specifically the point of view of this work is the flood hazard assessment within the inundated area focusing on local estimations of the product between flood velocity and water depths i e unit discharge and not so much on flow velocity and water depths considered separately as usually performed in the literature furthermore it should be underlined that the unit discharges have not only an operational value as reference parameters for the quantification of the hazard degree but they are themselves the conserved variables that come out from the hydraulic simulations as a consequence for a given water depth the differences between the unit discharges computed by flood inundation models can be used as a quantitative measure to evaluate the modifications in the hydrodynamic behavior induced by simplifications in the momentum equations that characterize the low complexity modelling in respect of the fully dynamic approach therefore the focus of this work is the detailed analysis on the influence played by the physical complexity of the hydrodynamic model on local estimations of flood hazard and consequently on the potential effects of the flow on specific targets such as buildings vehicles and people the analysis will be carried out considering three models 1 a fully dynamic model hereafter identified as swe based on the swes solved using a well balanced shock capturing scheme 2 a diffusive or zero inertia model hereafter called zi 3 a porosity model hereafter identified as pm based on a shock capturing scheme that has been never considered in the studies mentioned above related to benchmarking of 2d flood inundation models the models will be firstly applied to an experimental test related to a flash flood in idealized urban districts testa et al 2007 in order to preliminarily analyze the potential discrepancies among the simulated hydrodynamic variables induced by the different physical complexities then attention will be devoted to the flood event which occurred in city of crotone calabria italy in 1996 for which detailed observed data are available the paper is organized as follows after the description of the mathematical models used here section 2 the case studies mentioned before are presented in section 3 section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the results and relative discussion finally the main conclusions of this work are reported in section 5 2 mathematical models in this section the governing equations of the fully dynamic model swe the porosity model pm and the diffusive model zi and the related numerical schemes for their solutions are presented 2 1 fully dynamic model swe the mathematical model is based on the 2 d swe that can be expressed in the following form 1 u t f x g y s where 2 3 4 5 u h h u h v f hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s 0 g h s 0 x s fx g h s 0 y s fy in which t s is time x m y m are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u m s v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration s0x m m s0y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions sfx m m sfy m m are the friction slopes in x and y directions an unstructured grid based on irregular triangular elements tin has been used to obtain the computational domain for the numerical integration of system 1 the finite volume method fvm has been applied in particular the roe scheme 1981 first order accurate in time and space has been used for the computation of the numerical fluxes the numerical integration of the shallow water equations in complex topographies requires further specific algorithms to the numerical treatment of the bottom slope of the friction slope and of the wet dry fronts for the sake of brevity only some key aspects of the model already presented in previous works macchione et al 2016 2019b costabile et al 2019 are recalled here a in order to ensure the stability of the model the time steps have been estimated according to the cfl condition courant et al 1952 b an upwind approach has been adopted to discretize the bottom variations brufau et al 2004 c a semi implicit treatment of the friction source term has been applied brufau et al 2004 costabile et al 2013 cea and bladé 2015 d a robust wet dry procedure was implemented according to the approach presented in costabile et al 2013 e finally buildings are treated as internal solid wall boundary conditions this approach is considered particularly effective for the description of flood propagation in urban areas see for example costanzo and macchione 2006 schubert and sanders 2012 bellos and tsakiris 2015 2 2 porosity model pm several approaches based on the shallow water equations with porosity have been developed in order to describe the interaction between flow and buildings reducing the overall computational cost of the simulations the single porosity sp models consider a single porosity as the fraction of the unit surface area that is not occupied by obstacles based on an isotropic approach defina 2000 guinot and soares frazão 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 finaud guyot et al 2010 cea and vázquez cendón 2010 petaccia et al 2010 benkhaldoun et al 2016 ferrari et al 2017 velickovic et al 2017 cozzolino et al 2018 in the isotropic multiple porosity mp approach guinot 2012 the total porosity φ is the sum of the fraction of the unit surface area that may be occupied by stagnant water and of the fraction of the unit surface area that may be occupied by moving water the integral porosity ip models presented at first in sanders et al 2008 uses an integral formulation of the swes in which there are the storage porosity as the areal fraction of the computational cell that is not occupied by buildings and the conveyance porosity as the fraction of the cell edge that is not occupied by obstacles kim et al 2015 özgen et al 2016a b bruwier et al 2017 guinot et al 2017 ferrari et al 2019 viero 2019 in the dual integral porosity model dip presented in guinot et al 2017 porosity and flow variables are defined separately for control volumes and boundaries and a closure model is introduced to link control volume and boundary based flow variables in this paper a porosity model previously presented in costanzo and macchione 2006 and successively modified according to the porosity models reported in soares frazão et al 2008 and in cea and vázquez cendón 2010 has been applied the shallow water equations were modified introducing a storage porosity coefficient ϕ which is the ratio between the cell surface area subject to flood and the total cell surface area the equations 2 4 were modified as follows 6 7 8 u ϕ h ϕ h u ϕ h v f ϕ h u ϕ h u 2 g h 2 2 ϕ h u v g ϕ h v ϕ h u v ϕ h v 2 g h 2 2 also the components of source terms s are modified 9 s 0 g ϕ h s 0 x s fx 1 2 g h 2 ϕ x 1 2 h u u 2 v 2 c x l x 1 ϕ g ϕ h s 0 y s fy 1 2 g h 2 ϕ y 1 2 h v u 2 v 2 c y l y 1 ϕ in particular the term of the difference of pressure due to the variation of the porosity has been added along the x axis but in an equivalent way for the y axis as in guinot soares frazão 2006 soares frazão et al 2008 10 g h 2 2 ϕ x moreover a head loss term due to the presence of rapid geometry variations has been introduced along the x axis but in an equivalent way for the y axis as in cea and vázquez cendón 2010 11 1 2 h u u 2 v 2 c x l x 1 ϕ in which cx is the head loss coefficient and lx is the projection length of the obstruction along the x axis although the model is an isotropic one in the proposed model the storage porosity coefficient ϕ and the projection lengths of the obstructions along the x and y directions have been calculated in each cell of the domain in order to consider the anisotropy of the urban area as suggested in sanders et al 2008 for the porosity model the same numerical model and treatments applied for the fully dynamic model have been used 2 3 diffusive model zi in this paper the diffusive model previously presented in costabile et al 2017 has been applied neglecting the inertial terms the eq 1 can be written in the following way 12 13 14 h t u h x v h y 0 h x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 0 h y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 0 in which h h z where z m is the bed level the velocity components are easy to compute as shown in the following relations eqs 15 16 15 16 u h 2 3 n s ws 1 2 h e x v h 2 3 n s ws 1 2 h e y in which ex ey is the frame reference of the plane x y and 17 s ws h h x 2 h y 2 1 2 the numerical scheme used here has been already presented and discussed in costabile et al 2017 it has been developed from the storage cell methods following the approach presented by bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 it is based on an unstructured grid composed of irregular triangular elements and uses cell centred depths values to determine fluxes at interfaces moreover specific algorithms for the computation of the free surface in a cell and the management of the wet dry fronts have been developed as well all the numerical details can be found in costabile et al 2017 3 motivation and description of the selected case studies 3 1 model city flooding experiment and available data the lack of validation data from the field may be addressed using laboratory models since they provide accurate measurement of flow characteristics under controlled conditions among the available studies of urban flooding based on laboratory experiments see mignot et al 2019 for a recent review we have selected the simulation of flow propagation in an idealized urban district also known as model city flooding experiment carried out during the impact project testa et al 2007 we have chosen this test because it is still widely used in the literature to assess the models performances see for example soares frazão et al 2008 guinot 2012 jeong et al 2012 costabile and macchione 2015 xia et al 2017 ferrari et al 2019 indeed this test has been used here not so as to provide one more validation and or comparative analysis among the model simulations and experimental data as usually happens in the literature in our view this test is useful in order to discuss an example of urban flooding even though idealized from which it is possible to introduce the main contribution of this work which is that different models could provide similar inundated areas but different water depths values inside the domain and furthermore similar simulated water depths values may be associated to different estimation of hazards and vulnerability within the flooded areas in the experimental test the buildings in an urban area were represented using concrete blocks of 15 cm long edges depicted in black in fig 1 a placed in a checkerboard configuration and arranged in both a staggered and aligned manner the blocks were placed on the physical model scale 1 100 of the toce river valley that was extensively used for flood propagation experiments see cadam project to be more precise the model city was placed on a region close approximately 5 m to the upstream end of the toce river physical model three hydrographs have been considered for both the configurations for the sake of brevity only the lower hydrograph qlow has been considered here as the upstream boundary condition fig 1b 3 1 1 details of the simulations a 5 cm spacing digital elevation model dem of the toce river valley physical model was obtained by enel cesi two computational grids have been set up to run the numerical models the first unstructured grid is composed of 15 223 elements and 7687 nodes see fig 1c to give an idea about the grid size in the urban district the triangular element side is 5 cm which is one fourth of the space between two consecutive buildings evaluated along a specific row or column of the blocks this grid has been used to run both the swe and the zi for these two models the buildings have been considered as internal solid wall boundary conditions the second unstructured grid is composed of 1577 elements and 830 nodes fig 1d this grid has been used to run the pm 3 2 the case of 1996 inundation of crotone italy and available data the inundation of the city of crotone calabria italy occurred on 14th october 1996 due to the overflow of the esaro river see fig 2 for a general overview all the pluviometric and hydrological data are reported in a previous study of the authors see macchione et al 2019b and are not reported here for the sake of brevity the flood evolution provoked six fatalities and several injuries causing also the collapse of bridges and the disruption of the main communication roads including the railway traffic several buildings commercial activities and small factories registered enormous damages the values of the water depths and velocities were such that significant hazard conditions occurred in the urbanized areas see fig 3 the available observed data can be grouped essentially in two sets the first one is a collection of information extracted from the analysis of some amateur videos which mainly refers to water levels estimated near two bridges located at the beginning and in the middle of the computational domain see macchione et al 2019b the second one refers to data collected during a post event survey which consists of some estimations of the maximum water levels reached by the flow inside the urban areas re arranged according to pre fixed ranges as reported in macchione et al 2019b the bridge 1 see fig 2 was overtopped by the flow and the temporal evolution of the water levels just above the road surface of the bridge in some instant of times are available moreover the analysis of the videos allowed the authors to deduce a process of significant obstruction though not full and sudden unclogging of the bridge over time this process has been carefully modeled and the reader can refer to macchione et al 2019b for the details finally the detailed analysis of the videos highlighted that another bridge downstream bridge 2 see fig 2 was obstructed as well representing the main reason that induced the inundation of some neighborhoods located on the right hand side of the esaro river the main features that characterize this event recalled so far represent the main motivation of its choice in the light of the purpose of this work the novelty introduced by this flood event is thus represented by the possibility to provide a benchmarking study of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation in situations for which the overbank flow has been strongly influenced by the interaction of the flood with obstructed bridges 3 2 1 details of the simulations specifically four simulations have been performed using the same boundary conditions and roughness values distribution this research assumes that the roughness values are hydraulic parameters that should be estimated from land use of the studied areas as usually performed in flood hazard mapping so in this study we don t consider the strickler manning coefficient as a calibration parameter to tune the performance of the numerical models in particular we have used only one set of roughness values one for the river bed and another one for the urban areas equal for the all the models in particular the manning coefficient has been set equal to 0 0164 m1 3 s for the experimental test case according to the suggestion provided by the literature for the real flood event we have set the strickler coefficient equal to 25 m1 3 s and 15 m1 3 s for the river bed and urban area respectively two simulations refer to the application of the swe and zi models using the most refined grid the other two simulations refer to the application of the pm using both a fine and a coarse grid the four computational grids used here are shown in fig 4 in particular the most refined grid g 1 fig 4a consists of 58 712 elements having a mean area approximately equal to 57 m2 the grid is more refined in the area covered by the main channels of the two rivers resulting in a mean element area around 30 m2 and inside the urbanized districts in which the grid resolution ranges from 20 m2 neighborhood 1 in fig 2 to 40 m2 port or street 1 and 2 in fig 2 this grid has been used essentially due to the approach used for the representation of the buildings within the swe and zi models for which interior solid wall boundary conditions have been set in order to describe the flow motion among the buildings themselves therefore the small size of the elements is a consequence of the irregular contours of the buildings footprints and the alleys that characterize the studied areas the application of the pm is meaningful in those cases for which there is the need to reduce the number of the computational elements especially for reasons of computational times and machine memory limitations in order to evaluate the model performances also as a function of the grid resolution two computational domains have been set by the progressive removal of grid points from the previous grid this process has been applied only to the areas external to the river in order to favor the comparison between the swe model and pm in the areas outside the river itself for which the application of pm is meaningful so a gradual reduction of grid points density moving from the smaller computational elements river to those external to the river itself has been carried out to avoid grid quality problems i e significant variations of adjacent elements area see also costabile and macchione 2015 for this reason the out of bank areas close to the river have a nodal density greater than those far from the river itself the two reduced grids are shown in fig 4b and c the first one g 2 fig 4b is composed of about 20 000 elements with a mean element area approximately equal to 170 m2 the mean area of the computational elements ranges from 90 m2 in areas close to the esaro river neighborhood 1 and road 1 to 1000 m2 for the farthest ones port the last grid g 3 fig 4c is the coarsest one and is composed of about 13 000 elements with a mean element area approximately equal to 250 m2 the mean area of the computational elements ranges from 8000 m2 in areas close to the esaro river neighborhood 1 and road 1 to 12000 m2 for the farthest ones port the coarsening applied to the g 2 and g 3 grids may be further appreciated in fig 4d which shows the significant reduction of the number of cells having area lower than 100 m2 in respect to the g 1 grid 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of the experimental test attention has been focused on a couple of issues 1 behavior of the hydrodynamic variables water depth and velocity 2 potential effects on hazard vulnerability assessment the maximum extents of flood areas simulated by the three models are not shown here because they are very similar to each other due to topographic constraints that limit the lateral expansion of the flow therefore the comparison is not particular meaningful in this case 4 1 1 behavior of the hydrodynamic variables and flow regimes water depth and velocity the results shown in fig 5 refer to the temporal behavior of the water depths simulated by the three models using the hydrograph depicted in fig 1b as the upstream boundary condition the gauges p3 and p4 are located just upstream of the urban district and consequently they are involved in the backwater effect induced by the interaction between the flood front and idealized buildings this effect clearly is more important in p4 than in p3 because the first one is located just above the block while the second one is in the middle of two rows of blocks see fig 1a due to rapid increase of the water depths the swe is expected to provide the best simulations of the experimental data in those locations as shown in fig 5a b the pm results are less accurate than the swe ones because the presence of the urban district is taken into account only indirectly by the porosity coefficients but they somewhat show the tendency to reproduce approximately the phenomenon due to the shock capturing properties of the model the pm gives better predictions than the zi ones because these latter fail to reproduce the sudden increase of the water levels providing a poor simulation due to the absence of the inertial terms focusing the attention inside the urban district the differences among the models tend to reduce as highlighted for example by the depth hydrographs obtained in the location of the p6 p7 p8 and p9 gauges the zi predictions confirm a slight tendency in the underestimation of the results while the pm results are close to the swe ones the underestimation of the experimental data observed in p8 has been already observed by other authors see for example soares frazão et al 2008 kim et al 2014 it could be induced in part by the density of elements in that area since another simulation carried out using a more refined grid not shown here highlighted a better agreement downstream from the idealized urban district in the area close to the p10 gauge the swe seems to outperform the simplified models since it captures better the peak value and it does not work worse than the other models afterwards this time the zi results show an overestimation of the observed results while the pm underestimates the experimental water depths it may be important to underline that all three models predict faster wetting at all probes than the experimental data confirming what has been already observed in previous studies using pm and swe approaches soares frazão et al 2008 kim et al 2014 finally it is important to briefly discuss the differences among the velocities simulated by the three models even though no experimental data are available fig 6 highlights that generally the swe provides higher velocities and more steep fronts than the other two models in few locations the simplified models results are in reasonable good agreement with the swe ones see fig 6f and fig 6a for the zi and pm respectively but in several cases flow velocities simulated by the pm see fig 6c e f h and the zi 6b c d g h are significantly lower than swe ones 4 1 2 potential effects on hazard and vulnerability assessment it is interesting now to evaluate the potential effects that the differences among the hydrodynamic variables simulated by the three models could have in terms of hazard and vulnerability assessment though the analysis we are discussing refers to idealized urban districts we will show later on in this work that some conclusions obtained from this experimental test are valid also for the real world inundation event that will be discussed in the next section in particular we consider the product between the magnitude of the velocity vector v u 2 v 2 0 5 and water depth h as a hydrodynamic variable supporting hazard vulnerability assessments the temporal profiles of this product computed in the same gauge locations considered above are shown in fig 7 in the position of the p3 gauge the zi results are significantly lower than the swe and the pm ones the hv values simulated by the pm are lower than the swe accordingly to what has been already observed in the analysis of the water depths however this is not the case in the position of the p4 gauge in which the pm values are greater than those computed by the swe at least for the peak value inside the urban district the situation highlighted in the position of gauges p6 and p9 is substantially equivalent to what has been already observed for the gauge p3 on the contrary looking at the position of gauge p8 the pm predicts values significantly lower than those simulated using the swe and zi despite the slight differences observed in terms of water depths values downstream of the blocks the pm results highlight a significant underestimation of hv values in respect to the other two simulations while the zi provides values lower than the swe ones despite the higher values simulated for the water depths the percentage differences between simplified models and the swe are shown in table 1 in particular regarding the pm the hv values are relatively small only in three locations p3 p4 and p6 while significant underestimations in respect to the swe ones have been computed elsewhere with discrepancies greater than 50 in four locations and maximum differences up to 70 in p7 and p8 a similar observation can be made for the zi except for the p8 location in which the difference is small 10 the underestimation of hv values are greater than 50 in four locations and a maximum difference up to 80 in p9 finally it is interesting to discuss the behavior of the variable hv simulated by three models along some longitudinal 1 1 and 2 2 and cross sections 3 3 and 4 4 inside the urban district represented in fig 8 a along the sections 1 1 and 2 2 it may be observed that all the models describe the downstream effects induced by the interaction between the blocks and flow front however the transversal variation assumed by hv as simulated by the swe is reproduced only in part by the zi which provides a smoother profile while the behavior of the pm results is even worse along the longitudinal sections 3 and 4 the swe simulates a quite progressive decreasing behavior of hv while the zi provides an unrealistic swaying for that variable probably due to the poor hydraulic description of the phenomenon within the urban area the pm results underestimate significantly the values of hv along the sections 4 2 flood hazard assessment for the case of the 1996 inundation in the city of crotone this section is devoted to the analysis of the results of the models considering the real world inundation event that interested the city of crotone described in section 3 the analysis performed here is essentially organized in two steps in the first one attention is focused on the comparison between results of the models and the available observed data related essentially to water levels in the river and in the adjacent areas where urban districts are located in the second one we provide some numerical elaborations aimed at the evaluation of the differences in terms of flood hazard vulnerability assessment inside the city of crotone according to the simulations results obtained using the three models considered in this work prior to focusing attention on the issues cited above it is important to provide some considerations about the extent of the flooded areas simulated by the different models fig 9 represents the flooded areas obtained by the four simulations described in section 3 2 at first sight the simulations predict a comparable extent of the inundated areas in particular the zi model gives a slight underestimation 15 in respect of the swe model while the pm model predictions are substantially similar to the swe one even though a tendency to overestimate the result can be observed when moving from a fine grid 2 to a coarse grid 8 however the distribution of the water depths within the flooded areas highlighted by the contour levels maps shown in fig 9 seems to be affected by significant differences that in turn may induce one to argue that also the simulated velocity fields can be different the comparative analysis of model performances in term of water depths and velocities will be discussed in the next sections 4 2 1 comparison between model results and observed data the first analysis presented here refers to the model performances in the main channel of the esaro river near to bridge 1 and upstream of bridge 2 fig 10 a represents the comparison between the estimated water levels in specific instants of times represented by the green circles and the simulations provided by the swe and zi models obviously the pm model has no meaning here since we are discussing a situation located in the main river for which a porosity cell has no sense the temporal evolution simulated by the swe model shows some discontinuities due to the sequence of the span bridge opening used for the representation of the unblocking phenomenon more specifically we have modeled the bridge obstruction considering some cells as internal solid wall boundary conditions then we have progressively removed over time this setting turning the status of those cells from a solid wall boundary condition to a common computational cells so the sudden rising lowering of the water levels can be explained by a sudden decrease increase of the available cross section area for further details see macchione et al 2019b the zi model is less sensitive to this sudden changing but the overall behavior can be considered as comparable to that simulated by the swe model providing the same peak value and time to peak even though the lowering dynamics deduced from the video analysis is correctly reproduced only by the swe a second significant piece of information related to flow levels in the esaro river regards the maximum water level estimated in a cross section located near bridge 2 which according to the reconstruction based on the video analyses is approximately equal to 8 m bridge 2 crosses the esaro river just upstream of street 1 150 m upstream of the confluence between the esaro river and the lamps papaniciaro stream fig 10b shows the comparison between the models results and the estimated water level depicted by a green dotted line though the water levels simulated by the swe model show a greater transversal variability than that simulated by the zi model the two results can be considered comparable also in this case both the models have provided a good result since the simulated water levels are practically superimposed on the observed one the comparison between the simulated water levels and the estimated ones for both the locations shown here highlights a substantial similar good performance provided by the swe and zi models according to these results the dynamics of the flood propagation in the esaro river has been similarly simulated by the two models at least upstream of the considered bridges since no particular difference has been observed in two points located at the beginning and in the middle of the computational domain the attention now is devoted to the results obtained by all the models outside the river banks and in particular inside the urban areas in order to understand if the previous conclusion can be extended also to the adjacent areas of the main river figs 11 a and 12a highlight the points for which water levels estimations are available re arranged in pre fixed ranges we have grouped these areas in five main zones according to their locations within the domain that are listed hereafter as follows zone 1 railway station red circles in fig 11a upstream of the confluence between the esaro river and the lamps papaniciaro stream on the left zone 2 road 1 cyan circles in fig 11a located downstream of the confluence on the left zone 3 neighborhood 1 green circles in fig 11a located downstream of the confluence on the right zone 4 streets 1 and 2 orange circles in fig 12 a located on the right of the esaro river moving to the downtown zone 5 port purple circles in fig 12a on the right of the esaro river close to the sea for each zone we have provided graphs reported in figs 11 and 12 in which we have represented the simulated versus observed water levels in which the latter ones are represented by ranges of values and not by a specific value moreover for each graph we have highlighted the line of perfect agreement by a black dotted line the simulations refer not only to the swe and zi models but also to the application of the porosity model pm using both the coarse grid pmcg and a finer grid pmfg highlighted in fig 4 though the models performances can be appreciated looking at the figs 11 and 12 from which the mean error could be roughly perceived we have preferred also to provide information related to the mean absolute errors reported in table 2 in particular the quantification of the errors between the generic model m where m stands for swe zi pmfg or pmcg predictions and observed data has been computed for each zone i according to the eq 18 18 e m i j 1 n i h m j i h o j i h o j i n i in which ni is the number of the observed points in the i th zone while hm j i and ho j i are respectively the water depths computed by the model m and observed in the j th point of the i th zone specifically ho j i is the mean value of the observed range of values finally a global assessment of model performances has been carried out computing the weighted mean value of the absolute errors e m g considering the number of the observed values for each zone the models results are quite different the analysis of the error e m g highlights that the best result has been obtained by swe followed by pmfg pmcg and zi this ranking is generally confirmed by the e m i values for each zone swe performs better than the other models except for the zone 4 for which the pmfg and pmcg provided comparable results among the simplified models zi performs worse than the pm models except for the zone 5 and zone 3 for which the results are similar and for the zone 2 in which it provides errors in the middle of pmfg and pmcg the ranking of the models performances discussed so far can be further appreciated in figs 11 and 12 looking at the discrepancies in respect to the line of perfect agreement a visual comparative analysis of the results shown in fig 11 highlights that the swe model has provided the best performances in all the three considered zones the pmfg model results are in good agreement with the observations only for zone 2 fig 11f while the simulations are not particularly satisfying in the remaining two zones resulting in a tendency to overestimate fig 11g and underestimate fig 11e the estimated water levels the use of a coarse grid has led to a deterioration of the quality of the predicted results obtained using the pm model in particular fig 11j highlights the worsening in the prediction of the simulated water levels in respect to the pmfg results showing a slight tendency to underestimate the observed values for the other two zones the simulations are more or less comparable even though the pmcg results show the tendency to predict lower values than those obtained by the pmfg model especially for zone 3 fig 11j the zi model seems to provide an overall poor prediction of the observed values in particular there is a general underestimation of the results in the zones 2 and 3 fig 11l and m focusing attention on the two zones on the right closer than the previous ones to the downtown of the city of crotone the previous observations still holds the swe model has again provided the best results making a satisfactory prediction for the water level inside zone 4 see fig 12b even though there are three points for which it has predicted significant higher values than the estimated ones for zone 5 see fig 12c the pm model relative to the finer grid has provided substantially similar results to the swe model for zone 4 fig 12d but drastically underestimated the observed water levels in zone 5 fig 12e using the coarse grid the results simulated by the pm model are approximately similar to those obtained using the fine grid even though the underestimation highlighted for the pmfg result for zone 5 is more pronounced fig 12g finally the zi seems to provide poor predictions increasing the underestimations of the observed water levels in zone 4 fig 12h while the simulated water levels show some significant overestimations of the observed values in zone 5 fig 12i 4 2 2 flood hazard assessment according to models simulations this section is devoted to the analysis of models results in terms of flood hazard assessment in particular attention here is first focused on the areas shown in fig 3 where significant hazard conditions have been arisen as highlighted by consequences represented in the pictures our interest does not only lie in the maximum values assumed by water depths and velocities as simulated by the models but also the arrival time the rapidity of rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs and the persistence over time that a specific hazard condition may generate for this reason we focus on the whole hydrographs obtained by the models in terms of water depths and velocities in each area shown in fig 3 as regards the location 1 near the railway station the water depth profile simulated by the zi model is substantially similar to that provided by the swe model at least for the initial part of the hydrograph even though a not negligible overestimation can be observed later fig 13 a on the contrary the velocity profile simulated by the zi significantly underestimates the swe one for the whole duration of the event fig 13b the pm results are lower than the swe ones in terms of both the water depth and velocity profiles fig 13a b the nodal grid density between g 2 and g 3 is not so different in this area and for this reason the pmfg and pmcg simulations are quite similar in the location number 2 that belongs to road 1 the zi model confirms the previous behavior in terms of water depth profiles while the pm model results are practically superimposed on the swe ones also due to a very limited difference in terms of computational grids fig 13c this area in particular is very close to the river so it is not possible to provide significant variations of the grid element size however the temporal variation of the velocity highlights a significant difference among the models fig 13d the pmcg and zi predictions are very similar together but both provide a remarkable underestimation of the velocity profile simulated by the swe model the pmfg gives a better prediction than the previous two simulations but in any case its values are lower than the swe ones as regards locations numbers 3 and 4 both falling in the neighborhood 1 the water depth profile simulated by the zi significantly underestimates the swe ones showing also a slower arrival time of the front flow fig 13e and g moreover in fig 13e the overall behavior seems to be different showing a lower increase of the rising limb of the hydrograph and a very low variation of the water levels after the peak value in respect of the other simulations the pm results are significantly influenced by the computational grid used in particular the water depths simulated using the g2 grid pmfg are very close to the swe ones fig 13e and g also because the nodal density in this area is not particularly different from the g1 one used for swe model the use of the g3 grid significantly deteriorates the simulation in respect to the swe model resulting closer to the zi ones except for the front arrival time that is better described due to presence of the inertial terms in the momentum equations the analysis of the simulated flow velocity confirms what has been observed for the water depths highlighting even more pronounced differences fig 13f and h the locations number 5 and 6 fall in an area located in the middle between the neighborhood 1 and street 1 the zi model still continues not only to underperform for the water levels computed by the swe model fig 13i and k but also it predicts very low values of flow velocity in respect to the other simulations fig 13j and l giving a significant delay in terms of front arrival times also in these cases the computational grid plays an important role in the performances of the pm showing important discrepancies in respect to the swe results as moving from the g2 grid to the g3 one in particular the underestimation of the water level given by the pmcg is more important than that provided by the zi one fig 13k despite the flow velocities being similar to the swe ones fig 13j a similar observation can be made looking at the pmfg results since they might provide similar water levels fig 13k but significant lower values of flow velocity than the swe ones fig 13l this behavior confirms what has been already observed in the analysis of model performances related to the simulation of the experimental test section 4 1 different models could provide similar water depths values inside the domain but at the same time different values of velocity or vice versa and therefore different estimation of hazards within the flooded areas finally the location number 7 belongs to street 1 in this area the g2 and g3 grids are significantly coarser than the g1 one and therefore the application of the pm model is more meaningful here than in areas very close to the river in particular fig 13m highlights that the water levels simulated by the pmfg are not in close agreement to the swe ones as generally occurred in the previous locations moreover the velocity profile predicted by the pmfg model is very far from the swe resulting in a significant underestimation similar to that performed by the zi model 13n the zi model results confirm the previous observations regarding the lower values of both water levels and velocity in respects of the swe ones the hydrographs shown in fig 13 represent a further confirmation of what has been already deduced by the analysis of figs 11 and 12 related to the comparison with estimated maximum values in particular it seems that despite similar predictions of the inundated area extent significant local underestimations of the hydrodynamic values have been simulated by the zi and pm approaches in order to characterize the differences among the models throughout the domain the percentage variations between the zi pmfg and pmcg results and the swe ones used as benchmark have been computed in particular introducing the variables hi t vi t and hivi t that represent respectively the temporal evolution of the water depths h the module of velocity v and the product between v and h computed by the numerical models three parameters have been computed for each computational cells i δ h i max h i t m max h i t swe max h i t swe δ v i max v i t m max v i t swe max v i t swe δ h v i max hv i t m max hv i t swe max hv i t swe in which δ h i δ v i δ hv i represents the percent variations between the maximum water depth velocity or product between velocity and water depth value computed in the cell i by the model m where m stands again for the zi pmfg or pmcg and the homologous relative to the swe simulation regarding the results relative to pmfg and pmcg it should be recalled that they refer to the g 2 and g 3 grids that are coarser than the g 1 grid used for the swe model in order to provide a suitable comparison between the results relative to models running on different grids we have interpolated the hydrodynamic variables computed in the cells centroid of the coarser grid onto the g 1 grid points the values obtained for δ h i δ v i δ hv i have been grouped in 5 classes in order to have a quick comprehension of the results in particular four classes have been identified to highlight two different levels for both the underestimation and overestimation computed by a generic model m in respect to the swe model while another class has been used to identify a substantial similarity of the models results specifically when the percent variations range between 0 2 and 0 2 we have considered as comparable the result obtained by the generic model m in respect to the swe model otherwise large and significant underestimation overestimation have been detected assuming respectively the following ranges 0 6 greater than0 6 and 0 6 0 2 0 2 0 6 fig 14 shows the percent variations maps obtained for each couple of models pmfg swe pmcg swe zi swe the results show important variations in respect of the swe ones fig 14 especially in the simulation of the maximum velocity and the product hv considering the model simulations as a whole among the considered variables the water depths seem to be the most comparable ones since limited differences δ h have been obtained for large areas of the computational domain especially in the nw part however important variations exist especially near the confluence on the right of the esaro river moving to street 1 and the port these considerations hold for all the models even though some local variations can be observed in the fig 14a b c first of all the decrease of grid resolution affects the results obtained by the pm model increasing the differences in respect to the swe simulations this is evident for example looking at the areas adjacent to the esaro river on the right see for example the neighborhood 1 in which we turn from a comparable simulation to a significant underestimation of the results only by changing the grid resolution g 3 instead of g 2 and consequently the porosity coefficients as regards the zi simulations relative to the same grid used for the swe model the δ h values detect large or significant underestimation of the water depths practically in all the areas located to the right of the esaro river except some limited parts in the eastern zones of the domain fig 14c the analysis of the variations related to the other two variables v and hv are less immediate the zi results shown in fig 14f and i highlight a general large underestimation of both v and hv values except for the most upstream part of the domain the δ v and δ hv values obtained using the pm results are very far from the range identifying comparable results alternating areas in which large underestimation and overestimation occur fig 14d e g h in order to have a rough idea of the overall behavior of model simulation we focus attention on the five zones already discussed in section 4 2 1 in particular we have considered the groups of cells belonging to the areas depicted in fig 15 and for each group we have computed the percentage of cells for which the δ h δ v and δ hv values fall in the range identifying comparable results these results are reported in table 3 which permits a better clarification of what has been previously observed in the analysis of fig 14 in particular the overall results highlight that all the models give low percentages of comparable values only in few cases are the percentages greater than 50 and they refer essentially to the water depths values as regards velocities the percentage of cells for which comparable values are simulated is generally significantly lower than those relative to water depths and this situation is even worse when looking at the hv values the zi results show greater discrepancies than the pm models in respect to the swe ones in particular in zones 3 and 4 the results are completely different considering all the hydrodynamic variables h v and hv in the other three zones there is a significant discrepancy between the prediction in terms of water depths and velocities specifically the percentage of cells for which comparable values have been simulated in terms of water depths is much greater than the homologous one related to velocities this fact highlights the negative consequence associated to the use of the approximated formulation of the momentum equations that lead to a rough computation of flow velocity the discrepancy between the simulations in terms of water depths and velocities though sometimes less pronounced is also shown by the pm models results especially for the pmfg simulation among the considered hydrodynamic variables the worst results in terms of percentage of cells in which the simplified models provided results comparable to the swe ones is related to hv values this consideration holds for each model analyzed in this work the results shown in fig 14 are useful in order to give extensive information about the differences among the model simulations in terms of the variables commonly used for flood hazard assessment independently from the specific criteria used for its evaluation we think that this is important because the use of different methods can lead to different conclusions when mapping hazard vulnerability classification see for example russo et al 2013 moreover the research on this field is rapidly moving on developing more and more sophisticated criteria to be used for hazard classifications according to people vehicles and buildings however it should be interesting to discuss now the potential practical consequences that could be associated to the use of simplified models when using a specific criterion for flood hazard assessment in terms of different classes of hazard vulnerability as recalled in the introduction there are several methods available in the literature to that purpose as an example in this work we refer to criteria proposed by smith et al 2014 and recommended by aidr 2017 it has been also discussed and compared to other methods in a recent review on vehicles stability during floods bocanegra et al 2019 we have chosen this approach essentially due to its simplicity and because it takes into account the main targets exposed to flood risk once again attention is focused on the five zones represented in fig 15 the reasoning followed here is structured in two steps in the first one we have performed for each model the hazard classification as reported in fig 16 so for each cell we have a specific classification ranging from h1 to h6 next we have compared the classifications made for each cell considering the results obtained using simplified models in respect to the evaluations performed using the swe results this comparison has been organized in order 1 to compute the percentage of cells for which we have the same classification 2 to evaluate the percentage of cells for which we have an underestimation or an overestimation of hazard classification in respect to swe evaluations and 3 to detect how many hazard classes have been overestimated or underestimated a synthetic representation of this kind of comparative analysis has been reported in fig 17 in which bar plots of the results are depicted looking at zone 1 railway station fig 17a b we have obtained the same classification for a percentage of cells up to 60 70 while the class underestimations or overestimations are substantially equally distributed resulting in no more than 20 25 each fig 17a and mainly limited to a leap of only one class fig 17b these considerations are also valid for zone 2 road 1 for which the classification made according the pm simulations is in good agreement with the swe one instead the classification performed according to the zi results has led to a significant percentage of cells about 40 for which the hazard class has been underestimated fig 17c not only of one class but also of two or more classes fig 17d the effect of grid resolution on the pm is particularly important in zone 3 neighborhood 1 in this area the percentage of cells for which the same classification has been estimated by the pmcg results in respect to the swe is significantly lower that the pmfg ones resulting in a high percentage of cells in which the hazard class is underestimated fig 17e even by two or more classes fig 17f the zi model results give the worst results since the class is underestimated in the large majority of cells up to 70 with differences that are very often equal to or greater than leaps of two classes fig 17f in the last two zones the pm and zi models completely fail to reproduce the same classification performed by the swe results in particular in zone 4 streets 1 and 2 all the models results provided high percentages of cells for which the hazard class has been underestimated fig 17g ranging from 50 to 90 respectively for the pmcg and zi the number of cells for which the class underestimation is equal to or greater than 2 is significant as well fig 17h these same considerations can be applied to the analysis of zone 5 port for which the classification performed by the pm results are even poorer than those relative to zone 4 fig 17i and the hazard class is very often underestimated by more than 2 classes fig 17j 5 discussion and conclusion the numerical models aimed at the simulation of the hydraulic features of urban floods events may be grouped into three families fully dynamic models based on the swe approaches based on different physical simplification of the swe and methods based on the indirect representation of buildings using the porosity techniques in the literature several papers deal with the benchmarking of these kinds of models a careful analysis of the state of the art has highlighted that such a comparison is very often carried out with reference to the flooded areas extent only sometimes analyzing also the simulated water depths values and quite rarely evaluating the computed velocities however from a practical point of view simulation models are advanced tools for flood hazard and vulnerability assessments therefore in this paper the performances of the models mentioned above have been evaluated considering them not only with reference to the hydrodynamic variables water depths and velocities but also focusing the attention on the variable hv and to the consequences associated to their different estimations on the vulnerability assessment for this reason attention here has been firstly focused on a well known experimental test concerning a flash flood in an idealized urban district this test has been used here not so much as to provide one more validation and or comparative analysis among the model simulations and experimental data as usually happens in the literature but because it has allowed us to introduce one of the main findings of this work different models could provide similar inundated areas but different water depths values inside the domain and furthermore similar simulated water depths values may be associated to different estimation of hazards and vulnerability within the flooded areas the results obtained for the flood inundation of an idealized district highlighted that no particular differences exist among the models predictions in terms of flooded areas extent the observed hydraulic behavior of the flow is correctly reproduced only by the swe model and in a less accurate way by the pm in which no simplifications have been introduced in the momentum equations the indirect representation of the idealized buildings did not allow the model to faithfully reproduce the observed local evolution of the water depths and velocities in particular the distribution of the velocities is more uniform than those provided by the swe model this leads to a significant underestimation of flow velocities that in turn affects the estimation of hv values the zi model has not been able to provide a suitable representation of the local effects induced by the interactions between the flood flow and idealized buildings due to the intrinsic limitations represented by the absence of the inertial terms these considerations obviously require further insights and understandings that only the analysis of a real flood event can provide the inundation in the actual urban area considered here has been selected not only to increase the number of case study available in the literature for the benchmarking of 2d models but in such a way as to provide an event that has specific features not analyzed yet in particular it should be underlined that the complexity of the case studies simulated in the literature is very often not so high dealing with quite progressive slow varying discharge hydrograph without further complexity during the evolution of the event downstream for example it would be interesting to analyze a flood inundation process strongly induced by the interaction of flow and an obstructed bridge representing the main reason causing the sudden increase of the water levels and therefore the out of banks flow in situations like these that are not infrequent during a real world flood event the hydrodynamic process is much more complex and no paper in the literature shows a benchmarking study to evaluate the capability of different complexity models to provide effective and reliable simulations of the flow inundation an example of this kind of inundation occurred in the city of crotone in 1996 the analysis of the results has highlighted that the extent of the flooded areas are not equal despite the variations between the simplified models and swe model being not so important as for the channel flow the water levels computed by the zi model are similar to those provided by the swe one even though the zi model is not able to simulate the sudden temporal variations of the water levels induced by the clogging unclogging process of the bridges as for the urban areas the swe has provided the best prediction when comparing observed and simulated water depths the other two models provide a greater dispersion around the perfect agreement lines showing the tendency to underestimate the observed values the dispersion observed for the zi model could be explained by its intrinsic inability in the simulation of local phenomena as for the idealized urban district test case as for the pm the tendency to underestimate the observed values could be explained by the fact that local effects induced by the interaction between flow and buildings cannot be accurately simulated by the porosity coefficient as a proof of this the predictions become poorer as the grid size increase the analysis of water depths and velocities hydrographs in areas for which significant hazards have been observed confirms what has previously stated for the maximum water depths values in some points the zi model has provided significant underestimation of the water depths and velocities the pm results becomes very different from the swe ones as the grid size increases moreover it has been observed that in some locations the swe and pm results are similar in terms of water depths values but very different when comparing the flow velocities confirming what has been previously highlighted for the idealized urban districts test case the differences observed in terms of the hydrodynamic variables h and v become higher when attention is focused on the variable hv specifically it has been shown that these discrepancies lead to wrong estimations of hazard vulnerability classifications with reference to people vehicles and buildings in particular the use of simplified models could lead to significant variations when one has to determine the vulnerability class therefore according to the results shown in this work it seems that fully dynamic modeling should be the unavoidable reference tool when the goal of the urban flood inundation mapping activity is not limited to the evaluation of flood prone areas extent but involves also the local estimation of flood hazard vulnerability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6006,infiltration and drainage are complex hydrological considerations to determine unsaturated flow processes in case of irrigation root growth and pollutant transport in porous media consisting of multi layered soils considering sports fields this affects the quality of sports organization in terms of player s health the participation of spectators and the cancellation of games this study investigated the drainage behavior of sports fields both experimentally and numerically under simulated rainfall to achieve this goal a newly developed experimental setup which consists of a rainfall simulator rs that is able to simulate the natural rainfall and a drainage tank dt that is able to pack stratified drainage layers same as in the sports fields were used experimental rainfall hyetographs were designed to simulate various rainfall conditions for the relevant region in istanbul turkey numerous experiments were conducted to investigate hydrological description of unsaturated flow by using packed drainage layers in the laboratory time dependent water contents were also monitored using soil moisture sensors 10 hs decagon devices at different depths in the drainage layers soil water retention curve swrc of each drainage layer obtained from calibration tests and empirical parameters α n were optimized with hydrus 3d model by using water contents and suction pressure results observed drain outflow hydrographs were compared with simulated drain outflow hydrographs by using statistical indices of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index kling and gupta efficiency kge

respectively in the present study experimental and numerical investigation of the drainage mechanisms for sports fields was evaluated by considering unsaturated flow characteristics through the different drainage layers keywords drainage sports field hydrus rainfall simulator hydrograph nash sutcliffe efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades the effects of global warming have brought changes to many hydrological phenomena such as the rainfall runoff relationship stormwater and urban drainage one of the most affected phenomena is the drainage of sports fields sports fields are significant places that bring thousands of people together as part of social and sports activities many sports events globally have been canceled due to insufficient drainage because water could not drain quickly enough from the field surfaces when brief high intensity rainfall interrupted events the drainage of sports fields is quite different from the other land and urban drainage systems because the quality of the root zone has to be protected and drainage gutters cannot be placed on sports fields to capture the runoff the main objective of this study was to develop a methodology for mechanisms of sports field drainage that can remove excess rainfall from the surface of the field as quickly as possible and monitor the unsaturated flow characteristics through the drainage layers also the effects of intense rainfalls were investigated by considering design storms of different rainfall intensities both experimentally and numerically to evaluate the processes of sports field drainage a rainfall simulator rs is an ideal tool to simulate natural rainfall storm characteristics rss have been used for many years in agricultural environmental and hydrological studies to understand the mechanisms of runoff soil erosion soil crusting infiltration and drainage of soils the main purpose of the rs is to simulate the characteristics of natural rainfall its performance is characterized by several criteria that require spatial uniformity christiansen 1942 laws and parsons 1943 raindrop diameter of natural rainfall bubenzer 1979 and reproducible storm patterns in terms of intensity and duration moore et al 1983 in this study raindrop diameters were determined by using the flour pellet method which was first used by bentley 1904 to determine the drop size distribution of rainfall in washington d c usa therefore in the literature some researchers gave empirical formulas to find the raindrop diameters such as van dijk et al 2002 as given in eq 1 1 d 50 α r β where r is the rainfall intensity in mm h 1 and d 50 is the median diameter of raindrops in mm the range of parameters was given as 0 8 α 1 28 and 0 123 β 0 292 which represent the upper and lower boundary respectively the most commonly used technique to determine the spatial uniformity uses the coefficient of uniformity cu which was defined by christiansen 1942 as follows 2 cu 1 1 n x i 1 n x i x 100 where x i is the rainfall depth at location i x is the average rainfall depth and n is the number of points at which rain gauges are located on the drainage tank to collect rainfall adams 1986 stated that sports fields drainage is completely different from agricultural drainage it requires that incident rainfall be transmitted to drainage pipes for maintaining a proper and playable field surface the study showed that complete profile reconstruction which consists of a root zone for turfgrass blinding layer sandwich layer and permeable bed with gravel is the most comprehensive approach for high quality sports fields although it is one of the most expensive designs he also focused on the content of the root zone mixture and the grain sizes used in the blinding and gravel layers in terms of practical aspects of sports field drainage therefore the drainage of sports fields has not been comprehensively investigated in the literature and designs have been based on experience considering imprecise science fleming et al 2016 the hydraulic performance of the drainage of the sports fields has not been determined in terms of hydrological perspectives fleming et al 2016 investigated the drainage behavior of sports fields using field observations and mathematical modeling they reported that field observations from the sports fields were not reliable and predictable when comparing measured and estimated drain outflows moreover their study also showed that porous field designs provided high attenuation of the peak rainfall of the drain outflow hydrograph when considering rainfalls for varying periods between 2011 and 2014 fleming et al 2016 did not consider the unsaturated flow characteristic of the drainage layers in addition their mathematical model was not sufficiently comprehensive to simulate the hydraulic behavior of drainage layers determining the hydraulic behavior of materials used in multilayered soils of sports fields is crucial to properly model the unsaturated flow these soils generally have heterogeneities through the profile sakellariou makrantonaki 1997 investigated water drainage in layered soils experimentally and numerically soil water content and pressure were measured in a vertical column and the results were compared with the numerical solutions from solving the richards equation with the finite difference method similarly alfnes et al 2004 stated that textured layers increased the water capacity of soils and reduced percolation with considering waste contaminant they investigated the mechanism of water flow and solute transport in the layered soils by conducting drainage experiments huang et al 2011 also investigated the drainage processes in the multi layered coarser soils they evaluated the hydraulic performance of natural soils by using hydrus 1d through 20 different textured layers they compared simulated and measured soil water content profiles and drained water volumes during infiltration and drainage phases their study showed that heterogeneous soil profile could store more water when compared to more homogeneous soils under the same drainage conditions taylor et al 1997 studied water retention in the upper layer of the drainage profile root zone in the layered soils by considering sub root zone layering effects changing blinding layer and gravel layer their study showed the effect of the blinding layer on the water retention of the root zone therefore selecting root zone material is very crucial for both the root growth of turfgrass and drainage especially a sand dominated root zone is used due to its resistance to compaction and healthy drainage on the other hand it has some disadvantages because of the little holding capacity and not enough about storing plant nutrients a laboratory study by henderson et al 2001 demonstrated that sand dominated root zones containing 90 sand or more 10 silt and clay mix or less were appropriate in terms of acceptable drainage rates for sports fields considering firm footing adequate resiliency and resistance to tearing it is not appropriate to select 100 sand dominated root zones determining the optimum thickness of drainage layers plays an important role for holding enough water in the root zone and draining excessive rainfall without runoff on the field surface zhao et al 2014 studied the rainfall runoff process and soil moisture dynamics in multi layered soils of grassland plots under simulated rainfall they measured soil water content to investigate the response of water content to intense rainfall by using sensors placed at different depths the drainage of sports fields can be considered as a part of the urban drainage in addition the sports fields are specifically designed to prevent runoff and ponding water conditions on the play surface likewise sustainable urban drainage systems suds design principle is to provide sufficient storage drain outflow control to prevent runoff as stated in woods ballard et al 2015 there is actually no standard for runoff rate for the green field but preserving the quality of turfgrass and creating playable field surfaces corresponding to fifa fédération internationale de football association criteria no runoff no ponding condition is more applicable and preferable for sports fields it has considerably seen progress in the understanding of water flow in the unsaturated zone hydrus model which is commonly used in the literature was used to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media in many scientific fields hydrus model was successfully applied by considering unsaturated flow characteristics with solving the richards equation for instance hilten et al 2008 modeled stormwater runoff relation from green roofs using hydrus 1d ebrahimian and noory 2015 simulated subsurface drainage of paddy fields with hydrus 3d turco et al 2017 also investigated the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of permeable pavement with hydrus 2d they compared measured and modeled hydrographs with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index and determination coefficient they did not give sufficient details about simulated rainfall that is highly significant for hydrological relation between hyetograph and drain outflow hydrograph in the field of hydrology parameters of the hydrological model are not accurately measurable and therefore it is the fact that there is a deficiency for this condition besides hydrological model accuracy is generally performed by a few statistical indices in the literature the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling and gupta efficiency index kge that was developed by gupta et al 2009 were widely used to evaluate the model accuracy these descriptive statistics were estimated for the validation of the simulation capability of drain outflow results based on eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n y y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y and y i are the predicted and measured values for the dependent variable y y is the mean of the measured values and n sample size 4 kge 1 pc 1 2 cd rd 1 2 cm rm 1 2 where pc is the pearson coefficient cm and rm are the mean of the measured and predicted values cd and rd are the standard deviation of measured and predicted values respectively in the present study the hydrological analysis was performed by comparing drain outflow hydrographs corresponding to different rainfall hyetographs under the no runoff condition therefore for the conceptual model of the drainage system that demonstrates the relationship between hyetograph and drain hydrograph there are some key parameters that describe the behavior of the drainage system time of concentration the time from start of the rainfall to the point of the time of drain outflow starts and lag time the duration between peak rainfall intensity and peak drain outflow discharge moreover the drainage mechanism of sports fields was thoroughly evaluated by using the experimental setup that is able to create rainfall patterns for different return periods and durations drainage experiments were conducted by using different drainage layers under different hyetographs unsaturated flow parameters of the drainage layers were estimated by hydrus 3d from water contents and suction pressures measured during the experiments and swrc for each material was obtained measured and modeled drain outflow hydrographs were compared with statistical analysis using nse index kge index and determination coefficient r2 time dependent water content profiles were obtained from each drainage experiment the drain outflow hydrographs were also evaluated with peak discharge time of concentration and lag time 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of rainfall simulator an experimental setup was used to evaluate the drainage mechanism under various rainfall conditions by creating design hyetographs it also had the ability to simulate natural rainfall characteristics and to monitor drainage flow conditions through the layers fig 1 it had two components the rs which was composed of a downward oriented spraying nozzle system and the dt which included two identical 1 5 1 3 m compartments a programmable logic controller plc panel was placed in front of the experimental setup it controlled the motor and pump system by generating pulse signals with different precise periods fig 1b essentially the plc could control and change pressures ranging from 0 to 65 bar to pump at different flow rates and the rs produced a wide range of rainfall intensities by the means of the plc further details for the experimental setup can be found in kesgin et al 2018 in addition the system mentioned by kesgin et al 2018 was improved by using two different nozzles a new nozzle system lnn and gg w nozzles manufactured by spraying systems was created to spray with a wider range of rainfall intensities compared with the single nozzle system developed by kesgin et al 2018 two different nozzles were connected with solenoid vanes controlled by the plc system fig 2 according to different flow rates the plc chooses an appropriate nozzle for the corresponding rainfall intensity while the lnn nozzle was used for producing a smaller rainfall intensity r 26 m m h 1 the gg w nozzle produced larger rainfall intensities 266 6 m m h 1 r 26 m m h 1 the operating time interval for each nozzle during the experiment was defined for the range of rainfall intensities with the changing values of the inlet and outlet pressures 2 2 experimental hyetographs in the hydrological design of drainage systems the time dependent flow rates are in general not available therefore only peak values of flow rates or rainfall intensities are considered chow et al 1988 mentioned that design methods have been developed recently with unsteady flow analysis which makes it possible to create a more predictable design hyetograph in this study a design hyetograph was determined using the records of a meteorological station near sports fields in istanbul turkey there are two ways to obtain design hyetographs from intensity duration frequency idf curves the alternating block ab method and the instantaneous intensity ii method chow et al 1988 in this study hyetographs were designed using the ab method because it is simpler and easier to apply compared with the ii method the production details of obtaining experimental hyetographs by the ab method can be found in kesgin et al 2018 the experimental hyetographs were developed based on 100 year return periods t rainfall intensities for 10 20 and 30 min time intervals and 120 min of total storm duration according to the selected time intervals rainfall intensities were determined from the idf curves as can be seen in fig 3 obtained from the relevant meteorological station in istanbul turkey dogan et al 2018 2 3 model description of the drainage process hydrus model šimůnek et al 2006 was used to simulate drainage of soil in the multi layers of the sports fields it is commonly used in the literature to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media the governing equation is given by the following form of the richard s equation 5 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is the pressure head l x i i 1 2 are the spatial coordinates l t is time t k ij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 s is the sink term t 1 that was assumed to be zero in this study hydrus 3d model uses the soil hydraulic functions proposed by van genuchten 1980 who used the statistical pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 they described the soil water retention curve function θ h and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h respectively 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 7 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 8 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 9 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s denotes the residual and saturated water content l 3 l 3 respectively s e is the effective water content l 3 l 3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 α l 1 n m are the parameters of the van genuchen model these empirical parameters are dependent on soil types that are considered to affect the shape of hydraulic functions mualem 1976 determined the l as the pore connectivity that was to be about 0 5 for an average for many soils the pore size distribution index n which is the steepness of the soil water retention curve and α is the inverse of air entry bubbling pressure that it takes greater values for coarser soils gravel and coarser sand 2 4 material properties three different materials fine sand medium sand and gravel were used in the drainage experiments the unsaturated flow parameters α n used to simulate water flow in hydrus 3d were determined from calibration tests by measuring water content and suction pressure through the drainage layer bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity field capacity porosity and the specific gravity of the materials were also determined separately in the construction materials and hydraulics laboratories at yıldız technical university ytu the empirical parameters α n l directly influence the shape of the hydraulic functions when the parameter n is the steepness of the soil water retention curve swrc α takes higher values for coarser materials therefore these parameters were optimized with hydrus 3d using measurements of water content and suction pressure during the calibration tests after determining the most suitable swrcs for each drainage layer they were used in simulations of the drainage experiments with hydrus 3d 2 5 experimental methodology in the present study a new methodology was developed that includes creating rainfall patterns with design hyetographs and investigating different drainage layers for both removing excessive rainfall from the field surface and storing sufficient water for the root zone at the same time first calibration experiments for the rs were conducted to simulate natural rainfall with a wider range of rainfall intensities in the laboratory second different drainage layers of sports fields were created by taking examples of football fields as suggested in the fédération internationale de football association fifa quality concept for football turf fifa 2004 fifa 2012 for preparing the drainage layers five materials with different mean diameters between 0 1 and 8 mm were used and the dt was packed with a different thickness and mean diameter for each layer based on the literature and experience the thickness of the root zone can be between 15 and 30 cm according to the united states golf association usga green section specifications usga green section staff 1993 in the literature the blinding or sandwich layer thickness also takes values between 5 and 10 cm for instance adams 1986 recommended a 5 cm blinding layer in his research the gravel layer is the most uncertain part in addition according to experience a 15 cm gravel layer thickness can be prepared for the drainage experiments within the scope of this study different combinations of drainage layers were determined 4 cm turfgrass which was specially grown for football fields 15 cm root zone 15 cm blinding layer and 15 cm gravel layer over the drainage pipes as shown in fig 4 schematically dogan et al 2018 although preparing the drainage layers is laborious on 1 5 1 3 m dt these layers were exposed to eight different design hyetographs therefore the selected root zone consisted of 90 sand and 10 silt clay and organic matter mixture approximately 70 experiments were conducted and analyzed by considering the relationship between hyetographs and drain outflow hydrographs these hydrographs were obtained by measuring drain outflows at 5 min intervals experiments were conducted in the hydraulic laboratory of yıldız technical university design hyetographs were prepared for four different return periods 10 25 50 and 100 years and four different time intervals 10 20 30 and 40 min with 120 min total storm duration using the ab method suggested by chow et al 1988 in this study a drainage layer that was considered one of the most optimal layers with a 15 cm root zone 90 0 5 mm sand and 10 silt clay and organic matter mixture 15 cm blinding layer with mean diameter of 1 mm and 15 cm gravel layer with mean diameter of 6 mm was determined the thickness of the gravel layer was not altered while different thicknesses of the root zone and the blinding layer were tested all drainage layers were exposed to two identical hyetographs consecutively to ensure similar experimental conditions the experimental results showed that turfgrass was damaged after a few experiments because of the lack of healthy root growing conditions of the sports turf in the laboratory even though the artificial sunlight was used therefore the turfgrass was not used because it blocked the infiltration and drainage process mps 6 and 10 hs sensors were used to determine the suction pressure and soil water content through the drainage profile respectively three sets of experiments were performed using the developed experimental setup in the first set 12 experiments were conducted with the same total thickness of the drainage layer l 45 cm therefore three experiments were performed with l 40 cm and three experiments were conducted with l 35 cm the thickness of the gravel bed 15 cm was not changed in the experiments for the experimental notation e25 l 45 cm showed that the thicknesses of the root zone and blinding layers were 25 and 5 cm through the 45 cm drainage layer respectively 3 performance of the experimental setup 3 1 rainfall simulator 3 1 1 rainfall intensity rainfall intensities were obtained from two different nozzles in the present study kesgin et al 2018 produced rainfall intensities between 26 mm h 1 and 266 6 mm h 1 using a single gg w nozzle in addition the lnn nozzle was used to create smaller rainfall intensities fig 5 shows the relationship between discharge and rainfall intensity for each nozzle table 1 summarizes the details of boundary conditions for discharge and rainfall intensity relations by employing two different nozzle systems a wide range of rainfall intensities and their relationships between discharges were determined eq 10 was obtained for the range of discharges of 0 29 q 1 81 l min 1 and the range of rainfall intensities of 2 0 r 25 7 m m h 1 for the lnn nozzle similarly for the gg w nozzle eq 11 was obtained as a power function within the discharge range of 1 98 q 13 48 l min 1 and the range of rainfall intensities of 26 0 r 266 6 m m h 1 as given by kesgin et al 2018 as follows 10 r 13 93 q 11 r 19 554 e 0 1975 q where q is discharge in liters per minute l min 1 and r is rainfall intensity in mm h 1 observing trends for eqs 10 and 11 were fitted in good agreement with determination coefficients of 0 9853 and 0 9953 respectively as mentioned by kesgin et al 2018 pressures were measured at the inlet and outlet of the orifice meter and named system pressure and orifice pressure respectively in addition nozzle pressure was also measured with a simple manometer at the inlet of the nozzle system fig 2 the measurement of pressure values for different rainfall intensities is shown in fig 6 for each nozzle the increasing values of pressure for the lnn nozzle remarkably changed when compared with the pressures for the gg w nozzle moreover as expected pressure values diminished from the inlet of the orifice meter to the inlet of the nozzle system maximum rainfall was measured at the lnn nozzle as 25 7 mm h 1 when the system orifice and nozzle pressures became 41 46 40 87 and 39 5 bar respectively likewise 266 6 mm h 1 of maximum rainfall was obtained when the pressures were measured as 38 22 25 31 and 15 2 bar for the gg w nozzle respectively linearized plots of eqs 10 and 11 for the prediction of rainfall intensities r versus measured values r are in good agreement with the determination coefficients of 0 982 and 0 9956 respectively fig 7 3 1 2 raindrop size in this study raindrop size was determined using the flour pellet method the experimental details of this method can be found in kesgin et al 2018 the distribution of the pellet diameters produced by the lnn nozzle is shown in fig 8 for four different rainfall intensities of 5 11 9 17 8 and 25 7 mm h 1 the pellet diameters were similar to the results of kesgin et al 2018 and they took very close values when this nozzle was used likewise fig 9 shows the distributions of pellet diameters created by the gg w nozzle for different rainfall intensities following the same experimental methodology as kesgin et al 2018 raindrop diameters were determined and the distributions are plotted in fig 10 the intervals of the raindrop diameters suggested by van dijk et al 2002 are also shown in fig 10 together with the results of the present study they showed that raindrop diameters were determined within the range of van dijk et al 2002 the raindrop size distribution was sufficient for producing simulated rainfall the presented results were closer to the lower boundary than to the upper boundary the maximum raindrop diameter produced by the lnn nozzle smaller rainfall intensities was greater than the minimum raindrop diameter created by the gg w nozzle larger rainfall intensities although the rainfall intensities of the gg w nozzle were always larger than the lnn s the difference between raindrop diameters could be explained with the presence of the mesh that was located 1 m beneath the nozzle system because of higher pressures in larger rainfall intensities of the lnn nozzle the larger diameter of simulated raindrops smaller drops grew after they hit the mesh were created as mentioned in carvalho et al 2014 3 1 3 uniformity of the simulated rainfall the coefficient of uniformity cu defined by christiansen 1942 was calculated using eq 2 over the 1 5 1 3 m surface area of the dt according to the results for the lnn nozzle the coefficients of uniformity took values between 80 and 85 in the range of 10 and 25 7 mm h 1 although they were determined to be between 70 and 80 for rainfall intensities less than 10 mm h 1 fig 11 however for the greater rainfall intensities produced by the gg w nozzle they were always greater than 80 and reached a maximum uniformity of 90 76 for the rainfall intensities between 45 and 90 mm h 1 therefore at the maximum rainfall intensities for both nozzles cu was determined to be approximately 82 moazed et al 2010 stated that when cu is greater than 80 the rainfall can be accepted as a uniform rainfall similarly luk et al 1993 expressed that for larger plots rainfall can be accepted as uniform if cu is greater than 70 except for the smaller rainfall intensities of less than 10 mm h 1 produced by the lnn nozzle the coefficient of uniformity was sufficient for the simulation of the natural rainfall and the results were compatible with those in the literature however the coefficients of uniformity for smaller rainfall intensities were also acceptable as suggested by luk et al 1993 raindrop velocities and kinetic energies of simulated rainfall were examined in a similar way as in the work of kesgin et al 2018 the range of the rainfall intensity became wider while the minimum rainfall intensity was 26 mm h 1 in the previous rs the lnn nozzle produced rainfall in the range of 2 25 7 mm h 1 although the spatial uniformity of simulated rainfall for this nozzle had values between 70 and 80 within the rainfall intensities between 2 and 10 mm h 1 3 2 design of the experimental hyetographs the experimental hyetographs were developed based on 100 year return periods t rainfall intensities for 10 20 and 30 min time intervals and 120 min of total storm duration these hyetographs were applied to different drainage layers as two consecutive hyetographs to ensure initial conditions at the field capacity the total duration of each experiment was determined as 240 min for the evaluation of drain outflows fig 12 shows the experimental hyetographs with 10 20 and 30 min time intervals respectively 3 3 hydraulic properties of materials properties of materials used in the drainage experiments are given in table 2 the mean diameters d 50 were found from analyzing grain size distribution curves therefore the uniformity coefficient c u and the gradation coefficient c c were defined as d 60 d 10 and d 30 2 d 60 d 10 respectively d 10 d 30 and d 60 are the effective grain sizes that found from the grain size distribution curves in this study materials were considered as to be uniformly graded if c u was less than 4 and c c was in the range of 1 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by a permeameter that was appropriate for coarser material sizes in this study saturated water content θ s was accepted as equal to porosity values for each material determining residual water content θ r was highly difficult for coarser materials and their values were found very close to zero in the literature therefore θ r was set using calibration experiments using hydrus technical manual sejna et al 2012 swrc was also obtained from calibration tests for each material separately these data were optimized using hydrus 3d and fig 13 shows the comparisons of measured and optimized values the comparisons of results for the gravel bed and the blinding layer were more compatible on the other hand the swrc of the root zone was not sufficiently fitted although many calibration experiments were conducted therefore the best fit and closest relation was used as given in fig 13 4 results and discussion 4 1 drain outflow hydrographs in this study 18 drainage experiments were conducted as three different sets by changing the thicknesses of the drainage layers table 3 the first set of experiments was performed on a 45 cm thick total drainage layer l 45 cm and the others were performed on 40 and 35 cm thick drainage layers all sets were exposed to three different rainfall hyetographs with time intervals of 10 r10 20 r20 and 30 r30 min the experimental results were classified according to different hyetographs and drainage layers figs 14 16 show the drain outflow observations of l 45 cm for r10 r20 and r30 respectively similarly figs 17 19 demonstrate drain outflow hydrographs for the experiments of l 40 cm and l 35 cm for r10 r20 and r30 respectively when all of the hydrographs were analyzed the type of rainfall hyetograph was more dominant on the drain outflow hydrograph than the type of drainage layer therefore the shape of the drain outflow hydrograph did not prominently alter according to the type of drainage layer as expected the shape of the hydrographs for r10 was sharper because of a shorter time interval of 10 min fig 14 fig 14a and c show the hydrographs for e15 and e25 for l 45 cm which were different from the other group of hydrographs resulting from r10 rainfall that was because of the initial conditions of water content through different layers when the consecutive hyetographs were applied to drainage layers the first peak discharge fpd was much smaller than the second peak discharge spd because of the dry initial condition of the drainage layer as seen in fig 14a this result was also supported by the simulation result it also demonstrated the behavior of the drainage layer for both the dry condition and the condition at its field capacity although the initial condition for the experiment of e25 l 45 cm given in fig 16c was not dry but was very close to the field capacity condition the difference between the first and second discharges was distinctive and fpd was smaller than spd considering the drain outflow hydrographs for e20 and e30 for l 45 cm that are shown in fig 14b and d the shape of the hydrographs was very compatible with simulation results and fpd was sufficiently close to spd to evaluate the effect of the blinding layer maximum discharges fpd and spd were observed in the experiment of e30 l 45 cm without blinding layer for all rainfall hyetographs when the thickness of the blinding layer increased for the l 45 cm experiments fpd and spd generally decreased or took almost the same discharges this was also confirmed with the simulation results when the peak rainfall intensity for the different hyetographs diminished from r10 to r30 the differences between maximum discharges for different drainage layers were getting closer and the shape of the drain outflow hydrographs became almost similar these results are given in detail in table 4 similarly as anticipated fpd and spd decreased from r10 to r30 when compared for the same drainage layer moreover because of the 20 and 30 min time intervals there were almost constant values as a horizontal line for the drain outflow hydrographs for both experiment and simulation after peak discharges came after 500 min the observed and simulated discharges became less than 0 1 l min 1 for all experiments when the thickness of the drainage layers was changed from l 45 cm to l 40 and l 35 cm the compatible results were obtained from experiments and simulations however there were not predictable and reasonable results in terms of maximum discharges fpd and spd although maximum discharges for e15 l 40 cm were greater than for e15 l 35 cm for r10 there were no similar relationships for r20 and r30 the results obtained from r20 for e15 l 35 cm had a bigger peak discharge and it took almost the same values for r30 when the two drainage layers were compared when the experiment of e15 l 45 was compared with the experiments for l 40 and l 35 cm under r20 and r30 rainfalls the results for r20 showed that the compatibility for observations and simulations was acceptable and the shape of the hydrographs was sufficiently fitted however peak discharges for l 45 and l 35 cm became closer while the others were apparently smaller considering the r30 results all the discharges were almost similar with good fitting however the compatibility of e15 l 35 cm for both experiment and simulation was weaker when compared with the results of the experiments for l 45 and l 40 cm table 4 was obtained from the drain outflow hydrographs the table summarizes the results of fpd spd time of concentration toc and lag time lt for each consecutive hyetograph when the values of toc were analyzed simulation results were greater than experimental results although the experimental and simulated results were slightly different from each other for r10 the results for r20 and r30 were almost similar while a few simulation values of toc were bigger it is clear that the experimental results of drain outflow started to come earlier when compared with simulations the values of toc also demonstrated that there was no significant change for different drainage layers especially for l 45 cm after the thickness of the drainage layer was altered toc slightly decreased particularly for l 35 cm considering the lag times lt1 and lt2 of two consecutive hyetographs the results were compatible with experiments and simulations for each drainage layer lt1 and lt2 were almost the same in most of the experiments lt1 and lt2 generally had values of 5 10 and 15 min for r10 r20 and r30 respectively lt1 was also identical to or greater than lt2 for all the rainfalls and drainage layers while considering the lag times results for the r30 rainfall the lag times for e15 l 35 cm were smaller and the lag times of e15 l 40 cm were bigger for the results of the r20 rainfall the results obtained from the lag time showed that there were no differences in terms of drainage layers and there was also no significant effect of the blinding layer on the hydrograph parameters for 45 cm thick drainage layers in the case of reaching or exceeding the field capacity in addition small differences between experiments and simulations originated from discrepancies between observed and simulated water content results therefore the reason for applying two consecutive hyetographs was to make it possible to reach or exceed the field capacity condition this was successfully applied to different drainage layers and always found to be lt2 lt1 for better understanding the first observed and simulated peak discharges fpd and spd were compared as shown in fig 20 they were in good agreement with the determination coefficient r2 of 0 9108 and had a linear relationship y 0 9811x hydrus 3d slightly underestimated the drain outflow results as approximately 2 less than observations when compared with the peak discharges figs 21 23 also show the detailed comparisons of all measurements and simulations marked on the drain outflow hydrographs for r10 r20 and r30 respectively these relationships were given according to the types of drainage layer by considering the reference line y x indicated with a bold black line the results showed that most of the measurements were underestimated by hydrus 3d similar to the peak discharges the distribution of the results for each drainage layer was well established around the reference line moreover there were no discharges larger than 6 l min 1 for r10 similarly discharges greater than 4 l min 1 and 3 l min 1 were not observed for r20 and r30 respectively this resulted from decreasing maximum rainfall intensity for the corresponding hyetograph there were also scattered values caused by the small differences for the time of concentrations the drain outflow hydrographs showed that larger discharges were observed for the case without the blinding layer e30 l 45 cm under different rainfall intensities therefore the results for e15 l 40 cm were close enough to the result of e30 l 45 cm if the peak rainfall intensity decreased the distinctive difference for different drainage layers also diminished in other words the hydrograph parameters significantly changed when greater rainfall intensities were exposed to the drainage layers the effects of the thickness of the blinding layer and root zone were not obvious for smaller rainfall intensities table 5 indicates the results of three widely used statistical indices that were used to evaluate hydrological model accuracy in terms of the type of drainage layer and each hyetograph according to eqs 10 and 11 the goodness of fit values of the simulated experimental data in accordance with the adjusted determination coefficient r 2 took values between 0 868 and 0 975 except for the experiment of e25 l 45 cm therefore the accurate performance of the simulation was confirmed with the nse index varied between 0 865 and 0 958 however the kge index varied a wider range of values between 0 594 and 0 954 for the experiments that used a 45 cm thick drainage layer it was larger than 0 741 nse and r 2 were good for validation whereas the wide dispersion of kge was not accurate enough for the experiments of l 40 and l 35 cm thick the comprehensive results demonstrated that measurements and simulations were in a good agreement with statistical indices with r 2 nse and kge also simulation results indicated that the hydrus 3d model is reliable 4 2 water content water contents were measured using 10 hs sensors in the drainage experiments these sensors were located at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm in this study time dependent water contents through the corresponding depths were measured and simulated by hydrus 3d the comparisons between observed and simulated water content for r10 rainfall and various thicknesses of drainage layers are given in figs 24 and 25 the results for r20 and r30 are given in the appendix figs a1 and a2 the water contents were measured for 1440 min a day after each experiment started the distribution of the water content through the drainage layer was drawn by splicing the measurements of water contents at corresponding depths linearly for instance while fig 24a shows observed water content for e30 l 45 cm under r10 fig 24b shows simulated water content for identical conditions except for e15 l 45 cm all experiments started with an initial condition that was not less than field capacity for experiment e15 l 45 cm the initial condition was dry as seen in fig 24g the general results indicated that if the initial water content was greater than the field capacity for both observed and simulated water content the distribution of time dependent water content was almost identical for each drainage layer under different rainfall hyetographs when compared with the observation the hydrus 3d model underestimated the change of the water content due to the wetting front moreover in the stratified layers the hydraulic barrier at the interface of the root zone and the blinding layer controls the wetting front gerke and van genuchten 1993 stated that simulations based on the richards equation as given in eq 5 are not reliable and accurate enough for the consideration of a change of the water content in the wetting zone huang et al 2011 confirmed this result in their field observations they also stated that the infiltration and drainage were highly nonuniform because of different hydraulic conductivities in the drainage layer and this influenced the simulation in hydrus 3d the observation of the water content change was apparent through the drainage layer when compared with the simulation results in addition greater toc values and smaller peak discharges resulted from the lack of water content change in the simulation similarly the effect of the blinding layer on the water content distribution was more distinctive for observation in the drainage experiments the water content at the interface of the root zone and the blinding layer or the gravel bed was measured as the almost maximum value for without the blinding layer condition therefore water content results obtained from the drainage layers with 5 and 10 cm blinding layers were almost similar and a slight effect of the blinding layer was observed however a 15 cm blinding layer was more effective for the distribution of the water content for the simulation results there was no clear difference for comprehending the effect of the blinding layer in most of the experiments the hydrus 3d model simulated the water content without showing effects of the presence of the blinding layer in addition there was no significant change according to the type of rainfall in other words the type of drainage layer was dominant fig 25 also shows the water content results for drainage layer thicknesses of 40 and 35 cm l 40 and l 35 cm for r10 rainfall the other results are given in the appendix according to corresponding rainfalls respectively figs a3 and a4 although there was a similar discrepancy between observations and simulations the results were sufficiently compatible for the experiments of l 40 and l 35 cm when the experiments for e15 l 40 cm were compared with those for e20 l 45 cm and e15 l 45 cm water content results were similar to the experiments that had the same thickness of the blinding layer of 10 cm however the drain outflow hydrographs were more similar for the same thickness of the root zone when the maximum rainfall intensity increased these differences and discrepancies became more distinctive by considering identical experimental conditions for the same thickness of root zones e15 l 45 cm l 40 l 35 cm maximum peak discharges were generally similar and the peak discharge of e15 l 40 cm was slightly smaller however at the interface of the root zone and blinding layer water content was comparatively less in the experiment with a 15 cm thick blinding layer considering simulations for the same experiments the distributions of the water content were almost the same and the differences were not obvious as obtained from the observations 5 conclusions an experimental and numerical investigation was conducted to determine the drainage mechanisms of sports fields new and more accurate insights into the drainage mechanism of sports fields were presented a rainfall simulator developed by kesgin et al 2018 was improved by increasing the capability to simulate a wider range of natural rainfall intensities therefore for the two nozzle system a new methodology based on nozzle discharge and rainfall intensity relationships was determined with r 13 93 q for smaller rainfall intensities produced by the lnn nozzle and r 19 554 e 0 1975 q for larger rainfall intensities produced by the gg w nozzle according to these relationships the predicted and measured rainfall intensities at the lnn and gg w nozzles were also in good agreement with r 2 values of 0 982 and 0 9956 respectively considering the drain outflow hydrographs the type and shape of the hyetograph were found to have more influence on the shape of the hydrograph than the type of drainage layer did the shape of the hydrograph did not significantly change with the type of drainage layer it was sharper for intense rainfalls that had shorter time intervals therefore the initial water content had a significant effect on the drain outflow hydrograph the effect of the thickness of the blinding layer and the root zone was not clearly seen for smaller rainfall intensities especially the results obtained in the experiments under the most intense rainfall r10 were distinctive larger peak discharges were observed without the blinding layer e30 l 45 cm for different rainfalls in other words the blinding layer had a considerable effect on the amount of peak rainfall that was more obvious for the experiment with a 15 cm blinding layer the results also showed that there was no distinct effect of the blinding layer on the hydrograph parameters in the case of reaching or exceeding the field capacity slight differences between the experiment and simulation originated from discrepancies between observed and simulated water content results determining optimal drainage layers thickness of layers and type of material depends highly on long term rainfall records for a relevant region the results of the unsaturated flow model hydrus 3d showed satisfactorily that the description of the drainage flow for sports fields is the steady state flow and this was also confirmed by the proposed soil hydraulic parameters for the definition of the drainage processes of sports fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this study was supported by the

6006,infiltration and drainage are complex hydrological considerations to determine unsaturated flow processes in case of irrigation root growth and pollutant transport in porous media consisting of multi layered soils considering sports fields this affects the quality of sports organization in terms of player s health the participation of spectators and the cancellation of games this study investigated the drainage behavior of sports fields both experimentally and numerically under simulated rainfall to achieve this goal a newly developed experimental setup which consists of a rainfall simulator rs that is able to simulate the natural rainfall and a drainage tank dt that is able to pack stratified drainage layers same as in the sports fields were used experimental rainfall hyetographs were designed to simulate various rainfall conditions for the relevant region in istanbul turkey numerous experiments were conducted to investigate hydrological description of unsaturated flow by using packed drainage layers in the laboratory time dependent water contents were also monitored using soil moisture sensors 10 hs decagon devices at different depths in the drainage layers soil water retention curve swrc of each drainage layer obtained from calibration tests and empirical parameters α n were optimized with hydrus 3d model by using water contents and suction pressure results observed drain outflow hydrographs were compared with simulated drain outflow hydrographs by using statistical indices of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index kling and gupta efficiency kge index and determination coefficient r2 experimental results and hydrus 3d simulations showed good compatibility with the values of nse kge and r2 varied between 0 859 0 958 0 594 0 972 and 0 868 0 975 respectively in the present study experimental and numerical investigation of the drainage mechanisms for sports fields was evaluated by considering unsaturated flow characteristics through the different drainage layers keywords drainage sports field hydrus rainfall simulator hydrograph nash sutcliffe efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades the effects of global warming have brought changes to many hydrological phenomena such as the rainfall runoff relationship stormwater and urban drainage one of the most affected phenomena is the drainage of sports fields sports fields are significant places that bring thousands of people together as part of social and sports activities many sports events globally have been canceled due to insufficient drainage because water could not drain quickly enough from the field surfaces when brief high intensity rainfall interrupted events the drainage of sports fields is quite different from the other land and urban drainage systems because the quality of the root zone has to be protected and drainage gutters cannot be placed on sports fields to capture the runoff the main objective of this study was to develop a methodology for mechanisms of sports field drainage that can remove excess rainfall from the surface of the field as quickly as possible and monitor the unsaturated flow characteristics through the drainage layers also the effects of intense rainfalls were investigated by considering design storms of different rainfall intensities both experimentally and numerically to evaluate the processes of sports field drainage a rainfall simulator rs is an ideal tool to simulate natural rainfall storm characteristics rss have been used for many years in agricultural environmental and hydrological studies to understand the mechanisms of runoff soil erosion soil crusting infiltration and drainage of soils the main purpose of the rs is to simulate the characteristics of natural rainfall its performance is characterized by several criteria that require spatial uniformity christiansen 1942 laws and parsons 1943 raindrop diameter of natural rainfall bubenzer 1979 and reproducible storm patterns in terms of intensity and duration moore et al 1983 in this study raindrop diameters were determined by using the flour pellet method which was first used by bentley 1904 to determine the drop size distribution of rainfall in washington d c usa therefore in the literature some researchers gave empirical formulas to find the raindrop diameters such as van dijk et al 2002 as given in eq 1 1 d 50 α r β where r is the rainfall intensity in mm h 1 and d 50 is the median diameter of raindrops in mm the range of parameters was given as 0 8 α 1 28 and 0 123 β 0 292 which represent the upper and lower boundary respectively the most commonly used technique to determine the spatial uniformity uses the coefficient of uniformity cu which was defined by christiansen 1942 as follows 2 cu 1 1 n x i 1 n x i x 100 where x i is the rainfall depth at location i x is the average rainfall depth and n is the number of points at which rain gauges are located on the drainage tank to collect rainfall adams 1986 stated that sports fields drainage is completely different from agricultural drainage it requires that incident rainfall be transmitted to drainage pipes for maintaining a proper and playable field surface the study showed that complete profile reconstruction which consists of a root zone for turfgrass blinding layer sandwich layer and permeable bed with gravel is the most comprehensive approach for high quality sports fields although it is one of the most expensive designs he also focused on the content of the root zone mixture and the grain sizes used in the blinding and gravel layers in terms of practical aspects of sports field drainage therefore the drainage of sports fields has not been comprehensively investigated in the literature and designs have been based on experience considering imprecise science fleming et al 2016 the hydraulic performance of the drainage of the sports fields has not been determined in terms of hydrological perspectives fleming et al 2016 investigated the drainage behavior of sports fields using field observations and mathematical modeling they reported that field observations from the sports fields were not reliable and predictable when comparing measured and estimated drain outflows moreover their study also showed that porous field designs provided high attenuation of the peak rainfall of the drain outflow hydrograph when considering rainfalls for varying periods between 2011 and 2014 fleming et al 2016 did not consider the unsaturated flow characteristic of the drainage layers in addition their mathematical model was not sufficiently comprehensive to simulate the hydraulic behavior of drainage layers determining the hydraulic behavior of materials used in multilayered soils of sports fields is crucial to properly model the unsaturated flow these soils generally have heterogeneities through the profile sakellariou makrantonaki 1997 investigated water drainage in layered soils experimentally and numerically soil water content and pressure were measured in a vertical column and the results were compared with the numerical solutions from solving the richards equation with the finite difference method similarly alfnes et al 2004 stated that textured layers increased the water capacity of soils and reduced percolation with considering waste contaminant they investigated the mechanism of water flow and solute transport in the layered soils by conducting drainage experiments huang et al 2011 also investigated the drainage processes in the multi layered coarser soils they evaluated the hydraulic performance of natural soils by using hydrus 1d through 20 different textured layers they compared simulated and measured soil water content profiles and drained water volumes during infiltration and drainage phases their study showed that heterogeneous soil profile could store more water when compared to more homogeneous soils under the same drainage conditions taylor et al 1997 studied water retention in the upper layer of the drainage profile root zone in the layered soils by considering sub root zone layering effects changing blinding layer and gravel layer their study showed the effect of the blinding layer on the water retention of the root zone therefore selecting root zone material is very crucial for both the root growth of turfgrass and drainage especially a sand dominated root zone is used due to its resistance to compaction and healthy drainage on the other hand it has some disadvantages because of the little holding capacity and not enough about storing plant nutrients a laboratory study by henderson et al 2001 demonstrated that sand dominated root zones containing 90 sand or more 10 silt and clay mix or less were appropriate in terms of acceptable drainage rates for sports fields considering firm footing adequate resiliency and resistance to tearing it is not appropriate to select 100 sand dominated root zones determining the optimum thickness of drainage layers plays an important role for holding enough water in the root zone and draining excessive rainfall without runoff on the field surface zhao et al 2014 studied the rainfall runoff process and soil moisture dynamics in multi layered soils of grassland plots under simulated rainfall they measured soil water content to investigate the response of water content to intense rainfall by using sensors placed at different depths the drainage of sports fields can be considered as a part of the urban drainage in addition the sports fields are specifically designed to prevent runoff and ponding water conditions on the play surface likewise sustainable urban drainage systems suds design principle is to provide sufficient storage drain outflow control to prevent runoff as stated in woods ballard et al 2015 there is actually no standard for runoff rate for the green field but preserving the quality of turfgrass and creating playable field surfaces corresponding to fifa fédération internationale de football association criteria no runoff no ponding condition is more applicable and preferable for sports fields it has considerably seen progress in the understanding of water flow in the unsaturated zone hydrus model which is commonly used in the literature was used to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media in many scientific fields hydrus model was successfully applied by considering unsaturated flow characteristics with solving the richards equation for instance hilten et al 2008 modeled stormwater runoff relation from green roofs using hydrus 1d ebrahimian and noory 2015 simulated subsurface drainage of paddy fields with hydrus 3d turco et al 2017 also investigated the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of permeable pavement with hydrus 2d they compared measured and modeled hydrographs with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index and determination coefficient they did not give sufficient details about simulated rainfall that is highly significant for hydrological relation between hyetograph and drain outflow hydrograph in the field of hydrology parameters of the hydrological model are not accurately measurable and therefore it is the fact that there is a deficiency for this condition besides hydrological model accuracy is generally performed by a few statistical indices in the literature the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 kling and gupta efficiency index kge that was developed by gupta et al 2009 were widely used to evaluate the model accuracy these descriptive statistics were estimated for the validation of the simulation capability of drain outflow results based on eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3 nse 1 i 1 n y y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y and y i are the predicted and measured values for the dependent variable y y is the mean of the measured values and n sample size 4 kge 1 pc 1 2 cd rd 1 2 cm rm 1 2 where pc is the pearson coefficient cm and rm are the mean of the measured and predicted values cd and rd are the standard deviation of measured and predicted values respectively in the present study the hydrological analysis was performed by comparing drain outflow hydrographs corresponding to different rainfall hyetographs under the no runoff condition therefore for the conceptual model of the drainage system that demonstrates the relationship between hyetograph and drain hydrograph there are some key parameters that describe the behavior of the drainage system time of concentration the time from start of the rainfall to the point of the time of drain outflow starts and lag time the duration between peak rainfall intensity and peak drain outflow discharge moreover the drainage mechanism of sports fields was thoroughly evaluated by using the experimental setup that is able to create rainfall patterns for different return periods and durations drainage experiments were conducted by using different drainage layers under different hyetographs unsaturated flow parameters of the drainage layers were estimated by hydrus 3d from water contents and suction pressures measured during the experiments and swrc for each material was obtained measured and modeled drain outflow hydrographs were compared with statistical analysis using nse index kge index and determination coefficient r2 time dependent water content profiles were obtained from each drainage experiment the drain outflow hydrographs were also evaluated with peak discharge time of concentration and lag time 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of rainfall simulator an experimental setup was used to evaluate the drainage mechanism under various rainfall conditions by creating design hyetographs it also had the ability to simulate natural rainfall characteristics and to monitor drainage flow conditions through the layers fig 1 it had two components the rs which was composed of a downward oriented spraying nozzle system and the dt which included two identical 1 5 1 3 m compartments a programmable logic controller plc panel was placed in front of the experimental setup it controlled the motor and pump system by generating pulse signals with different precise periods fig 1b essentially the plc could control and change pressures ranging from 0 to 65 bar to pump at different flow rates and the rs produced a wide range of rainfall intensities by the means of the plc further details for the experimental setup can be found in kesgin et al 2018 in addition the system mentioned by kesgin et al 2018 was improved by using two different nozzles a new nozzle system lnn and gg w nozzles manufactured by spraying systems was created to spray with a wider range of rainfall intensities compared with the single nozzle system developed by kesgin et al 2018 two different nozzles were connected with solenoid vanes controlled by the plc system fig 2 according to different flow rates the plc chooses an appropriate nozzle for the corresponding rainfall intensity while the lnn nozzle was used for producing a smaller rainfall intensity r 26 m m h 1 the gg w nozzle produced larger rainfall intensities 266 6 m m h 1 r 26 m m h 1 the operating time interval for each nozzle during the experiment was defined for the range of rainfall intensities with the changing values of the inlet and outlet pressures 2 2 experimental hyetographs in the hydrological design of drainage systems the time dependent flow rates are in general not available therefore only peak values of flow rates or rainfall intensities are considered chow et al 1988 mentioned that design methods have been developed recently with unsteady flow analysis which makes it possible to create a more predictable design hyetograph in this study a design hyetograph was determined using the records of a meteorological station near sports fields in istanbul turkey there are two ways to obtain design hyetographs from intensity duration frequency idf curves the alternating block ab method and the instantaneous intensity ii method chow et al 1988 in this study hyetographs were designed using the ab method because it is simpler and easier to apply compared with the ii method the production details of obtaining experimental hyetographs by the ab method can be found in kesgin et al 2018 the experimental hyetographs were developed based on 100 year return periods t rainfall intensities for 10 20 and 30 min time intervals and 120 min of total storm duration according to the selected time intervals rainfall intensities were determined from the idf curves as can be seen in fig 3 obtained from the relevant meteorological station in istanbul turkey dogan et al 2018 2 3 model description of the drainage process hydrus model šimůnek et al 2006 was used to simulate drainage of soil in the multi layers of the sports fields it is commonly used in the literature to simulate water flow in variably saturated porous media the governing equation is given by the following form of the richard s equation 5 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is the pressure head l x i i 1 2 are the spatial coordinates l t is time t k ij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 s is the sink term t 1 that was assumed to be zero in this study hydrus 3d model uses the soil hydraulic functions proposed by van genuchten 1980 who used the statistical pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 they described the soil water retention curve function θ h and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h respectively 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 7 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 8 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 9 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s denotes the residual and saturated water content l 3 l 3 respectively s e is the effective water content l 3 l 3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 α l 1 n m are the parameters of the van genuchen model these empirical parameters are dependent on soil types that are considered to affect the shape of hydraulic functions mualem 1976 determined the l as the pore connectivity that was to be about 0 5 for an average for many soils the pore size distribution index n which is the steepness of the soil water retention curve and α is the inverse of air entry bubbling pressure that it takes greater values for coarser soils gravel and coarser sand 2 4 material properties three different materials fine sand medium sand and gravel were used in the drainage experiments the unsaturated flow parameters α n used to simulate water flow in hydrus 3d were determined from calibration tests by measuring water content and suction pressure through the drainage layer bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity field capacity porosity and the specific gravity of the materials were also determined separately in the construction materials and hydraulics laboratories at yıldız technical university ytu the empirical parameters α n l directly influence the shape of the hydraulic functions when the parameter n is the steepness of the soil water retention curve swrc α takes higher values for coarser materials therefore these parameters were optimized with hydrus 3d using measurements of water content and suction pressure during the calibration tests after determining the most suitable swrcs for each drainage layer they were used in simulations of the drainage experiments with hydrus 3d 2 5 experimental methodology in the present study a new methodology was developed that includes creating rainfall patterns with design hyetographs and investigating different drainage layers for both removing excessive rainfall from the field surface and storing sufficient water for the root zone at the same time first calibration experiments for the rs were conducted to simulate natural rainfall with a wider range of rainfall intensities in the laboratory second different drainage layers of sports fields were created by taking examples of football fields as suggested in the fédération internationale de football association fifa quality concept for football turf fifa 2004 fifa 2012 for preparing the drainage layers five materials with different mean diameters between 0 1 and 8 mm were used and the dt was packed with a different thickness and mean diameter for each layer based on the literature and experience the thickness of the root zone can be between 15 and 30 cm according to the united states golf association usga green section specifications usga green section staff 1993 in the literature the blinding or sandwich layer thickness also takes values between 5 and 10 cm for instance adams 1986 recommended a 5 cm blinding layer in his research the gravel layer is the most uncertain part in addition according to experience a 15 cm gravel layer thickness can be prepared for the drainage experiments within the scope of this study different combinations of drainage layers were determined 4 cm turfgrass which was specially grown for football fields 15 cm root zone 15 cm blinding layer and 15 cm gravel layer over the drainage pipes as shown in fig 4 schematically dogan et al 2018 although preparing the drainage layers is laborious on 1 5 1 3 m dt these layers were exposed to eight different design hyetographs therefore the selected root zone consisted of 90 sand and 10 silt clay and organic matter mixture approximately 70 experiments were conducted and analyzed by considering the relationship between hyetographs and drain outflow hydrographs these hydrographs were obtained by measuring drain outflows at 5 min intervals experiments were conducted in the hydraulic laboratory of yıldız technical university design hyetographs were prepared for four different return periods 10 25 50 and 100 years and four different time intervals 10 20 30 and 40 min with 120 min total storm duration using the ab method suggested by chow et al 1988 in this study a drainage layer that was considered one of the most optimal layers with a 15 cm root zone 90 0 5 mm sand and 10 silt clay and organic matter mixture 15 cm blinding layer with mean diameter of 1 mm and 15 cm gravel layer with mean diameter of 6 mm was determined the thickness of the gravel layer was not altered while different thicknesses of the root zone and the blinding layer were tested all drainage layers were exposed to two identical hyetographs consecutively to ensure similar experimental conditions the experimental results showed that turfgrass was damaged after a few experiments because of the lack of healthy root growing conditions of the sports turf in the laboratory even though the artificial sunlight was used therefore the turfgrass was not used because it blocked the infiltration and drainage process mps 6 and 10 hs sensors were used to determine the suction pressure and soil water content through the drainage profile respectively three sets of experiments were performed using the developed experimental setup in the first set 12 experiments were conducted with the same total thickness of the drainage layer l 45 cm therefore three experiments were performed with l 40 cm and three experiments were conducted with l 35 cm the thickness of the gravel bed 15 cm was not changed in the experiments for the experimental notation e25 l 45 cm showed that the thicknesses of the root zone and blinding layers were 25 and 5 cm through the 45 cm drainage layer respectively 3 performance of the experimental setup 3 1 rainfall simulator 3 1 1 rainfall intensity rainfall intensities were obtained from two different nozzles in the present study kesgin et al 2018 produced rainfall intensities between 26 mm h 1 and 266 6 mm h 1 using a single gg w nozzle in addition the lnn nozzle was used to create smaller rainfall intensities fig 5 shows the relationship between discharge and rainfall intensity for each nozzle table 1 summarizes the details of boundary conditions for discharge and rainfall intensity relations by employing two different nozzle systems a wide range of rainfall intensities and their relationships between discharges were determined eq 10 was obtained for the range of discharges of 0 29 q 1 81 l min 1 and the range of rainfall intensities of 2 0 r 25 7 m m h 1 for the lnn nozzle similarly for the gg w nozzle eq 11 was obtained as a power function within the discharge range of 1 98 q 13 48 l min 1 and the range of rainfall intensities of 26 0 r 266 6 m m h 1 as given by kesgin et al 2018 as follows 10 r 13 93 q 11 r 19 554 e 0 1975 q where q is discharge in liters per minute l min 1 and r is rainfall intensity in mm h 1 observing trends for eqs 10 and 11 were fitted in good agreement with determination coefficients of 0 9853 and 0 9953 respectively as mentioned by kesgin et al 2018 pressures were measured at the inlet and outlet of the orifice meter and named system pressure and orifice pressure respectively in addition nozzle pressure was also measured with a simple manometer at the inlet of the nozzle system fig 2 the measurement of pressure values for different rainfall intensities is shown in fig 6 for each nozzle the increasing values of pressure for the lnn nozzle remarkably changed when compared with the pressures for the gg w nozzle moreover as expected pressure values diminished from the inlet of the orifice meter to the inlet of the nozzle system maximum rainfall was measured at the lnn nozzle as 25 7 mm h 1 when the system orifice and nozzle pressures became 41 46 40 87 and 39 5 bar respectively likewise 266 6 mm h 1 of maximum rainfall was obtained when the pressures were measured as 38 22 25 31 and 15 2 bar for the gg w nozzle respectively linearized plots of eqs 10 and 11 for the prediction of rainfall intensities r versus measured values r are in good agreement with the determination coefficients of 0 982 and 0 9956 respectively fig 7 3 1 2 raindrop size in this study raindrop size was determined using the flour pellet method the experimental details of this method can be found in kesgin et al 2018 the distribution of the pellet diameters produced by the lnn nozzle is shown in fig 8 for four different rainfall intensities of 5 11 9 17 8 and 25 7 mm h 1 the pellet diameters were similar to the results of kesgin et al 2018 and they took very close values when this nozzle was used likewise fig 9 shows the distributions of pellet diameters created by the gg w nozzle for different rainfall intensities following the same experimental methodology as kesgin et al 2018 raindrop diameters were determined and the distributions are plotted in fig 10 the intervals of the raindrop diameters suggested by van dijk et al 2002 are also shown in fig 10 together with the results of the present study they showed that raindrop diameters were determined within the range of van dijk et al 2002 the raindrop size distribution was sufficient for producing simulated rainfall the presented results were closer to the lower boundary than to the upper boundary the maximum raindrop diameter produced by the lnn nozzle smaller rainfall intensities was greater than the minimum raindrop diameter created by the gg w nozzle larger rainfall intensities although the rainfall intensities of the gg w nozzle were always larger than the lnn s the difference between raindrop diameters could be explained with the presence of the mesh that was located 1 m beneath the nozzle system because of higher pressures in larger rainfall intensities of the lnn nozzle the larger diameter of simulated raindrops smaller drops grew after they hit the mesh were created as mentioned in carvalho et al 2014 3 1 3 uniformity of the simulated rainfall the coefficient of uniformity cu defined by christiansen 1942 was calculated using eq 2 over the 1 5 1 3 m surface area of the dt according to the results for the lnn nozzle the coefficients of uniformity took values between 80 and 85 in the range of 10 and 25 7 mm h 1 although they were determined to be between 70 and 80 for rainfall intensities less than 10 mm h 1 fig 11 however for the greater rainfall intensities produced by the gg w nozzle they were always greater than 80 and reached a maximum uniformity of 90 76 for the rainfall intensities between 45 and 90 mm h 1 therefore at the maximum rainfall intensities for both nozzles cu was determined to be approximately 82 moazed et al 2010 stated that when cu is greater than 80 the rainfall can be accepted as a uniform rainfall similarly luk et al 1993 expressed that for larger plots rainfall can be accepted as uniform if cu is greater than 70 except for the smaller rainfall intensities of less than 10 mm h 1 produced by the lnn nozzle the coefficient of uniformity was sufficient for the simulation of the natural rainfall and the results were compatible with those in the literature however the coefficients of uniformity for smaller rainfall intensities were also acceptable as suggested by luk et al 1993 raindrop velocities and kinetic energies of simulated rainfall were examined in a similar way as in the work of kesgin et al 2018 the range of the rainfall intensity became wider while the minimum rainfall intensity was 26 mm h 1 in the previous rs the lnn nozzle produced rainfall in the range of 2 25 7 mm h 1 although the spatial uniformity of simulated rainfall for this nozzle had values between 70 and 80 within the rainfall intensities between 2 and 10 mm h 1 3 2 design of the experimental hyetographs the experimental hyetographs were developed based on 100 year return periods t rainfall intensities for 10 20 and 30 min time intervals and 120 min of total storm duration these hyetographs were applied to different drainage layers as two consecutive hyetographs to ensure initial conditions at the field capacity the total duration of each experiment was determined as 240 min for the evaluation of drain outflows fig 12 shows the experimental hyetographs with 10 20 and 30 min time intervals respectively 3 3 hydraulic properties of materials properties of materials used in the drainage experiments are given in table 2 the mean diameters d 50 were found from analyzing grain size distribution curves therefore the uniformity coefficient c u and the gradation coefficient c c were defined as d 60 d 10 and d 30 2 d 60 d 10 respectively d 10 d 30 and d 60 are the effective grain sizes that found from the grain size distribution curves in this study materials were considered as to be uniformly graded if c u was less than 4 and c c was in the range of 1 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by a permeameter that was appropriate for coarser material sizes in this study saturated water content θ s was accepted as equal to porosity values for each material determining residual water content θ r was highly difficult for coarser materials and their values were found very close to zero in the literature therefore θ r was set using calibration experiments using hydrus technical manual sejna et al 2012 swrc was also obtained from calibration tests for each material separately these data were optimized using hydrus 3d and fig 13 shows the comparisons of measured and optimized values the comparisons of results for the gravel bed and the blinding layer were more compatible on the other hand the swrc of the root zone was not sufficiently fitted although many calibration experiments were conducted therefore the best fit and closest relation was used as given in fig 13 4 results and discussion 4 1 drain outflow hydrographs in this study 18 drainage experiments were conducted as three different sets by changing the thicknesses of the drainage layers table 3 the first set of experiments was performed on a 45 cm thick total drainage layer l 45 cm and the others were performed on 40 and 35 cm thick drainage layers all sets were exposed to three different rainfall hyetographs with time intervals of 10 r10 20 r20 and 30 r30 min the experimental results were classified according to different hyetographs and drainage layers figs 14 16 show the drain outflow observations of l 45 cm for r10 r20 and r30 respectively similarly figs 17 19 demonstrate drain outflow hydrographs for the experiments of l 40 cm and l 35 cm for r10 r20 and r30 respectively when all of the hydrographs were analyzed the type of rainfall hyetograph was more dominant on the drain outflow hydrograph than the type of drainage layer therefore the shape of the drain outflow hydrograph did not prominently alter according to the type of drainage layer as expected the shape of the hydrographs for r10 was sharper because of a shorter time interval of 10 min fig 14 fig 14a and c show the hydrographs for e15 and e25 for l 45 cm which were different from the other group of hydrographs resulting from r10 rainfall that was because of the initial conditions of water content through different layers when the consecutive hyetographs were applied to drainage layers the first peak discharge fpd was much smaller than the second peak discharge spd because of the dry initial condition of the drainage layer as seen in fig 14a this result was also supported by the simulation result it also demonstrated the behavior of the drainage layer for both the dry condition and the condition at its field capacity although the initial condition for the experiment of e25 l 45 cm given in fig 16c was not dry but was very close to the field capacity condition the difference between the first and second discharges was distinctive and fpd was smaller than spd considering the drain outflow hydrographs for e20 and e30 for l 45 cm that are shown in fig 14b and d the shape of the hydrographs was very compatible with simulation results and fpd was sufficiently close to spd to evaluate the effect of the blinding layer maximum discharges fpd and spd were observed in the experiment of e30 l 45 cm without blinding layer for all rainfall hyetographs when the thickness of the blinding layer increased for the l 45 cm experiments fpd and spd generally decreased or took almost the same discharges this was also confirmed with the simulation results when the peak rainfall intensity for the different hyetographs diminished from r10 to r30 the differences between maximum discharges for different drainage layers were getting closer and the shape of the drain outflow hydrographs became almost similar these results are given in detail in table 4 similarly as anticipated fpd and spd decreased from r10 to r30 when compared for the same drainage layer moreover because of the 20 and 30 min time intervals there were almost constant values as a horizontal line for the drain outflow hydrographs for both experiment and simulation after peak discharges came after 500 min the observed and simulated discharges became less than 0 1 l min 1 for all experiments when the thickness of the drainage layers was changed from l 45 cm to l 40 and l 35 cm the compatible results were obtained from experiments and simulations however there were not predictable and reasonable results in terms of maximum discharges fpd and spd although maximum discharges for e15 l 40 cm were greater than for e15 l 35 cm for r10 there were no similar relationships for r20 and r30 the results obtained from r20 for e15 l 35 cm had a bigger peak discharge and it took almost the same values for r30 when the two drainage layers were compared when the experiment of e15 l 45 was compared with the experiments for l 40 and l 35 cm under r20 and r30 rainfalls the results for r20 showed that the compatibility for observations and simulations was acceptable and the shape of the hydrographs was sufficiently fitted however peak discharges for l 45 and l 35 cm became closer while the others were apparently smaller considering the r30 results all the discharges were almost similar with good fitting however the compatibility of e15 l 35 cm for both experiment and simulation was weaker when compared with the results of the experiments for l 45 and l 40 cm table 4 was obtained from the drain outflow hydrographs the table summarizes the results of fpd spd time of concentration toc and lag time lt for each consecutive hyetograph when the values of toc were analyzed simulation results were greater than experimental results although the experimental and simulated results were slightly different from each other for r10 the results for r20 and r30 were almost similar while a few simulation values of toc were bigger it is clear that the experimental results of drain outflow started to come earlier when compared with simulations the values of toc also demonstrated that there was no significant change for different drainage layers especially for l 45 cm after the thickness of the drainage layer was altered toc slightly decreased particularly for l 35 cm considering the lag times lt1 and lt2 of two consecutive hyetographs the results were compatible with experiments and simulations for each drainage layer lt1 and lt2 were almost the same in most of the experiments lt1 and lt2 generally had values of 5 10 and 15 min for r10 r20 and r30 respectively lt1 was also identical to or greater than lt2 for all the rainfalls and drainage layers while considering the lag times results for the r30 rainfall the lag times for e15 l 35 cm were smaller and the lag times of e15 l 40 cm were bigger for the results of the r20 rainfall the results obtained from the lag time showed that there were no differences in terms of drainage layers and there was also no significant effect of the blinding layer on the hydrograph parameters for 45 cm thick drainage layers in the case of reaching or exceeding the field capacity in addition small differences between experiments and simulations originated from discrepancies between observed and simulated water content results therefore the reason for applying two consecutive hyetographs was to make it possible to reach or exceed the field capacity condition this was successfully applied to different drainage layers and always found to be lt2 lt1 for better understanding the first observed and simulated peak discharges fpd and spd were compared as shown in fig 20 they were in good agreement with the determination coefficient r2 of 0 9108 and had a linear relationship y 0 9811x hydrus 3d slightly underestimated the drain outflow results as approximately 2 less than observations when compared with the peak discharges figs 21 23 also show the detailed comparisons of all measurements and simulations marked on the drain outflow hydrographs for r10 r20 and r30 respectively these relationships were given according to the types of drainage layer by considering the reference line y x indicated with a bold black line the results showed that most of the measurements were underestimated by hydrus 3d similar to the peak discharges the distribution of the results for each drainage layer was well established around the reference line moreover there were no discharges larger than 6 l min 1 for r10 similarly discharges greater than 4 l min 1 and 3 l min 1 were not observed for r20 and r30 respectively this resulted from decreasing maximum rainfall intensity for the corresponding hyetograph there were also scattered values caused by the small differences for the time of concentrations the drain outflow hydrographs showed that larger discharges were observed for the case without the blinding layer e30 l 45 cm under different rainfall intensities therefore the results for e15 l 40 cm were close enough to the result of e30 l 45 cm if the peak rainfall intensity decreased the distinctive difference for different drainage layers also diminished in other words the hydrograph parameters significantly changed when greater rainfall intensities were exposed to the drainage layers the effects of the thickness of the blinding layer and root zone were not obvious for smaller rainfall intensities table 5 indicates the results of three widely used statistical indices that were used to evaluate hydrological model accuracy in terms of the type of drainage layer and each hyetograph according to eqs 10 and 11 the goodness of fit values of the simulated experimental data in accordance with the adjusted determination coefficient r 2 took values between 0 868 and 0 975 except for the experiment of e25 l 45 cm therefore the accurate performance of the simulation was confirmed with the nse index varied between 0 865 and 0 958 however the kge index varied a wider range of values between 0 594 and 0 954 for the experiments that used a 45 cm thick drainage layer it was larger than 0 741 nse and r 2 were good for validation whereas the wide dispersion of kge was not accurate enough for the experiments of l 40 and l 35 cm thick the comprehensive results demonstrated that measurements and simulations were in a good agreement with statistical indices with r 2 nse and kge also simulation results indicated that the hydrus 3d model is reliable 4 2 water content water contents were measured using 10 hs sensors in the drainage experiments these sensors were located at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm in this study time dependent water contents through the corresponding depths were measured and simulated by hydrus 3d the comparisons between observed and simulated water content for r10 rainfall and various thicknesses of drainage layers are given in figs 24 and 25 the results for r20 and r30 are given in the appendix figs a1 and a2 the water contents were measured for 1440 min a day after each experiment started the distribution of the water content through the drainage layer was drawn by splicing the measurements of water contents at corresponding depths linearly for instance while fig 24a shows observed water content for e30 l 45 cm under r10 fig 24b shows simulated water content for identical conditions except for e15 l 45 cm all experiments started with an initial condition that was not less than field capacity for experiment e15 l 45 cm the initial condition was dry as seen in fig 24g the general results indicated that if the initial water content was greater than the field capacity for both observed and simulated water content the distribution of time dependent water content was almost identical for each drainage layer under different rainfall hyetographs when compared with the observation the hydrus 3d model underestimated the change of the water content due to the wetting front moreover in the stratified layers the hydraulic barrier at the interface of the root zone and the blinding layer controls the wetting front gerke and van genuchten 1993 stated that simulations based on the richards equation as given in eq 5 are not reliable and accurate enough for the consideration of a change of the water content in the wetting zone huang et al 2011 confirmed this result in their field observations they also stated that the infiltration and drainage were highly nonuniform because of different hydraulic conductivities in the drainage layer and this influenced the simulation in hydrus 3d the observation of the water content change was apparent through the drainage layer when compared with the simulation results in addition greater toc values and smaller peak discharges resulted from the lack of water content change in the simulation similarly the effect of the blinding layer on the water content distribution was more distinctive for observation in the drainage experiments the water content at the interface of the root zone and the blinding layer or the gravel bed was measured as the almost maximum value for without the blinding layer condition therefore water content results obtained from the drainage layers with 5 and 10 cm blinding layers were almost similar and a slight effect of the blinding layer was observed however a 15 cm blinding layer was more effective for the distribution of the water content for the simulation results there was no clear difference for comprehending the effect of the blinding layer in most of the experiments the hydrus 3d model simulated the water content without showing effects of the presence of the blinding layer in addition there was no significant change according to the type of rainfall in other words the type of drainage layer was dominant fig 25 also shows the water content results for drainage layer thicknesses of 40 and 35 cm l 40 and l 35 cm for r10 rainfall the other results are given in the appendix according to corresponding rainfalls respectively figs a3 and a4 although there was a similar discrepancy between observations and simulations the results were sufficiently compatible for the experiments of l 40 and l 35 cm when the experiments for e15 l 40 cm were compared with those for e20 l 45 cm and e15 l 45 cm water content results were similar to the experiments that had the same thickness of the blinding layer of 10 cm however the drain outflow hydrographs were more similar for the same thickness of the root zone when the maximum rainfall intensity increased these differences and discrepancies became more distinctive by considering identical experimental conditions for the same thickness of root zones e15 l 45 cm l 40 l 35 cm maximum peak discharges were generally similar and the peak discharge of e15 l 40 cm was slightly smaller however at the interface of the root zone and blinding layer water content was comparatively less in the experiment with a 15 cm thick blinding layer considering simulations for the same experiments the distributions of the water content were almost the same and the differences were not obvious as obtained from the observations 5 conclusions an experimental and numerical investigation was conducted to determine the drainage mechanisms of sports fields new and more accurate insights into the drainage mechanism of sports fields were presented a rainfall simulator developed by kesgin et al 2018 was improved by increasing the capability to simulate a wider range of natural rainfall intensities therefore for the two nozzle system a new methodology based on nozzle discharge and rainfall intensity relationships was determined with r 13 93 q for smaller rainfall intensities produced by the lnn nozzle and r 19 554 e 0 1975 q for larger rainfall intensities produced by the gg w nozzle according to these relationships the predicted and measured rainfall intensities at the lnn and gg w nozzles were also in good agreement with r 2 values of 0 982 and 0 9956 respectively considering the drain outflow hydrographs the type and shape of the hyetograph were found to have more influence on the shape of the hydrograph than the type of drainage layer did the shape of the hydrograph did not significantly change with the type of drainage layer it was sharper for intense rainfalls that had shorter time intervals therefore the initial water content had a significant effect on the drain outflow hydrograph the effect of the thickness of the blinding layer and the root zone was not clearly seen for smaller rainfall intensities especially the results obtained in the experiments under the most intense rainfall r10 were distinctive larger peak discharges were observed without the blinding layer e30 l 45 cm for different rainfalls in other words the blinding layer had a considerable effect on the amount of peak rainfall that was more obvious for the experiment with a 15 cm blinding layer the results also showed that there was no distinct effect of the blinding layer on the hydrograph parameters in the case of reaching or exceeding the field capacity slight differences between the experiment and simulation originated from discrepancies between observed and simulated water content results determining optimal drainage layers thickness of layers and type of material depends highly on long term rainfall records for a relevant region the results of the unsaturated flow model hydrus 3d showed satisfactorily that the description of the drainage flow for sports fields is the steady state flow and this was also confirmed by the proposed soil hydraulic parameters for the definition of the drainage processes of sports fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6007,streamflow prediction is a challenging task due to the different processes involved in streamflow generation these different processes have different characteristics of the relationships between hydro meteorological variables and streamflow which make it a challenging task to develop single data driven stream flow prediction models that can map the input output relationships for all different streamflow regimes to improve the performance of streamflow prediction we proposed a flow regime dependent approach to map the relationships between hydro meteorological variables and streamflow based on hydro meteorological condition classification this approach integrates the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso fuzzy c means fcm and deep belief networks dbn and therefore referred to as the lasso fcm dbn approach this approach employs lasso to select the hydro meteorological variables which have a significant impact on streamflow fcm to identify different streamflow regimes and dbn as a data driven model to map the nonlinear and complex relationships between the selected hydro meteorological variables and streamflow within different flow regimes to assess the performance of the proposed approach two comparative studies were carried out 1 the multi variable fcm was compared to the traditional single variable threshold based method and 2 the performance of the dbn was compared to a traditional artificial neural networks anns model two stations in the tennessee river usa were used as the case study the results demonstrate that the performance of the multi variable based fcm classification method is better and more stable than the traditional threshold based single variable method due to the sensitivity of the single variable method to different threshold values in addition dbns performed better than traditional anns in all three statistical measures considered overall the lasso fcm dbn multi model system significantly improved the performance of streamflow prediction and is therefore a valuable tool for water resources management and planning keywords streamflow prediction lasso deep belief networks fuzzy c means classification 1 introduction streamflow prediction is a challenging task especially in regions with high streamflow variability due to the significantly different flow characteristics within low medium and high flow regimes zhang and govindaraju 2000 low medium and high flows are associated with different hydrological processes and have different dynamical properties caballero et al 2007 stahl et al 2011 low flows often occur in periods with retention and slow release of water and therefore have lower frequency fluctuations whereas high flows directly respond to water input and often have higher frequency fluctuations groisman et al 2001 in addition base flow is the major contribution to low flow events while high flow events are primarily resulted from intense storm rainfall wu et al 2009 therefore it is difficult to develop a single global data driven model to predict low medium and high flow levels and multiple models may be required to predict flows in different flow regimes separately classification methods have been used to identify different flow regimes and improve the performance of streamflow prediction models cannas et al 2006 shrestha and solomatine 2006 wu et al 2008 hu et al 2001 developed a range dependent network model for daily streamflow prediction based on the threshold auto regressive tar which was used to classify the total samples based on pre defined threshold values of streamflow solomatine and xue 2004 used m5 model trees and multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks anns for flood forecasting the m5 model trees were used to split flood samples with different hydrological characteristics into different groups sivapragasam and liong 2005 divided flows into high medium and low flow groups before developing a streamflow prediction model for each flow regime wu et al 2009 used the fcm method to divide the original training dataset into a couple of subsets and then an ann model was developed for each subset independently to predict river flow in all these studies a single variable threshold based method was used to stratify streamflow into different groups there is little discussion on the selection of threshold values and the impact of different threshold values on model performance furthermore streamflow generation is impacted by multiple processes including rainfall potential evaporation temperature among others so a multi variable classification method is more suitable however the impact of different classification methods on the performance of the forecasting models needs to be discussed further different data driven models have been used to predict streamflow karran et al 2014 liu et al 2014 yang et al 2017b among which the ann based approach is most popular edossa and babel 2011 guimarães santos and silva 2014 makwana and tiwari 2014 recently a new ann model the deep belief networks dbn showed encouraging performance apart from its ability to map multiple non linear relationships its distinctive unsupervised pre training feature avoids over fitting and improves generalization ability zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2017a dbn models have already been applied successfully to solve many real world problems including image classification brosch and tam 2015 drought forecasting chen et al 2012 and information retrieval lv et al 2015 sarikaya et al 2014 therefore dbn models could be a promising method for streamflow prediction this study is therefore proposed to incorporate the multi variable fuzzy c means fcm based streamflow classification method and dbns for streamflow prediction the method also integrates the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso for input selection the method was applied to the tennessee river usa where global scale atmospheric oscillations sea surface temperatures sst and rainfall were considered as candidate predictors barlow et al 2001 kalra and ahmad 2009 risko and martinez 2014 as part of the study 1 the impact of different classification methods on the performance of prediction models were investigated 2 the performance of the dbn model was compared to that of the traditional anns for streamflow prediction the rest of the paper is arranged as follows the methods used for streamflow prediction including the lasso method for input selection the single variable threshold based and the multi variable fcm based streamflow classification methods and the traditional anns as well as dbns are introduced in section 2 the study area and data are presented in section 3 the results are presented and discussed in section 4 the last section concludes 2 method the proposed model development process is shown in fig 1 and it includes three stages the first stage is input selection during this stage lasso was employed to select the final predictors the inputs of dbn models that are suitable to predict streamflow the second stage is samples classification one sample is comprised of the input variables selected in the previous stage and the output variable at one month and there are hundreds of samples in the total datasets which were divided into low medium and high flow groups using either a single variable or a multi variable method the single variable streamflow classification method is based on pre selected threshold of rainfall the multi variable method is based on fcm details of these two methods are presented in detail in the subsections below the third stage is streamflow prediction model development three data driven models were developed at the stage each for a single flow regime two different model architectures i e traditional anns and dbns were used radial basis function neural network rrbfnn was used in this paper as a traditional ann model moradkhani et al 2004 finally model performance was evaluated using three statistic measures i e mae rmse and r2 details of the models used in this approach including lasso sample classification methods dbn are provided section 2 1 section 2 2 and section 2 3 below 2 1 least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso lasso proposed by tibshirani is an effective technique for shrinkage and selection it can reduce the regression coefficients as much as possible shrinkage and set some regression coefficients exactly to zero selection thus constraining the regression coefficients by the sum of the modulus or absolute values of the coefficients tibshirani 1996 daghir wojtkowiak et al 2015 kwon et al 2017 there is an important parameter lambda in the process of modeling using lasso the lambda parameter directly controls the number of predictors a predictor is selected if the absolute value of its covariance with the outcome is larger than lambda and excluded otherwise jiang et al 2016 marami milani et al 2016 for detailed description of lasso can be found in nardi and rinaldo 2011 and mcneish 2015 2 2 samples classification the purpose of classification is to group all the samples into three subsets each corresponding to the different relationships between hydro meteorological variables during the low medium and high flow regimes respectively thus individual models can be developed to simulate the distinctively different input output relationships within each flow regime improving model performance the single variable threshold based method and the multi variable fcm based methods are introduced below 2 2 1 single variable threshold based classification method the basic idea of the threshold based classification method is to describe a given stochastic process by a piecewise model according to the value of an observable variable termed the threshold variable with this method the total samples are split into three subsets according to the different threshold of rainfall as shown in fig 2 there are m samples in the total samples dataset and one sample is comprised of the inputs and the corresponding streamflow when the value of rainfall is less than a1 the sample will be classified into the left group if the value of rainfall is between a1 and a2 the sample will be classified into the center group and the value of rainfall is more than a2 the sample will be classified into the right group 2 2 2 multi variable fuzzy c means based classification method the fuzzy c means fcm clustering technique is a well known data clustering technique which assigns each data point to different clusters with multiple grades rundo et al 2017 let x x 1 x 2 x n denote a dataset including n samples and d is the dimension of each sample i e xi rd the fcm algorithm divides the dataset x into c clusters by minimizing an objective function f which is defined as follows 1 f i 1 n j 1 c u ij m x i c j 2 where m m 1 is the weight pollution index and we can obtain better clustering results when m 2 c j denotes the jth cluster centroid and u ij is the membership that the ith sample is divided into the jth cluster hinton et al 2006 chang et al 2017 the clustering process stops when either the maximum number of iterations is reached or the objective function improvement between two consecutive iterations is less than the specified minimum mahela and shaik 2017 he and tan 2017 this method consideres the relationships between multiple input and output variables and therefore is more stable and requires less computational effort as an unsupervised clustering algorithm kim et al 2011 2 3 deep belief networks dbns a dbn model includes multiple layers of restricted boltzmann machine rbm which is a two layer neural network consisting of one binary valued visible neurons layer and one layer of hidden units dedinec et al 2016 chen and li 2017 there are no connections between neurons in the same layer but full connections between neurons in different layers chao et al 2011 karabulut and ibrikci 2017 sabeena et al 2017 the structure of a rbm is illustrated in fig 3 the weights and biases of a rbm determine the energy of a joint configuration of the hidden and visible units 2 e v h θ i 1 m a i v i j 1 n b j h j i 1 m j 1 n v i w ij h j where θ w a b are model parameters w are the symmetric weight parameters a are the visible unit bias parameters b are the hidden unit bias parameters with the aid of certain pre training principles the unknown rbm parameters i e w a and b can be determined in an unsupervised manner then the probability distributions over visible and hidden layers can be defined in terms of the energy function 3 p v h 1 z e e v h let v i and h j represent the states of visible unit i and hidden unit j respectively and w ij w ji the bidirectional weights the state probabilities of the units are 4 p vi p v i 1 1 1 exp j w ij h j 5 p hj p h j 1 1 1 exp i w ij v i following the gradient of the log likelihood we obtained the update rule for the weights as 6 δ w ij η v j h j v j h j where η is a learning rate v j h j represents the mathematical expectation under the original data driving data distribution v j h j represents the mathematical expectation under the reconstructed data driving data distribution qiu et al 2014 ghasemi et al 2017 two stages were included in the training process of the dbn model pre training stage and fine tuning stage in the pre training stage the parameters of dbns are initialized and then the layer by layer network training methods are used one layer of rbm is used to train each time and the output result is used as the input layer to the next rbm fink et al 2015 uddin et al 2017 the layers are trained one by one until all the layers of rbm are completed and the weight and bias value of each layer are retained accordingly he et al 2017 in order to make the network performance better the gradient descent algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters of the whole network papa et al 2015 qin et al 2017 this stage is similar to the back propagation bp neural network algorithm the weights in each layer have been pertained by the rbm before fine tuning which is not in random initialization like the bp neural networks have thus avoiding the situation of premature convergence chen et al 2016 shao et al 2017 dbns are probabilistic generative models that are composed of multiple layers of rbms rbms can efficiently pre train the initial weights of the networks using a layer by layer unsupervised learning and then the fine tuning procedure is carried out based on stochastic gradient descent to slightly adjust the weights of the whole network the learning algorithm and fine tuning procedure enable dbn to achieve the high performance and avoid over fitting kuremoto et al 2014 3 study area and data description the case study area is the tennessee river located in the tennessee usa which is the largest tributary of the ohio river fig 4 tennessee river has a length of approximately 1049 km and it flows through tennessee and kentucky and then flows into the ohio river there are two gauging stations knoxville 35 78 n 83 88 w and franklin 35 48 n 87 82 w in the upstream and downstream of tennessee river respectively two gauging stations were identified on streams that had unimpaired catchments and long relatively complete streamflow records average annual rainfall in the area is about 1400 mm and it ranges from 1350 mm to 1450 mm from east to west average annual temperature in the area is 13 9 c while average annual temperatures range from 11 1 c to 14 4 c across the area the warmest months of the year are july and august and the coldest months of the year are typically january and february the aim of this study is to predict streamflow at two stations using the rainfall sst and large scale climatic variability 3 1 data four types of data were collected and used in this study streamflow output rainfall sst and large scale climatic variability data streamflow data are available from two unimpaired united states geological survey usgs streamflow gauging stations in the upstream and downstream of tennessee river respectively for this study we used monthly streamflow data from usgs gauge stations knoxville and franklin between january 1950 and december 2016 all the data were at the monthly scale from 1950 to 2016 so there were 804 input output pairs samples the data from 1950 to 2006 684 samples were used for calibration and the data from 2007 to 2016 120 samples for validation monthly

and variance are presented in table 1 at the station knoxville the monthly streamflow ranges from 117 m3 s to 5227 m3 s and the mean and variance values 797 m3 s and 790 m3 s and it has an obvious fluctuation there are 441 samples in which monthly streamflow ranges from 120 m3 s to 630 m3 s nearly half of the total samples and the monthly rainfall ranges from 0 25 mm to 364 mm and the mean and variance values 111 mm and 57 mm it shows the normal distribution in rainfall in the station franklin large fluctuation can be observed in monthly streamflow sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 also computed the standard deviation of monthly streamflow observed at 639 stations in the us and it also show the standard deviation of the area where two stations are located is higher than that of the other area 4 results and discussion 4 1 input selection in total 19 candidate predictors including rainfall ao pna pdo nao soi nino3 nino4 nino3 4 and sst for ten regions which were selected by the regions of large scale atmospheric circulation sst1 10 were sued to predict streamflow at both gauges lasso was used to determine the optimal predictors for two stations in the tennessee river fig 5 shows a plot of the mse and se as output for various values of lambda vertical lines represent the value for lambda selected according to the mse method the red dots are mse and the bars indicate mse se and mse se as the values of λ increases all regression coefficients shrink to zero and mse becomes higher which indicates the predictive power of the model is poor as the values of λ decreases regression coefficients do not shrink to zero the plot appears to flatten the imposed vertical line in fig 5 indicates the sum of mse and se is minimum when the relative position of the largest λ value is 3 5 according to the lasso results the significant predictors were selected and prepared for streamflow prediction models as the inputs there were seven predictors selected including rainfall pna nao sst 2 sst 8 and sst 10 the results agreed with some previous studies discussed below pna is the dominant climate mode for the central united states mallakpour and villarini 2016 and tennessee river basin was very close to the central united states during the negative phase of pna there is a higher amount of moisture transported over the central united states in addition there are strong correlations between pdo warm and cold phases and pacific sst with south atlantic gulf regions sagarika et al 2015 where is located next to tennessee river basin the pacific sst bounded around 150e to 160w and 24 34n which was significantly correlated with south atlantic gulf regions acts as an important pathway for different air streams to divide and move into particular directions ultimately entering the western u s envelope and pressure differences in this region when sst is cooler can cause a cyclonic cell near the western u s enhancing subtropical jet and returning moist air from the subtropical pacific ocean the lasso analysis between the streamflow for two stations in the tennessee river and large scale climate patterns rainfall helped in understanding the responses to climate variability and provided a comprehensive understanding of the complex teleconnections to illustrate the effectiveness of lasso method different input combinations were used to analyze the impact of input selection to the accuracy of the forecasting models there are four input combinations the first input combination c1 includes rainfall ao pna pdo nao soi nino3 nino4 nino3 4 the second input combination c2 includes rainfall sst for ten regions the third input combination c2 includes rainfall pna soi sst 3 sst 5 and sst 10 which is selected by the correlation coefficient between streamflow and climate predictors and the number of the inputs is the same as lasso method s inputs the fourth input combination c4 includes rainfall pna nao sst 2 sst 8 and sst 10 which is selected by lasso method different sample datasets were obtained by different input combinations then different sample datasets were used to train the dbn models and compare the accuracy of different models with different input combinations and the results were shown in table 2 from table 2 it can be seen different input combinations have different effects on the prediction accuracy the results show that the forecasting models with the input combination selected by lasso method c4 during the calibration and validation period had best performance and the following is c3 c1 and c2 during validation period the order of r2 values was as follows c4 0 860 c3 0 788 c1 0 769 c2 0 696 the results indicate that input selection by lasso method can be an effective method in improving the prediction accuracy compared to the other methods 4 2 impact of streamflow classification one sample was comprised of seven predictors selected by lasso inputs and the corresponding streamflow output and there are 684 input output samples in the total dataset and the total dataset was classified into three subsets to represent different relationship between climate predictors and monthly streamflow to investigate the impact of different classification methods on the prediction model two classification methods combing with ann model and dbn model were discussed to investigate the effect of different rainfall thresholds on the accuracy of ann and dbn model four typical thresholds classification case 1 4 in station knoxville were selected to illustrate the effect process the maximum monthly streamflow is 360 m3 s and the minimum monthly streamflow is 0 m3 s and two values of streamflow between 0 and 360 should be selected randomly as the thresholds to divide the total samples into three subsets the thresholds of four cases were randomly generated case 1 120 240 case 2 80 130 case 3 60 230 and case 4 140 190 for example the thresholds of case 1 is 120 and 240 the value is divided into three intervals 0 120 120 240 240 360 case 1 means that when the rainfall value of this sample is less than 120 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of low value that is subset 1 when the rainfall value of this sample is greater than 120 and less than 240 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of middle value that is subset 2 when the rainfall value of this sample is greater than 240 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of high value that is subset 3 different subsets were obtained by different threshold classification then different subsets were used to train the ann and dbn models and compare the accuracy of different models with different thresholds classification and the results were shown in table 3 comprehensive evaluations of these models and cases are described in subsequent sections the results show that ann models with four cases during the calibration period had good performance the ann model case 3 during the validation period achieved more favorable performance lower mae rmse and higher r2 values than the other cases table 3 during validation period among the first four cases the order of r2 values was as follows case 3 0 776 case 2 0 760 case 1 0 753 case 4 0 726 when the dbn model was applied in the four cases the order of the r2 values during the validation period was as follows case 2 0 820 case 4 0 768 case 3 0 673 case 3 0 642 however dbn model case 2 performed best among the other cases from table 3 it can be seen different thresholds have different effects on the prediction accuracy for different ann models the r2 the prediction accuracy of different thresholds changes between 0 72 and 0 76 for different dbn models the r2 the prediction accuracy of different thresholds changes between 0 64 and 0 82 the influence of different threshold for dbn is greater than that for ann models for case 1 the number of subsets were 502 156 and 26 respectively for case 2 the number of subsets were 222 254 and 208 respectively for case 3 the number of subsets were 144 508 and 32 respectively for case 4 the number of subsets were 474 126 and 84 respectively the classification case 2 can maintain the number of different subsets and ensure the classification is reasonable when the number of some subsets is large and the number of some subsets is small the thresholds classification results of station franklin also show different thresholds have a great impact on the performance of ann and dbn models for fcm classifications in the station knoxville there are 684 training samples in total and 285 286 and 113 in each of the subsets respectively and the average monthly rainfall values were 62 mm 121 mm and 208 mm respectively and the corresponding variance were 21 mm 20 mm and 40 mm the average monthly corresponding streamflow values were 456 m3 s 791 m3 s and 1721 m3 s respectively for the another station franklin and the number of three subsets datasets were 307 265 and 112 respectively and the average monthly rainfall values were 117 mm 67 mm and 183 mm respectively and the variance were 16 mm 19 mm and 31 mm the average monthly corresponding streamflow values were 531 m3 s 300 m3 s and 1043 m3 s respectively subset low flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and low flow subset medium flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and medium flow subset high flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and high flow it is evident that there are the differences among different subsets obtained by fcm classifications results three different ann or dbn models with different parameters should be built based on the different subsets the result of case 2 was shown in table 3 during the model validation period the threshold and fcm classification methods with the dbn model resulted in maes of 0 355 and 0 283 rmses of 360 and 305 and correlation coefficients of 0 820 and 0 860 respectively from table 4 the performance of ann and dbn models with fcm classifications is better than those of threshold classifications the performance of ann or dbn based on threshold classification method is significantly affected by the threshold value however the performance improvement of fcm classifications is more stable than those of threshold classifications the results of station franklin also indicates that the performance improvement of ann and dbn models with fcm classifications is higher than those of threshold classifications in the table 5 4 3 comparison of traditional anns and dbns the comparison results are showed in tables 6 and 7 for station knoxville the performance of the ann and dbn models during the calibration period have maes of 0 346 and 0 261 rmses of 457 and 394 and r2 of 0 818 and 0 854 respectively during the model validation period these models resulted in maes of 0 410 and 0 361 rmses of 449 and 367 and r2 of 0 711 and 0 750 respectively for station franklin the performance of the ann and dbn models during the calibration period showed in maes of 0 637 and 0 574 rmses of 251 and 233 and r2 of 0 780 and 0 822 respectively during the model validation period these models resulted in maes of 0 641 and 0 585 rmses of 301 and 269 and r2 of 0 715 and 0 771 respectively for single ann and dbn models the dbn model performed better in the calibration and validation period in all three statistical measures the results also indicate that the lasso fcm dbn method also performs better than lasso fcm ann for station knoxville the r2 of different models during model calibration and validation period are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively lasso fcm dbn model has the r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 894 and 0 860 respectively and lasso fcm ann model has the r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 870 and 0 791 respectively fig 8 displays the comparison between predicted and observed streamflow during model validation using ann dbn lasso fcm ann and lasso fcm dbn to show the temporal performance it can be seen that lasso fcm dbn forecasts show generally more agreement with the observed streamflow than the other others dbn models can discover the inherent features and hidden invariant structures in data from layer to layer therefore the performance of dbn models exhibits superiority and higher accuracy in monthly streamflow prediction figs 9 and 10 illustrate the streamflow forecasts of station franklin with and without fcm and lasso during model calibration and validation using ann and dbn models the r2 statistics of different models were given in figs 9 and 10 and lasso fcm dbn model has the highest r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 920 and 0 890 respectively and single ann model has the smallest r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 780 and 0 715 respectively from the figures it is evident that the dbn models provide better monthly streamflow predictions than the ann and lasso fcm dbn ann models out performed the single ann dbn model for predicting monthly streamflow the results discussed above show that the performance of lasso fcm dbn ann models performed better than those of single dbn ann this analysis also indicates that input selection and hydro meteorological conditions classification can assist in improving the performance of ann and dbn models it is demonstrated that lasso fcm dbn produced significantly more accurate prediction results than the traditional prediction models the hydro meteorological conditions associations identified through the current study may be used to improve streamflow predictability and enhance management of streamflow volumes in advance however from figs 6 and 9 part of low values are overestimated suggesting a difficulties of these models to describe the lower magnitude flow with limited streamflow data 5 conclusions streamflow in some basins changes dramatically from time to time and the relationships between the climate variables and streamflow at different levels are different which make accurate and reliable streamflow prediction more complex and difficult the paper integrates lasso fcm and dbn in simultaneously considering the selection of predictors deep learning prediction at river basin scale the model was applied to predict monthly streamflow at two stations in the tennessee river basin data driven models including ann model and dbn model were used for streamflow prediction and dbn model performed much better than the ann models in terms of the statistical measures then the threshold classification and fcm classification methods were compared for threshold classification different thresholds have different effects on the prediction accuracy the influence of different threshold for dbn is greater than that for ann models and the performance of fcm classification was more stable than that of threshold based classification the samples were then split into different subsets to represent different relationship between climate variables and streamflow for different flow regime the dbn models were developed for monthly streamflow based on different samples subsets and the performance was compared with the conventional ann models which were built without data classification overall the dbn model combined with fcm classification performed better than single ann and dbn models the results show that the prediction models based on the classification method can improve the accuracy of streamflow prediction compared to the traditional ann models without samples classification the lasso helps to screen the predictors to select appropriate inputs for streamflow prediction models the sample classification contributes to identifying different relationships between the predictors and streamflow at different flow levels and the dbn model simulates the complex relationships between the predictors at different scales and streamflow the integration of these models produced significantly improved results than traditional prediction models as a results the proposed approach will be invaluable for future water resources management and planning a piecewise prediction model need to develop three single dbn models and three times as much as the number of parameters need to be trained so an effective way to optimize the parameters should be investigated in the future there is a big difference of the number of different subsets generated by the classification method which may affect the accuracy of different models corresponding to the subsets in addition further work is required to consider the duplicate use of samples in different sub samples e g one sample may be classified into low and medium flow datasets at the same time or high flow datasets at the same time and its impact on final model performance declaration of competing

6007,streamflow prediction is a challenging task due to the different processes involved in streamflow generation these different processes have different characteristics of the relationships between hydro meteorological variables and streamflow which make it a challenging task to develop single data driven stream flow prediction models that can map the input output relationships for all different streamflow regimes to improve the performance of streamflow prediction we proposed a flow regime dependent approach to map the relationships between hydro meteorological variables and streamflow based on hydro meteorological condition classification this approach integrates the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso fuzzy c means fcm and deep belief networks dbn and therefore referred to as the lasso fcm dbn approach this approach employs lasso to select the hydro meteorological variables which have a significant impact on streamflow fcm to identify different streamflow regimes and dbn as a data driven model to map the nonlinear and complex relationships between the selected hydro meteorological variables and streamflow within different flow regimes to assess the performance of the proposed approach two comparative studies were carried out 1 the multi variable fcm was compared to the traditional single variable threshold based method and 2 the performance of the dbn was compared to a traditional artificial neural networks anns model two stations in the tennessee river usa were used as the case study the results demonstrate that the performance of the multi variable based fcm classification method is better and more stable than the traditional threshold based single variable method due to the sensitivity of the single variable method to different threshold values in addition dbns performed better than traditional anns in all three statistical measures considered overall the lasso fcm dbn multi model system significantly improved the performance of streamflow prediction and is therefore a valuable tool for water resources management and planning keywords streamflow prediction lasso deep belief networks fuzzy c means classification 1 introduction streamflow prediction is a challenging task especially in regions with high streamflow variability due to the significantly different flow characteristics within low medium and high flow regimes zhang and govindaraju 2000 low medium and high flows are associated with different hydrological processes and have different dynamical properties caballero et al 2007 stahl et al 2011 low flows often occur in periods with retention and slow release of water and therefore have lower frequency fluctuations whereas high flows directly respond to water input and often have higher frequency fluctuations groisman et al 2001 in addition base flow is the major contribution to low flow events while high flow events are primarily resulted from intense storm rainfall wu et al 2009 therefore it is difficult to develop a single global data driven model to predict low medium and high flow levels and multiple models may be required to predict flows in different flow regimes separately classification methods have been used to identify different flow regimes and improve the performance of streamflow prediction models cannas et al 2006 shrestha and solomatine 2006 wu et al 2008 hu et al 2001 developed a range dependent network model for daily streamflow prediction based on the threshold auto regressive tar which was used to classify the total samples based on pre defined threshold values of streamflow solomatine and xue 2004 used m5 model trees and multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks anns for flood forecasting the m5 model trees were used to split flood samples with different hydrological characteristics into different groups sivapragasam and liong 2005 divided flows into high medium and low flow groups before developing a streamflow prediction model for each flow regime wu et al 2009 used the fcm method to divide the original training dataset into a couple of subsets and then an ann model was developed for each subset independently to predict river flow in all these studies a single variable threshold based method was used to stratify streamflow into different groups there is little discussion on the selection of threshold values and the impact of different threshold values on model performance furthermore streamflow generation is impacted by multiple processes including rainfall potential evaporation temperature among others so a multi variable classification method is more suitable however the impact of different classification methods on the performance of the forecasting models needs to be discussed further different data driven models have been used to predict streamflow karran et al 2014 liu et al 2014 yang et al 2017b among which the ann based approach is most popular edossa and babel 2011 guimarães santos and silva 2014 makwana and tiwari 2014 recently a new ann model the deep belief networks dbn showed encouraging performance apart from its ability to map multiple non linear relationships its distinctive unsupervised pre training feature avoids over fitting and improves generalization ability zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2017a dbn models have already been applied successfully to solve many real world problems including image classification brosch and tam 2015 drought forecasting chen et al 2012 and information retrieval lv et al 2015 sarikaya et al 2014 therefore dbn models could be a promising method for streamflow prediction this study is therefore proposed to incorporate the multi variable fuzzy c means fcm based streamflow classification method and dbns for streamflow prediction the method also integrates the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso for input selection the method was applied to the tennessee river usa where global scale atmospheric oscillations sea surface temperatures sst and rainfall were considered as candidate predictors barlow et al 2001 kalra and ahmad 2009 risko and martinez 2014 as part of the study 1 the impact of different classification methods on the performance of prediction models were investigated 2 the performance of the dbn model was compared to that of the traditional anns for streamflow prediction the rest of the paper is arranged as follows the methods used for streamflow prediction including the lasso method for input selection the single variable threshold based and the multi variable fcm based streamflow classification methods and the traditional anns as well as dbns are introduced in section 2 the study area and data are presented in section 3 the results are presented and discussed in section 4 the last section concludes 2 method the proposed model development process is shown in fig 1 and it includes three stages the first stage is input selection during this stage lasso was employed to select the final predictors the inputs of dbn models that are suitable to predict streamflow the second stage is samples classification one sample is comprised of the input variables selected in the previous stage and the output variable at one month and there are hundreds of samples in the total datasets which were divided into low medium and high flow groups using either a single variable or a multi variable method the single variable streamflow classification method is based on pre selected threshold of rainfall the multi variable method is based on fcm details of these two methods are presented in detail in the subsections below the third stage is streamflow prediction model development three data driven models were developed at the stage each for a single flow regime two different model architectures i e traditional anns and dbns were used radial basis function neural network rrbfnn was used in this paper as a traditional ann model moradkhani et al 2004 finally model performance was evaluated using three statistic measures i e mae rmse and r2 details of the models used in this approach including lasso sample classification methods dbn are provided section 2 1 section 2 2 and section 2 3 below 2 1 least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso lasso proposed by tibshirani is an effective technique for shrinkage and selection it can reduce the regression coefficients as much as possible shrinkage and set some regression coefficients exactly to zero selection thus constraining the regression coefficients by the sum of the modulus or absolute values of the coefficients tibshirani 1996 daghir wojtkowiak et al 2015 kwon et al 2017 there is an important parameter lambda in the process of modeling using lasso the lambda parameter directly controls the number of predictors a predictor is selected if the absolute value of its covariance with the outcome is larger than lambda and excluded otherwise jiang et al 2016 marami milani et al 2016 for detailed description of lasso can be found in nardi and rinaldo 2011 and mcneish 2015 2 2 samples classification the purpose of classification is to group all the samples into three subsets each corresponding to the different relationships between hydro meteorological variables during the low medium and high flow regimes respectively thus individual models can be developed to simulate the distinctively different input output relationships within each flow regime improving model performance the single variable threshold based method and the multi variable fcm based methods are introduced below 2 2 1 single variable threshold based classification method the basic idea of the threshold based classification method is to describe a given stochastic process by a piecewise model according to the value of an observable variable termed the threshold variable with this method the total samples are split into three subsets according to the different threshold of rainfall as shown in fig 2 there are m samples in the total samples dataset and one sample is comprised of the inputs and the corresponding streamflow when the value of rainfall is less than a1 the sample will be classified into the left group if the value of rainfall is between a1 and a2 the sample will be classified into the center group and the value of rainfall is more than a2 the sample will be classified into the right group 2 2 2 multi variable fuzzy c means based classification method the fuzzy c means fcm clustering technique is a well known data clustering technique which assigns each data point to different clusters with multiple grades rundo et al 2017 let x x 1 x 2 x n denote a dataset including n samples and d is the dimension of each sample i e xi rd the fcm algorithm divides the dataset x into c clusters by minimizing an objective function f which is defined as follows 1 f i 1 n j 1 c u ij m x i c j 2 where m m 1 is the weight pollution index and we can obtain better clustering results when m 2 c j denotes the jth cluster centroid and u ij is the membership that the ith sample is divided into the jth cluster hinton et al 2006 chang et al 2017 the clustering process stops when either the maximum number of iterations is reached or the objective function improvement between two consecutive iterations is less than the specified minimum mahela and shaik 2017 he and tan 2017 this method consideres the relationships between multiple input and output variables and therefore is more stable and requires less computational effort as an unsupervised clustering algorithm kim et al 2011 2 3 deep belief networks dbns a dbn model includes multiple layers of restricted boltzmann machine rbm which is a two layer neural network consisting of one binary valued visible neurons layer and one layer of hidden units dedinec et al 2016 chen and li 2017 there are no connections between neurons in the same layer but full connections between neurons in different layers chao et al 2011 karabulut and ibrikci 2017 sabeena et al 2017 the structure of a rbm is illustrated in fig 3 the weights and biases of a rbm determine the energy of a joint configuration of the hidden and visible units 2 e v h θ i 1 m a i v i j 1 n b j h j i 1 m j 1 n v i w ij h j where θ w a b are model parameters w are the symmetric weight parameters a are the visible unit bias parameters b are the hidden unit bias parameters with the aid of certain pre training principles the unknown rbm parameters i e w a and b can be determined in an unsupervised manner then the probability distributions over visible and hidden layers can be defined in terms of the energy function 3 p v h 1 z e e v h let v i and h j represent the states of visible unit i and hidden unit j respectively and w ij w ji the bidirectional weights the state probabilities of the units are 4 p vi p v i 1 1 1 exp j w ij h j 5 p hj p h j 1 1 1 exp i w ij v i following the gradient of the log likelihood we obtained the update rule for the weights as 6 δ w ij η v j h j v j h j where η is a learning rate v j h j represents the mathematical expectation under the original data driving data distribution v j h j represents the mathematical expectation under the reconstructed data driving data distribution qiu et al 2014 ghasemi et al 2017 two stages were included in the training process of the dbn model pre training stage and fine tuning stage in the pre training stage the parameters of dbns are initialized and then the layer by layer network training methods are used one layer of rbm is used to train each time and the output result is used as the input layer to the next rbm fink et al 2015 uddin et al 2017 the layers are trained one by one until all the layers of rbm are completed and the weight and bias value of each layer are retained accordingly he et al 2017 in order to make the network performance better the gradient descent algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters of the whole network papa et al 2015 qin et al 2017 this stage is similar to the back propagation bp neural network algorithm the weights in each layer have been pertained by the rbm before fine tuning which is not in random initialization like the bp neural networks have thus avoiding the situation of premature convergence chen et al 2016 shao et al 2017 dbns are probabilistic generative models that are composed of multiple layers of rbms rbms can efficiently pre train the initial weights of the networks using a layer by layer unsupervised learning and then the fine tuning procedure is carried out based on stochastic gradient descent to slightly adjust the weights of the whole network the learning algorithm and fine tuning procedure enable dbn to achieve the high performance and avoid over fitting kuremoto et al 2014 3 study area and data description the case study area is the tennessee river located in the tennessee usa which is the largest tributary of the ohio river fig 4 tennessee river has a length of approximately 1049 km and it flows through tennessee and kentucky and then flows into the ohio river there are two gauging stations knoxville 35 78 n 83 88 w and franklin 35 48 n 87 82 w in the upstream and downstream of tennessee river respectively two gauging stations were identified on streams that had unimpaired catchments and long relatively complete streamflow records average annual rainfall in the area is about 1400 mm and it ranges from 1350 mm to 1450 mm from east to west average annual temperature in the area is 13 9 c while average annual temperatures range from 11 1 c to 14 4 c across the area the warmest months of the year are july and august and the coldest months of the year are typically january and february the aim of this study is to predict streamflow at two stations using the rainfall sst and large scale climatic variability 3 1 data four types of data were collected and used in this study streamflow output rainfall sst and large scale climatic variability data streamflow data are available from two unimpaired united states geological survey usgs streamflow gauging stations in the upstream and downstream of tennessee river respectively for this study we used monthly streamflow data from usgs gauge stations knoxville and franklin between january 1950 and december 2016 all the data were at the monthly scale from 1950 to 2016 so there were 804 input output pairs samples the data from 1950 to 2006 684 samples were used for calibration and the data from 2007 to 2016 120 samples for validation monthly

and variance are presented in table 1 at the station knoxville the monthly streamflow ranges from 117 m3 s to 5227 m3 s and the mean and variance values 797 m3 s and 790 m3 s and it has an obvious fluctuation there are 441 samples in which monthly streamflow ranges from 120 m3 s to 630 m3 s nearly half of the total samples and the monthly rainfall ranges from 0 25 mm to 364 mm and the mean and variance values 111 mm and 57 mm it shows the normal distribution in rainfall in the station franklin large fluctuation can be observed in monthly streamflow sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 also computed the standard deviation of monthly streamflow observed at 639 stations in the us and it also show the standard deviation of the area where two stations are located is higher than that of the other area 4 results and discussion 4 1 input selection in total 19 candidate predictors including rainfall ao pna pdo nao soi nino3 nino4 nino3 4 and sst for ten regions which were selected by the regions of large scale atmospheric circulation sst1 10 were sued to predict streamflow at both gauges lasso was used to determine the optimal predictors for two stations in the tennessee river fig 5 shows a plot of the mse and se as output for various values of lambda vertical lines represent the value for lambda selected according to the mse method the red dots are mse and the bars indicate mse se and mse se as the values of λ increases all regression coefficients shrink to zero and mse becomes higher which indicates the predictive power of the model is poor as the values of λ decreases regression coefficients do not shrink to zero the plot appears to flatten the imposed vertical line in fig 5 indicates the sum of mse and se is minimum when the relative position of the largest λ value is 3 5 according to the lasso results the significant predictors were selected and prepared for streamflow prediction models as the inputs there were seven predictors selected including rainfall pna nao sst 2 sst 8 and sst 10 the results agreed with some previous studies discussed below pna is the dominant climate mode for the central united states mallakpour and villarini 2016 and tennessee river basin was very close to the central united states during the negative phase of pna there is a higher amount of moisture transported over the central united states in addition there are strong correlations between pdo warm and cold phases and pacific sst with south atlantic gulf regions sagarika et al 2015 where is located next to tennessee river basin the pacific sst bounded around 150e to 160w and 24 34n which was significantly correlated with south atlantic gulf regions acts as an important pathway for different air streams to divide and move into particular directions ultimately entering the western u s envelope and pressure differences in this region when sst is cooler can cause a cyclonic cell near the western u s enhancing subtropical jet and returning moist air from the subtropical pacific ocean the lasso analysis between the streamflow for two stations in the tennessee river and large scale climate patterns rainfall helped in understanding the responses to climate variability and provided a comprehensive understanding of the complex teleconnections to illustrate the effectiveness of lasso method different input combinations were used to analyze the impact of input selection to the accuracy of the forecasting models there are four input combinations the first input combination c1 includes rainfall ao pna pdo nao soi nino3 nino4 nino3 4 the second input combination c2 includes rainfall sst for ten regions the third input combination c2 includes rainfall pna soi sst 3 sst 5 and sst 10 which is selected by the correlation coefficient between streamflow and climate predictors and the number of the inputs is the same as lasso method s inputs the fourth input combination c4 includes rainfall pna nao sst 2 sst 8 and sst 10 which is selected by lasso method different sample datasets were obtained by different input combinations then different sample datasets were used to train the dbn models and compare the accuracy of different models with different input combinations and the results were shown in table 2 from table 2 it can be seen different input combinations have different effects on the prediction accuracy the results show that the forecasting models with the input combination selected by lasso method c4 during the calibration and validation period had best performance and the following is c3 c1 and c2 during validation period the order of r2 values was as follows c4 0 860 c3 0 788 c1 0 769 c2 0 696 the results indicate that input selection by lasso method can be an effective method in improving the prediction accuracy compared to the other methods 4 2 impact of streamflow classification one sample was comprised of seven predictors selected by lasso inputs and the corresponding streamflow output and there are 684 input output samples in the total dataset and the total dataset was classified into three subsets to represent different relationship between climate predictors and monthly streamflow to investigate the impact of different classification methods on the prediction model two classification methods combing with ann model and dbn model were discussed to investigate the effect of different rainfall thresholds on the accuracy of ann and dbn model four typical thresholds classification case 1 4 in station knoxville were selected to illustrate the effect process the maximum monthly streamflow is 360 m3 s and the minimum monthly streamflow is 0 m3 s and two values of streamflow between 0 and 360 should be selected randomly as the thresholds to divide the total samples into three subsets the thresholds of four cases were randomly generated case 1 120 240 case 2 80 130 case 3 60 230 and case 4 140 190 for example the thresholds of case 1 is 120 and 240 the value is divided into three intervals 0 120 120 240 240 360 case 1 means that when the rainfall value of this sample is less than 120 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of low value that is subset 1 when the rainfall value of this sample is greater than 120 and less than 240 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of middle value that is subset 2 when the rainfall value of this sample is greater than 240 the corresponding sample was assigned to the samples set of high value that is subset 3 different subsets were obtained by different threshold classification then different subsets were used to train the ann and dbn models and compare the accuracy of different models with different thresholds classification and the results were shown in table 3 comprehensive evaluations of these models and cases are described in subsequent sections the results show that ann models with four cases during the calibration period had good performance the ann model case 3 during the validation period achieved more favorable performance lower mae rmse and higher r2 values than the other cases table 3 during validation period among the first four cases the order of r2 values was as follows case 3 0 776 case 2 0 760 case 1 0 753 case 4 0 726 when the dbn model was applied in the four cases the order of the r2 values during the validation period was as follows case 2 0 820 case 4 0 768 case 3 0 673 case 3 0 642 however dbn model case 2 performed best among the other cases from table 3 it can be seen different thresholds have different effects on the prediction accuracy for different ann models the r2 the prediction accuracy of different thresholds changes between 0 72 and 0 76 for different dbn models the r2 the prediction accuracy of different thresholds changes between 0 64 and 0 82 the influence of different threshold for dbn is greater than that for ann models for case 1 the number of subsets were 502 156 and 26 respectively for case 2 the number of subsets were 222 254 and 208 respectively for case 3 the number of subsets were 144 508 and 32 respectively for case 4 the number of subsets were 474 126 and 84 respectively the classification case 2 can maintain the number of different subsets and ensure the classification is reasonable when the number of some subsets is large and the number of some subsets is small the thresholds classification results of station franklin also show different thresholds have a great impact on the performance of ann and dbn models for fcm classifications in the station knoxville there are 684 training samples in total and 285 286 and 113 in each of the subsets respectively and the average monthly rainfall values were 62 mm 121 mm and 208 mm respectively and the corresponding variance were 21 mm 20 mm and 40 mm the average monthly corresponding streamflow values were 456 m3 s 791 m3 s and 1721 m3 s respectively for the another station franklin and the number of three subsets datasets were 307 265 and 112 respectively and the average monthly rainfall values were 117 mm 67 mm and 183 mm respectively and the variance were 16 mm 19 mm and 31 mm the average monthly corresponding streamflow values were 531 m3 s 300 m3 s and 1043 m3 s respectively subset low flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and low flow subset medium flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and medium flow subset high flow may represent the relationships between the climate variables and high flow it is evident that there are the differences among different subsets obtained by fcm classifications results three different ann or dbn models with different parameters should be built based on the different subsets the result of case 2 was shown in table 3 during the model validation period the threshold and fcm classification methods with the dbn model resulted in maes of 0 355 and 0 283 rmses of 360 and 305 and correlation coefficients of 0 820 and 0 860 respectively from table 4 the performance of ann and dbn models with fcm classifications is better than those of threshold classifications the performance of ann or dbn based on threshold classification method is significantly affected by the threshold value however the performance improvement of fcm classifications is more stable than those of threshold classifications the results of station franklin also indicates that the performance improvement of ann and dbn models with fcm classifications is higher than those of threshold classifications in the table 5 4 3 comparison of traditional anns and dbns the comparison results are showed in tables 6 and 7 for station knoxville the performance of the ann and dbn models during the calibration period have maes of 0 346 and 0 261 rmses of 457 and 394 and r2 of 0 818 and 0 854 respectively during the model validation period these models resulted in maes of 0 410 and 0 361 rmses of 449 and 367 and r2 of 0 711 and 0 750 respectively for station franklin the performance of the ann and dbn models during the calibration period showed in maes of 0 637 and 0 574 rmses of 251 and 233 and r2 of 0 780 and 0 822 respectively during the model validation period these models resulted in maes of 0 641 and 0 585 rmses of 301 and 269 and r2 of 0 715 and 0 771 respectively for single ann and dbn models the dbn model performed better in the calibration and validation period in all three statistical measures the results also indicate that the lasso fcm dbn method also performs better than lasso fcm ann for station knoxville the r2 of different models during model calibration and validation period are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively lasso fcm dbn model has the r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 894 and 0 860 respectively and lasso fcm ann model has the r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 870 and 0 791 respectively fig 8 displays the comparison between predicted and observed streamflow during model validation using ann dbn lasso fcm ann and lasso fcm dbn to show the temporal performance it can be seen that lasso fcm dbn forecasts show generally more agreement with the observed streamflow than the other others dbn models can discover the inherent features and hidden invariant structures in data from layer to layer therefore the performance of dbn models exhibits superiority and higher accuracy in monthly streamflow prediction figs 9 and 10 illustrate the streamflow forecasts of station franklin with and without fcm and lasso during model calibration and validation using ann and dbn models the r2 statistics of different models were given in figs 9 and 10 and lasso fcm dbn model has the highest r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 920 and 0 890 respectively and single ann model has the smallest r2 in model calibration and validation period with the value of 0 780 and 0 715 respectively from the figures it is evident that the dbn models provide better monthly streamflow predictions than the ann and lasso fcm dbn ann models out performed the single ann dbn model for predicting monthly streamflow the results discussed above show that the performance of lasso fcm dbn ann models performed better than those of single dbn ann this analysis also indicates that input selection and hydro meteorological conditions classification can assist in improving the performance of ann and dbn models it is demonstrated that lasso fcm dbn produced significantly more accurate prediction results than the traditional prediction models the hydro meteorological conditions associations identified through the current study may be used to improve streamflow predictability and enhance management of streamflow volumes in advance however from figs 6 and 9 part of low values are overestimated suggesting a difficulties of these models to describe the lower magnitude flow with limited streamflow data 5 conclusions streamflow in some basins changes dramatically from time to time and the relationships between the climate variables and streamflow at different levels are different which make accurate and reliable streamflow prediction more complex and difficult the paper integrates lasso fcm and dbn in simultaneously considering the selection of predictors deep learning prediction at river basin scale the model was applied to predict monthly streamflow at two stations in the tennessee river basin data driven models including ann model and dbn model were used for streamflow prediction and dbn model performed much better than the ann models in terms of the statistical measures then the threshold classification and fcm classification methods were compared for threshold classification different thresholds have different effects on the prediction accuracy the influence of different threshold for dbn is greater than that for ann models and the performance of fcm classification was more stable than that of threshold based classification the samples were then split into different subsets to represent different relationship between climate variables and streamflow for different flow regime the dbn models were developed for monthly streamflow based on different samples subsets and the performance was compared with the conventional ann models which were built without data classification overall the dbn model combined with fcm classification performed better than single ann and dbn models the results show that the prediction models based on the classification method can improve the accuracy of streamflow prediction compared to the traditional ann models without samples classification the lasso helps to screen the predictors to select appropriate inputs for streamflow prediction models the sample classification contributes to identifying different relationships between the predictors and streamflow at different flow levels and the dbn model simulates the complex relationships between the predictors at different scales and streamflow the integration of these models produced significantly improved results than traditional prediction models as a results the proposed approach will be invaluable for future water resources management and planning a piecewise prediction model need to develop three single dbn models and three times as much as the number of parameters need to be trained so an effective way to optimize the parameters should be investigated in the future there is a big difference of the number of different subsets generated by the classification method which may affect the accuracy of different models corresponding to the subsets in addition further work is required to consider the duplicate use of samples in different sub samples e g one sample may be classified into low and medium flow datasets at the same time or high flow datasets at the same time and its impact on final model performance declaration of competing

6008,this work presents the electrical resistivity imaging of the hydrogeological experimental site hes karst aquifer of poitiers france from pseudo three dimensional 3 d electrical resistivity tomography ert i e a three dimensional model obtained from the joint inversion of resistivity data collected along parallel profiles the inverse resistivity model provided a fairly reliable definition of the main hydrogeological units the survey also allowed the recognition of possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures that do not show any ground expression at present but have been revealed at depth by vertical flowmeter data and high resolution video footage from wells these features seem to connect with middle depth sub vertical features down to a depth of 25 m which are likely to correlate with soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features that do not show any ground expression at present as well as karst conduits at greater depth the resistivity model allowed the recognition of the first two main karst intervals 35 40 m and 85 87 m deep associated with water productive layers as revealed by well logs the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by the hes allowed an assessment of the error the pseudo 3 d ert model makes in estimating the depth of the karst intervals synthetic dataset modelling provided the detectability of the pseudo 3 d ert model in identifying karst intervals synthetic dataset modelling also allowed an estimation of the response of the experimental and inversion setup to a variable degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer using well log data as geological a priori information keywords hydrogeological experimental site of poitiers karst aquifer ert pseudo 3 d resistivity tomography 1 introduction electrical resistivity tomography ert is a proven imaging technique where the theory cf arato et al 2014 athanasiou et al 2007 buvat et al 2013 dahlin and loke 1998 daily and owen 1991 loke et al 2003 spiegel et al 1980 and application cf cassiani et al 2009 daily and ramirez 1992 griffiths and barker 1993 guérin and benderitter 1995 guérin et al 2004 kuras et al 2009 ritz et al 1999 are well documented in geophysical literature ert is a technique well suited to identifying karst features and it partially characterizes karst aquifers karst features can be predominantly air filled making them highly resistive e g 1000 ω m or partially or completely water filled e g 60 1000 ω m in the latter case depending on the ionic concentration of the groundwater karst features may have a bulk conductivity ranging from very conductive e g 60 100 ω m to relatively conductive e g 100 250 ω m compared to the host rock e g 2000 ω m for not karst limestone karst features may also be filled by highly weathered material such as clays in which case they will be conductive relative to the host rock e g 60 150 ω m there have been many applications of electrical resistivity methods to detect karst features sinkholes and cavities see for instance al zoubi et al 2007 carrière et al 2013 maillol et al 1999 rainone et al 2015 satitpittakul et al 2013 smith 1986 van schoor 2002 zhu et al 2011 meyerhoff et al 2012 2014 show the application of time lapse ert to study changes of electrical conductivity in karst aquifers during times of varying discharge this work presents the electrical resistivity imaging of the hydrogeological experimental site hes karst aquifer of poitiers france poitou charentes region from pseudo three dimensional 3 d ert this is a 3 d model obtained from the joint inversion not simply 2 d data interpolation of resistivity data collected along parallel profiles the target of the study is to provide further insights into the applicability and effectiveness of pseudo 3 d ert in karst aquifer investigation at relatively great depth down to 100 m better accuracy may be obtained from actual 3 d ert surveys i e data actually collected along the three directions rather than pseudo 3 d surveys but at these depths the pseudo 3 d survey is often an enforced choice due to the significant use of field equipment i e very long multi core cables that a 3 d ert survey would involve the main geophysical targets of this study are represented by karst intervals i e zones of void development as identified by well logs the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by the hes allowed an evaluation of the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model and the effectiveness of some of the most common surface electrode arrays in investigating difficult geological targets such as karst aquifers the detectability of karst intervals provided by the pseudo 3 d ert model was assessed through synthetic dataset modelling i e a numerical simulation aimed at evaluating the capacity of the implemented pseudo 3 d ert survey to detect predefined targets at the hes well log data available from the dense well network at the hes were used as geological a priori input information for the generation of synthetic models syms representing different features of the hes aquifer therefore the synthetic datasets produced by forward modelling through the application of the syms were inverted to generate synthetic dataset models to be compared with field dataset models this approach allowed an estimation of the response of the experimental and inversion setup to a variable degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer and guided the interpretation of field data 1 1 geological setting of the test site the hes of poitiers is located on the southern border of the paris basin fig 1 a in this region jurassic limestone outcrops or lays beneath a thin cover of tertiary clays fig s1 in the supporting information and is slightly tilted toward the north this monoclinic structure is cut by sub vertical faults from several tectonic phases between the eocene and pliocene epochs burbaud vergneaud 1987 delay et al 2004 2007 kaczmaryk and delay 2007a b with the development to the south of horst structures like those of seuil du poitou and ligugé jurassic aquifers are therefore sub horizontal limestone and vertically fractured along the n s and e w directions the hercynian crystalline basement underlies the jurassic limestone fig s1 in the supporting information 1 2 the hydrogeological experimental site hes the hes of poitiers fig 1a b was developed by the institut de chimie des milieux et des matériaux de poitiers university of poitiers and french national center for scientific research within the network of national hydrogeological sites sno h the hes is found on the seuil du poitou a large mesozoic carbonate plateau marking the transition between the aquitaine and paris sedimentary basins the hes is located in one of the main regional aquifers which includes i the lower and middle lias aquifer 5 to 10 m thick and ii the dogger aquifer approximately 100 m thick these aquifers are hydraulically separated by the marly toarcian aquitard 20 m thick an argillaceous limestone approximately 30 m thick overlies the dogger aquifer indicating that the dogger aquifer is sealed beneath this thick relatively impermeable formation thirty five fully penetrating open wells were drilled with destructive techniques using a down the hole dth hammer rotary until the top of toarcian marls located at a depth of approximately 125 m fig 1b all the holes completely traverse the dogger aquifer these wells were cased with a 0 24 m diameter steel pipe to depths ranging from 15 to 80 m below the steel casing some wells were uncased while others were partly or fully screened with a 0 17 m diameter machine slotted pvc pipe most of the wells were arranged according to a regular grid in a square area measuring 210 210 m according to a multiscale nested five spot pattern audouin et al 2008 their fig 2 this pattern is classically used in petroleum engineering to improve oil recovery by simultaneously injecting water into the corner wells and pumping oil in the central well this technique was used at the hes to optimize the tracer recovery during tracer tests and to provide an experimental facility for flow and transport upscaling studies a large volume of data was collected from the dogger aquifer these data stored in the h database de dreuzy et al 2006 include the geologic structure of the reservoir bourbiaux et al 2007 well logs audouin 2007 petrophysical properties porosity and permeability measurements bourbiaux et al 2007 flow conditions in the boreholes audouin et al 2008 water table dynamics audouin 2007 audouin bodin 2007 2008 bernard delay 2008 bernard et al 2006 delay et al 2004 delay et al 2007 kaczmaryk delay 2007a b and the 3 d seismic imaging of the reservoir mari porel 2008a under natural flow conditions the piezometric level that measured in the boreholes which are screened open hole over the entire length of the aquifer represents the average hydraulic head over the thickness of the aquifer varies from 20 m to 25 m below ground level bgl however due to heavy rainfall a piezometric level of 17 mbgl was observed during ert data collection the aquifer is highly heterogeneous with local variations in both lithology and fracture density as revealed by the correlation between natural gamma and long normal resistivity logs audouin et al 2008 their fig 5 the 3 d porosity block achieved by 3 d seismic surveys mari porel 2008b and the variability in borehole yields that range from less than 5 m3 h to 60 m3 h the boreholes with higher yields are those which intercept at least one karst feature vertical flowmeter data and high resolution photography reveal two sets of fractures fissures a main set that is nw se oriented and a minor n s oriented set there are also three different main karst intervals i e zones of void development at depths of 35 40 m 85 87 m and 110 115 m audouin et al 2008 these were also confirmed by stratigraphic and resistivity well logs heat pulse flowmeter logs and borehole imaging analyses show that inflow levels are associated to sub horizontal karst structures which are confined within vuggy limestone layers these vuggy levels are well marked by dark shades on borehole images audouin et al 2008 their fig 10 a net increase in macroscopic porosity is associated to the localized presence of dissolution cavities 1 3 cm in diameter the vertical interconnectivity between the three karst intervals seems to result from sub vertical fracture occurrence as revealed by borehole imaging fractures are either isolated or concentrated within fracture zones no large cavities have been intercepted by wells however the presence of sub vertical conduits or cavities of a significant size cannot be excluded considering that sub vertical features are under sampled by the vertical wells karst intervals water filled lead to a fall in the resistivity of the dogger limestone an example of stratigraphic and resistivity logs for well m04 is shown in fig 2 cross sections of well logs have been shown by audouin et al 2008 their figs 5 and 10 2 materials and methods 2 1 field dataset collection ert field data were collected between 17 and 22 june 2013 at the hes with a fully automatic multi electrode resistivity meter the syscal jr switch 48 by iris instruments 400 v max output voltage 1200 ma max output current 100 w max output power ert data were collected using a wenner schlumberger ws array which delivers high vertical resolution and signal amplitude and a pole dipole pd array that shows high lateral resolution and penetration depth and even if it is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength smith 1986 in accordance with szalai et al 2009 who report that it is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays differing in depth of investigation and resolution a hybrid array sequence was obtained by merging ws and pd array sequences the acquisition layout comprised of 48 electrodes at 10 m intervals along five parallel 470 m long surface profiles ert 1 ert 5 and with each profile approximately 50 m apart the pd array comprised of a remote electrode at a distance of 960 m from the center of the 3 d block fig 1b the quadrupole sequence for each profile comprised of 596 measurements for the ws array and 699 measurements for the pd array the hybrid array sequence comprised of 1 295 measurements for each profile three dimensional resistivity grids 481 m 203 m in size with a maximum depth ranging from 90 m for the ws array and 130 m for the pd were designed for merging 2 d ert data details on field dataset collection are provided in text s1 in the supporting information pseudo sections reveal six intervals of apparent resistivity which represent different hydrogeological units including the two karst intervals fig s2 in the supporting information the third karst interval is not detectable due to its depth which is greater than the ert survey s maximum depth of investigation some erratic measurements seem to be related to the presence of a small very shallow buried body this body acting as source of noise is able to affect electrical resistivity measures and generates a severe measure artifact i e the pant leg anomaly shown by the pseudo section in fig s2a this anomaly is not due to the steel pipes all the wells are cased with to depths ranging from 15 to 80 m this finding is consistent with the results of resistivity surveys by other authors that did not record any noise due to the metallic casing from water wells located in the near vicinity of the surveys unlike self potential surveys see for instance saribudak and hawkins 2019 however the pant leg anomaly shown by the pseudo section in fig s2a was partially removed by data processing before inversion as shown in fig s2b 2 2 processing and inversion of the field dataset to verify the field dataset s capability to identify karst intervals 1 d resistivity soundings were extracted from ert apparent resistivity data fig s3 in the supporting information this approach allowed the verification that the first two karst intervals were correlated to an overall decrease in apparent resistivity data processing allowed outliers from apparent resistivity data to be removed problematic data showing unrealistically high resistivity 600 ω m too high standard deviation 10 ω m and negative resistivity that is unrealistic for 2 d data were removed from apparent data the pseudo 3 d resistivity imaging was obtained from the joint inversion of merged 2 d ert data ertlab solver by multi phase technologies llc geostudi astier srl based on tetrahedral finite element modelling fem was used for data inversion a tetrahedral discretization was used in both forward and inverse modelling the foreground region was discretized using a 27 1 m element size i e the weighted average of the electrode separation due to different electrode spacing along the x and y directions on the ground the background region was discretized using an increasing element size towards the outside of the domain according to the sequence 1 1 2 4 and 8 the foreground element size the forward modelling was performed using mixed boundary conditions dirichlet neumann and a tolerance stop criterion of 1 0e 7 for a symmetric successive over relaxation conjugate gradient ssorcg iterative solver data inversion was based on a least squares smoothness constrained approach labrecque et al 1996 noise was appropriately managed using a data weighting algorithm morelli and labrecque 1996 that allows the variance matrix after each iteration for data points poorly fitted by the model to be adaptively changed the inverse modelling was performed using a maximum number of internal inverse preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterations of 5 and a tolerance stop criterion for inverse pcg iterations of 0 001 the amount of roughness from one iteration to the next was controlled in order to assess maximum layering a low value of reweight constant 0 1 was set with the objective of generating maximum heterogeneity the inverse resistivity models figs 3 5 and fig s4 in the supporting information were obtained through the application of homogeneous starting models that set each node the average apparent resistivity value measured by the corresponding array sequence 54 ω m for ws 109 ω m for pd 77 ω m for hybrid the inverse final resistivity models were chosen with a criterion based on the achievement of a minimum data residual misfit error 2 3 method used to compare observed stratigraphy and ert results to quantify the differences between the directly observed stratigraphy from the wells and the remotely sensed stratigraphy with the ert surveys a comparison between available stratigraphic logs and resistivity imaging was carried out the depth of karst intervals defined as zones of void development revealed by stratigraphic logs was compared to the depth where the pseudo 3 d ert model revealed a resistivity range that was consistent with the presence of karst intervals the results of the comparison were returned in terms of the success rate of the ert model in detecting karst intervals the 3 d visual inspection and a scatter plot as regards the success rate assessment for instance 50 success meant that the pseudo 3 d ert model was able to correctly detect karst intervals in 50 of cases the visual comparison consists in plotting the depth of karst intervals detected by the stratigraphic logs on the 3 d geophysical model the scatter plot compares the depth at which each karst interval was detected by stratigraphic logs and by the pseudo 3 d ert 2 4 synthetic dataset modelling the same electrode arrays quadrupole sequences and experimental setup involved in the field dataset collection were used in the synthetic dataset modelling the same solver and inversion procedure run in the field dataset inversion were used in the synthetic dataset modelling the only exception was the discretization of the foreground region using a 12 4 m element size along the x and y directions and a 5 14 m element size along the z direction this domain discretization was necessary to prevent the occurrence of aliasing issues when applying heterogeneous synthetic models syms synthetic datasets were generated by forward modelling through the application of different 3 d syms with a variable degree of heterogeneity a low degree of heterogeneity layered synthetic model sym fig 6 a simulating only the fundamental features of the aquifer it includes 8 layers and comprises a 40 ω m argillaceous limestone 2570 ω m not karst intervals and 745 ω m karst intervals the resistivity of the bodies is the mean resistivity value observed from well resistivity logs a high degree of heterogeneity full data sym fig 6b designed by using all the information available from resistivity and stratigraphic logs of the 21 calibration boreholes fig 6b the resistivity of the bodies is the same as the layered sym a middle degree of heterogeneity smooth full data sym fig 6c in order to reduce the level of detail to eliminate spurious noise within the model and bring out regional trends a smoothing filter that sets each node of the sym to the average of itself 168 nodes immediately surrounding it and 169 nodes immediately above and below it i e a filter with a 60 m size along both the x and y direction and a 10 m size along the z direction was applied to the full data sym to obtain from it a best fitting smooth sym a high degree of heterogeneity seismic based sym fig 6d obtained from a 3d reflection seismic block mari and porel 2008a b mari and delay 2011 and comprising the same resistivity values as the layered and the full data syms this sym introduced the geometry of the bodies revealed by a high resolution 3 d reflection seismic survey the 3 d seismic block used to design the seismic based sym was 300 m 240 m in size fig 1b with a depth ranging between 32 m and 117 m the synthetic datasets generated by forward modelling through the application of all the syms were corrupted with 1 random noise to provide realistic results and were inverted to generate inverse resistivity models 3 results 3 1 the resistivity imaging of the hes karst aquifer results analysis reveals an overall congruence between cross sections and slices extracted from the pseudo 3 d models fig s4 in the supporting information and between pseudo 3 d models from different arrays figs 3 5 comparison between cross sections and pseudo 3 d models reveals that the low porosity dogger limestone has slightly lower resistivity values in the cross sections than in the corresponding slices extracted from the pseudo 3 d model as shown by fig s4 three resistivity ranges can be found in the pseudo 3 d models figs 3 and 4 0 60 ω m for drift deposits and argillaceous limestone 60 140 ω m for high porosity dogger limestone also limestone affected by some clay content and 140 540 ω m for low porosity dogger limestone argillaceous limestone 0 60 ω m seems to be affected by a main nw se oriented trend and a minor n s oriented trend of opening cracks fig 3a c and fig 4d f that appear to be high resistivity structures 60 140 ω m compared to host argillaceous limestone these features may be related to shallow dissolution enlarged fractures that do not show any ground expression at present but were revealed at depth by vertical flowmeter data and high resolution video footage from wells shallow dissolution enlarged fractures seem to be in connection with middle depth sub vertical features figs 3d f figs 4g i further the latter features are found within argillaceous limestone down to a depth of 25 m and appear to be high resistivity structures 130 ω m compared to the host rock this suggests that these structures are related to void rich zones the 130 140 ω m resistivity range figs 4j l fig 5 recovers a better imaging of these sub vertical features that are likely to correlate with conduits larger features may be related to soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features that do not show any ground expression at present at least four main incipient sinkhole formation features were recognizable a d feature in fig 5 features a and b were revealed by all three arrays while c was detected by pd and hybrid arrays and d was revealed by ws and hybrid arrays fig 5 the 130 140 ω m resistivity range fig 4j l fig 5 observed from the hybrid inverse model and partly from the pd model seems apparently to reproduce a better imaging of the first two main karst intervals at a depth of approximately 35 40 m and 85 87 m associated with water productive layers as revealed by well logs the third karst interval is not detectable due to its greater depth the hybrid inverse model figs 4l fig 5c is 85 7 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals the conjunction of the two karst intervals at the edges of the model seems to be due to the decrease in the density of measured data at the model s boundary therefore these lateral zones should not be related to any actual hydrogeological body details on the misfit of field dataset models are provided in text s2 in the supporting information 3 2 comparison between the hes imaging from different arrays although the models achieved by different array sequences are quite consistent in identifying karst intervals represented by the same resistivity range extractions fig 5 it is possible to identify some differences between them the ws array showed a tendency to identify layering to locate karst intervals at a shallower location and to laterally extend the bodies the pd array sequence showed larger lateral heterogeneities and more compact and vertically extended bodies the hybrid array sequence delivered a better correlation with respect to stratigraphic logs fig 5 despite lower data fitting as pd a fair congruence between the resistivity values achieved by the hybrid and the pd models is found in the 10 22 m low depth range within the shallow conductive layer and in the 62 88 m high depth range the hybrid model delivered slightly larger values in the 22 88 m middle depth range where the largest vertical and lateral resistivity variations occur and ws and pd array sequences are affected by different vertical and lateral resolutions the evidence that the hybrid array sequence delivered better imaging suggests that is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays that differ in depth of investigation and resolution 3 3 comparison between observed stratigraphy and ert results the pseudo 3 d ert model in particular the hybrid model is in close agreement with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals in fact as seen before the hybrid model which delivered better imaging fig 4l fig 5c is 85 7 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals the scatter plot in fig 7 shows that the difference between the pseudo 3 d ert hybrid model and the stratigraphic logs in estimating the depth of the karst intervals ranges between 9 m and 4 m with an average of 1 4 m and a standard deviation of 4 2 m these findings suggest that the pseudo 3 d ert hybrid model provides on average an overall slight underestimation of the depth of the karst intervals this estimate excludes the cases in which karst intervals were not identified by either survey in fact there are three cases in which the karst interval is detected only by the stratigraphic log wells m04 m20 p01 while there are five cases in which the karst interval is detected only by the pseudo 3 d ert wells m07 m01 m15 m13 m22 in addition there are two cases wells m01 and m22 in which stratigraphic logs and the pseudo 3 d ert almost completely agree 3 4 detectability of karst intervals and model accuracy from synthetic dataset modelling on the basis of synthetically calculated data generated from the layered sym fig 6a by changing the thickness of the karst intervals and visually comparing the predefined sym with the resulting image fig 8 a the detectability of ert models appears to be 4 m at a depth of 35 m first karst interval and 12 m at a depth of 85 m second karst interval for the 3 d inverse hybrid model the pd array seems to deliver a detectability comparable to the hybrid array and about twice that of the ws array synthetic dataset modelling also allowed the verification that the experimental and inversion setup involved in generating the pseudo 3 d model is capable of resolving a degree of heterogeneity comparable to that shown by the smooth full data sym model fig 8c indeed as revealed by the comparison between observed stratigraphy and ert results this model is 78 6 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals this consistency value is close to that obtained from the field dataset model 85 7 in contrast the full data sym model fig 8b 57 2 consistent and the seismic based sym fig 8d 54 consistent are affected by too high a degree of heterogeneity while the layered sym model fig 8a 28 6 consistent shows a degree of heterogeneity lower than the accuracy provided by the experimental and inversion setup details on the misfit of synthetic dataset models are provided in text s3 in the supporting information 4 discussion the pseudo 3 d ert model provided a fairly reliable definition of the main hydrogeological units and structures such as karst intervals possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures and likely soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features at the hes of poitiers these findings along with the assessment of the detectability developed by the experimental setup and inversion procedure used in this work as determined by synthetic modelling may provide further insights on pseudo 3 d ert applicability and effectiveness in karst aquifer investigation better accuracy may be obtained from actual 3 d ert surveys but as mentioned in the introduction such depths of investigation 100 m would involve a significant field equipment effort a limit to the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model is that if merging not very dense 2 d profiles the area below a 2 d profile does not really affect measurements from neighboring 2 d profiles this means that the resulting pseudo 3 d model is driven mostly from the smoothness along the y axis rather than from the 3 d sensitivity of the dataset the use of an electrode spacing of 10 m along the x axis although implying low resolution for identifying small structures at shallow depths provides a suitable resolution for solving larger and deeper geophysical targets considering that detectability falls as depth increases however the use of large sized inversion elements may have led to a loss of resolution even along the x axis given the resolution provided by the experimental and inversion setup the pseudo 3 d model is able to identify structures several meters in size consequently the karst bodies identified by the pseudo 3 d model represent actually broad high porosity zones i e several meters in size as revealed by the study on the detectability of the geophysical model rather than meter scale main zones of void development 35 40 m and 85 87 m deep as identified by well logs the simplified conceptual model of the hes karst aquifer is shown in fig 9 this model represents the main features of the aquifer as revealed by well data and the pseudo 3 d ert model a rough estimate of total porosity values for karst bodies can be obtained from the pseudo 3 d model by using the empirical relationship proposed by archie 1942 1 r rw f φ m where r the resistivity of the true formation rw the resistivity of the water impregnating the formation f the formation factor φ the total porosity of the formation m the cementation factor by using m 2 and rw 20 ω m i e the mean resistivity value of groundwater samples collected from wells although the applicability of archie s law may be argued and is questionable for a karst reservoir two reasons motivated its adoption the first is that the reservoir can be regarded as being equivalent to a sedimentary carbonate formation at the resistivity imaging resolution scale indeed the pseudo 3 d ert model shows a rather large sized 27 1 m3 element volume furthermore the volume of the karst bodies represents only 2 3 of the reservoir volume from borehole image analysis audouin 2007 low medium limestone resistivity volumes are found to correspond to hydraulically conductive levels and zones as identified from well logging and flow interference tests audouin 2007 audouin et al 2008 differently high limestone resistivity volumes are found to correspond to tight limestone bulk total porosity values of 38 39 and 19 20 obtained from the hybrid model fig 5c would represent karst bodies and tight limestone respectively in view of the ert underestimation of the limestone bulk resistivity with respect to the resistivity logs of wells a possible overestimation of the total porosity by 3 of karst and non karst limestone should be considered mari et al 2009 suggest that the bodies showing a total porosity of approximately 16 would represent tight limestone with a low permeability less than a millidarcy but nonetheless significant storability 5 conclusions the resistivity imaging of the hes karst aquifer of poitiers from pseudo 3 d ert has been presented in this work the pseudo 3 d model provided a good definition of the main hydrogeological units and structures such as karst intervals possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures and likely soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth available at the hes provided the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model and the effectiveness of some of the most common surface electrode arrays in investigating difficult geological targets such as karst aquifers the detectability of karst intervals provided by the pseudo 3 d

6008,this work presents the electrical resistivity imaging of the hydrogeological experimental site hes karst aquifer of poitiers france from pseudo three dimensional 3 d electrical resistivity tomography ert i e a three dimensional model obtained from the joint inversion of resistivity data collected along parallel profiles the inverse resistivity model provided a fairly reliable definition of the main hydrogeological units the survey also allowed the recognition of possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures that do not show any ground expression at present but have been revealed at depth by vertical flowmeter data and high resolution video footage from wells these features seem to connect with middle depth sub vertical features down to a depth of 25 m which are likely to correlate with soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features that do not show any ground expression at present as well as karst conduits at greater depth the resistivity model allowed the recognition of the first two main karst intervals 35 40 m and 85 87 m deep associated with water productive layers as revealed by well logs the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by the hes allowed an assessment of the error the pseudo 3 d ert model makes in estimating the depth of the karst intervals synthetic dataset modelling provided the detectability of the pseudo 3 d ert model in identifying karst intervals synthetic dataset modelling also allowed an estimation of the response of the experimental and inversion setup to a variable degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer using well log data as geological a priori information keywords hydrogeological experimental site of poitiers karst aquifer ert pseudo 3 d resistivity tomography 1 introduction electrical resistivity tomography ert is a proven imaging technique where the theory cf arato et al 2014 athanasiou et al 2007 buvat et al 2013 dahlin and loke 1998 daily and owen 1991 loke et al 2003 spiegel et al 1980 and application cf cassiani et al 2009 daily and ramirez 1992 griffiths and barker 1993 guérin and benderitter 1995 guérin et al 2004 kuras et al 2009 ritz et al 1999 are well documented in geophysical literature ert is a technique well suited to identifying karst features and it partially characterizes karst aquifers karst features can be predominantly air filled making them highly resistive e g 1000 ω m or partially or completely water filled e g 60 1000 ω m in the latter case depending on the ionic concentration of the groundwater karst features may have a bulk conductivity ranging from very conductive e g 60 100 ω m to relatively conductive e g 100 250 ω m compared to the host rock e g 2000 ω m for not karst limestone karst features may also be filled by highly weathered material such as clays in which case they will be conductive relative to the host rock e g 60 150 ω m there have been many applications of electrical resistivity methods to detect karst features sinkholes and cavities see for instance al zoubi et al 2007 carrière et al 2013 maillol et al 1999 rainone et al 2015 satitpittakul et al 2013 smith 1986 van schoor 2002 zhu et al 2011 meyerhoff et al 2012 2014 show the application of time lapse ert to study changes of electrical conductivity in karst aquifers during times of varying discharge this work presents the electrical resistivity imaging of the hydrogeological experimental site hes karst aquifer of poitiers france poitou charentes region from pseudo three dimensional 3 d ert this is a 3 d model obtained from the joint inversion not simply 2 d data interpolation of resistivity data collected along parallel profiles the target of the study is to provide further insights into the applicability and effectiveness of pseudo 3 d ert in karst aquifer investigation at relatively great depth down to 100 m better accuracy may be obtained from actual 3 d ert surveys i e data actually collected along the three directions rather than pseudo 3 d surveys but at these depths the pseudo 3 d survey is often an enforced choice due to the significant use of field equipment i e very long multi core cables that a 3 d ert survey would involve the main geophysical targets of this study are represented by karst intervals i e zones of void development as identified by well logs the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by the hes allowed an evaluation of the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model and the effectiveness of some of the most common surface electrode arrays in investigating difficult geological targets such as karst aquifers the detectability of karst intervals provided by the pseudo 3 d ert model was assessed through synthetic dataset modelling i e a numerical simulation aimed at evaluating the capacity of the implemented pseudo 3 d ert survey to detect predefined targets at the hes well log data available from the dense well network at the hes were used as geological a priori input information for the generation of synthetic models syms representing different features of the hes aquifer therefore the synthetic datasets produced by forward modelling through the application of the syms were inverted to generate synthetic dataset models to be compared with field dataset models this approach allowed an estimation of the response of the experimental and inversion setup to a variable degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer and guided the interpretation of field data 1 1 geological setting of the test site the hes of poitiers is located on the southern border of the paris basin fig 1 a in this region jurassic limestone outcrops or lays beneath a thin cover of tertiary clays fig s1 in the supporting information and is slightly tilted toward the north this monoclinic structure is cut by sub vertical faults from several tectonic phases between the eocene and pliocene epochs burbaud vergneaud 1987 delay et al 2004 2007 kaczmaryk and delay 2007a b with the development to the south of horst structures like those of seuil du poitou and ligugé jurassic aquifers are therefore sub horizontal limestone and vertically fractured along the n s and e w directions the hercynian crystalline basement underlies the jurassic limestone fig s1 in the supporting information 1 2 the hydrogeological experimental site hes the hes of poitiers fig 1a b was developed by the institut de chimie des milieux et des matériaux de poitiers university of poitiers and french national center for scientific research within the network of national hydrogeological sites sno h the hes is found on the seuil du poitou a large mesozoic carbonate plateau marking the transition between the aquitaine and paris sedimentary basins the hes is located in one of the main regional aquifers which includes i the lower and middle lias aquifer 5 to 10 m thick and ii the dogger aquifer approximately 100 m thick these aquifers are hydraulically separated by the marly toarcian aquitard 20 m thick an argillaceous limestone approximately 30 m thick overlies the dogger aquifer indicating that the dogger aquifer is sealed beneath this thick relatively impermeable formation thirty five fully penetrating open wells were drilled with destructive techniques using a down the hole dth hammer rotary until the top of toarcian marls located at a depth of approximately 125 m fig 1b all the holes completely traverse the dogger aquifer these wells were cased with a 0 24 m diameter steel pipe to depths ranging from 15 to 80 m below the steel casing some wells were uncased while others were partly or fully screened with a 0 17 m diameter machine slotted pvc pipe most of the wells were arranged according to a regular grid in a square area measuring 210 210 m according to a multiscale nested five spot pattern audouin et al 2008 their fig 2 this pattern is classically used in petroleum engineering to improve oil recovery by simultaneously injecting water into the corner wells and pumping oil in the central well this technique was used at the hes to optimize the tracer recovery during tracer tests and to provide an experimental facility for flow and transport upscaling studies a large volume of data was collected from the dogger aquifer these data stored in the h database de dreuzy et al 2006 include the geologic structure of the reservoir bourbiaux et al 2007 well logs audouin 2007 petrophysical properties porosity and permeability measurements bourbiaux et al 2007 flow conditions in the boreholes audouin et al 2008 water table dynamics audouin 2007 audouin bodin 2007 2008 bernard delay 2008 bernard et al 2006 delay et al 2004 delay et al 2007 kaczmaryk delay 2007a b and the 3 d seismic imaging of the reservoir mari porel 2008a under natural flow conditions the piezometric level that measured in the boreholes which are screened open hole over the entire length of the aquifer represents the average hydraulic head over the thickness of the aquifer varies from 20 m to 25 m below ground level bgl however due to heavy rainfall a piezometric level of 17 mbgl was observed during ert data collection the aquifer is highly heterogeneous with local variations in both lithology and fracture density as revealed by the correlation between natural gamma and long normal resistivity logs audouin et al 2008 their fig 5 the 3 d porosity block achieved by 3 d seismic surveys mari porel 2008b and the variability in borehole yields that range from less than 5 m3 h to 60 m3 h the boreholes with higher yields are those which intercept at least one karst feature vertical flowmeter data and high resolution photography reveal two sets of fractures fissures a main set that is nw se oriented and a minor n s oriented set there are also three different main karst intervals i e zones of void development at depths of 35 40 m 85 87 m and 110 115 m audouin et al 2008 these were also confirmed by stratigraphic and resistivity well logs heat pulse flowmeter logs and borehole imaging analyses show that inflow levels are associated to sub horizontal karst structures which are confined within vuggy limestone layers these vuggy levels are well marked by dark shades on borehole images audouin et al 2008 their fig 10 a net increase in macroscopic porosity is associated to the localized presence of dissolution cavities 1 3 cm in diameter the vertical interconnectivity between the three karst intervals seems to result from sub vertical fracture occurrence as revealed by borehole imaging fractures are either isolated or concentrated within fracture zones no large cavities have been intercepted by wells however the presence of sub vertical conduits or cavities of a significant size cannot be excluded considering that sub vertical features are under sampled by the vertical wells karst intervals water filled lead to a fall in the resistivity of the dogger limestone an example of stratigraphic and resistivity logs for well m04 is shown in fig 2 cross sections of well logs have been shown by audouin et al 2008 their figs 5 and 10 2 materials and methods 2 1 field dataset collection ert field data were collected between 17 and 22 june 2013 at the hes with a fully automatic multi electrode resistivity meter the syscal jr switch 48 by iris instruments 400 v max output voltage 1200 ma max output current 100 w max output power ert data were collected using a wenner schlumberger ws array which delivers high vertical resolution and signal amplitude and a pole dipole pd array that shows high lateral resolution and penetration depth and even if it is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength smith 1986 in accordance with szalai et al 2009 who report that it is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays differing in depth of investigation and resolution a hybrid array sequence was obtained by merging ws and pd array sequences the acquisition layout comprised of 48 electrodes at 10 m intervals along five parallel 470 m long surface profiles ert 1 ert 5 and with each profile approximately 50 m apart the pd array comprised of a remote electrode at a distance of 960 m from the center of the 3 d block fig 1b the quadrupole sequence for each profile comprised of 596 measurements for the ws array and 699 measurements for the pd array the hybrid array sequence comprised of 1 295 measurements for each profile three dimensional resistivity grids 481 m 203 m in size with a maximum depth ranging from 90 m for the ws array and 130 m for the pd were designed for merging 2 d ert data details on field dataset collection are provided in text s1 in the supporting information pseudo sections reveal six intervals of apparent resistivity which represent different hydrogeological units including the two karst intervals fig s2 in the supporting information the third karst interval is not detectable due to its depth which is greater than the ert survey s maximum depth of investigation some erratic measurements seem to be related to the presence of a small very shallow buried body this body acting as source of noise is able to affect electrical resistivity measures and generates a severe measure artifact i e the pant leg anomaly shown by the pseudo section in fig s2a this anomaly is not due to the steel pipes all the wells are cased with to depths ranging from 15 to 80 m this finding is consistent with the results of resistivity surveys by other authors that did not record any noise due to the metallic casing from water wells located in the near vicinity of the surveys unlike self potential surveys see for instance saribudak and hawkins 2019 however the pant leg anomaly shown by the pseudo section in fig s2a was partially removed by data processing before inversion as shown in fig s2b 2 2 processing and inversion of the field dataset to verify the field dataset s capability to identify karst intervals 1 d resistivity soundings were extracted from ert apparent resistivity data fig s3 in the supporting information this approach allowed the verification that the first two karst intervals were correlated to an overall decrease in apparent resistivity data processing allowed outliers from apparent resistivity data to be removed problematic data showing unrealistically high resistivity 600 ω m too high standard deviation 10 ω m and negative resistivity that is unrealistic for 2 d data were removed from apparent data the pseudo 3 d resistivity imaging was obtained from the joint inversion of merged 2 d ert data ertlab solver by multi phase technologies llc geostudi astier srl based on tetrahedral finite element modelling fem was used for data inversion a tetrahedral discretization was used in both forward and inverse modelling the foreground region was discretized using a 27 1 m element size i e the weighted average of the electrode separation due to different electrode spacing along the x and y directions on the ground the background region was discretized using an increasing element size towards the outside of the domain according to the sequence 1 1 2 4 and 8 the foreground element size the forward modelling was performed using mixed boundary conditions dirichlet neumann and a tolerance stop criterion of 1 0e 7 for a symmetric successive over relaxation conjugate gradient ssorcg iterative solver data inversion was based on a least squares smoothness constrained approach labrecque et al 1996 noise was appropriately managed using a data weighting algorithm morelli and labrecque 1996 that allows the variance matrix after each iteration for data points poorly fitted by the model to be adaptively changed the inverse modelling was performed using a maximum number of internal inverse preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterations of 5 and a tolerance stop criterion for inverse pcg iterations of 0 001 the amount of roughness from one iteration to the next was controlled in order to assess maximum layering a low value of reweight constant 0 1 was set with the objective of generating maximum heterogeneity the inverse resistivity models figs 3 5 and fig s4 in the supporting information were obtained through the application of homogeneous starting models that set each node the average apparent resistivity value measured by the corresponding array sequence 54 ω m for ws 109 ω m for pd 77 ω m for hybrid the inverse final resistivity models were chosen with a criterion based on the achievement of a minimum data residual misfit error 2 3 method used to compare observed stratigraphy and ert results to quantify the differences between the directly observed stratigraphy from the wells and the remotely sensed stratigraphy with the ert surveys a comparison between available stratigraphic logs and resistivity imaging was carried out the depth of karst intervals defined as zones of void development revealed by stratigraphic logs was compared to the depth where the pseudo 3 d ert model revealed a resistivity range that was consistent with the presence of karst intervals the results of the comparison were returned in terms of the success rate of the ert model in detecting karst intervals the 3 d visual inspection and a scatter plot as regards the success rate assessment for instance 50 success meant that the pseudo 3 d ert model was able to correctly detect karst intervals in 50 of cases the visual comparison consists in plotting the depth of karst intervals detected by the stratigraphic logs on the 3 d geophysical model the scatter plot compares the depth at which each karst interval was detected by stratigraphic logs and by the pseudo 3 d ert 2 4 synthetic dataset modelling the same electrode arrays quadrupole sequences and experimental setup involved in the field dataset collection were used in the synthetic dataset modelling the same solver and inversion procedure run in the field dataset inversion were used in the synthetic dataset modelling the only exception was the discretization of the foreground region using a 12 4 m element size along the x and y directions and a 5 14 m element size along the z direction this domain discretization was necessary to prevent the occurrence of aliasing issues when applying heterogeneous synthetic models syms synthetic datasets were generated by forward modelling through the application of different 3 d syms with a variable degree of heterogeneity a low degree of heterogeneity layered synthetic model sym fig 6 a simulating only the fundamental features of the aquifer it includes 8 layers and comprises a 40 ω m argillaceous limestone 2570 ω m not karst intervals and 745 ω m karst intervals the resistivity of the bodies is the mean resistivity value observed from well resistivity logs a high degree of heterogeneity full data sym fig 6b designed by using all the information available from resistivity and stratigraphic logs of the 21 calibration boreholes fig 6b the resistivity of the bodies is the same as the layered sym a middle degree of heterogeneity smooth full data sym fig 6c in order to reduce the level of detail to eliminate spurious noise within the model and bring out regional trends a smoothing filter that sets each node of the sym to the average of itself 168 nodes immediately surrounding it and 169 nodes immediately above and below it i e a filter with a 60 m size along both the x and y direction and a 10 m size along the z direction was applied to the full data sym to obtain from it a best fitting smooth sym a high degree of heterogeneity seismic based sym fig 6d obtained from a 3d reflection seismic block mari and porel 2008a b mari and delay 2011 and comprising the same resistivity values as the layered and the full data syms this sym introduced the geometry of the bodies revealed by a high resolution 3 d reflection seismic survey the 3 d seismic block used to design the seismic based sym was 300 m 240 m in size fig 1b with a depth ranging between 32 m and 117 m the synthetic datasets generated by forward modelling through the application of all the syms were corrupted with 1 random noise to provide realistic results and were inverted to generate inverse resistivity models 3 results 3 1 the resistivity imaging of the hes karst aquifer results analysis reveals an overall congruence between cross sections and slices extracted from the pseudo 3 d models fig s4 in the supporting information and between pseudo 3 d models from different arrays figs 3 5 comparison between cross sections and pseudo 3 d models reveals that the low porosity dogger limestone has slightly lower resistivity values in the cross sections than in the corresponding slices extracted from the pseudo 3 d model as shown by fig s4 three resistivity ranges can be found in the pseudo 3 d models figs 3 and 4 0 60 ω m for drift deposits and argillaceous limestone 60 140 ω m for high porosity dogger limestone also limestone affected by some clay content and 140 540 ω m for low porosity dogger limestone argillaceous limestone 0 60 ω m seems to be affected by a main nw se oriented trend and a minor n s oriented trend of opening cracks fig 3a c and fig 4d f that appear to be high resistivity structures 60 140 ω m compared to host argillaceous limestone these features may be related to shallow dissolution enlarged fractures that do not show any ground expression at present but were revealed at depth by vertical flowmeter data and high resolution video footage from wells shallow dissolution enlarged fractures seem to be in connection with middle depth sub vertical features figs 3d f figs 4g i further the latter features are found within argillaceous limestone down to a depth of 25 m and appear to be high resistivity structures 130 ω m compared to the host rock this suggests that these structures are related to void rich zones the 130 140 ω m resistivity range figs 4j l fig 5 recovers a better imaging of these sub vertical features that are likely to correlate with conduits larger features may be related to soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features that do not show any ground expression at present at least four main incipient sinkhole formation features were recognizable a d feature in fig 5 features a and b were revealed by all three arrays while c was detected by pd and hybrid arrays and d was revealed by ws and hybrid arrays fig 5 the 130 140 ω m resistivity range fig 4j l fig 5 observed from the hybrid inverse model and partly from the pd model seems apparently to reproduce a better imaging of the first two main karst intervals at a depth of approximately 35 40 m and 85 87 m associated with water productive layers as revealed by well logs the third karst interval is not detectable due to its greater depth the hybrid inverse model figs 4l fig 5c is 85 7 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals the conjunction of the two karst intervals at the edges of the model seems to be due to the decrease in the density of measured data at the model s boundary therefore these lateral zones should not be related to any actual hydrogeological body details on the misfit of field dataset models are provided in text s2 in the supporting information 3 2 comparison between the hes imaging from different arrays although the models achieved by different array sequences are quite consistent in identifying karst intervals represented by the same resistivity range extractions fig 5 it is possible to identify some differences between them the ws array showed a tendency to identify layering to locate karst intervals at a shallower location and to laterally extend the bodies the pd array sequence showed larger lateral heterogeneities and more compact and vertically extended bodies the hybrid array sequence delivered a better correlation with respect to stratigraphic logs fig 5 despite lower data fitting as pd a fair congruence between the resistivity values achieved by the hybrid and the pd models is found in the 10 22 m low depth range within the shallow conductive layer and in the 62 88 m high depth range the hybrid model delivered slightly larger values in the 22 88 m middle depth range where the largest vertical and lateral resistivity variations occur and ws and pd array sequences are affected by different vertical and lateral resolutions the evidence that the hybrid array sequence delivered better imaging suggests that is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays that differ in depth of investigation and resolution 3 3 comparison between observed stratigraphy and ert results the pseudo 3 d ert model in particular the hybrid model is in close agreement with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals in fact as seen before the hybrid model which delivered better imaging fig 4l fig 5c is 85 7 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals the scatter plot in fig 7 shows that the difference between the pseudo 3 d ert hybrid model and the stratigraphic logs in estimating the depth of the karst intervals ranges between 9 m and 4 m with an average of 1 4 m and a standard deviation of 4 2 m these findings suggest that the pseudo 3 d ert hybrid model provides on average an overall slight underestimation of the depth of the karst intervals this estimate excludes the cases in which karst intervals were not identified by either survey in fact there are three cases in which the karst interval is detected only by the stratigraphic log wells m04 m20 p01 while there are five cases in which the karst interval is detected only by the pseudo 3 d ert wells m07 m01 m15 m13 m22 in addition there are two cases wells m01 and m22 in which stratigraphic logs and the pseudo 3 d ert almost completely agree 3 4 detectability of karst intervals and model accuracy from synthetic dataset modelling on the basis of synthetically calculated data generated from the layered sym fig 6a by changing the thickness of the karst intervals and visually comparing the predefined sym with the resulting image fig 8 a the detectability of ert models appears to be 4 m at a depth of 35 m first karst interval and 12 m at a depth of 85 m second karst interval for the 3 d inverse hybrid model the pd array seems to deliver a detectability comparable to the hybrid array and about twice that of the ws array synthetic dataset modelling also allowed the verification that the experimental and inversion setup involved in generating the pseudo 3 d model is capable of resolving a degree of heterogeneity comparable to that shown by the smooth full data sym model fig 8c indeed as revealed by the comparison between observed stratigraphy and ert results this model is 78 6 consistent with stratigraphic logs in identifying karst intervals this consistency value is close to that obtained from the field dataset model 85 7 in contrast the full data sym model fig 8b 57 2 consistent and the seismic based sym fig 8d 54 consistent are affected by too high a degree of heterogeneity while the layered sym model fig 8a 28 6 consistent shows a degree of heterogeneity lower than the accuracy provided by the experimental and inversion setup details on the misfit of synthetic dataset models are provided in text s3 in the supporting information 4 discussion the pseudo 3 d ert model provided a fairly reliable definition of the main hydrogeological units and structures such as karst intervals possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures and likely soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features at the hes of poitiers these findings along with the assessment of the detectability developed by the experimental setup and inversion procedure used in this work as determined by synthetic modelling may provide further insights on pseudo 3 d ert applicability and effectiveness in karst aquifer investigation better accuracy may be obtained from actual 3 d ert surveys but as mentioned in the introduction such depths of investigation 100 m would involve a significant field equipment effort a limit to the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model is that if merging not very dense 2 d profiles the area below a 2 d profile does not really affect measurements from neighboring 2 d profiles this means that the resulting pseudo 3 d model is driven mostly from the smoothness along the y axis rather than from the 3 d sensitivity of the dataset the use of an electrode spacing of 10 m along the x axis although implying low resolution for identifying small structures at shallow depths provides a suitable resolution for solving larger and deeper geophysical targets considering that detectability falls as depth increases however the use of large sized inversion elements may have led to a loss of resolution even along the x axis given the resolution provided by the experimental and inversion setup the pseudo 3 d model is able to identify structures several meters in size consequently the karst bodies identified by the pseudo 3 d model represent actually broad high porosity zones i e several meters in size as revealed by the study on the detectability of the geophysical model rather than meter scale main zones of void development 35 40 m and 85 87 m deep as identified by well logs the simplified conceptual model of the hes karst aquifer is shown in fig 9 this model represents the main features of the aquifer as revealed by well data and the pseudo 3 d ert model a rough estimate of total porosity values for karst bodies can be obtained from the pseudo 3 d model by using the empirical relationship proposed by archie 1942 1 r rw f φ m where r the resistivity of the true formation rw the resistivity of the water impregnating the formation f the formation factor φ the total porosity of the formation m the cementation factor by using m 2 and rw 20 ω m i e the mean resistivity value of groundwater samples collected from wells although the applicability of archie s law may be argued and is questionable for a karst reservoir two reasons motivated its adoption the first is that the reservoir can be regarded as being equivalent to a sedimentary carbonate formation at the resistivity imaging resolution scale indeed the pseudo 3 d ert model shows a rather large sized 27 1 m3 element volume furthermore the volume of the karst bodies represents only 2 3 of the reservoir volume from borehole image analysis audouin 2007 low medium limestone resistivity volumes are found to correspond to hydraulically conductive levels and zones as identified from well logging and flow interference tests audouin 2007 audouin et al 2008 differently high limestone resistivity volumes are found to correspond to tight limestone bulk total porosity values of 38 39 and 19 20 obtained from the hybrid model fig 5c would represent karst bodies and tight limestone respectively in view of the ert underestimation of the limestone bulk resistivity with respect to the resistivity logs of wells a possible overestimation of the total porosity by 3 of karst and non karst limestone should be considered mari et al 2009 suggest that the bodies showing a total porosity of approximately 16 would represent tight limestone with a low permeability less than a millidarcy but nonetheless significant storability 5 conclusions the resistivity imaging of the hes karst aquifer of poitiers from pseudo 3 d ert has been presented in this work the pseudo 3 d model provided a good definition of the main hydrogeological units and structures such as karst intervals possible shallow dissolution enlarged fractures and likely soil mantled incipient sinkhole formation features the opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth available at the hes provided the accuracy of the pseudo 3 d model and the effectiveness of some of the most common surface electrode arrays in investigating difficult geological targets such as karst aquifers the detectability of karst intervals provided by the pseudo 3 d ert model was assessed through synthetic dataset modelling this approach also allowed an estimation of the response of the experimental and inversion set up to a variable degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer using well log data as geological a priori information and therefore allowing the interpretation of field data to be guided these findings may provide further insights on pseudo 3 d ert s applicability and effectiveness in karst aquifer investigation and may be useful in survey designing and interpreting stages of ert investigations aimed at imaging difficult geological targets such as

6009,determination of streambed hydraulic conductivity ksb and its variations over time are critical for quantifying exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater previous studies have used flood wave response techniques frt to determine ksb or its transience excluding the streambed storage effect thus the estimated ksb may not be reliable in this study after improving a previous frt by substituting the gradient descent algorithm with an advanced and robust optimization method trust region reflective algorithm we have analyzed the influence of streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb through successive inversion of flood wave responses the study shows that the streambed storage effect is not important for identifying the transience in the hydraulic properties of a relatively thin streambed e g several or dozens of centimeters but significant under estimation 1 2 orders of magnitude can be seen because of neglecting the streambed storage effect it is particularly true for a stream confined aquifer system if the streambed is composed of fine deposits e g silt clay with a thicker thickness greater than 1 m corresponding to low permeability but high storativity and the aquifer is characterized by relatively low permeability e g roughly 0 1 10 m d 1 and relatively low storativity roughly 1e 5 m 1 e g dense fine sands the new method in which streambed storage effect is incorporated can provide more reliable estimations of time dependent ksb for a stream confined aquifer system and it has been successfully applied to estimate the time dependent ksb of a reach of the arkansas river kansas usa keywords stream aquifer interaction transient streambed hydraulic conductivity flood wave response model parameters inversion 1 introduction the streambed is a key factor controlling the exchange flux between surface water sw and groundwater gw boano et al 2014 brunner et al 2017 constantz 2016 temporal variations in hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity of a streambed commonly occur due to fine grained sediments scour deposition e g jin et al 2017 hatch et al 2010 partington et al 2017 simpson and meixner 2012 biofilm growth e g caruso et al 2017 newcomer et al 2016 2018 treese et al 2009 ulrich et al 2015 xian et al 2019 chemical precipitation dissolution du et al 2013 and temperature variations e g doppler et al 2007 irvine et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the streambed transience has received increasing attention in the last two decades e g battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 genereux et al 2008 gianni et al 2016 hatch et al 2010 mutiti and levy 2010 ping et al 2018 simpson and meixner 2012 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 xian et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 because of its non negligible influence on the water and chemical fluxes across a streambed for example mutiti and levy 2010 indicated that during storm events the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed ksb almost increased by one order of magnitude due to loss of fine sediments in the great miami river southwest ohio usa battin and sengschmitt 1999 showed that the development of biofilms can drop the value of ksb by two to three orders of magnitude corresponding to a five to six fold reduction in riverbed leakage coefficients for the danube river vienna austria wang et al 2017 illustrated that neglecting the impact of annual temperature variations on ksb would result in an overestimation of 10 15 on stream water infiltration for the lower heihe river an ephemeral stream in north western china therefore it is crucial to determine temporal variations of ksb for accurately quantifying interactions between sw and gw a range of in situ direct measurement methods such as permeameter tests seepage meter test and slug tests and grain size analysis of streambed samples have been used for determining ksb e g genereux et al 2008 kalbus et al 2006 landon et al 2001 wang et al 2014 in addition coupled heat tracer and hydraulic gradient measurement was also adopted to calculate transient ksb e g hatch et al 2010 mutiti and levy 2010 however mostly because of commonly seen spatial heterogeneity of streambed sediments calver 2001 determining the spatiotemporal variations of ksb is challenging with these approaches from which the point estimations of ksb are derived brunner et al 2017 kalbus et al 2006 moreover direct measurement methods are difficult to implement for deep rivers or fast flowing rivers brunner et al 2017 recently integrated surface and subsurface hydrological models were developed to determine spatial variations in ksb across a reach with inversion techniques e g niswonger et al 2008 shanafield et al 2014 tang et al 2018 but parameter estimation with the integrated models is quite time consuming gianni et al 2016 tang et al 2018 in contrast the flood wave response technique frt can rapidly estimate the hydraulic parameters of a streambed gianni et al 2016 jha and singh 2014 jerbi 2018 and is relatively simple to implement because it only requires time series data of stream stage fluctuations and the corresponding hydraulic head variations of a riparian zone observation well gianni et al 2016 this approach inverses the hydraulic properties of a streambed by minimizing the sum of squared errors between calculated and observed hydraulic heads of an observation well close to a stream bank the hydraulic heads are calculated from a convolution of the responses to stream stage fluctuations based on an analytical solution of stream aquifer interaction models gianni et al 2016 extended this technique to calculate the transience in streambed conductance through successive inversion of a flood wave response model ha et al 2007 hall and moench 1972 singh et al 2002 the upgraded technique developed by gianni et al 2016 named as sfrt hereinafter has been respectively employed to determine the transience in the streambed permeability and conductance of reaches in the schwarzbach river southwest of frankfurt germany zhou et al 2018 and the rhone river in the south switzerland gianni et al 2016 in prior studies the analytical model of carslaw and jaeger 1959 which describes the one dimensional transient interaction between a fully penetrating stream with a semipervious streambed and a confined aquifer was often adopted as a unit step response function in a flood wave response model to inverse the hydraulic parameters of a streambed e g gianni et al 2016 ha et al 2007 singh et al 2002 2004 zhou et al 2018 moench and barlow 2000 developed one dimensional analytical models for transient interaction between a fully penetrating stream and a confined unconfined aquifer the analytical models can be applied for various scenarios e g the confined unconfined aquifer may or may not be bounded by a streambed and may or may not be overlaid by a leaky aquifer and the unconfined aquifer also can be recharged discharged by precipitation evapotranspiration based on the analytical models of moench and barlow 2000 barlow et al 2000 has developed two computer programs to estimate the hydraulic properties of streambed and aquifer moreover barlow and moench 1998 derived a two dimensional analytical solution for cross sectional flow in a fully penetrating stream unconfined aquifer system kisekka et al 2013 and jerbi 2018 used this two dimensional analytical model and a convolution integral method to assess the hydraulic parameters of streambed and aquifer however in these previous analytical models only flow equation for an aquifer aquitard was solved and the leakages through a streambed were represented with a cauchy boundary condition thus streambed storage was not included such representation of the leakage from a stream as a cauchy boundary condition may hold for a thin e g a few centimeters or dozens of centimeters streambed but in the situations of a thick e g several meters streambed the storage of streambed may significantly influence the propagation of signals of stream stage fluctuations from a stream into an aquifer li et al 2008 sun and zhan 2006 2007 a phenomenon called streambed buffer effect the negligence of the streambed buffer effect on the propagation of stream stage fluctuations may result in unreliable estimation of the hydraulic properties of a streambed and therefore their dynamic variations over time in fact a streambed several meters thick has been increasingly seen in nature where more and more regulated rivers are emerging in the world nilsson 2005 lehner et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 2019 in regulated rivers backwater induced by a dam often create a low flow velocity condition thus promotes fine sediment to deposit and form a thick riverbed su et al 2007 xian et al 2017 for example crosbie et al 2014 mapped the thickness of clogging layer over a 2 km reach of billabong creek in southeastern australia through use of a geophysical technique based on in river vertical electrical soundings which has been calibrated to riverbed core profiles in their field investigation along the survey transect about 1 m to more than 4 m thick clogging layers overlying the sand aquifer were detected and the maximum riverbed thickness can reach as many as 7 m lamontagne et al 2011a b 2014 identified the clogging layers of lachlan river and billabong creek in southeastern australia by collecting riverbed sediments core profiles and found that the thickness of clogging layers can range from 0 5 m to greater than 2 m by applying a combination of field methods at multiple scales including seepage meter slug test coupled water flow and heat modeling of river and groundwater and geophysical techniques including electrical resistivity seismic wave and electromagnetism wojnar et al 2013 identified the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of riverbeds at four field sites along the great miami river in ohio usa and indicated that the superficial fine sediments layers of the riverbed were up to 2 m thick for the boat ramp site and from 0 to 3 m thick for the north hamilton site likewise levy et al 2011 measured the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the riverbed in great miami river near the charles m bolton municipal well field through a use of multiple methods like wojnar et al 2013 and a 2 34 m thick riverbed overlying the glacial outwash aquifer was observed in this study we first analyze how streambed storage effect influences the estimation of temporal variations of ksb from sfrt second we develop a new method in which the streambed storage effect is included to estimate time dependent ksb in this new model the streambed storage effect is incorporated and an advanced and robust optimization method of trust region reflective algorithm trra is employed for the inversion of hydraulic properties lastly the present method is applied to estimate the temporal variations of ksb of a reach in the arkansas river the great bend prairie of kansas usa 2 methods in this section an overview of the development of the new method with the streambed buffer effect is first described in section 2 1 next to strive for better estimation of ksb from sfrt some improvement of sfrt is provided in section 2 2 lastly the method for analyzing the streambed storage effect on the estimation of sfrt is illustrated in section 2 3 2 1 development of the new method with streambed buffer effect to estimate temporal variations in ksb through successive inversion of a flood wave response model three iterative steps are required according to gianni et al 2016 1 the response of an aquifer at a given distance from a stream is calculated with a convolution relation between stream stage variations and a unit step response function of a stream aquifer system 2 the estimation of streambed permeability for a designated time step is performed using a parameter estimation approach which minimizes the sum of squared errors between observed and calculated hydraulic heads 3 the steps 1 and 2 are repeatedly implement to acquire ksb for successive time steps 2 1 1 the flood wave response model with the streambed storage effect for a semi infinite stream aquifer system with a semipervious stream bank fig 1 the flow in the streambed aquifer system can be described by two one dimensional diffusion equations 1 2 h sb x t x 2 1 α sb h sb x t t 0 x m 2 2 h a x t x 2 1 α a h a x t t m x where hsb ha represent the change of hydraulic head in the streambed and the aquifer respectively l αsb αa denote the hydraulic diffusivity of the streambed and the aquifer respectively l2t 1 and equal to kid si where ki ksb ka are the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed and the aquifer respectively lt 1 and d denotes the thickness of the aquifer l si ssb sa represent the storativities of the streambed and the aquifer respectively m is the thickness of the streambed x is horizontal coordinate and the origin is at the left edge of the streambed t is time t initially the variations of hydraulic heads of the streambed and the aquifer are zeroes i e 3 h sb x 0 h a x 0 0 the continuities of head and flux at the streambed aquifer interface x m are maintained 4 h sb m t h a m t 5 k sb h sb m t x k a h a m t x the boundary conditions of the stream at x 0 and x are respectively described as 6 h sb 0 t f t 7 d h a t dx 0 where f t represents the time dependent stream stage a minor point to note is that the variation of stream stage along the stream channel is not considered here and the stream channel meander is not considered as well these assumptions are probably reasonably as the scale of concern here is quite limited near the streambank liu and ball 1998 derived an analytical solution for solute diffusion in a one dimensional semi infinite two layer system with a constant source based on their analytical solution we have developed a new analytical model of stream aquifer interaction considering streambed storage effect by solving eqs 1 6 i e a unit step response function of the aquifer 8 p x t 1 ξ j 0 ξ j e r f c 2 j 1 m 1 α sb x m 1 α a 2 t where ξ k a 1 α a k sb 1 α sb k a 1 α a k sb 1 α sb j is the index of the summation and erfc is the complementary error function notably the infinite series in eq 8 require only the first 3 5 terms to converge liu and ball 1998 the detailed derivation of eq 8 is put in the section 1 of the supplementary material see section 3 1 for the verification of eq 8 the response of the aquifer to stream stage variations can be expressed by a convolution relation 9 h x t 0 t f τ p x t τ d τ where f t is the time variation of stream stage for any variations of stream stage the response of the aquifer can derive from the discrete form of eq 9 10 h x n δ t k 1 n f k p x n k 1 δ t where n represents the number of time steps with a constant length δt k denotes the index of the summation and f k is the variation of stream stage during a time step 11 f k f k f k 1 2 1 2 estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity the method of walk forward optimization is adopted to identify the time varying ksb as illustrated in fig 2 the complete optimization process contains multiple inversion sub processes each inversion optimizes ksb by using heads data within a time window in the observed time series data the time window is called parameter optimization window pow the parameter ksb in a pow is assumed to be constant and optimized by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse between calculated and observed heads in the pow 12 sse i 1 m h i h i 2 where hi and hi are the observed and calculated heads respectively hi can be calculated by eq 10 m is the total number of observed calculated heads within a pow i is the index of the summation to estimate the parameter ksb throughout the study period the inversion process repeats while the pow progressively shifts forward by a time step i e a shift until the end of the study period the shift is usually much less than the size of a pow thus a pow always partly overlaps with its last or next pow see fig 2 the total number of estimations of ksb is determined by the ratio of the length of the study period to the size of a shift see gianni et al 2016 for detailed explanations of the workflow of the walk forward optimization method within each inversion of the walk forward optimization gianni et al 2016 used a gradient descent algorithm gda to estimate the hydraulic properties of a streambed for a pow gda is one of the simplest optimization approaches and is easy to implement but it converges slowly when close to the minimum meza 2010 to speed up the convergence of gda the accuracy of computation in certain situations has to be sacrificed to some extent by using a relatively high convergence tolerance criterion or a relatively large learning rate which may result in instability and non convergence consequentially as a matter of fact gda is not commonly employed in practice meza 2010 in comparison the more advanced optimization approaches such as levenberg marquardt algorithm lma and trra etc are preferable to overcome the numerical problem of gda here we have adopted trra which is more robust than gda to achieve accurate estimations of ksb within a shorter computational time trra is a combination of the trust region optimization approach and the interior reflective newton algorithm coleman and li 1994 1996 and is a powerful approach to solve the nonlinear least squares problem 13 min κ f κ 1 m f i κ 2 l b κ u b f i κ h i h i κ where f i κ represents the head error function κ is the parameter to be estimated here it is ksb and can be bounded by a lower bound lb and an upper bound ub the idea of the conventional trust region method for min κ f κ is straightforward within a small neighborhood n of a current point κ k based on taylor s theorem f κ k s can be reasonably approximated by eq 14 the neighborhood n is the trust region and k is the current number of iteration 14 f κ k s f κ k f κ k t s 1 2 s t 2 f κ k s where and 2 denote the first and second order partial derivatives respectively t represents the transpose operation thus the original problem of min κ f κ can be approximated by solving the minimization problem of the quadratic function 15 min s q k s g k t s 1 2 s t h k s s δ k where g k is the gradient of f κ at the current point κ k f κ k h k is the hessian matrix 2 f κ k δ k denotes a trust region size is the 1 norm the trial step s is determined by minimizing the quadratic function q s under the constraint of s δ k if f κ k s f κ k κ changes from κ k to κ k s otherwise κ keeps unchanged and remains at κ k and the trust region size δ k is reduced thus the key issue of the trust region method is its sub problem of finding the trial step s and defining the trust region size δ k to achieve global and local convergence and high computational efficiency of each iteration the interior reflective newton algorithm was developed by coleman and li 1994 1996 and li 1993 by employing a reflective transformation technique to the box constrained quadratic sub problem eq 15 was transformed into the following

study a matlab program has been developed to implement the new method by coding the walk forward optimization algorithm in which the head response function h x t and trra are incorporated the function lsqnonlin in matlab is applied to implement trra a tolerance of 1 10 10 for the minimum change in the optimized parameter κ and the minimum change in the objective function f κ was used to ensure the accuracy of estimated ksb 2 2 the improvement on sfrt although the transience in streambed conductance can be clearly detected by the previous sfrt however the results derived from the approach may not be estimated within adequate accuracy gianni et al 2016 to provide a better analysis of streambed storage effect on the estimated results from sfrt in which streambed storage effect is not considered trra is adopted for sfrt instead of gda used by gianni et al 2016 we used the improved sfrt to estimate the transience in ksb based on the same synthetic data of gianni et al 2016 fig 3 shows the comparisons of estimated ksb from the improved and the original sfrt with a pow of 1 day and a shift of 1 h as illustrated in fig 3 the accuracy of estimations of ksb has been significantly improved by the improved sfrt a point to note is that over estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude also took place near 29 5th 30th day when sharp increases in ksb were manually imposed in the model simulation it is not shown in fig 3 for the convenience of comparison 2 3 synthetic data to analyze the streambed storage effect on estimations of dynamic ksb from sfrt we first used comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa to simulate water flow in the stream aquifer system as shown in fig 1 and then generate a series of synthetic data of groundwater head variation in the model simulations an assumed time varying ksb trend was manually imposed the variations of hydraulic heads from numerical simulations were regarded as observed data the temporal variations of ksb were estimated by the improved sfrt and then the estimated and the imposed ksb were compared to analyze the streambed storage effect a base case was setup first a one dimensional finite domain was chosen to substitute the infinite domain as depicted in fig 1 the width of the one dimensional domain varies from 5000 m to 50 000 m to satisfy the no flow right boundary condition the specific storages of s s sb 1e 3 m 1 and s s a 1e 5 m 1 were chosen for the streambed and the aquifer respectively the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ka is 0 1 m d 1 the thickness of the streambed is 2 m as gianni et al 2016 did the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed ksb is imposed by the following sequence ksb first exponentially decreases from 0 1 m d 1 to 0 001 m d 1 over a period of 30 day and then rapidly increases from 0 001 m d 1 to 0 1 m d 1 within 0 2 day and exponentially decreases again from 0 1 m d 1 to 0 001 m d 1 over 29 8 day such variations of ksb represent the evolution of ksb experiencing clogging and erosion and clogging processes in sequence a sinusoidal variation of stream stage with a period of 1 day and an amplitude of 1 m is imposed at x 0 m the transient model is setup for a period of 60 day we have conducted grid and time step independence analyses to ensure that simulated results were independence of grid size and time step length consequentially a uniform grid spacing of 0 1 m and a maximum time step of 0 01 day were adopted a sensitivity analysis was carried out by altering the parameters of s s sb m s s a ka the size of pow and the shift for the improved sfrt were 1 day and 0 1 day respectively 3 results 3 1 verification of the new analytical model of stream aquifer interaction considering streambed storage effect to test the validity of the developed analytical solution of stream aquifer interaction i e eq 8 we compared the analytical solution with numerical simulation results under different combinations of parameters including ka ksb m s s a the numerical method is similar with that described in section 2 3 for the base case the parameters of ka 1 m d 1 ksb 0 1 m d 1 s s a 1e 5 m 1 s s sb 1e 3 m 1 and m 1 m were used a unit step function was imposed at the left boundary x 0 grid size and time step length independence analyse were implemented and as a result a uniform grid space of 0 1 m and a maximum time step of 0 01 day were adopted the transient model was run for a period of 10 day sensitivity analyses were conducted by systematically changing the parameters of ka ksb m and s s a in the base case fig 4 depicts the comparisons between the calculated head variations at x 50 m from eq 8 and numerical simulations under different combinations of parameters ka ksb m and s s a fig 4 indicates that eq 8 agrees very well with the numerical solution over the entire period therefore eq 8 is sufficiently accurate and robust to calculate the head variations of the stream aquifer interaction system as shown in fig 1 3 2 illustrations of buffer effect on identifying transient ksb with sfrt fig 5 shows the effect of s s sb on the head variations of the aquifer at x 20 m as portrayed in fig 5 despite the same stream stage fluctuation the streambeds with different s s sb induces distinct head variations of the aquifer it illustrates that the head variations in a riparian zone observation well are closely related to the composition of streambed sediments for a streambed composited with fine deposits e g fine loose sand silt or clay which often correspond to high s s sb stream stage fluctuation can induce lower amplitudes of the head variations of the aquifer because of stronger streambed storage effect moreover the relative differences among the amplitudes of the head variations for different s s sb increase with decreasing ksb fig 5 because the streambed storage effect is neglected in the flood wave response model of sfrt the head responses at an observation well may not be accurately calculated by the flood wave response model thus sfrt cannot provide reliable estimations of the time dependent ksb figs 6 9 depict the comparison between estimated ksb from sfrt and the imposed values under different combinations of parameters s s sb m s s a ka as illustrated in fig 6 significant under estimations can take place for sfrt in fig 6c for base case the differences between estimated and imposed ksb increase from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude as imposed ksb exponentially decreases furthermore because streambed storage effect is enhanced with increasing s s sb and m the differences between estimated and imposed ksb increase as s s sb and m increase figs 6 and 7 specifically as s s sb 1e 4 m 1 sfrt only slightly underestimates the time varying ksb fig 6a such differences rapidly increase and reach around 0 9 1 1 orders of magnitude as s s sb increases to 5e 3 m 1 fig 6d as expected for a thin streambed e g m 0 5 m only sight under estimations occur throughout a whole period of 60 days except for some over estimations during 0th 5 6th and 30th 34th day fig 7a for a thick streambed e g m 4 m the differences range from 1 0 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 7d in contrast the differences decrease as s s a and ka increase figs 8 and 9 for example as s s a 1e 5 m 1 the differences vary from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 8a while they are less than 0 2 order of magnitude as s s a 5e 4 m 1 fig 8d moreover for ka 0 1 m d 1 the differences range from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 9a and remain less than 0 3 order of magnitude as ka increases to 50 m d 1 fig 9d in comparison with considering the streambed storage effect the present new method provides more reliable estimations of ksb figs 6 9 almost all the estimated ksb values from the new method agree well with imposed ksb except for somewhat over estimations in the situations of thick streambeds e g m 4 m fig 7d and high s s a e g 5e 4 m 1 fig 8d notably as reported by gianni et al 2016 large over estimations for estimated ksb from sfrt occurred at 30th day when a sharp increase in ksb was imposed similar with sfrt large difference up to 1 2 orders of magnitude between estimated ksb from the new method and imposed value took place near 30th day e g fig 6a 4 field application the new method developed in this study is tested in the following field application 4 1 study site the study site

generally a relatively continuously silt clay layer presents near surface in the area the underlying great bend aquifer consists of alternation of fining upward sand and gravel lenses which does not always present to sandy silt clay sequences sophocleous 1991 in addition many highly transmissive and southeast northwest east west buried paleochannels are distributed throughout the area sophocleous 1991 4 2 the field data analysis and interpretation because of the near surface silt clay layer the great bend aquifer is essentially a confined aquifer which is characterized by a low storativity value sophocleous 1991 as discussed in section 3 for a stream confined aquifer system with a low storativity the present new method can provide a better estimation of ks b and its dynamics than sfrt and therefore is applied to determine the time varying ksb using the time series data of the arkansas river stream stage and the hydraulic head at the observation well p as shown in fig 10 the observation well p is along a major paleochannel and 244 m far from the arkansas river the head variations of the observation well p had excellent responses to the arkansas river streamflow recorded by the great bend stream gaging station sophocleous 1991 based on the hydrograph of the arkansas river streamflow for 1989 we derived the hydrograph of stream stage for 1989 fig 11 through a linear interpolation based on the relationship between the streamflow and gage height at the great bend stream gaging station for 2007 2008 waterdata usgs gov nwis uv 07141300 the size of pow and the shift for the new method were 10 days and 0 5 days respectively the hydraulic conductivity of 0 5 m d 1 and specific storage of 1e 6 m 1 for the confined aquifer and the thickness of 2 m and specific storage of 5e 4 m 1 for the streambed were respectively used the ksb value for every shift of 0 5 day was optimized to fit the measured depths to water at the observation well p to analyze streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb the improved sfrt was also employed and the same parameters of the new method were adopted as shown in fig 11a the calculated and measured depths to water generally agree well with each other the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 92 and 0 89 are generated by the new method and the improved sfrt respectively where nse i 1 i t h i h i 2 i 1 i t h i h i 2 it is the total number of calculated measured heads and nse 1 represents a perfect fit to measured data fig 11b depicts the estimated time series of ksb from the new method and the improved sfrt the estimated ksb corresponds to the average of the streambed hydraulic conductivity of the river reach near the great bend stream gaging station the trend of time series of ksb generated from the new method and the improved sfrt are generally consistent with each other specifically according to the time series of ksb from the new method during 155th 169th days ksb did not increase as a flood took place but decreased by roughly 50 this can be explained by that new clogging layer rapidly developed after old clogging layer was removed by the flooding water furthermore the new clogging layer will be compressed due to increased stream depth therefore ksb decreased despite of the flood bouwer and rice 1989 chen et al 2013 houston et al 1999 the phenomenon of ksb decreasing with increased stream depth also took place in the period of 175th 179th days during 169th 175th days and 179th 185th days ksb increased as stream stage fell this may be attributed to the following reasons as stream stage dropped below the groundwater table of the riparian zone the confined aquifer would be drained by the arkansas river the fine streambed sediments can be washed away due to the combined effects of the upward gradient of groundwater flow and streamflow gianni et al 2016 in the period of 185th 205th days ksb decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude as streamflow weakened and fine particles were deposited at the streambed an abrupt increase of ksb occurred at 205th day as a response to the rapid rise in stream stage and after that ksb decreased again due to streambed clogging caused by drops of the stream stage despite the consistence of the general variation trend of time dependent ksb estimated by the two methods the improved sfrt generates lower estimations of ksb relative to those from the new method because the improved sfrt completely neglects the streambed storage effect as depicted in fig 11b the estimated ksb from the improved sfrt are 0 1 order of magnitude less than those from the new method over 159th 185th day and slight differences around 0 1 order of magnitude take place during other remaining periods in addition during the period of 160th 170th day the estimated ksb from the new method decreases with a falling stream stage while the improved sfrt generates a reverse variation trend 5 discussions the frt has been widely used to determine the hydraulic properties of streambed because it is relatively less time consuming and simple to operate gianni et al 2016 jha and singh 2014 jerbi 2018 based on frt in which static parameters are optimized through inversion of a flood wave response model gianni et al 2016 developed sfrt to identify the transience in streambed conductance through successive inversion of a flood wave response model however in these studies the streambed storage effect was not incorporated the neglect of streambed storage effect may be attributed to the conventional assumption that the streambed thickness is typically thin e g a few centimeters and therefore its storage effect is not important however thick streambeds e g several meters are increasingly detected in nature due to the extensive construction of dams around the world nilsson 2005 lehner et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 2019 where thick streambeds can be induced by low flow conditions created by a dam su et al 2007 xian et al 2017 several field investigations e g crosbie et al 2014 lamontagne et al 2011a 2011b 2014 levy et al 2011 wojnar et al 2013 have provided direct evidences on the development of a few meters thick streambeds clogging layers as described in section 1 before analyzing the streambed storage effect on the estimated ksb from sfrt we have improved the optimization method of the previous sfrt specifically in the previous sfrt gianni et al 2016 used gda to optimize the streambed conductance however gda is relatively slow to converge to a minimum to expedite the convergence of gda a relatively high termination tolerance or a relatively high learning rate has to be adopted but they may lead to unacceptable loss of accuracy for example in the study of gianni et al 2016 a termination tolerance of 0 1 m was used for the minimum change of sse some errors of estimations generated by the previous sfrt see fig 4 in gianni et al 2016 may be caused by this relatively high termination criterion in this study an advanced optimization approach trra which is more robust than gda was adopted to achieve more reliable estimations for sfrt a termination criterion of 1 10 10 was used for the minimum change of sse and the optimized parameter ksb to ensure the accuracy of computation the present study showed that sfrt is excellent to identify the transience in the hydraulic properties of a thin m is less than 1 m streambed but significant under estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude may be resulted because of neglecting the streambed storage effect if sfrt is employed to determine the transience in ksb or streambed conductance this is particularly true for a stream confined aquifer system while the streambed is thick e g m is greater than 1 m and composited with fine deposits such as loose fine sand silt or clay which corresponds to high storativity but low permeability and the confined aquifer is characterized by a relatively low permeability e g 0 1 10 m d 1 and a low storativity e g s s a 1e 5 m 1 such as dense fine sands or mixture of sands and gravels to overcome the problem discussed above based on the framework of sfrt we have presented a new method in which streambed storage effect is included to estimate time varying ksb for a stream confined aquifer system the new method provides more reliable estimations of ksb like other methods of frt it can rapidly identify the time varying ksb based on the time series data of stream stage and the hydraulic head of a riparian zone observation well despite the advantages discussed above the proposed method has some limitations of frt as follows first in nature the permeability of superficial streambed sediments often changes more dramatically than those of deeper sediments due to erosion deposition or bioclogging due to the common limitations of analytical methods like other flood wave response methods the proposed method assumes that the streambed is homogeneous and isotropic and does not incorporate any heterogeneity information of the streambed aquifer therefore the estimated ksb only represents the equivalent average of hydraulic conductivity however the heterogeneous evolution of streambed sediments permeability can be reasonably modeled by the permeability variations over time of an equivalent homogeneous streambed second the unit step response function eq 8 is limited to the interaction of a stream confined aquifer system or the weak nonlinear interaction of a stream unconfined aquifer system where the variation of the groundwater level is small in comparison with the saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer thus the transmissivity or storativity does not change with time considerably last one dimensional flow in the stream aquifer system is assumed and it implies that the stream fully penetrates the aquifer in fact a partially penetrating stream can be reasonably modeled with a fully penetrating stream by using an equivalent streambed hydraulic conductivity or thickness ha et al 2007 singh et al 2002 in addition some points need be noted in the application of the proposed method gianni et al 2016 reynolds 1987 first the proposed method requires that the distance of observation well to the edge of a stream i e the term of x in eq 8 does not significantly change with time when the stream stage fluctuates over time second a fluctuating stream stage time series is required as the input signal and good response should be observed in the observation well of an aquifer therefore the observed data close to a stream are often preferred third the effects of pumping recharge well or other stress sources e g ponds on groundwater level variations are not incorporated in the proposed method the regions significantly affected by these non stream stage fluctuations should be avoided to employ this method furthermore as seen from eq 8 the parameters of ka s s a s s sb m should be known prior to estimate ksb relative to ka s s a s s sb m is sometime difficult to identify in field investigations nevertheless two feasible ways are possible to determine m first geophysical techniques e g resistivity seismic wave and electromagnetism can provide the spatial structures of riverbed sediments on the basis of the geophysical survey the thickness of riverbed can be further determined through the use of a host of other methods e g riverbed core sampling water heat modelling etc several examples have been listed in section 1 second the parameter of streambed thickness m can also be acquired by simultaneously optimizing the parameters of m and ksb we have also attempted to search for a dimensionless number or criterion to quantify if the streambed storage effect should be considered or can be neglected but failed to come out with such a number further research is necessary in this direction for the practical purpose of the new method of this study 6 conclusions in this study after improving the previous sfrt by substituting the gradient descent algorithm with a more robust optimization method trust region reflective algorithm we analyzed the influence of streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb from sfrt in which streambed storage effect is neglected a new method in which streambed storage effect is incorporated was proposed the key findings summarized from this study include 1 by using trust region reflective algorithm the improved sfrt can provide a better estimation of time dependent ksb than the previous sfrt in which gradient descent algorithm was used the errors from the improved sfrt generally remain under 20 of imposed ksb while sinusoidal variations of the errors with a maximum of 50 of imposed values occurred on the previous sfrt 2 sfrt is valid to identify the transience in the hydraulic properties of a stream aquifer system in which the streambed storage effect is relatively weak e g a thin streambed with a low storativity but significant under estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude of time dependent ksb can be resulted by sfrt because of neglecting the streambed storage effect it is particularly true for a stream confined aquifer system

relatively low permeability e g roughly 0 1 10 m d 1 and relatively low storativity roughly 1e 5 m 1 e g dense fine sands 3 to overcome the shortcomings of the existing sfrt model a new method

6009,determination of streambed hydraulic conductivity ksb and its variations over time are critical for quantifying exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater previous studies have used flood wave response techniques frt to determine ksb or its transience excluding the streambed storage effect thus the estimated ksb may not be reliable in this study after improving a previous frt by substituting the gradient descent algorithm with an advanced and robust optimization method trust region reflective algorithm we have analyzed the influence of streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb through successive inversion of flood wave responses the study shows that the streambed storage effect is not important for identifying the transience in the hydraulic

the streambed is a key factor controlling the exchange flux between surface water sw and groundwater gw boano et al 2014 brunner et al 2017 constantz 2016 temporal variations in hydraulic properties e

irvine et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the streambed transience has received increasing attention in the last two decades e g battin and sengschmitt 1999 blaschke et al 2003 genereux et al 2008 gianni et al 2016 hatch et al 2010 mutiti and levy 2010 ping et al 2018 simpson and meixner 2012 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 xian et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2018 because of its non negligible influence on the water and chemical fluxes across a streambed for example mutiti and levy 2010 indicated that during storm events the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed ksb almost increased by one order of magnitude due to loss of fine sediments in the great miami river southwest ohio usa battin and sengschmitt 1999 showed that the development of biofilms can drop the value of ksb by two to three orders of magnitude corresponding to a five to six fold reduction in riverbed leakage coefficients for the danube river vienna austria wang et al 2017 illustrated that neglecting the impact of annual temperature variations on ksb would result in an overestimation of 10 15 on stream water infiltration for the lower heihe river an ephemeral stream in north western china therefore it is crucial to determine temporal variations of ksb for accurately quantifying interactions between sw and gw a range of in situ direct measurement methods such as permeameter tests seepage meter test and slug tests and grain size analysis of streambed samples have been used for determining ksb e g genereux et al 2008 kalbus et al 2006 landon et al 2001 wang et al 2014 in addition coupled heat tracer and hydraulic gradient measurement was also adopted to calculate transient ksb e g hatch et al 2010 mutiti and levy 2010 however mostly because of commonly seen spatial heterogeneity of streambed sediments calver 2001 determining the spatiotemporal variations of ksb is challenging with these approaches from which the point estimations of ksb are derived brunner et al 2017 kalbus et al 2006 moreover direct measurement methods are difficult to implement for deep rivers or fast flowing rivers brunner et al 2017 recently integrated surface and subsurface hydrological models were developed to determine spatial variations in ksb across a reach with inversion techniques e g niswonger et al 2008 shanafield et al 2014 tang et al 2018 but parameter estimation with the integrated models is quite time consuming gianni et al 2016 tang et al 2018 in contrast the flood wave response technique frt can rapidly estimate the hydraulic parameters of a streambed gianni et al 2016 jha and singh 2014 jerbi 2018 and is relatively simple to implement because it only requires time series data of stream stage fluctuations and the corresponding hydraulic head variations of a riparian zone observation well gianni et al 2016 this approach inverses the hydraulic properties of a streambed by minimizing the sum of squared errors between calculated and observed hydraulic heads of an observation well close to a stream bank the hydraulic heads are calculated from a convolution of the responses to stream stage fluctuations based on an analytical solution of stream aquifer interaction models gianni et al 2016 extended this technique to calculate the transience in streambed conductance through successive inversion of a flood wave response model ha et al 2007 hall and moench 1972 singh et al 2002 the upgraded technique developed by gianni et al 2016 named as sfrt hereinafter has been respectively employed to determine the transience in the streambed permeability and conductance of reaches in the schwarzbach river southwest of frankfurt germany zhou et al 2018 and the rhone river in the south switzerland gianni et al 2016 in prior studies the analytical model of carslaw and jaeger 1959 which describes the one dimensional transient interaction between a fully penetrating stream with a semipervious streambed and a confined aquifer was often adopted as a unit step response function in a flood wave response model to inverse the hydraulic parameters of a streambed e g gianni et al 2016 ha et al 2007 singh et al 2002 2004 zhou et al 2018 moench and barlow 2000 developed one dimensional analytical models for transient interaction between a fully penetrating stream and a confined unconfined aquifer the analytical models can be applied for various scenarios e g the confined unconfined aquifer may or may not be bounded by a streambed and may or may not be overlaid by a leaky aquifer and the unconfined aquifer also can be recharged discharged by precipitation evapotranspiration based on the analytical models of moench and barlow 2000 barlow et al 2000 has developed two computer programs to estimate the hydraulic properties of streambed and aquifer moreover barlow and moench 1998 derived a two dimensional analytical solution for cross sectional flow in a fully penetrating stream unconfined aquifer system kisekka et al 2013 and jerbi 2018 used this two dimensional analytical model and a convolution integral method to assess the hydraulic parameters of streambed and aquifer however in these previous analytical models only flow equation for an aquifer aquitard was solved and the leakages through a streambed were represented with a cauchy boundary condition thus streambed storage was not included such representation of the leakage from a stream as a cauchy boundary condition may hold for a thin e g a few centimeters or dozens of centimeters streambed but in the situations of a thick e g several meters streambed the storage of streambed may significantly influence the propagation of signals of stream stage fluctuations from a stream into an aquifer li et al 2008 sun and zhan 2006 2007 a phenomenon called streambed buffer effect the negligence of the streambed buffer effect on the propagation of stream stage fluctuations may result in unreliable estimation of the hydraulic properties of a streambed and therefore their dynamic variations over time in fact a streambed several meters thick has been increasingly seen in nature where more and more regulated rivers are emerging in the world nilsson 2005 lehner et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 2019 in regulated rivers backwater induced by a dam often create a low flow velocity condition thus promotes fine sediment to deposit and form a thick riverbed su et al 2007 xian et al 2017 for example crosbie et al 2014 mapped the thickness of clogging layer over a 2 km reach of billabong creek in southeastern australia through use of a geophysical technique based on in river vertical electrical soundings which has been calibrated to riverbed core profiles in their field investigation along the survey transect about 1 m to more than 4 m thick clogging layers overlying the sand aquifer were detected and the maximum riverbed thickness can reach as many as 7 m lamontagne et al 2011a b 2014 identified the clogging layers of lachlan river and billabong creek in southeastern australia by collecting riverbed sediments core profiles and found that the thickness of clogging layers can range from 0 5 m to greater than 2 m by applying a combination of field methods at multiple scales including seepage meter slug test coupled water flow and heat modeling of river and groundwater and geophysical techniques including electrical resistivity seismic wave and electromagnetism wojnar et al 2013 identified the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of riverbeds at four field sites along the great miami river in ohio usa and indicated that the superficial fine sediments layers of the riverbed were up to 2 m thick for the boat ramp site and from 0 to 3 m thick for the north hamilton site likewise levy et al 2011 measured the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the riverbed in great miami river near the charles m bolton municipal well field through a use of multiple methods like wojnar et al 2013 and a 2 34 m thick riverbed overlying the glacial outwash aquifer was observed in this study we first analyze how streambed storage effect influences the estimation of temporal variations of ksb from sfrt second we develop a new method in which the streambed storage effect is included to estimate time dependent ksb in this new model the streambed storage effect is incorporated and an advanced and robust optimization method of trust region reflective algorithm trra is employed for the inversion of hydraulic properties lastly the present method is applied to estimate the temporal variations of ksb of a reach in the arkansas river the great bend prairie of kansas usa 2 methods in this section an overview of the development of the new method with the streambed buffer effect is first described in section 2 1 next to strive for better estimation of ksb from sfrt some improvement of sfrt is provided in section 2 2 lastly the method for analyzing the streambed storage effect on the estimation of sfrt is illustrated in section 2 3 2 1 development of the new method with streambed buffer effect to estimate temporal variations in ksb through successive inversion of a flood wave response model three iterative steps are required according to gianni et al 2016 1 the response of an aquifer at a given distance from a stream is calculated with a convolution relation between stream stage variations and a unit step response function of a stream aquifer system 2 the estimation of streambed permeability for a designated time step is performed using a parameter estimation approach which minimizes the sum of squared errors between observed and calculated hydraulic heads 3 the steps 1 and 2 are repeatedly implement to acquire ksb for successive time steps 2 1 1 the flood wave response model with the streambed storage effect for a semi infinite stream aquifer system with a semipervious stream bank fig 1 the flow in the streambed aquifer system can be described by two one dimensional diffusion equations 1 2 h sb x t x 2 1 α sb h sb x t t 0 x m 2 2 h a x t x 2 1 α a h a x t t m x where hsb ha represent the change of hydraulic head in the streambed and the aquifer respectively l αsb αa denote the hydraulic diffusivity of the streambed and the aquifer respectively l2t 1 and equal to kid si where ki ksb ka are the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed and the aquifer respectively lt 1 and d denotes the thickness of the aquifer l si ssb sa represent the storativities of the streambed and the aquifer respectively m is the thickness of the streambed x is horizontal coordinate and the origin is at the left edge of the streambed t is time t initially the variations of hydraulic heads of the streambed and the aquifer are zeroes i e 3 h sb x 0 h a x 0 0 the continuities of head and flux at the streambed aquifer interface x m are maintained 4 h sb m t h a m t 5 k sb h sb m t x k a h a m t x the boundary conditions of the stream at x 0 and x are respectively described as 6 h sb 0 t f t 7 d h a t dx 0 where f t represents the time dependent stream stage a minor point to note is that the variation of stream stage along the stream channel is not considered here and the stream channel meander is not considered as well these assumptions are probably reasonably as the scale of concern here is quite limited near the streambank liu and ball 1998 derived an analytical solution for solute diffusion in a one dimensional semi infinite two layer system with a constant source based on their analytical solution we have developed a new analytical model of stream aquifer interaction considering streambed storage effect by solving eqs 1 6 i e a unit step response function of the aquifer 8 p x t 1 ξ j 0 ξ j e r f c 2 j 1 m 1 α sb x m 1 α a 2 t where ξ k a 1 α a k sb 1 α sb k a 1 α a k sb 1 α sb j is the index of the summation and erfc is the complementary error function notably the infinite series in eq 8 require only the first 3 5 terms to converge liu and ball 1998 the detailed derivation of eq 8 is put in the section 1 of the supplementary material see section 3 1 for the verification of eq 8 the response of the aquifer to stream stage variations can be expressed by a convolution relation 9 h x t 0 t f τ p x t τ d τ where f t is the time variation of stream stage for any variations of stream stage the response of the aquifer can derive from the discrete form of eq 9 10 h x n δ t k 1 n f k p x n k 1 δ t where n represents the number of time steps with a constant length δt k denotes the index of the summation and f k is the variation of stream stage during a time step 11 f k f k f k 1 2 1 2 estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity the method of walk forward optimization is adopted to identify the time varying ksb as illustrated in fig 2 the complete optimization process contains multiple inversion sub processes each inversion optimizes ksb by using heads data within a time window in the observed time series data the time window is called parameter optimization window pow the parameter ksb in a pow is assumed to be constant and optimized by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse between calculated and observed heads in the pow 12 sse i 1 m h i h i 2 where hi and hi are the observed and calculated heads respectively hi can be calculated by eq 10 m is the total number of observed calculated heads within a pow i is the index of the summation to estimate the parameter ksb throughout the study period the inversion process repeats while the pow progressively shifts forward by a time step i e a shift until the end of the study period the shift is usually much less than the size of a pow thus a pow always partly overlaps with its last or next pow see fig 2 the total number of estimations of ksb is determined by the ratio of the length of the study period to the size of a shift see gianni et al 2016 for detailed explanations of the workflow of the walk forward optimization method within each inversion of the walk forward optimization gianni et al 2016 used a gradient descent algorithm gda to estimate the hydraulic properties of a streambed for a pow gda is one of the simplest optimization approaches and is easy to implement but it converges slowly when close to the minimum meza 2010 to speed up the convergence of gda the accuracy of computation in certain situations has to be sacrificed to some extent by using a relatively high convergence tolerance criterion or a relatively large learning rate which may result in instability and non convergence consequentially as a matter of fact gda is not commonly employed in practice meza 2010 in comparison the more advanced optimization approaches such as levenberg marquardt algorithm lma and trra etc are preferable to overcome the numerical problem of gda here we have adopted trra which is more robust than gda to achieve accurate estimations of ksb within a shorter computational time trra is a combination of the trust region optimization approach and the interior reflective newton algorithm coleman and li 1994 1996 and is a powerful approach to solve the nonlinear least squares problem 13 min κ f κ 1 m f i κ 2 l b κ u b f i κ h i h i κ where f i κ

current point κ k f κ k h k is the hessian matrix 2 f κ k δ k denotes a trust region size is the 1 norm the trial step s is determined by minimizing the quadratic function q s under the constraint of s δ k if f κ k s f κ k κ changes from κ k to κ k s otherwise κ keeps unchanged and remains at κ k and the trust region size δ k is reduced thus the key issue of the trust region method is its sub problem of finding the trial step s and defining the trust region size δ k to achieve global and local convergence and high computational efficiency of each iteration the interior reflective newton algorithm was developed by coleman and li 1994 1996 and li 1993 by employing a reflective transformation technique to the box constrained quadratic sub problem eq 15 was transformed into the following

study a matlab program has been developed to implement the new method by coding the walk forward optimization algorithm in which the head response function h x t and trra are incorporated the function lsqnonlin in matlab is applied to implement trra a tolerance of 1 10 10 for the minimum change in the optimized parameter κ and the minimum change in the objective function f κ was used to ensure the accuracy of estimated ksb 2 2 the improvement on sfrt although the transience in streambed conductance can be clearly detected by the previous sfrt however the results derived from the approach may not be estimated within adequate accuracy gianni et al 2016 to provide a better analysis of streambed storage effect on the estimated results from sfrt in which streambed storage effect is not considered trra is adopted for sfrt instead of gda used by gianni et al 2016 we used the improved sfrt to estimate the transience in ksb based on the same synthetic data of gianni et al 2016 fig 3 shows the comparisons of estimated ksb from the improved and the original sfrt with a pow of 1 day and a shift of 1 h as illustrated in fig 3 the accuracy of estimations of ksb has been significantly improved by the improved sfrt a point to note is that over estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude also took place near 29 5th 30th day when sharp increases in ksb were manually imposed in the model simulation it is not shown in fig 3 for the convenience of comparison 2 3 synthetic data to analyze the streambed storage effect on estimations of dynamic ksb from sfrt we first used comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa to simulate water flow in the stream aquifer system as shown in fig 1 and then generate a series of synthetic data of groundwater head variation in the model simulations an assumed time varying ksb trend was manually imposed the variations of hydraulic heads from numerical simulations were regarded as observed data the temporal variations of ksb were estimated by the improved sfrt and then the estimated and the imposed ksb were compared to analyze the streambed storage effect a base case was setup first a one dimensional finite domain was chosen to substitute the infinite domain as depicted in fig 1 the width of the one dimensional domain varies from 5000 m to 50 000 m to satisfy the no flow right boundary condition the specific storages of s s sb 1e 3 m 1 and s s a 1e 5 m 1 were chosen for the streambed and the aquifer respectively the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ka is 0 1 m d 1 the thickness of the streambed is 2 m as gianni et al 2016 did the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed ksb is imposed by the following sequence ksb first exponentially decreases from 0 1 m d 1 to 0 001 m d 1 over a period of 30 day and then rapidly increases from 0 001 m d 1 to 0 1 m d 1 within 0 2 day and exponentially decreases again from 0 1 m d 1 to 0 001 m d 1 over 29 8 day such variations of ksb represent the evolution of ksb experiencing clogging and erosion and clogging processes in sequence a sinusoidal variation of stream stage with a period of 1 day and an amplitude of 1 m is imposed at x 0 m the transient model is setup for a period of 60 day we have conducted grid and time step independence analyses to ensure that simulated results were independence of grid size and time step length consequentially a uniform grid spacing of 0 1 m and a maximum time step of 0 01 day were adopted a sensitivity analysis was carried out by altering the parameters of s s sb m s s a ka the size of pow and the shift for the improved sfrt were 1 day and 0 1 day respectively 3 results 3 1 verification of the new analytical model of stream aquifer interaction considering streambed storage effect to test the validity of the developed analytical solution of stream aquifer interaction i e eq 8 we compared the analytical solution with numerical simulation results under different combinations of parameters including ka ksb m s s a the numerical method is similar with that described in section 2 3 for the base case the parameters of ka 1 m d 1 ksb 0 1 m d 1 s s a 1e 5 m 1 s s sb 1e 3 m 1 and m 1 m were used a unit step function was imposed at the left boundary x 0 grid size and time step length independence analyse were implemented and as a result a uniform grid space of 0 1 m and a maximum time step of 0 01 day were adopted the transient model was run for a period of 10 day sensitivity analyses were conducted by systematically changing the parameters of ka ksb m and s s a in the base case fig 4 depicts the comparisons between the calculated head variations at x 50 m from eq 8 and numerical simulations under different combinations of parameters ka ksb m and s s a fig 4 indicates that eq 8 agrees very well with the numerical solution over the entire period therefore eq 8 is sufficiently accurate and robust to calculate the head variations of the stream aquifer interaction system as shown in fig 1 3 2 illustrations of buffer effect on identifying transient ksb with sfrt fig 5 shows the effect of s s sb on the head variations of the aquifer at x 20 m as portrayed in fig 5 despite the same stream stage fluctuation the streambeds with different s s sb induces distinct head variations of the aquifer it illustrates that the head variations in a riparian zone observation well are closely related to the composition of streambed sediments for a streambed composited with fine deposits e g fine loose sand silt or clay which often correspond to high s s sb stream stage fluctuation can induce lower amplitudes of the head variations of the aquifer because of stronger streambed storage effect moreover the relative differences among the amplitudes of the head variations for different s s sb increase with decreasing ksb fig 5 because the streambed storage effect is neglected in the flood wave response model of sfrt the head responses at an observation well may not be accurately calculated by the flood wave response model thus sfrt cannot provide reliable estimations of the time dependent ksb figs 6 9 depict the comparison between estimated ksb from sfrt and the imposed values under different combinations of parameters s s sb m s s a ka as illustrated in fig 6 significant under estimations can take place for sfrt in fig 6c for base case the differences between estimated and imposed ksb increase from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude as imposed ksb exponentially decreases furthermore because streambed storage effect is enhanced with increasing s s sb and m the differences between estimated and imposed ksb increase as s s sb and m increase figs 6 and 7 specifically as s s sb 1e 4 m 1 sfrt only slightly underestimates the time varying ksb fig 6a such differences rapidly increase and reach around 0 9 1 1 orders of magnitude as s s sb increases to 5e 3 m 1 fig 6d as expected for a thin streambed e g m 0 5 m only sight under estimations occur throughout a whole period of 60 days except for some over estimations during 0th 5 6th and 30th 34th day fig 7a for a thick streambed e g m 4 m the differences range from 1 0 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 7d in contrast the differences decrease as s s a and ka increase figs 8 and 9 for example as s s a 1e 5 m 1 the differences vary from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 8a while they are less than 0 2 order of magnitude as s s a 5e 4 m 1 fig 8d moreover for ka 0 1 m d 1 the differences range from 0 5 to 1 5 orders of magnitude fig 9a and remain less than 0 3 order of magnitude as ka increases to 50 m d 1 fig 9d in comparison with considering the streambed storage effect the present new method provides more reliable estimations of ksb figs 6 9 almost all the estimated ksb values from the new method agree well with imposed ksb except for somewhat over estimations in the situations of thick streambeds e g m 4 m fig 7d and high s s a e g 5e 4 m 1 fig 8d notably as reported by gianni et al 2016 large over estimations for estimated ksb from sfrt occurred at 30th day when a sharp increase in ksb was imposed similar with sfrt large difference up to 1 2 orders of magnitude between estimated ksb from the new method and imposed value took place near 30th day e g fig 6a 4 field application the new method developed in this study is tested in the following field application 4 1 study site the study site is located at great bend central kansas usa fig 10 in the great bend prairie of kansas the arkansas river keeps flowing northeastwards but changes its direction at great bend to flow southeastwards generally a relatively continuously silt clay layer presents near surface in the area the underlying great bend aquifer consists of alternation of fining upward sand and gravel lenses which does not always present to sandy silt clay sequences sophocleous 1991 in addition many highly transmissive and southeast northwest east west buried paleochannels are distributed throughout the area sophocleous 1991 4 2 the field data analysis and interpretation because of the near surface silt clay layer the great bend aquifer is essentially a confined aquifer which is characterized by a low storativity value sophocleous 1991 as discussed in section 3 for a stream confined aquifer system with a low storativity the present new method can provide a better estimation of ks b and its dynamics than sfrt and therefore is applied to determine the time varying ksb using the time series data of the arkansas river stream stage and the hydraulic head at the observation well p as shown in fig 10 the observation well p is along a major paleochannel and 244 m far from the arkansas river the head variations of the observation well p had excellent responses to the arkansas river streamflow recorded by the great bend stream gaging station sophocleous 1991 based on the hydrograph of the arkansas river streamflow for 1989 we derived the hydrograph of stream stage for 1989 fig 11 through a linear interpolation based on the relationship between the streamflow and gage height at the great bend stream gaging station for 2007 2008 waterdata usgs gov nwis uv 07141300 the size of pow and the shift for the new method were 10 days and 0 5 days respectively the hydraulic conductivity of 0 5 m d 1 and specific storage of 1e 6 m 1 for the confined aquifer and the thickness of 2 m and specific storage of 5e 4 m 1 for the streambed were respectively used the ksb value for every shift of 0 5 day was optimized to fit the measured depths to water at the observation well p to analyze streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb the improved sfrt was also employed and the same parameters of the new method were adopted as shown in fig 11a the calculated and measured depths to water generally agree well with each other the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 92 and 0 89 are generated by the new method and the improved sfrt respectively where nse i 1 i t h i h i 2 i 1 i t h i h i 2 it is the total number of calculated measured heads and nse 1 represents a perfect fit to measured data fig 11b depicts the estimated time series of ksb from the new method and the improved sfrt the estimated ksb corresponds to the average of the streambed hydraulic conductivity of the river reach near the great bend stream gaging station the trend of time series of ksb generated from the new method and the improved sfrt are generally consistent with each other specifically according to the time series of ksb from the new method during 155th 169th days ksb did not increase as a flood took place but decreased by roughly 50 this can be explained by that new clogging layer rapidly developed after old clogging layer was removed by the flooding water furthermore the new clogging layer will be compressed due to increased stream depth therefore ksb decreased despite of the flood bouwer and rice 1989 chen et al 2013 houston et al 1999 the phenomenon of ksb decreasing with increased stream depth also took place in the period of 175th 179th days during 169th 175th days and 179th 185th days ksb increased as stream stage fell this may be attributed to the following reasons as stream stage dropped below the groundwater table of the riparian zone the confined aquifer would be drained by the arkansas river the fine streambed sediments can be washed away due to the combined effects of the upward gradient of groundwater flow and streamflow gianni et al 2016 in the period of 185th 205th days ksb decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude as streamflow weakened and fine particles were deposited at the streambed an abrupt increase of ksb occurred at 205th day as a response to the rapid rise in stream stage and after that ksb decreased again due to streambed clogging caused by drops of the stream stage despite the consistence of the general variation trend of time dependent ksb estimated by the two methods the improved sfrt generates lower estimations of ksb relative to those from the new method because the improved sfrt completely neglects the streambed storage effect as depicted in fig 11b the estimated ksb from the improved sfrt are 0 1 order of magnitude less than those from the new method over 159th 185th day and slight differences around 0 1 order of magnitude take place during other remaining periods in addition during the period of 160th 170th day the estimated ksb from the new method decreases with a falling stream stage while the improved sfrt generates a reverse variation trend 5 discussions the frt has been widely used to determine the hydraulic properties of streambed because it is relatively less time consuming and simple to operate gianni et al 2016 jha and singh 2014 jerbi 2018 based on frt in which static parameters are optimized through inversion of a flood wave response model gianni et al 2016 developed sfrt to identify the transience in streambed conductance through successive inversion of a flood wave response model however in these studies the streambed storage effect was not incorporated the neglect of streambed storage effect may be attributed to the conventional assumption that the streambed thickness is typically thin e g a few centimeters and therefore its storage effect is not important however thick streambeds e g several meters are increasingly detected in nature due to the extensive construction of dams around the world nilsson 2005 lehner et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 2019 where thick streambeds can be induced by low flow conditions created by a dam su et al 2007 xian et al 2017 several field investigations e g crosbie et al 2014 lamontagne et al 2011a 2011b 2014 levy et al 2011 wojnar et al 2013 have provided direct evidences on the development of a few meters thick streambeds clogging layers as described in section 1 before analyzing the streambed storage effect on the estimated ksb from sfrt we have improved the optimization method of the previous sfrt specifically in the previous sfrt gianni et al 2016 used gda to optimize the streambed conductance however gda is relatively slow to converge to a minimum to expedite the convergence of gda a relatively high termination tolerance or a relatively high learning rate has to be adopted but they may lead to unacceptable loss of accuracy for example in the study of gianni et al 2016 a termination tolerance of 0 1 m was used for the minimum change of sse some errors of estimations generated by the previous sfrt see fig 4 in gianni et al 2016 may be caused by this relatively high termination criterion in this study an advanced optimization approach trra which is more robust than gda was adopted to achieve more reliable estimations for sfrt a termination criterion of 1 10 10 was used for the minimum change of sse and the optimized parameter ksb to ensure the accuracy of computation the present study showed that sfrt is excellent to identify the transience in the hydraulic properties of a thin m is less than 1 m streambed but significant under estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude may be resulted because of neglecting the streambed storage effect if sfrt is employed to determine the transience in ksb or streambed conductance this is particularly true for a stream confined aquifer system while the streambed is thick e g m is greater than 1 m and composited with fine deposits such as loose fine sand silt or clay which corresponds to high storativity but low permeability and the confined aquifer is characterized by a relatively low permeability e g 0 1 10 m d 1 and a low storativity e g s s a 1e 5 m 1 such as dense fine sands or mixture of sands and gravels to overcome the problem discussed above based on the framework of sfrt we have presented a new method in which streambed storage effect is included to estimate time varying ksb for a stream confined aquifer system the new method provides more reliable estimations of ksb like other methods of frt it can rapidly identify the time varying ksb based on the time series data of stream stage and the hydraulic head of a riparian zone observation well despite the advantages discussed above the proposed method has some limitations of frt as follows first in nature the permeability of superficial streambed sediments often changes more dramatically than those of deeper sediments due to erosion deposition or bioclogging due to the common limitations of analytical methods like other flood wave response methods the proposed method assumes that the streambed is homogeneous and isotropic and does not incorporate any heterogeneity information of the streambed aquifer therefore the estimated ksb only represents the equivalent average of hydraulic conductivity however the heterogeneous evolution of streambed sediments permeability can be reasonably modeled by the permeability variations over time of an equivalent homogeneous streambed second the unit step response function eq 8 is limited to the interaction of a stream confined aquifer system or the weak nonlinear interaction of a stream unconfined aquifer system where the variation of the groundwater level is small in comparison with the saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer thus the transmissivity or storativity does not change with time considerably last one dimensional flow in the stream aquifer system is assumed and it implies that the stream fully penetrates the aquifer in fact a partially penetrating stream can be reasonably modeled with a fully penetrating stream by using an equivalent streambed hydraulic conductivity or thickness ha et al 2007 singh et al 2002 in addition some points need be noted in the application of the proposed method gianni et al 2016 reynolds 1987 first the proposed method requires that the distance of observation well to the edge of a stream i e the term of x in eq 8 does not significantly change with time when the stream stage fluctuates over time second a fluctuating stream stage time series is required as the input signal and good response should be observed in the observation well of an aquifer therefore the observed data close to a stream are often preferred third the effects of pumping recharge well or other stress sources e g ponds on groundwater level variations are not incorporated in the proposed method the regions significantly affected by these non stream stage fluctuations should be avoided to employ this method furthermore as seen from eq 8 the parameters of ka s s a s s sb m should be known prior to estimate ksb relative to ka s s a s s sb m is sometime difficult to identify in field investigations nevertheless two feasible ways are possible to determine m first geophysical techniques e g resistivity seismic wave and electromagnetism can provide the spatial structures of riverbed sediments on the basis of the geophysical survey the thickness of riverbed can be further determined through the use of a host of other methods e g riverbed core sampling water heat modelling etc several examples have been listed in section 1 second the parameter of streambed thickness m can also be acquired by simultaneously optimizing the parameters of m and ksb we have also attempted to search for a dimensionless number or criterion to quantify if the streambed storage effect should be considered or can be neglected but failed to come out with such a number further research is necessary in this direction for the practical purpose of the new method of this study 6 conclusions in this study after improving the previous sfrt by substituting the gradient descent algorithm with a more robust optimization method trust region reflective algorithm we analyzed the influence of streambed storage effect on the estimation of time dependent ksb from sfrt in which streambed storage effect is neglected a new method in which streambed storage effect is incorporated was proposed the key findings summarized from this study include 1 by using trust region reflective algorithm the improved sfrt can provide a better estimation of time dependent ksb than the previous sfrt in which gradient descent algorithm was used the errors from the improved sfrt generally remain under 20 of imposed ksb while sinusoidal variations of the errors with a maximum of 50 of imposed values occurred on the previous sfrt 2 sfrt is valid to identify the transience in the hydraulic properties of a stream aquifer system in which the streambed storage effect is relatively weak e g a thin streambed with a low storativity but significant under estimations 1 2 orders of magnitude of time dependent ksb can be resulted by sfrt because of neglecting the streambed storage effect it is particularly true for a stream confined aquifer system if the streambed is composed of fine deposits e g silt clay with a thicker thickness greater than 1 m corresponding to low permeability but high storativity and the aquifer is characterized by relatively low permeability e g roughly 0 1 10 m d 1 and relatively low storativity roughly 1e 5 m 1 e g dense fine sands 3 to overcome the shortcomings of the existing sfrt model a new method considering the streambed storage effect has been proposed and it can provide more reliable estimations of time dependent ksb the new method has been successfully applied to estimate the time
