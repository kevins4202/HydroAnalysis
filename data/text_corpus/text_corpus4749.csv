23745,reinforced concrete rc slabs are the major components for building structures and underwater engineering plants however blast loading especially from contact explosion can cause significant damage to the target structures both in air and water the objective of this paper is to compare the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions three methods i e fully coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and coupled finite element method and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method fem sph are first employed to simulate the damage features of an rc slab to air contact explosion damage profiles of the rc slab to air contact explosion using the three methods are compared with the experiment results in the literature and the applicability and suitability of these methods are discussed subsequently the most effective method i e fem sph is used to describe the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion shock wave propagation characteristics from air and underwater contact explosions are discussed damage features of the rc slab to air and underwater contact explosions are compared damage characteristics and plastic deformation of reinforcement steel bars are also investigated keywords damage features reinforced concrete slab air contact explosion underwater contact explosion fem sph 1 introduction rc slabs as the principal components for engineering structures have been widely used all over the world however blast loading especially from contact explosion can cause significant damage to the target structures by comparing with non contact blasts nonlinear dynamic response of rc slabs to contact explosion is a more complex nonlinear problem as it involves the material and geometric nonlinearity loading rate dependent material properties dynamic interactions among the explosion products and the structure and time dependent structural deformation the rc slabs to contact explosions will undergo crater large deformation spalling and even punching although the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion have increasingly attracted attention in recent years the understanding of contact explosion loading is still relatively incomplete the damage mechanisms of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion are as yet unresolved but widely studied there are two major approaches i e experimental test and numerical simulation to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures under contact blast loadings the experimental test can provide intuitional observations and useful data of structures subjected to contact explosion the relevant explosion results of steels kumar et al 2015 rajendran and narasimhan 2001 concrete columns wu et al 2011 codina et al 2016 yao et al 2016 and rc slabs wang et al 2012 2015 li et al 2016a coughlin et al 2010 can be found in the bibliography however blast experimental efforts require the specialized equipment labors and vast fund furthermore the experimental tests require the use of relatively large amounts of charges which will involve potential risks and need careful handling with the rapid development of computer technology and the advancement of numerical techniques the numerical simulation could be a powerful supplement to the experimental tests many numerical methods have been developed to investigate the damage processes of the target structures to blast loadings such as cel sph and fem sph without being exhaustive some contributions to these methods and their applications in blast analysis of concrete structures are worth mentioning wang et al 2013 employed the cel method to study the behavior of one way square reinforced concrete rc slabs subjected to close in explosion their results showed that the failure modes of rc slabs are gradually changed from overall flexure to localized punching failure when the weight of the charge increases wang et al wang and zhang 2014 used the cel method to investigate the damage characteristics of concrete gravity dams subjected to underwater explosion yuan et al 2008 discussed the damage modes of rc slabs under contact detonation by using the cel method they found that with the increase of the weight of explosive the dimensions of damage crater increase and the slabs experience four different damage patterns namely explosive crater spalling perforation and punching rabczuk and eibl 2003 2006 adopted the sph method to perform the fragmentation process of the slabs they found that the sph method can easily handle large deformations and fracture in 2d computations jankowiak and lodygowski 2013 compared the blast damage and structural failure of the concrete using the fem and sph hu et al 2014 investigated the dynamic deformation process of concrete structures to blast loadings and found that the fem sph method can basically ensure conservation of total energy in damage process xu et al xu and liu 2008 modeled the whole processes from the propagation of the pressure wave to the response concrete structures through the fem sph method they concluded that this model can be used for reasonably accurate explosive analysis of structures although the computational efficiency of the cel method is very high the calculation may be terminated when the elements are too distorted lu et al 2005 the erosion criterion is usually used to avoid this problem however choosing the erosion criterion for the structure may lead to the massive deletion of the elements and can t maintain the mass conservation the sph method as a particle method of lagrangian has an advantage in dealing with the large deformation problems however accurate sph simulations require large run time autodyn 1998 in order to accurately and conveniently simulate the dynamic response of structures subjected to contact explosion a combination of fem and sph fem sph is presented which integrates the high computational efficiency of fem and advantages of sph method wang et al 2005 ming et al 2016 yang et al 2012 it has been proved that the fem sph method can provide acceptable predictions of structural response to dynamic loading at a lower cost however it should be noted that there is little research about comparing the applicability and suitability of the three methods when used to describe the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion during the service life of some important structures such as embankments bridge piers and dams they may undergo air blast loading as well as underwater blast loading owing to the large differences in the speed of sound and mass density between water and air the dynamic response of structures subjected to air and underwater blast loadings will be significantly different although researchers have investigated the difference of shock wave propagation characteristics and structure response to air and underwater explosions rajendran and lee 2009 clutter and stahl 2004 kwak et al 2012 librescu et al 2006 wang et al 2014 they mainly focused on non contact explosion because the contact explosion is likely to cause more serious damage to structures li et al 2015 2016b zhou and hao 2009 zhang et al 2014 more attention should be paid to this blast scenario hence the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are still needed for further research the purpose of this paper is to investigate the damage characteristics and dynamic response of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods are used to simulate the damage processes of the rc slab to air contact explosion and the final damage profiles of the rc slab are compared with the experiment results in the literature the validity of the three algorithms is examined the most effective method i e fem sph method is finally selected to simulate the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion shock wave propagation characteristics from contact explosions in air and water are compared damage characteristics of rc slabs under air and underwater contact explosions are also discussed 2 description of the coupled method with the rapid development of the computer technology and the advancement of numerical techniques the numerical simulation could be a powerful method to describe the dynamic response of structures under blasting load although many numerical methodologies have been widely adopted and developed only three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods are selected in the present study 2 1 cel numerical approach the cel method adopted in the present study has been made possible in autodyn autodyn 2006 and other hydrocodes in this method the eulerian material can exert the pressure boundary conditions on the lagrange element which causes displacement of the structure and the lagrange interface can cut through the eulerian mesh that is fixed in space in an arbitrary manner the lagrangian interface in return provides the velocity boundary conditions to eulerian material flow and the eulerian material cannot penetrate the lagrange element a typical coupled situation is shown in fig 1 in this coupled method the finite volume method is used to solve the eulerian equation 2 2 the smooth particle hydrodynamic sph method when the lagrangian algorithm is selected to describe the dynamic response of structures to contact explosion the calculation processes will be faced with the problem of the mesh distortion and tangling however the sph technique which is originated from an application in astrophysics by lucy 1977 bypasses the requirement for a numerical grid to avoid this problem in the sph method the arbitrarily distributed particles carry all the computational information including the elastic modulus and velocity as well as the mass this method uses a kernel approximation which is based on randomly distributed interpolation points to calculate the derivatives 2 3 coupling algorithm of sph with fem accurate sph simulations require a large number of particles throughout the sph region which will require a large amount of the computational effort the coupled fem sph method can solve this problem in addition this coupled approach will be especially effective for modeling the problems involving large deformations caused by the blasting loadings in the coupled fem sph method the conventional fem is used to model the far medium with the small deformation and the sph method is adopted to model the explosion processes and the area with large deformation caused by the blast loadings fig 2 shows the basic concept on how the sph particles coupled with the traditional lagrange fem mesh the smaller real circle larger broken circle around particle i and smaller broken circle around fem node represent sph particles support domain of the sph particles and background particles respectively the variables of the background particle are consistent with those of the corresponding fem nodes such as the particle velocity stress mass and position the fem nodes are added to sph neighbor list in the mode of background particles in the present paper the calculation of momentum energy and density for particle i is done with contributions from particles n 1 n 2 n 5 and fem nodes n 6 n 7 n 8 to avoiding boundary effects the smoothing function w is not truncated by the boundary this is because the support domain of the sph particle near the interface does not interact with the problem domain liu and liu 2003 see fig 3 3 material model 3 1 material model for concrete in the present study the riedel hiermaier thoma rht riedel et al 1999 dynamic damage model which is developed on the basis of the holmquist johnson cook hjc model holmquist et al 1993 is used for modeling of the concrete material this model which can reflect the characteristics of the concrete material behavior at a high strain rate is particularly useful for modeling the dynamic behavior of brittle materials such as concrete and rock under dynamic loading the rht material model also takes into account pressure hardening strain hardening strain rate hardening third invariant dependence for compressive and tensile meridians and a damage model for strain softening it can be used in conjunction with the existing tensile crack softening algorithm the strain rate dependence is taken into account by expanding the failure surface in the stress space where the degree of expansion depends on the hydrostatic stresses i e the dynamic increase effect is larger for tensile than compressive states of stress the effect of the loading path on the yield surface is taken into account by a dependence of the third invariant the rht model consists of three pressure dependent surfaces in the stress space which are different limit states for the yield surface the elastic limit the failure and the residual strength as shown in fig 4 the failure surface y is defined as a function of pressure p the lode angle θ and strain rate ε 1 y f y p r θ f r a t e ε where y p f c a p p s p a l l f r a t e ε n with f c is the compressive strength a is the failure surface constant n is the failure surface exponent and p is the pressure normalized by f c p s p a l l p f t f c f r a t e ε is the strain rate function r θ defines the third invariant dependency of the model as a function of the second and third stress invariants and a meridian ratio q 2 fig 5 illustrates the tensile and compressive meridian on the stress π plane strain rate effects are represented through increases in fracture strength with plastic strain rate two different terms can be used for compression and tension with linear interpolation being used in the intermediate pressure regime 2 f r a t e ε ε ε 0 α f o r p f c 3 ε 0 30 10 6 s 1 ε ε 0 δ f o r p f c 3 ε 0 3 10 6 s 1 where α is the compressive strain rate factor δ is the tensile strain rate factor detailed formulation on the rht dynamic damage model for concrete can be found in refs riedel et al 1999 tu and lu 2009 the young s modulus compressive strength and tensile strength are referred to the reference li et al 2015 it should be noted that other material parameters required by the rht model are based on the material library in autodyn autodyn 2006 and the reference tu and lu 2009 the material parameters are as follows the density ρ is 2 55 g cm3 the shear modulus g is 16 7 gpa the compressive strength f c is 39 5 mpa the tensile strength f t is 8 2 mpa the failure strain is 0 001 the failure surface constant a is 1 6 the failure surface exponent n is 0 61 the residual failure constant b is 0 7 the residual failure surface exponent m is 0 8 the damage constants d 1 and d 2 which used to describe the effect strain to fracture as a function of pressure are 0 015 and 1 respectively the minimum strain to reach failure ε f min is 0 0008 the principal strain erosion criterion has been adopted in the presented study in order to model the large deformation in the post failure region such as concrete spall damage and avoid eroding elements prematurely large principal strain i e 2 0 suggested by the material library in autodyn is chosen as the erosion criterion 3 2 material model for reinforcement steel bar explosive water and air in this study the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the john cook model johnson and cook 1983 which is suitable for modeling the strength behavior of materials subjected to large strains high strain rates and high temperatures and also this model takes into account the effect of strain rate on material strength the model defines the yield stress y as 3 σ a b ε p n 1 c in ε p ε 0 1 t h m where ε p is the effective plastic strain ε p ε ε 0 is the normalized effective plastic strain rate for ε 0 1 s 1 t h t t r o o m t m e l t t r o o m where t r o o m is the room temperature and t m e l t is the melting temperature and a b c n and m are material constants the constant a is the basic yield stress at low strain whereas b and n represent the effect of strain hardening the second and third brackets in eq 3 represent the effects of strain rate and temperature respectively the material constants adopted in the current research are based on the typical data for steel 4340 the material parameters autodyn 2006 are as follows the reference density ρ 7 83 g cm3 the bulk modulus k 159 gpa shear modulus g 81 8 gpa the reference room temperature t room 300 k melting temperature t melt 1793 k the material constants a b c n and m are 792 mpa 510 mpa 0 014 0 26 and 1 03 respectively the charges are typically modeled using the standard jones wilkins and lee jwl equation of state eos which is the preferred choice for high energy explosives in most hydrodynamic calculations involving detonation the jwl eos has been widely used in engineering calculations which can be written in the form 4 p c 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v c 2 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where v is the specific volume of detonation products over the specific volume of undetonated explosive e is the specific internal energy c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 ω are material constants the terms c 1 and c 2 are the pressure coefficients r 1 and r 2 are the principal and secondary eigenvalues respectively and ω is the fractional part of the normal tait equation adiabatic exponent the values of these parameters for many common explosives have been determined from dynamic experiments and are available in autodyn in the present simulation for a tnt charge c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 and ω are 374 gpa 3 747 gpa 4 15 0 9 and 0 35 respectively it should be noted that the jwl is generally considered as a pure empirical equation of state with a non physical coefficient considered to be constant as a result the exponential terms may give unrealistic behavior especially under contact detonation the water which is assumed to be incompressible is modeled using the two phase equation of state eos with the polynomial forms the water pressure given by the two phase eos has different forms for states of compression and tension for μ 0 compression 5 p a 1 μ a 2 μ 2 a 3 μ 3 b 0 b 1 μ ρ 0 e for μ 0 tension 6 p t 1 μ t 2 μ 2 b 0 ρ 0 e where μ ρ ρ 0 1 ρ 0 is the initial density a 1 a 2 a 3 b 0 b 1 t 1 and t 2 are constants the term e is the specific internal energy which can be described as follows 7 e ρ g h p 0 ρ b 0 where ρ is the density h is the depth of water g is the acceleration due to gravity ρ 0 is the atmosphere pressure in the simulation the standard constants of water from the autodyn material library autodyn 2006 are used the material parameters are as follows the initial density ρ 0 is 999 kg m3 the constants a 1 a 2 a 3 b 0 b 1 t 1 and t 2 are 2 2 gpa 9 54 gpa 14 57 gpa 0 28 2 2 gpa and 0 respectively air is modeled by an ideal gas expression of state eos which is one of the simplest forms of eos the pressure is related to the energy by 8 p γ 1 ρ e where γ is the constant pressure to constant volume specific heat ratio e is the specific internal energy ρ ρ c ρ 0 ρ c is the current density ρ 0 is the initial density in the simulation the standard constants of air from the autodyn material library autodyn 2006 are as follows ρ 0 is 1 225 kg m3 γ is 1 4 the initial specific internal energy e is 2 068 105 kj kg 4 air contact explosion tests simulation 4 1 numerical model of contact explosion test material parameters and loadings a contact explosion experiment tested by li et al 2015 is simulated using the abovementioned three methods in the contact blast test the normal strength concrete slab was designed with both tension and compression with a 12 mm diameter rebar and a 10 mm concrete cover the reinforcement steel bars were spaced at 200 mm centers in the minor bending plane and 100 mm in the other plane this corresponds to a reinforcement ratio of 1 2 the cylinder tensile strength compressive strength and young s modulus of the normal concrete material are 8 2 mpa 39 5 mpa and 28 6 gpa respectively the young s modulus and yield strength of the reinforcement steel are 200 gpa and 600 mpa respectively the type of explosive is the tnt charge and the weight is 1 kg the charge is placed on the top surface of the test slab and offset from the center of the rc slab as shown in fig 6 the rc slab specimen has a cross sectional dimension of 2000 mm 1000 mm and a vertical thickness of 100 mm in order to stabilize the testing system the base steel plates are bolted to the ground slab and the slab specimens are placed on the steel rig with a simple support boundary the detailed information of the experiment can be found in the literature li et al 2015 by comparing the numerical results with the experiment results the accuracy and reliability of the numerical models can be verified although the sph and fem sph methods can really model the cylinder charge only the cubic charge can be modeled in the three dimensional model based on the cel method in order to compare the applicability and suitability of the three methods the cubic charge with the equivalent weight of explosive has been assumed in the numerical simulation instead of the cylinder charge the feasibility of this consideration will be discussed in the next section fig 7 shows the geometry and numerical models of the rc slab subjected to air contact based on the cel sph and fem sph in the cel model the concrete is modeled by the lagrange subgrid in which the coordinates move with the material on the other hand the air and high explosive are modeled by the euler subgrid wherein the grid is fixed with material allowed to flow through as shown in fig 7 b the boundary condition of the euler subgrid is set as an outflow boundary in the sph model the concrete and the explosive are modeled by the sph particle and the air is default as shown in fig 7 c in the fem sph model the sph particles are used to model the explosive the concrete is modeled in both the lagrange subgrid and sph particle and the air is default the lagrange subgrid is used to model the far field concrete as shown in fig 7 d it should be noted that the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the beam element in the three models the reinforcement steel bar and concrete are linked by shared nodes in the three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods and they are assumed to be perfectly bonded without any slip the reliability and validity of this assumption have been verified in reference wang et al 2005 the numerical algorithms of the materials are summarized in table 1 in the supporting area of the slab upper and back supports are created and all the displacements of the supports are fixed the suitable mesh size for numerical analysis is blast scenario dependent the mesh size convergence tests are carried out to determine the acceptable mesh size in the three current numerical models the mesh size of 10 mm is used for both concrete and reinforcing bars the mesh size for explosive is 5 mm and the particle size is 10 mm in the fem sph model the explosive zone contains 1000 particles and the concrete zone contains 63 261 particles and 144 400 elements in the sph model the explosive and the concrete zone contain 1000 and 224 422 particles respectively in the cel model the mesh size for air is 20 mm and the concrete zone contains 200 000 elements 4 2 charge shape sensitivity in order to examine the charge shape sensitivity of the model in the analysis two charge shapes i e cubic and cylinder as introduced in fig 8 are utilized in this study the fem sph method is adopted to describe the dynamic response of rc slabs subjected to air contact explosion in addition to the charge shape other conditions e g the mesh size particle size and boundary condition are the same it should be noted that the numerical model with the cubic charge fig 8 b is the same in fig 7 d the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab to air contact explosion with the cylinder and cubic charges are shown in fig 9 as observed by comparing the results from the cubic and cylinder charges the damage propagation process of the rc slab is very similar to each other the small charge shape sensitivity to the damage growth path is observed due to the highly nonlinear problem however the final damage profiles of the rc slab and the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars shows fairly objective results for the two charge shapes hence this consideration using the cubic charge instead of the cylinder charge is allowable and don t affect the damage mechanism 4 3 comparison of the numerical and experimental results performance of rc slabs under contact explosion refers to the dimensions of the crater and spalling of the rc slabs the damaged level is estimated by the crater diameter dc and spalling diameter ds these values measured in the simulation are illustrated in fig 10 the final damage profiles of the rc slab subjected to air contact explosion based on the abovementioned three approaches are shown in figs 11 13 the damage dimensions of the crater and spalling are also given in these figures the contour value between 0 and 1 indicates the concrete element damage ranges from undamaged material to fully damaged material it should be noted that the elements with the damage values between 0 9 and 1 0 are not displayed the purpose of such processing is to better show the damage status of the rc slab this is because that when the damage values of the damage zone are between 0 9 and 1 0 the concrete material has been severely damaged lots of macroscopic cracks will appear in the damaged region of the rc slab and the sph particles have been flying under air contact explosion conditions the blast pressure directly impacts on the top surface and causes a crater failure which is approximately circular the crater diameters for the cel sph and fem sph are about 430 mm 420 mm and 420 mm respectively when the blast pressure impacts on the top surface of the rc slab it induces a punching failure meanwhile the interaction between the incident stress and reflective stress causes a spalling failure on the bottom surface of the rc slab the spalling failure diameters for the cel sph and fem sph are about 610 mm 790 mm and 730 mm respectively subsequently there is a wedge shape spalling damage on the rc slab which is caused by the reflecting tensile wave moreover the reinforcement steel bars spread around the punching when the sph and fem sph models are employed it can be found that the reinforcement steel bars near the charge position have been torn see figs 12 and 13 the global deformation has not been observed in the rc slab which means that the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to air contact blasting load is highly localized fig 14 shows the final damage profile of the rc slab to air contact explosion obtained from the experimental test in the literature li et al 2015 the diameters of the crater and spalling from the numerical simulations and experimental test are listed in table 2 all analyses are performed on a pc with an intel r core tm i7 4770 cpu at 3 40 ghz and 16 gb ram the cpu times for cel sph and fem sph are 9000 s 36 000 s and 13 980 s respectively it should be noted the dynamic response of the rc slab is highly localized in the contact explosion the global flexural behavior of the slab is expected to be very small due to the lack of the deformation and strain data of the test slab only the failure mode and failure dimension are compared between the test slabs and numerical results as can be clearly seen the damage profiles from the three numerical methods all match reasonably with the experimental results li et al 2015 in terms of the diameters of the crater and spalling overall it may be concluded that the three presented methods can effectively predict the damage processes of the rc slabs subjected to contact explosion although the computational time of the cel method is the shortest the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars have not been well simulated in addition the calculation based on the cel method may be interrupted due to the large deformation problem based on sph and fem sph methods the top crater punching and bottom spalling of the rc slab are all well reproduced and the deformation and failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars are also well predicted however the computational time based on the sph method is significantly longer than that based on the fem sph method 4 4 damage process of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion in accordance with the above analyses it can be found that the coupled fem sph algorithm is the most effective method to reproduce the damage progresses of the rc slab to contact explosion hence only the fem sph method is employed for the subsequent analysis in order to compare the damage features of the rc slab from the air and underwater contact explosions this section gives the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab subjected to air contact explosion as shown in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion is highly localized the punching and spalling failures quickly expand with time mainly in the first 0 15 ms and the damage profile of the rc slab remains stable after 0 6 ms when the charge is detonated the blast pressure generated from explosion propagates into the air and directly impacts on the top surface of the rc slab as shown in fig 15 a an approximate circular crater failure is produced on the contact zone at t 0 015 ms with the expansion of detonation products the damage area of the crater is gradually increased at t 0 035 ms the bottom surface suffers the spalling failure fig 15 b at t 0 15 ms there is a wedge shape spalling damage on the side of the rc slab fig 15 c meanwhile it is worth noting that some reinforcement steel bars are spread around the charge position and the punching failure is formed as shown in fig 15 d with the propagation of stress waves in the rc slab the damage zone of the punching and bottom spalling failures increases gradually the steel bar under the charge position is torn and a lot of plastic zone can be observed on the reinforcement steel bars fig 15 e 5 underwater contact explosion simulation based on the fem sph method 5 1 numerical model for underwater contact explosion in the abovementioned section the fem sph method has been utilized to simulate the damage progresses of the rc slab to air contact blast and the feasibility and accuracy of the fem sph method are validated by comparing with the experimental observations although experimental and numerical studies have been previously carried out to observe the dynamic behavior of rc slabs subjected to air contact explosion very few studies have been reported to investigate the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion the underwater contact explosion model of the rc slab based on the fem sph approach is given in fig 16 the structural configuration charge weight element size and boundary conditions are assumed as aforementioned in the fem sph model the sph particles are used to model the charge and the concrete near the charge the lagrange subgrid is utilized to model the far field concrete and the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the beam element it should be noted that the air medium is default in the air contact explosion model but the water is modeled by sph particles in the underwater contact explosion model 5 2 shock wave propagation in order to investigate the influence of the rc slab on the shock wave propagation characteristics and energy dissipation when subjected to underwater contact explosion several target points are arranged beneath the rc slab the shock wave propagation characteristics of free field underwater explosion are also conducted the target points arranged in the underwater contact explosion model have been selected again fig 17 shows the shock wave propagation characteristics of underwater contact explosion and free field underwater explosion as can be seen from fig 17 a and b the shock wave is characterized by a sudden pressure rise to the peak value at the shock front and followed by a quasi exponential decrease back to ambient value the peak pressure of the shock wave attenuates rapidly with the increase of the distance from the charge location owing to the existence of the rc slab the shock wave will partially generate a reflected shock wave which propagates in the opposite direction and partially penetrate the rc slab and continue propagating in water hence the peak pressures of the shock wave at the target points from the underwater contact explosion are much weaker than these from the free field underwater explosion fig 17 c it can also be found that the difference of shock wave value at points 5 and 6 are small between free field underwater explosion and underwater contact explosion however the difference at point 1 2 3 and 4 are quite huge this is because that the target points 1 2 3 and 4 are closer to the center of explosive than the target points 5 and 6 the very serious damage on the rc slab caused by the underwater contact explosion is mainly in these areas above the target points 1 2 3 and 4 which will dissipate more energy of shock wave moreover the time for that the shock wave with peak pressure arrives at the targets from the underwater contact explosion is slightly later than that from free field underwater explosion fig 17 d 5 3 damage process of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab to underwater contact explosion are shown in fig 18 the blast pressure generated from underwater contact explosion propagates into the water and directly impacts on the top surface of the rc slab an approximate circular crater failure is produced in the contact zone fig 18 a when the stress wave transmits to the bottom surface of the slab the shock wave will partially propagate into the water and the bottom surface of the rc slab suffers the spalling and punching failures fig 18 b subsequently the reinforcement steel bars begin to bend and damage occurs at the side fig 18 c at t 0 3 ms the reinforcement steel bars on the upper layer suffer shear failure and large deformation is observed at the lower layer reinforcing steel bars meanwhile the punching failure is very conspicuous fig 18 d at t 0 6 ms the damage profile is stable the diameters of the crater punching and spalling are nearly 1570 mm 630 mm and 1100 mm respectively fig 18 e this indicates that underwater contact explosion has caused serious damage to the rc slab 6 comparative analysis of the rc slab subjected to air and underwater contact explosions there exists a significant contrast in the wave propagation processes between the air and the water media due to their different interface phenomena and physical properties hence attention should be paid to the comparative analyses of rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion and air contact blast fig 19 shows the comparison of the recorded pressure time histories at the target for the underwater contact explosion and air contact blast the pressure time histories at the same target from the underwater explosion and air blast in the free field are also given in fig 19 it should be noted that the pressure data of air contact blast are extracted from the cel model this is because the air is default in the air contact blast when using the fem sph method as shown whether contact explosion or free field explosion the peak pressure of underwater explosion is greater than the air blast it can also be found that the rc slab has a significant influence on the shock wave propagation of underwater and air contact explosions especially for air contact blast in the free field explosion the peak pressure overpressure from underwater explosion and air blast at the selected target are 259 00 mpa and 14 50 mpa respectively however owing to the existence of the rc slab the peak pressure overpressure from underwater and air contact explosions are 73 70 mpa and 0 02 mpa respectively this indicates that the shock wave from underwater contact explosion will partially penetrate the slab and continue propagating into another water area but almost no shock wave continues to propagate from the rc slab to the another air area when subjected to air contact blast the final damage profiles of the rc slab subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are shown in fig 20 it can be seen that damaged area of the rc slab subjected to an air contact blast is smaller in comparison to that subjected to an underwater contact explosion underwater contact explosion can cause significantly more damage to the rc slab than the same amount of explosive in air this is because that they have different physical properties and interface phenomena between the explosive product gases and the surrounding medium in the air contact explosion scenario the damage zone is mainly concentrated at the region where the charge is placed and a wedge shape tensile failure is observed on the side of the rc slab however almost the whole rc slab suffers serious damage when subjected to underwater contact explosion especially for the top surface of the rc slab and the side of the rc slab is fully damaged the diameters of the crater and spalling against time for rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are given in fig 21 as shown the diameters of the crater damage from air and underwater contact explosions are 420 mm and 1570 mm respectively the diameter of the spalling damage of underwater contact explosion is 1100 mm which is 1 5 times that of air contact explosion 730 mm the plastic zone distribution and effective plastic strain of the reinforcement steel bars subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the detonation shock wave causes a plastic zone of the reinforcement steel bars in both underwater and air contact explosions and parts of the reinforcing steel bars on the upper layer suffer shear failure the maximum effective plastic strains of the reinforcement steel bars subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are 0 07 and 0 11 respectively the plastic zone area of the top bars from underwater contact explosion is almost 0 36 m2 which is 3 8 times that from air contact explosion the plastic zone areas of the bottom bar for underwater and air contact explosions are approximately 0 64 m2 and 0 38 m2 respectively in general the plastic zones of both top and bottom reinforcement steel bars to underwater contact explosion are larger than air contact explosion 7 conclusions the objective of this paper is to investigate the damage features of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions for this purpose the cel sph and fem sph methods are first employed to simulate the dynamic response of rc slabs to air contact explosion the validity of the three methods is examined by comparing with the results from the numerical simulation and the previous air contact explosion tests then the most effective method i e fem sph is used to investigate the dynamic response of the same rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion the shock wave propagation characteristics and damage mechanisms from contact explosions in air and water are compared the following conclusions are drawn from this investigation 1 although the three presented methods i e cel sph and fem sph can effectively predict the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion as a whole the coupled fem sph algorithm is the most effective method to reproduce the damage progresses of the rc slab to contact explosion the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars cannot be well simulated when using the cel method the computational time based on the sph method is significantly longer than that from the fem sph method 2 although the small charge shape sensitivity to the damage propagation process of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion is observed due to the highly nonlinear problem the final damage profiles of the rc slab and the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars shows fairly objective results for the cubic and cylinder charges using the cubic charge instead of the cylinder charge is allowable 3 the dynamic response of the rc slab is highly localized in the air contact explosion the global flexural behavior of the slab is very small the crater failure is observed at the top surface of the rc slab due to the direct impact of the air contact blast loading the spalling failure occurs at the bottom of the rc slab the punching failure of the rc slab at the contact blast zone quickly expands with time 4 the top surface of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion is almost completely destroyed when the stress wave transmits to the bottom surface of the slab the bottom surface of the rc slab suffers the spalling and punching failures large deformation is observed at the lower layer reinforcing steel bars 5 underwater contact explosion can cause significantly more damage to the rc slab than the same amount of explosive in air in the air contact explosion scenario the damage zone is mainly concentrated at the region where the charge is placed however almost the whole rc slab suffers serious damage when subjected to underwater contact explosion especially for the top surface of the rc slab hence more attention should be paid to the damage potential of underwater contact explosion acknowledgements the authors gratefully appreciate the supports from the national natural science

23745,reinforced concrete rc slabs are the major components for building structures and underwater engineering plants however blast loading especially from contact explosion can cause significant damage to the target structures both in air and water the objective of this paper is to compare the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions three methods i e fully coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and coupled finite element method and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method fem sph are first employed to simulate the damage features of an rc slab to air contact explosion damage profiles of the rc slab to air contact explosion using the three methods are compared with the experiment results in the literature and the applicability and suitability of these methods are discussed subsequently the most effective method i e fem sph is used to describe the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion shock wave propagation characteristics from air and underwater contact explosions are discussed damage features of the rc slab to air and underwater contact explosions are compared damage characteristics and plastic deformation of reinforcement steel bars are also investigated keywords damage features reinforced concrete slab air contact explosion underwater contact explosion fem sph 1 introduction rc slabs as the principal components for engineering structures have been widely used all over the world however blast loading especially from contact explosion can cause significant damage to the target structures by comparing with non contact blasts nonlinear dynamic response of rc slabs to contact explosion is a more complex nonlinear problem as it involves the material and geometric nonlinearity loading rate dependent material properties dynamic interactions among the explosion products and the structure and time dependent structural deformation the rc slabs to contact explosions will undergo crater large deformation spalling and even punching although the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion have increasingly attracted attention in recent years the understanding of contact explosion loading is still relatively incomplete the damage mechanisms of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion are as yet unresolved but widely studied there are two major approaches i e experimental test and numerical simulation to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of structures under contact blast loadings the experimental test can provide intuitional observations and useful data of structures subjected to contact explosion the relevant explosion results of steels kumar et al 2015 rajendran and narasimhan 2001 concrete columns wu et al 2011 codina et al 2016 yao et al 2016 and rc slabs wang et al 2012 2015 li et al 2016a coughlin et al 2010 can be found in the bibliography however blast experimental efforts require the specialized equipment labors and vast fund furthermore the experimental tests require the use of relatively large amounts of charges which will involve potential risks and need careful handling with the rapid development of computer technology and the advancement of numerical techniques the numerical simulation could be a powerful supplement to the experimental tests many numerical methods have been developed to investigate the damage processes of the target structures to blast loadings such as cel sph and fem sph without being exhaustive some contributions to these methods and their applications in blast analysis of concrete structures are worth mentioning wang et al 2013 employed the cel method to study the behavior of one way square reinforced concrete rc slabs subjected to close in explosion their results showed that the failure modes of rc slabs are gradually changed from overall flexure to localized punching failure when the weight of the charge increases wang et al wang and zhang 2014 used the cel method to investigate the damage characteristics of concrete gravity dams subjected to underwater explosion yuan et al 2008 discussed the damage modes of rc slabs under contact detonation by using the cel method they found that with the increase of the weight of explosive the dimensions of damage crater increase and the slabs experience four different damage patterns namely explosive crater spalling perforation and punching rabczuk and eibl 2003 2006 adopted the sph method to perform the fragmentation process of the slabs they found that the sph method can easily handle large deformations and fracture in 2d computations jankowiak and lodygowski 2013 compared the blast damage and structural failure of the concrete using the fem and sph hu et al 2014 investigated the dynamic deformation process of concrete structures to blast loadings and found that the fem sph method can basically ensure conservation of total energy in damage process xu et al xu and liu 2008 modeled the whole processes from the propagation of the pressure wave to the response concrete structures through the fem sph method they concluded that this model can be used for reasonably accurate explosive analysis of structures although the computational efficiency of the cel method is very high the calculation may be terminated when the elements are too distorted lu et al 2005 the erosion criterion is usually used to avoid this problem however choosing the erosion criterion for the structure may lead to the massive deletion of the elements and can t maintain the mass conservation the sph method as a particle method of lagrangian has an advantage in dealing with the large deformation problems however accurate sph simulations require large run time autodyn 1998 in order to accurately and conveniently simulate the dynamic response of structures subjected to contact explosion a combination of fem and sph fem sph is presented which integrates the high computational efficiency of fem and advantages of sph method wang et al 2005 ming et al 2016 yang et al 2012 it has been proved that the fem sph method can provide acceptable predictions of structural response to dynamic loading at a lower cost however it should be noted that there is little research about comparing the applicability and suitability of the three methods when used to describe the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion during the service life of some important structures such as embankments bridge piers and dams they may undergo air blast loading as well as underwater blast loading owing to the large differences in the speed of sound and mass density between water and air the dynamic response of structures subjected to air and underwater blast loadings will be significantly different although researchers have investigated the difference of shock wave propagation characteristics and structure response to air and underwater explosions rajendran and lee 2009 clutter and stahl 2004 kwak et al 2012 librescu et al 2006 wang et al 2014 they mainly focused on non contact explosion because the contact explosion is likely to cause more serious damage to structures li et al 2015 2016b zhou and hao 2009 zhang et al 2014 more attention should be paid to this blast scenario hence the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are still needed for further research the purpose of this paper is to investigate the damage characteristics and dynamic response of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods are used to simulate the damage processes of the rc slab to air contact explosion and the final damage profiles of the rc slab are compared with the experiment results in the literature the validity of the three algorithms is examined the most effective method i e fem sph method is finally selected to simulate the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion shock wave propagation characteristics from contact explosions in air and water are compared damage characteristics of rc slabs under air and underwater contact explosions are also discussed 2 description of the coupled method with the rapid development of the computer technology and the advancement of numerical techniques the numerical simulation could be a powerful method to describe the dynamic response of structures under blasting load although many numerical methodologies have been widely adopted and developed only three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods are selected in the present study 2 1 cel numerical approach the cel method adopted in the present study has been made possible in autodyn autodyn 2006 and other hydrocodes in this method the eulerian material can exert the pressure boundary conditions on the lagrange element which causes displacement of the structure and the lagrange interface can cut through the eulerian mesh that is fixed in space in an arbitrary manner the lagrangian interface in return provides the velocity boundary conditions to eulerian material flow and the eulerian material cannot penetrate the lagrange element a typical coupled situation is shown in fig 1 in this coupled method the finite volume method is used to solve the eulerian equation 2 2 the smooth particle hydrodynamic sph method when the lagrangian algorithm is selected to describe the dynamic response of structures to contact explosion the calculation processes will be faced with the problem of the mesh distortion and tangling however the sph technique which is originated from an application in astrophysics by lucy 1977 bypasses the requirement for a numerical grid to avoid this problem in the sph method the arbitrarily distributed particles carry all the computational information including the elastic modulus and velocity as well as the mass this method uses a kernel approximation which is based on randomly distributed interpolation points to calculate the derivatives 2 3 coupling algorithm of sph with fem accurate sph simulations require a large number of particles throughout the sph region which will require a large amount of the computational effort the coupled fem sph method can solve this problem in addition this coupled approach will be especially effective for modeling the problems involving large deformations caused by the blasting loadings in the coupled fem sph method the conventional fem is used to model the far medium with the small deformation and the sph method is adopted to model the explosion processes and the area with large deformation caused by the blast loadings fig 2 shows the basic concept on how the sph particles coupled with the traditional lagrange fem mesh the smaller real circle larger broken circle around particle i and smaller broken circle around fem node represent sph particles support domain of the sph particles and background particles respectively the variables of the background particle are consistent with those of the corresponding fem nodes such as the particle velocity stress mass and position the fem nodes are added to sph neighbor list in the mode of background particles in the present paper the calculation of momentum energy and density for particle i is done with contributions from particles n 1 n 2 n 5 and fem nodes n 6 n 7 n 8 to avoiding boundary effects the smoothing function w is not truncated by the boundary this is because the support domain of the sph particle near the interface does not interact with the problem domain liu and liu 2003 see fig 3 3 material model 3 1 material model for concrete in the present study the riedel hiermaier thoma rht riedel et al 1999 dynamic damage model which is developed on the basis of the holmquist johnson cook hjc model holmquist et al 1993 is used for modeling of the concrete material this model which can reflect the characteristics of the concrete material behavior at a high strain rate is particularly useful for modeling the dynamic behavior of brittle materials such as concrete and rock under dynamic loading the rht material model also takes into account pressure hardening strain hardening strain rate hardening third invariant dependence for compressive and tensile meridians and a damage model for strain softening it can be used in conjunction with the existing tensile crack softening algorithm the strain rate dependence is taken into account by expanding the failure surface in the stress space where the degree of expansion depends on the hydrostatic stresses i e the dynamic increase effect is larger for tensile than compressive states of stress the effect of the loading path on the yield surface is taken into account by a dependence of the third invariant the rht model consists of three pressure dependent surfaces in the stress space which are different limit states for the yield surface the elastic limit the failure and the residual strength as shown in fig 4 the failure surface y is defined as a function of pressure p the lode angle θ and strain rate ε 1 y f y p r θ f r a t e ε where y p f c a p p s p a l l f r a t e ε n with f c is the compressive strength a is the failure surface constant n is the failure surface exponent and p is the pressure normalized by f c p s p a l l p f t f c f r a t e ε is the strain rate function r θ defines the third invariant dependency of the model as a function of the second and third stress invariants and a meridian ratio q 2 fig 5 illustrates the tensile and compressive meridian on the stress π plane strain rate effects are represented through increases in fracture strength with plastic strain rate two different terms can be used for compression and tension with linear interpolation being used in the intermediate pressure regime 2 f r a t e ε ε ε 0 α f o r p f c 3 ε 0 30 10 6 s 1 ε ε 0 δ f o r p f c 3 ε 0 3 10 6 s 1 where α is the compressive strain rate factor δ is the tensile strain rate factor detailed formulation on the rht dynamic damage model for concrete can be found in refs riedel et al 1999 tu and lu 2009 the young s modulus compressive strength and tensile strength are referred to the reference li et al 2015 it should be noted that other material parameters required by the rht model are based on the material library in autodyn autodyn 2006 and the reference tu and lu 2009 the material parameters are as follows the density ρ is 2 55 g cm3 the shear modulus g is 16 7 gpa the compressive strength f c is 39 5 mpa the tensile strength f t is 8 2 mpa the failure strain is 0 001 the failure surface constant a is 1 6 the failure surface exponent n is 0 61 the residual failure constant b is 0 7 the residual failure surface exponent m is 0 8 the damage constants d 1 and d 2 which used to describe the effect strain to fracture as a function of pressure are 0 015 and 1 respectively the minimum strain to reach failure ε f min is 0 0008 the principal strain erosion criterion has been adopted in the presented study in order to model the large deformation in the post failure region such as concrete spall damage and avoid eroding elements prematurely large principal strain i e 2 0 suggested by the material library in autodyn is chosen as the erosion criterion 3 2 material model for reinforcement steel bar explosive water and air in this study the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the john cook model johnson and cook 1983 which is suitable for modeling the strength behavior of materials subjected to large strains high strain rates and high temperatures and also this model takes into account the effect of strain rate on material strength the model defines the yield stress y as 3 σ a b ε p n 1 c in ε p ε 0 1 t h m where ε p is the effective plastic strain ε p ε ε 0 is the normalized effective plastic strain rate for ε 0 1 s 1 t h t t r o o m t m e l t t r o o m where t r o o m is the room temperature and t m e l t is the melting temperature and a b c n and m are material constants the constant a is the basic yield stress at low strain whereas b and n represent the effect of strain hardening the second and third brackets in eq 3 represent the effects of strain rate and temperature respectively the material constants adopted in the current research are based on the typical data for steel 4340 the material parameters autodyn 2006 are as follows the reference density ρ 7 83 g cm3 the bulk modulus k 159 gpa shear modulus g 81 8 gpa the reference room temperature t room 300 k melting temperature t melt 1793 k the material constants a b c n and m are 792 mpa 510 mpa 0 014 0 26 and 1 03 respectively the charges are typically modeled using the standard jones wilkins and lee jwl equation of state eos which is the preferred choice for high energy explosives in most hydrodynamic calculations involving detonation the jwl eos has been widely used in engineering calculations which can be written in the form 4 p c 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v c 2 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where v is the specific volume of detonation products over the specific volume of undetonated explosive e is the specific internal energy c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 ω are material constants the terms c 1 and c 2 are the pressure coefficients r 1 and r 2 are the principal and secondary eigenvalues respectively and ω is the fractional part of the normal tait equation adiabatic exponent the values of these parameters for many common explosives have been determined from dynamic experiments and are available in autodyn in the present simulation for a tnt charge c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 and ω are 374 gpa 3 747 gpa 4 15 0 9 and 0 35 respectively it should be noted that the jwl is generally considered as a pure empirical equation of state with a non physical coefficient considered to be constant as a result the exponential terms may give unrealistic behavior especially under contact detonation the water which is assumed to be incompressible is modeled using the two phase equation of state eos with the polynomial forms the water pressure given by the two phase eos has different forms for states of compression and tension for μ 0 compression 5 p a 1 μ a 2 μ 2 a 3 μ 3 b 0 b 1 μ ρ 0 e for μ 0 tension 6 p t 1 μ t 2 μ 2 b 0 ρ 0 e where μ ρ ρ 0 1 ρ 0 is the initial density a 1 a 2 a 3 b 0 b 1 t 1 and t 2 are constants the term e is the specific internal energy which can be described as follows 7 e ρ g h p 0 ρ b 0 where ρ is the density h is the depth of water g is the acceleration due to gravity ρ 0 is the atmosphere pressure in the simulation the standard constants of water from the autodyn material library autodyn 2006 are used the material parameters are as follows the initial density ρ 0 is 999 kg m3 the constants a 1 a 2 a 3 b 0 b 1 t 1 and t 2 are 2 2 gpa 9 54 gpa 14 57 gpa 0 28 2 2 gpa and 0 respectively air is modeled by an ideal gas expression of state eos which is one of the simplest forms of eos the pressure is related to the energy by 8 p γ 1 ρ e where γ is the constant pressure to constant volume specific heat ratio e is the specific internal energy ρ ρ c ρ 0 ρ c is the current density ρ 0 is the initial density in the simulation the standard constants of air from the autodyn material library autodyn 2006 are as follows ρ 0 is 1 225 kg m3 γ is 1 4 the initial specific internal energy e is 2 068 105 kj kg 4 air contact explosion tests simulation 4 1 numerical model of contact explosion test material parameters and loadings a contact explosion experiment tested by li et al 2015 is simulated using the abovementioned three methods in the contact blast test the normal strength concrete slab was designed with both tension and compression with a 12 mm diameter rebar and a 10 mm concrete cover the reinforcement steel bars were spaced at 200 mm centers in the minor bending plane and 100 mm in the other plane this corresponds to a reinforcement ratio of 1 2 the cylinder tensile strength compressive strength and young s modulus of the normal concrete material are 8 2 mpa 39 5 mpa and 28 6 gpa respectively the young s modulus and yield strength of the reinforcement steel are 200 gpa and 600 mpa respectively the type of explosive is the tnt charge and the weight is 1 kg the charge is placed on the top surface of the test slab and offset from the center of the rc slab as shown in fig 6 the rc slab specimen has a cross sectional dimension of 2000 mm 1000 mm and a vertical thickness of 100 mm in order to stabilize the testing system the base steel plates are bolted to the ground slab and the slab specimens are placed on the steel rig with a simple support boundary the detailed information of the experiment can be found in the literature li et al 2015 by comparing the numerical results with the experiment results the accuracy and reliability of the numerical models can be verified although the sph and fem sph methods can really model the cylinder charge only the cubic charge can be modeled in the three dimensional model based on the cel method in order to compare the applicability and suitability of the three methods the cubic charge with the equivalent weight of explosive has been assumed in the numerical simulation instead of the cylinder charge the feasibility of this consideration will be discussed in the next section fig 7 shows the geometry and numerical models of the rc slab subjected to air contact based on the cel sph and fem sph in the cel model the concrete is modeled by the lagrange subgrid in which the coordinates move with the material on the other hand the air and high explosive are modeled by the euler subgrid wherein the grid is fixed with material allowed to flow through as shown in fig 7 b the boundary condition of the euler subgrid is set as an outflow boundary in the sph model the concrete and the explosive are modeled by the sph particle and the air is default as shown in fig 7 c in the fem sph model the sph particles are used to model the explosive the concrete is modeled in both the lagrange subgrid and sph particle and the air is default the lagrange subgrid is used to model the far field concrete as shown in fig 7 d it should be noted that the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the beam element in the three models the reinforcement steel bar and concrete are linked by shared nodes in the three methods i e cel sph and fem sph methods and they are assumed to be perfectly bonded without any slip the reliability and validity of this assumption have been verified in reference wang et al 2005 the numerical algorithms of the materials are summarized in table 1 in the supporting area of the slab upper and back supports are created and all the displacements of the supports are fixed the suitable mesh size for numerical analysis is blast scenario dependent the mesh size convergence tests are carried out to determine the acceptable mesh size in the three current numerical models the mesh size of 10 mm is used for both concrete and reinforcing bars the mesh size for explosive is 5 mm and the particle size is 10 mm in the fem sph model the explosive zone contains 1000 particles and the concrete zone contains 63 261 particles and 144 400 elements in the sph model the explosive and the concrete zone contain 1000 and 224 422 particles respectively in the cel model the mesh size for air is 20 mm and the concrete zone contains 200 000 elements 4 2 charge shape sensitivity in order to examine the charge shape sensitivity of the model in the analysis two charge shapes i e cubic and cylinder as introduced in fig 8 are utilized in this study the fem sph method is adopted to describe the dynamic response of rc slabs subjected to air contact explosion in addition to the charge shape other conditions e g the mesh size particle size and boundary condition are the same it should be noted that the numerical model with the cubic charge fig 8 b is the same in fig 7 d the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab to air contact explosion with the cylinder and cubic charges are shown in fig 9 as observed by comparing the results from the cubic and cylinder charges the damage propagation process of the rc slab is very similar to each other the small charge shape sensitivity to the damage growth path is observed due to the highly nonlinear problem however the final damage profiles of the rc slab and the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars shows fairly objective results for the two charge shapes hence this consideration using the cubic charge instead of the cylinder charge is allowable and don t affect the damage mechanism 4 3 comparison of the numerical and experimental results performance of rc slabs under contact explosion refers to the dimensions of the crater and spalling of the rc slabs the damaged level is estimated by the crater diameter dc and spalling diameter ds these values measured in the simulation are illustrated in fig 10 the final damage profiles of the rc slab subjected to air contact explosion based on the abovementioned three approaches are shown in figs 11 13 the damage dimensions of the crater and spalling are also given in these figures the contour value between 0 and 1 indicates the concrete element damage ranges from undamaged material to fully damaged material it should be noted that the elements with the damage values between 0 9 and 1 0 are not displayed the purpose of such processing is to better show the damage status of the rc slab this is because that when the damage values of the damage zone are between 0 9 and 1 0 the concrete material has been severely damaged lots of macroscopic cracks will appear in the damaged region of the rc slab and the sph particles have been flying under air contact explosion conditions the blast pressure directly impacts on the top surface and causes a crater failure which is approximately circular the crater diameters for the cel sph and fem sph are about 430 mm 420 mm and 420 mm respectively when the blast pressure impacts on the top surface of the rc slab it induces a punching failure meanwhile the interaction between the incident stress and reflective stress causes a spalling failure on the bottom surface of the rc slab the spalling failure diameters for the cel sph and fem sph are about 610 mm 790 mm and 730 mm respectively subsequently there is a wedge shape spalling damage on the rc slab which is caused by the reflecting tensile wave moreover the reinforcement steel bars spread around the punching when the sph and fem sph models are employed it can be found that the reinforcement steel bars near the charge position have been torn see figs 12 and 13 the global deformation has not been observed in the rc slab which means that the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to air contact blasting load is highly localized fig 14 shows the final damage profile of the rc slab to air contact explosion obtained from the experimental test in the literature li et al 2015 the diameters of the crater and spalling from the numerical simulations and experimental test are listed in table 2 all analyses are performed on a pc with an intel r core tm i7 4770 cpu at 3 40 ghz and 16 gb ram the cpu times for cel sph and fem sph are 9000 s 36 000 s and 13 980 s respectively it should be noted the dynamic response of the rc slab is highly localized in the contact explosion the global flexural behavior of the slab is expected to be very small due to the lack of the deformation and strain data of the test slab only the failure mode and failure dimension are compared between the test slabs and numerical results as can be clearly seen the damage profiles from the three numerical methods all match reasonably with the experimental results li et al 2015 in terms of the diameters of the crater and spalling overall it may be concluded that the three presented methods can effectively predict the damage processes of the rc slabs subjected to contact explosion although the computational time of the cel method is the shortest the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars have not been well simulated in addition the calculation based on the cel method may be interrupted due to the large deformation problem based on sph and fem sph methods the top crater punching and bottom spalling of the rc slab are all well reproduced and the deformation and failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars are also well predicted however the computational time based on the sph method is significantly longer than that based on the fem sph method 4 4 damage process of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion in accordance with the above analyses it can be found that the coupled fem sph algorithm is the most effective method to reproduce the damage progresses of the rc slab to contact explosion hence only the fem sph method is employed for the subsequent analysis in order to compare the damage features of the rc slab from the air and underwater contact explosions this section gives the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab subjected to air contact explosion as shown in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the dynamic response of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion is highly localized the punching and spalling failures quickly expand with time mainly in the first 0 15 ms and the damage profile of the rc slab remains stable after 0 6 ms when the charge is detonated the blast pressure generated from explosion propagates into the air and directly impacts on the top surface of the rc slab as shown in fig 15 a an approximate circular crater failure is produced on the contact zone at t 0 015 ms with the expansion of detonation products the damage area of the crater is gradually increased at t 0 035 ms the bottom surface suffers the spalling failure fig 15 b at t 0 15 ms there is a wedge shape spalling damage on the side of the rc slab fig 15 c meanwhile it is worth noting that some reinforcement steel bars are spread around the charge position and the punching failure is formed as shown in fig 15 d with the propagation of stress waves in the rc slab the damage zone of the punching and bottom spalling failures increases gradually the steel bar under the charge position is torn and a lot of plastic zone can be observed on the reinforcement steel bars fig 15 e 5 underwater contact explosion simulation based on the fem sph method 5 1 numerical model for underwater contact explosion in the abovementioned section the fem sph method has been utilized to simulate the damage progresses of the rc slab to air contact blast and the feasibility and accuracy of the fem sph method are validated by comparing with the experimental observations although experimental and numerical studies have been previously carried out to observe the dynamic behavior of rc slabs subjected to air contact explosion very few studies have been reported to investigate the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion the underwater contact explosion model of the rc slab based on the fem sph approach is given in fig 16 the structural configuration charge weight element size and boundary conditions are assumed as aforementioned in the fem sph model the sph particles are used to model the charge and the concrete near the charge the lagrange subgrid is utilized to model the far field concrete and the reinforcement steel bars are modeled by the beam element it should be noted that the air medium is default in the air contact explosion model but the water is modeled by sph particles in the underwater contact explosion model 5 2 shock wave propagation in order to investigate the influence of the rc slab on the shock wave propagation characteristics and energy dissipation when subjected to underwater contact explosion several target points are arranged beneath the rc slab the shock wave propagation characteristics of free field underwater explosion are also conducted the target points arranged in the underwater contact explosion model have been selected again fig 17 shows the shock wave propagation characteristics of underwater contact explosion and free field underwater explosion as can be seen from fig 17 a and b the shock wave is characterized by a sudden pressure rise to the peak value at the shock front and followed by a quasi exponential decrease back to ambient value the peak pressure of the shock wave attenuates rapidly with the increase of the distance from the charge location owing to the existence of the rc slab the shock wave will partially generate a reflected shock wave which propagates in the opposite direction and partially penetrate the rc slab and continue propagating in water hence the peak pressures of the shock wave at the target points from the underwater contact explosion are much weaker than these from the free field underwater explosion fig 17 c it can also be found that the difference of shock wave value at points 5 and 6 are small between free field underwater explosion and underwater contact explosion however the difference at point 1 2 3 and 4 are quite huge this is because that the target points 1 2 3 and 4 are closer to the center of explosive than the target points 5 and 6 the very serious damage on the rc slab caused by the underwater contact explosion is mainly in these areas above the target points 1 2 3 and 4 which will dissipate more energy of shock wave moreover the time for that the shock wave with peak pressure arrives at the targets from the underwater contact explosion is slightly later than that from free field underwater explosion fig 17 d 5 3 damage process of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion the accumulated damage processes of the rc slab to underwater contact explosion are shown in fig 18 the blast pressure generated from underwater contact explosion propagates into the water and directly impacts on the top surface of the rc slab an approximate circular crater failure is produced in the contact zone fig 18 a when the stress wave transmits to the bottom surface of the slab the shock wave will partially propagate into the water and the bottom surface of the rc slab suffers the spalling and punching failures fig 18 b subsequently the reinforcement steel bars begin to bend and damage occurs at the side fig 18 c at t 0 3 ms the reinforcement steel bars on the upper layer suffer shear failure and large deformation is observed at the lower layer reinforcing steel bars meanwhile the punching failure is very conspicuous fig 18 d at t 0 6 ms the damage profile is stable the diameters of the crater punching and spalling are nearly 1570 mm 630 mm and 1100 mm respectively fig 18 e this indicates that underwater contact explosion has caused serious damage to the rc slab 6 comparative analysis of the rc slab subjected to air and underwater contact explosions there exists a significant contrast in the wave propagation processes between the air and the water media due to their different interface phenomena and physical properties hence attention should be paid to the comparative analyses of rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion and air contact blast fig 19 shows the comparison of the recorded pressure time histories at the target for the underwater contact explosion and air contact blast the pressure time histories at the same target from the underwater explosion and air blast in the free field are also given in fig 19 it should be noted that the pressure data of air contact blast are extracted from the cel model this is because the air is default in the air contact blast when using the fem sph method as shown whether contact explosion or free field explosion the peak pressure of underwater explosion is greater than the air blast it can also be found that the rc slab has a significant influence on the shock wave propagation of underwater and air contact explosions especially for air contact blast in the free field explosion the peak pressure overpressure from underwater explosion and air blast at the selected target are 259 00 mpa and 14 50 mpa respectively however owing to the existence of the rc slab the peak pressure overpressure from underwater and air contact explosions are 73 70 mpa and 0 02 mpa respectively this indicates that the shock wave from underwater contact explosion will partially penetrate the slab and continue propagating into another water area but almost no shock wave continues to propagate from the rc slab to the another air area when subjected to air contact blast the final damage profiles of the rc slab subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are shown in fig 20 it can be seen that damaged area of the rc slab subjected to an air contact blast is smaller in comparison to that subjected to an underwater contact explosion underwater contact explosion can cause significantly more damage to the rc slab than the same amount of explosive in air this is because that they have different physical properties and interface phenomena between the explosive product gases and the surrounding medium in the air contact explosion scenario the damage zone is mainly concentrated at the region where the charge is placed and a wedge shape tensile failure is observed on the side of the rc slab however almost the whole rc slab suffers serious damage when subjected to underwater contact explosion especially for the top surface of the rc slab and the side of the rc slab is fully damaged the diameters of the crater and spalling against time for rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are given in fig 21 as shown the diameters of the crater damage from air and underwater contact explosions are 420 mm and 1570 mm respectively the diameter of the spalling damage of underwater contact explosion is 1100 mm which is 1 5 times that of air contact explosion 730 mm the plastic zone distribution and effective plastic strain of the reinforcement steel bars subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the detonation shock wave causes a plastic zone of the reinforcement steel bars in both underwater and air contact explosions and parts of the reinforcing steel bars on the upper layer suffer shear failure the maximum effective plastic strains of the reinforcement steel bars subjected to air and underwater contact explosions are 0 07 and 0 11 respectively the plastic zone area of the top bars from underwater contact explosion is almost 0 36 m2 which is 3 8 times that from air contact explosion the plastic zone areas of the bottom bar for underwater and air contact explosions are approximately 0 64 m2 and 0 38 m2 respectively in general the plastic zones of both top and bottom reinforcement steel bars to underwater contact explosion are larger than air contact explosion 7 conclusions the objective of this paper is to investigate the damage features of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions for this purpose the cel sph and fem sph methods are first employed to simulate the dynamic response of rc slabs to air contact explosion the validity of the three methods is examined by comparing with the results from the numerical simulation and the previous air contact explosion tests then the most effective method i e fem sph is used to investigate the dynamic response of the same rc slabs subjected to underwater contact explosion the shock wave propagation characteristics and damage mechanisms from contact explosions in air and water are compared the following conclusions are drawn from this investigation 1 although the three presented methods i e cel sph and fem sph can effectively predict the damage characteristics of rc slabs subjected to contact explosion as a whole the coupled fem sph algorithm is the most effective method to reproduce the damage progresses of the rc slab to contact explosion the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars cannot be well simulated when using the cel method the computational time based on the sph method is significantly longer than that from the fem sph method 2 although the small charge shape sensitivity to the damage propagation process of the rc slab subjected to contact explosion is observed due to the highly nonlinear problem the final damage profiles of the rc slab and the failure modes of the reinforcement steel bars shows fairly objective results for the cubic and cylinder charges using the cubic charge instead of the cylinder charge is allowable 3 the dynamic response of the rc slab is highly localized in the air contact explosion the global flexural behavior of the slab is very small the crater failure is observed at the top surface of the rc slab due to the direct impact of the air contact blast loading the spalling failure occurs at the bottom of the rc slab the punching failure of the rc slab at the contact blast zone quickly expands with time 4 the top surface of the rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosion is almost completely destroyed when the stress wave transmits to the bottom surface of the slab the bottom surface of the rc slab suffers the spalling and punching failures large deformation is observed at the lower layer reinforcing steel bars 5 underwater contact explosion can cause significantly more damage to the rc slab than the same amount of explosive in air in the air contact explosion scenario the damage zone is mainly concentrated at the region where the charge is placed however almost the whole rc slab suffers serious damage when subjected to underwater contact explosion especially for the top surface of the rc slab hence more attention should be paid to the damage potential of underwater contact explosion acknowledgements the authors gratefully appreciate the supports from the national natural science

23746,this paper investigates tradeoffs between technical performance cost and flexibility level for reconfigurable offshore ships an offshore ship can be configured with various types of equipment thus its base structure constitutes a platform from which several end ship design configurations can be derived a ship with equipment retrofit flexibility will typically have excess stability deadweight and deck area to ensure physical compatibility however there are complex system interactions that need consideration such as the effects of flexibility on cost and technical performance to tackle this problem we capture technical performance using a multi attribute utility function based on a ship s capability capacity and operability and utilize a tradespace representation of the system to quantify flexibility using the filtered outdegree metric findings indicate that increased platform flexibility does increase capacity but comes at a complex compromise with operability as resistance is increased and roll periods become unfavorable due to high accelerations furthermore the analysis confirms the applicability of multi attribute utility tradespace exploration and filtered outdegree for understanding the implications of flexible offshore ships keywords ship design platform flexibility uncertainty systems engineering tradespace 1 introduction 1 1 motivation in contrast to traditional deep sea cargo transportation ships offshore ships comprise a set of ships that are designed to provide different operational services such as platform supply offshore construction and light well intervention these ships are usually build either for a particular long term contract which impose specialization or on speculation which impose multi functionality at early design stages the future needs of an offshore ship are typically uncertain due to volatile and heterogenous market conditions erikstad and rehn 2015 for this reason there is a need to understand how offshore ships can embed flexibility to be reconfigured in response to emerging needs and how flexibility affects technical performance and acquisition costs from a design perspective it may be useful to think of offshore ships as comprised of two main groups of subsystems ship systems and mission related systems erikstad and levander 2012 ship systems are similar across a wide range of final designs and may include the main hull accommodation unit and bridge mission related systems can include cranes remotely operated vehicle units and light well intervention towers in this way we adopt the notion of platforms representing the subsystems that provide a common basis from which a stream of end design configurations can be derived an interesting aspect of reconfigurable offshore ships is that compatibility between the platform and the mission related modules moves beyond the consideration of the platform module interface alone by adding mission related modules to the ship the behavior and performance of the whole system is changed such a reconfiguration may change the hydrodynamic properties of the ship and impact compliance with stability requirements rendering some useful reconfigurations infeasible 1 2 platforms and flexibility there exists a wide body of research on platforms in the systems engineering literature the segment of product family design and platform based product development has received particular attention jiao et al 2007 jose and tollenaere 2005 meyer and lehnerd 1997 simpson et al 2006 research on product platforms are rooted in the development of product families representing a set of similar products derived from a common platform while still having specific functionality to meet different customer requirements meyer and lehnerd 1997 define a product platform as a set of subsystems and interfaces developed to form a common structure from which a stream of derivative products can be efficiently developed and produced product platforms have traditionally been discussed in the context of manufacturing related to mass customization of product families this mode of platform thinking is especially useful for ship yards erikstad 2009 discusses modularization product platforming and modular production in shipbuilding semini et al 2014 take the perspective of customer order decoupling points to define customized and standardized designs and discuss strategies for customized ship design and construction linked to different market characteristics early stage ship design research frequently discuss modularization as a way to incorporate all necessary ship subsystems within the hull examples being the design building blocks andrews 2012 and the packing approach van oers 2011 an alternative view of the platform notion is on design of large complex systems subject to temporal uncertainty of future use and demand such as offshore ships this represents the ship owners point of view as ship owners need to handle uncertainty throughout a vessel s lifecycle in this paper we take the latter approach and use platform instead product platform notation to be specific however in the literature there seems to be overlapping definitions a challenge in platform and product platform design is the tradeoff between the degree of modularity and the performance of products based on the same platform a generic platform may work for multiple purposes but will perhaps not be a successful design in competition with optimized alternatives d souza and simpson 2003 present a method for balancing these design properties studying a general aviation aircraft case hölltä et al 2005 use several metrics to quantify the degree of modularity for products that face both technical and business related constraints finding that technical constraints limit the degree to which a design should be modularized in a more thorough study hölttä otto and de weck 2007 find that designs driven by technical constraints in fact often exhibit integral architectures compared to less constrained designs these results are in partial opposition to the independence axiom of suh 1990 and the notion that modularization is always a positive several methods for design of product platforms under uncertainty exist these include the product platform concept exploration method ppcem simpson et al 2001 design for variety dfv martin and ishii 2002 and a design process for a product line design under uncertainty and competition li and azarm 2002 gonzalez zugasti et al 2000 present a method for architecting product platforms which are evaluated using a real options approach by gonzalez zugasti et al 2001 flexible product platform designs are addressed by suh et al 2007 coupling real options valuation with a structural model for the platform a real option is in this context normally defined as the right but not the obligation to change system configuration at a future time de neufville 2003 as there are technical limitations to using real options analysis in engineering compared to financial applications it has been necessary to device new methods for evaluation of options in physical engineering systems wang and de neufville 2005 as opposed to real options on projects real options in projects require understanding of underlying technical constraints identification of these options becomes equivalent to finding the design elements that should be flexible kalligeros et al 2006 present a method for identifying the system elements that should constitute the platform design beyond options theory flexibility is discussed from a broad perspective by saleh et al 2009 reviewing the literature on flexibility from a multi disciplinary perspective including management manufacturing engineering and design flexibility is considered as the ability of a system to be modified to meet new requirements chalupnik et al 2013 ross et al 2008 suggest that flexibility require an external change agent to actively intervene considering it beneath the umbrella term changeability along with adaptability the ability of the system to change itself through an internal change agent fricke and schulz 2005 outline design principles for changeability aimed at reducing complexity and present a framework for identification and implementation of characteristics that enable future system configuration changes in their paper they further discuss the difference between changeability and product platforms and point out that changeability can be incorporated into the platform itself which is appropriate when there is temporal uncertainty to the demand of the overall product family there is an important difference between valuation of changeability and quantification of the level of changeability in traditional real options literature focus is usually on the valuation of a given real option when it comes to systems design before we can evaluate the flexibility of a design alternative we need to be able to describe a design s level of flexibility in addition to understanding the technical implications of different levels of flexibility in this paper we focus on flexibility level quantification by use of the graph theoretical filtered outdegree metrics ross et al 2008 we do not focus on monetary valuation of flexibility but rather address the technical performance of the whole offshore ship to be able to understand impacts of increased levels of flexibility the approach applied for assessment of ship performance in this paper is based on multi criteria decision making methods in which a set of conflicting objectives are traded keeney and raiffa 1993 multi objective decision making methods have become popular within ship design investigating multiple technical caprace et al 2010 klanac et al 2009 martins and burgos 2009 and commercial compromises gaspar et al 2012 temple and collette 2016 in multi attribute tradespace exploration the point is not merely to identify a set of pareto optimal design but also to understand how the set of pareto optimal designs change with changing context and needs ross and rhodes 2008 from this discussion we address an interesting problem from the naval architects point of view how to identify good design alternatives that satisfy performance expectations while still being flexible to change in the future we will demonstrate a method for quantifying the level of flexibility of an offshore ship using filtered outdegree based on tradespace network system representations and use this for understanding the technical limitations and tradeoffs in performance and cost that platform flexibility leads to 2 multi attribute decision making 2 1 multi attribute tradespace exploration for evaluating designs multi attribute tradespace exploration is a technique for evaluation of many alternative designs against a set of value attributes reflecting the preferences of the stakeholders ross et al 2004 founded in multi attribute utility theory the utility function is a function of a set of single attribute utility functions adhering to several requirements the attribute set should be complete representing all important properties operational possible to represent in the analysis decomposable meaning that the utility function can be broken down to parts that can be analyzed more easily non redundant suggesting that the aspects of importance should not be double counted and minimal meaning that the set of attributes should be kept as small as possible keeney and raiffa 1993 the multi attribute utility function is often represented as a linear weighted sum of all the single attribute utility functions as shown in equation 1 in this function u j represents the multi attribute utility estimate for a design alternative j in the design set j while the single attribute utility function u i j scores design alternative j with respect to value attribute i in the set of attributes i k i denotes the weight for attribute i 1 u j i i k i u i j j j in the tradespace the multi attribute utility for each design alternative is plotted against a measure of costs the costs can be readily estimated for each design alternative in fig 1 we see an example of a tradespace the pareto front of non dominated designs is highlighted a significant difference between multi attribute tradespace exploration and similar forms for multi criteria decision making methods is the focus on further concept exploration rather than directly finding an optimal solution there are two primary reasons for this first we do not have much knowledge about the design alternatives at this stage beyond the low fidelity analysis done therefore we should seek out more information before reducing the number of system concepts to explore second future uncertainty may manifest itself in changes in the context and stakeholder needs effectively changing the utility function solutions that once looked bad may now look better this line of thinking is captured in epoch era analysis ross et al 2008 ross and rhodes 2008 2 2 extending the pareto set with fuzziness a compromise between keeping all solutions for exploration of the tradespace and identifying solutions on the pareto efficient frontier is to retain some of the dominated designs for further analysis smaling and de weck 2004 developed a framework for extending the set of pareto efficient design to a fuzzy pareto set by introducing a relaxation factor for dominance the relaxation factor k is a number between 0 and 1 where 0 will mean that we only consider the set of designs at the pareto front and 1 meaning that the whole feasible solution space is kept for consideration a design alternative falling within the fuzzy pareto set when k 0 1 can be considered to be within 10 of the range of costs and utility relative the pareto front fitzgerald and ross 2012 the fuzzy pareto number f p n j for a design alternative j is defined by fitzgerald and ross 2012 as the minimal k for which the design alternative j is still contained within the fuzzy pareto set p k as shown in equation 2 2 f p n j min k j p k the concept of fuzzy pareto sets is illustrated in fig 1 b the tradespace is divided into a region that is within the fuzzy pareto set and the solutions that are still considered dominated under the relaxed condition for pareto optimality keeping an extended amount of design alternatives for further investigation reduces the probability that potentially value robust solutions are discarded before a proper evaluation has been done considering that the performance may change under future operating conditions 2 3 tradespace networks for quantification of changeability level physical reconfiguration changeability between point designs in the tradespace is considered next where changeability simply represents an umbrella term for flexibility as discussed by ross et al 2008 if a design from the tradespace has been selected as the preferred concept to build and deploy the stakeholders could still reconfigure the design at a later stage in the lifetime by adding or removing features the addition or removal of a feature will be equivalent to moving from one system state to another in theory all designs can change into each other but not all such changes between two designs are rational when accounting for the cost and time of implementing the change in graph theoretical terms each design alternative is a node while a set of arcs represents feasible reconfigurations from the considered start node to nodes representing the new systems after reconfigurations multiple paths may exist between two nodes comprising an arc as different physical ways mechanisms of making the state transition exist resulting in the same change effect details of this concepts are described in the agent mechanism effect framework presented by ross et al 2008 associated with each transition path there is a cost and time ross et al 2008 introduce filtered outdegree fod a measure quantifying the level of changeability by counting the outgoing paths or arcs from a design counting either change mechanisms or end states respectively reachable at a given cost and time in this paper we only consider counting the number of end states for simplicity fig 2 illustrates a tradespace network in which a cost and time filter is applied resulting in a reduced set of feasible arcs an arc is thus defined to exist if there is a path between the nodes within the acceptable cost and time threshold the node representing an initially selected design j that may have previously been located on the pareto front is shown in fig 2 a in fig 2 b arcs which symbolize feasible transitions for given cost and time thresholds are illustrated using the graph theoretical constructs outlined above in combination with the notion of a tradespace network ross et al 2008 present a framework for quantification of changeability the central metric for changeability in this framework is based on the outdegree of the system the outdegree is the number of outgoing arcs from a node by applying a threshold cost and time for a state change between two nodes the filtered outdegree fod is defined the f o d j c ˆ t ˆ metric quantifies the number of feasible outgoing arcs from node j to all nodes in the set j under given cost c ˆ and time t ˆ thresholds as given by equation 3 3 f o d j c ˆ t ˆ d j h c j d t j d c j d c ˆ t j d t ˆ c j d and t j d are cost and time for transitioning from node j to d and h is the heaviside function defined as 1 if there exist a path where both change cost and time for the node transition are below the thresholds and 0 else thus we only count end state changeability in this particular case however the metric can easily be altered to counting the number of change paths between states if that is more relevant for the analysis counting end states enables easy analysis of the space of possible reconfigurations while counting paths is a more complex measure that enables detailed analyses of the state transitions i e analyses of the change mechanisms counting paths can be relevant for e g equipment slot modularization or steel reinforcement analyses on an offshore ship this level of fidelity remains outside the scope of this paper and thus we proceed to count end states the filtered outdegree allows an understanding of which real options in the design that should be evaluated the measure can also be adapted by fixing certain design variables that can constitute integral to a platform design 3 methodology to investigate tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility of offshore vessels we follow a stepwise procedure as outlined in fig 3 the first three steps comprise the initial part where the problem is outlined this involves defining the multi attribute utility function characterizing the design space and developing a model of the system to be able to evaluate the performance of a design it is necessary to connect the multi attribute utility function with the possible design alternatives in a system model depending on the chosen approach for design characterization it is important to screen alternatives to make sure they are physically viable the latter three steps comprise the analysis part first to get an overall understanding of the model a tradespace should be developed and explored for model verification purposes one can benchmark against ships that are built to see their modelled performance a separation is made between ships without equipment i e platforms and with equipment as we are interested in analyzing the retrofit flexibility of the platforms to investigate the impact of cost we reduce the tradespace and extract cost efficient solutions by use of a fuzzy pareto filter on the tradeoff between flexibility and cost this reduces the set of designs to analyze simplifying the problem last we investigate the tradeoffs between various performance attributes and flexibility for these cost efficient designs 4 case study this case study uses the multi attribute tradespace network theories to generate insights into the design of reconfigurable offshore ships the design of offshore construction vessels has been chosen due to the spatial complexity of the design space the heterogeneity of the markets in which they operate and the ambiguities in perceived ability to generate value this case study presented builds on material in rehn et al 2016 4 1 define multi attribute utility function 4 1 1 offshore ship generalized performance attributes when assessing the performance of an offshore ship the question what is a better ship must be explored benford 1970 ulstein and brett 2015 first when considering commercial systems it is reasonable to argue that a good ship is a profitable ship the ability to generate profits depends on the market situation and is not easy to untangle in terms of describing individual system substructures contributing to profitability from a technical point of view we can still identify a few generalized performance attributes defining valuable systems for example in the consumer car industry disregarding the price generalized attributes that define a good car include comfort driving capabilities such as traction and acceleration transportation capacity in terms of people and luggage eco friendliness aesthetics and safety if all these are met we have a good car however as one may find these attributes eventually meet a physical tradeoff either you get a sports car or you get an suv further not to mention that increasing attributes together quickly increases the price of the car for offshore ships we can follow the same analogy a ship designer is interested in developing designs that can be sold to their potential customers the ship owners what is desired of an offshore ship is the ability to meet the customer requirements to drive profitability we propose three generalized technical performance attributes that are assumed to serve as proxies for profitability and thus define a better ship as presented in table 1 however even when disregarding costs bigger is not always better for example issues with external physical constraints may occur such as maximum lengths at ports and canals in addition to these three performance attributes several others may be defined such as safety and reliability papanikolaou 2009 these are more difficult to quantify at the conceptual design level and were hence not included in this analysis in general it is important not to span too many attributes as short term memory limits the number of attributes to seven plus minus two miller 1956 further the proposed performance characteristics are physical descriptive measures that are important for most ship concepts these attributes must not be confused with the ilities such as flexibility and adaptability which are system characteristics on the lifecycle level these enter the discussion when we consider the filtered outdegree in later parts of the analysis 4 1 2 multi attribute utility mau function the multi attribute utility mau function for offshore construction vessels is decomposed into a set of three single attribute utility functions connected to the three aspects of performance capability capacity and operability the structure of the utility function is shown in fig 4 for simplicity the utility function is assumed a linear weighted sum as presented in equation 1 with equal weights however other representations of value are possible the hierarchy in fig 4 represents a generalized set of performance attributes for offshore construction and well intervention vessels and does not necessarily represent the multi attribute utility function of a particular industry actor the single attribute utility functions for capability and capacity are easily estimated as these are decomposable to descriptive elements of the ship topside equipment types and size measures the single attribute utility for operability is decomposed into further performance attributes based on hydrodynamic characteristics which map onto ship concepts through the knowledge base of naval architects 4 2 characterize the design space 4 2 1 generating feasible designs a set of designs is enumerated on basis of design variables that are related both to the main dimensions of the ship and to the systems installed on board the six design variables that provide description of the design alternatives are provided in table 2 only design alternatives that adhere to some basic constraints on physical feasibility in naval architecture are enumerated ship concepts need to comply with stability freeboard and structural integrity criteria stability is incorporated based in the requirement of that initial metacentric height g m must exceed a minimum required g m m i n 0 15 m the freeboard f must exceed a minimum required f m i n 1 5 m a model that ensures structural integrity in the hull is included to prevent unreasonably slender ships a simplified structural model is assumed and the maximal material stress allowed is σ m a x 220 m p a for an assumed maximum bending moment condition including a safety factor in addition we require that if well intervention tower is installed a moonpool is required initial design space enumerates to 16800 designs which reduces to 5803 after the physical compatibility screening 4 2 2 parametric assessment for ship properties the analysis relies on various physical parameters which are given in table 3 assumed parameters for the properties of the equipment that can be installed on the vessel are given in table 4 the ship platform represents the ship without equipment the acquisition cost c s h i p for the ship is calculated using equation 5 by adding two cost elements the cost of the ship without equipment and the cost of the equipment the scaling constant k c o s t represents the cost per metric tonnes of the ship without equipment and is given in table 3 c e q u i p e is the cost of including equipment e in the set e of possible equipment types that can be installed on the ship 5 c s h i p k c o s t w l s e e c e q u i p e the lightweight of the platform ship w l s is given in equation 6 k l s is a scaling constant given in table 3 6 w l s k l s l b d 4 3 develop system model performance attributes representing the single attribute utility functions are defined on a 0 to 1 scale where 1 is the best and 0 is the worst for every performance attribute the individual subcomponents are included using a linear weighted sum as shown in equation 1 the defined ranges for the individual performance subcomponents are given in table 5 4 3 1 capability capability is based on the equipment installed on the vessel and is for simplicity assumed a linear combination of crane lifting capacity and well intervention tower lifting capacity no additional calculations are needed since the capability can be estimated directly from the design description and connects to the utility function as shown in table 5 4 3 2 capacity the deck area a d e c k for a design is estimated by equation 7 the scaling constant k d a is given in table 3 a e q u i p e is the area that equipment e in the set e of possible equipment types takes up on deck in other words we care about the free deck area in accordance with table 5 the deck area should be maximized 7 a d e c k k d a l b e e a e q u i p e the deadweight d w t of a design is estimated by equation 8 δ m a x is the maximum weight displacement of the ship defined by the main dimensions maximum freeboard block coefficient and water density w e q u i p e is the weight of equipment e on deck in the set e given in table 4 and w l s is the lightweight of the platform ship given by equation 6 8 d w t δ m a x e e w e q u i p e w l s 4 3 3 operability offshore ships should be operable in rough seas hence the hydrodynamic ship response in waves is simplified and estimated the heave response is determined from the main ship characteristics in sea states described by a bretschneider wave spectrum to simplify only the translational vertical response is considered the ship is modelled as a damped mass spring system including added mass from water faltinsen 1990 the excitation force in the vertical direction is the sum of the froude krylov force and the diffraction forces added mass is represented by 2d strip theory assuming the ship as a simplified box shape we obtain equation 9 describing the transfer function for heave response h 3 ω 9 h 3 ω x ζ a 2 k sin k l 2 ρ b g e k z b o t t o m ω 2 a 33 2 d e k z m i d d l e c 33 m a 33 ω 2 2 b 33 ω 2 here m is the ship mass a 33 is the added mass b 33 is the damping coefficient and c 33 is the spring constant ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration ζ a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency and k is the wave number l and b refer to the length and beam of the ship s ω is the bretschneider wave spectrum maximization of operability implies minimization of the heave variance σ 2 obtained by integrating the heave response spectrum as shown in equation 10 10 σ 2 0 h 3 ω 2 s ω d ω when it comes to roll and pitch movement it is reasonable to desire a high period as slow vessel accelerations are assumed beneficial for operations the estimates for the pitch and roll period are given in equation 11 11 t i 2 π k g i g g m i here i represents the degree of freedom either 4 for roll or 5 for pitch k g i is the radius of gyration and g m i is the initial metacentric height under the objective of maximizing operability we further seek to minimize the total ship resistance shown in equation 12 12 r t o t 1 2 ρ v 2 a c t o t where v is the speed of the ship and c t o t is the total resistance number the wet surface area a is estimated using equation 13 13 a a l where a is a constant assumed to be 2 6 is the volume displacement of the vessel estimated as c b l b t where c b is the block coefficient and l b and t refer to the length beam and draft of the ship the non dimensional total resistance number is assumed to follow the relation in equation 14 in which f n is the froude number given by f n v g l assuming a constant design speed of 15 knots 14 c t o t 3 99 f n 5 59 0 00206 to account for the vessel being equipped with a moonpool the resistance is assumed to increase by 10 keep in mind the potential inaccuracy of the above mentioned estimations may not be that of an issue as they are included for enabling comparisons between the alternative vessel concepts and not for absolute estimations 4 4 develop and explore tradespace a design space of 5803 alternative designs is generated and analyzed these designs include ship platforms both with and without equipment installed the corresponding tradespace is shown in fig 5 where each point represents a design alternative the designs that are on the pareto frontier are highlighted as are the designs that are within the 3 fuzziness pareto set five existing offshore construction vessels in the industry are included in fig 5 to benchmark and validate the model detailed information about these vessels is given in table 6 where cost mau and performance attributes are estimated by the model two of these vessels are previous winners of the award for the norwegian ship of the year note that the results for these five vessels only reflect their value to the hypothetical ship owner in the case and are not indicative of their value to their actual owners in terms of profitability in table 7 the details of four pareto efficient 0 fuzziness designs identified from fig 5 are shown including the design variables performance attributes mau and acquisition cost these designs are selected based on their spread along the pareto front as can be seen on the increasing cost and mau values we look at these designs to better understand our model and the tradespace findings are discussed in chapter 5 4 5 extract cost efficient flexible platforms the most significant retrofit cost drivers are changes in the main dimensions of the ship that is changing the size of the ship platform we therefore fix platform parameters length beam depth and moonpool and only investigate change of equipment on deck crane and tower this enables a more meaningful comparison between platforms since they are similar in the functional space this reduces the platform design space to 640 alternatives the 5 fuzzy pareto optimal designs in the tradeoff between filtered outdegree fod and acquisition cost reduces the size of the set of platform designs from 640 to 158 these are the most cost effective flexible platforms available at a given cost these 158 platform designs are plotted in a tradespace in fig 6 where we can see the tradeoffs between platform flexibility as measured by fod acquisition cost and multi attribute utility the threshold cost and time for the calculation of fod are in this case manipulated so that it only enables retrofit of equipment and not of the platform which enables us to analyze physical aspects of retrofit feasibility table 8 presents more detailed information of interesting pareto optimal platforms in fig 6 the platforms analyzed do not have any equipment hence their capability levels are zero indicated with a these can obviously be changed in the events of adding equipment which is what we analyze here the maximum filtered outdegree for a platform in this analysis is 23 which represents being able to take all potential equipment configuration states as predefined in the tradespace network model 4 6 investigating tradeoffs between performance attributes and flexibility being on the fuzzy pareto front in the tradeoff between filtered outdegree and acquisition cost is preferable to enable maximum potential retrofit upside at the minimal initial cost fig 7 untangles the multi attribute utility measure of the designs plotted in fig 6 to enable further investigation of the implications of platform flexibility on capacity and operability fig 7 illustrates single utility attribute values for the platforms as a function of the level of flexibility quantified by the fod metric there is a relatively clear correlation between capacity and flexibility however operability seems to have a more complex relationship with flexibility and hence it is of interest to investigate operability vs flexibility further to its individual sub attributes fig 8 plots fod against roll heave response resistance and pitch flexible platforms with high operational performance at low cost are of interest to identify and understand three selected platforms at this complex pareto front are given in table 9 with best individual single subcomponent operability levels we can see that these designs are significantly different supporting the hypothesis of that conflicting objectives must be traded off against each other i e no solution is best at all performance metrics at the same time 5 discussion pareto optimal results in table 7 represent the offshore ships that give the highest performance for the lowest cost in the tradespace plotted in fig 5 design 2636 in table 4 is closest to utopia this design is long and slender has a large crane installed and a low acquisition cost compared to ships in the industry today this ship has a high length to beam ration of 9 3 it could be interesting to investigate further why this is not found in the market today it is just a modelling oversimplification or a so far unexplored opportunity this points to the need for an iterative analysis process where we for example can revisit the assumption of equal single attribute weights further the physical compatibility models in this analysis for structural integrity and stability are very simple and high fidelity analyses should be used to further investigate the potential use for such a design for deeper insights in the model and results fig 5 also includes five real offshore ships of which two are previous winners of the award for norwegian ship of the year these ships are mainly included for model validation purposes but it also allows us to investigate differences between them information about cost technical performance and design variables for these are estimated by the model and given in table 6 akofs seafarer is the only of the four designs that is pareto optimal based on our model island constructor represent a first generation light well intervention lwi vessel and has substantially lower technical performance compared to the other ships in table 6 we do not aim to criticize any of the designs and recognize that our model may be flawed to give wrong estimates our estimation approach is though transparent as presented in the paper and the results follow directly from this our goal with the comparisons is to provide insight to improve decision making in offshore ship design in fig 6 we can see the tradeoff between platform flexibility measured in filtered outdegree and platform multi attribute utility and acquisition cost if a platform is supposed to handle crane and tower retrofits extra stability and deck area is needed which comes at a cost we are therefore interested in identifying the most flexible designs at the lowest cost a key characteristic of the most cost effective flexible maritime platforms presented in table 8 is the non slenderness of these designs they are wide and short indicating that cheap flexibility compromises operability fig 7 illustrates the relationships between the individual performance attributes and flexibility we can see that in terms of capacity we have a positive correlation with flexibility this is intuitive as a larger platform can take on more equipment retrofits and has a larger deck area and deadweight which increases the capacity however the relationship between operability and flexibility is more ambiguous as shown in fig 8 we observe that all 158 prescreened cost effective flexible platform designs perform poor in terms of rolling these designs have low roll periods 10s contributing to unfavorably high accelerations further fig 8 shows that a compromise must be made between resistance and flexibility as excess stability deadweight and deck area are needed for a high fod the heave response and pitch still have an ambiguous relationship with flexibility as they seem relatively independent from fod for the 158 prescreened cost effective flexible designs however all have relatively undesirable roll periods for heave motion however good dynamic behavior should be able to be achieved independently of the degree of flexibility table 9 presents three interesting platform designs at low cost which have one highest individual subcomponent operability attribute while still being able to take on all possible types of equipment fod 23 the fact that these three designs are significantly different supports our conclusion that operability is a complex performance attribute with conflicting sub attributes to decide which platform design that is better one needs to determine what is more important to be able to find a compromised optimal solution this ties back to our comment in the introduction about the difference between valuation of changeability and quantification of changeability level the former will aid in determining what to do while we focus on the latter in this paper thus attempts at deciding the best tradeoff between the conflicting objectives remains outside the objectives of this paper these results leave us with some insight about the properties of flexible offshore ship platforms multiple compromises must be made in the design between enabling reconfigurations through excessive platform size and stability roll period and resistance ship slenderness is a critical factor that must be traded against flexibility when designing offshore ship platforms with reconfigurable topsides we have shown how tradespace exploration lets us study the trade offs between utility and costs however the single attribute utility weights in the model are assumed constant by considering explicitly what happens when the system context or stakeholder needs change in an epoch era analysis ross and rhodes 2008 strategies could be elaborated for exercising specific reconfiguration opportunities the tradespace network using filtered outdegree to quantify the level of flexibility can thus lead us to designs providing promising redesign alternatives in the dynamic setting however outdegree is only one measure of centrality in network theory further insight can be obtained by exploring other measures of centrality such as betweenness and closeness curry et al 2017 briefly include some other metrics of centrality in their tradespace analysis nevertheless we demonstrate that filtered outdegree represents a good measure for quantifying the level of flexibility for offshore ship platforms in terms of flexible platform analysis it could be interesting to further investigate sensitivities in terms of the design variables of the platform for the ships in this analysis this involves the length beam depth and moonpool however it is important to realize that it is also possible to change the platform with for example elongation knight and singer 2012 and moonpool readiness while the design study presented in this paper has taken a parametric approach other methods researched in the maritime literature could provide valuable for flexibility analyses these include using design building blocks andrews 2012 packing approach van oers 2011 or optimization of modular adaptable designs choi and erikstad 2017 with such higher fidelity design methods involving the internals of the ship one can potentially approach the operability concerns from for the flexible ships from new angles which can offset the unfavorable aspects identified from the simple approach presented in this paper 6 conclusion this paper investigates tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility of offshore ship platforms for measuring technical performance a generalized maritime model is defined based on capability capacity and operability a tradespace representation is used to explore the design space and to define the tradespace network that enables the quantification of flexibility level by use of filtered outdegree two main conclusions can be drawn from this work first we conclude that tradespace exploration methods and filtered outdegree are good methods to understand the design space and investigate tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility it is particularly helpful to see which aspects of technical performance are affected by increasing the level of flexibility the second conclusion is regarding the insights gained from analyzing the flexible ship platforms with these methods flexible platforms are characterized by having excess stability deadweight and deck area to take on equipment retrofits increased platform flexibility does increase capacity but comes at a complex compromise with operability as resistance is increased and roll periods become unfavorable due to high accelerations although this latter conclusion may seem obvious from an experienced naval architect s point of view it is still beneficial to systematically quantify these tradeoffs with the aim of designing better ships under uncertainty 
23746,this paper investigates tradeoffs between technical performance cost and flexibility level for reconfigurable offshore ships an offshore ship can be configured with various types of equipment thus its base structure constitutes a platform from which several end ship design configurations can be derived a ship with equipment retrofit flexibility will typically have excess stability deadweight and deck area to ensure physical compatibility however there are complex system interactions that need consideration such as the effects of flexibility on cost and technical performance to tackle this problem we capture technical performance using a multi attribute utility function based on a ship s capability capacity and operability and utilize a tradespace representation of the system to quantify flexibility using the filtered outdegree metric findings indicate that increased platform flexibility does increase capacity but comes at a complex compromise with operability as resistance is increased and roll periods become unfavorable due to high accelerations furthermore the analysis confirms the applicability of multi attribute utility tradespace exploration and filtered outdegree for understanding the implications of flexible offshore ships keywords ship design platform flexibility uncertainty systems engineering tradespace 1 introduction 1 1 motivation in contrast to traditional deep sea cargo transportation ships offshore ships comprise a set of ships that are designed to provide different operational services such as platform supply offshore construction and light well intervention these ships are usually build either for a particular long term contract which impose specialization or on speculation which impose multi functionality at early design stages the future needs of an offshore ship are typically uncertain due to volatile and heterogenous market conditions erikstad and rehn 2015 for this reason there is a need to understand how offshore ships can embed flexibility to be reconfigured in response to emerging needs and how flexibility affects technical performance and acquisition costs from a design perspective it may be useful to think of offshore ships as comprised of two main groups of subsystems ship systems and mission related systems erikstad and levander 2012 ship systems are similar across a wide range of final designs and may include the main hull accommodation unit and bridge mission related systems can include cranes remotely operated vehicle units and light well intervention towers in this way we adopt the notion of platforms representing the subsystems that provide a common basis from which a stream of end design configurations can be derived an interesting aspect of reconfigurable offshore ships is that compatibility between the platform and the mission related modules moves beyond the consideration of the platform module interface alone by adding mission related modules to the ship the behavior and performance of the whole system is changed such a reconfiguration may change the hydrodynamic properties of the ship and impact compliance with stability requirements rendering some useful reconfigurations infeasible 1 2 platforms and flexibility there exists a wide body of research on platforms in the systems engineering literature the segment of product family design and platform based product development has received particular attention jiao et al 2007 jose and tollenaere 2005 meyer and lehnerd 1997 simpson et al 2006 research on product platforms are rooted in the development of product families representing a set of similar products derived from a common platform while still having specific functionality to meet different customer requirements meyer and lehnerd 1997 define a product platform as a set of subsystems and interfaces developed to form a common structure from which a stream of derivative products can be efficiently developed and produced product platforms have traditionally been discussed in the context of manufacturing related to mass customization of product families this mode of platform thinking is especially useful for ship yards erikstad 2009 discusses modularization product platforming and modular production in shipbuilding semini et al 2014 take the perspective of customer order decoupling points to define customized and standardized designs and discuss strategies for customized ship design and construction linked to different market characteristics early stage ship design research frequently discuss modularization as a way to incorporate all necessary ship subsystems within the hull examples being the design building blocks andrews 2012 and the packing approach van oers 2011 an alternative view of the platform notion is on design of large complex systems subject to temporal uncertainty of future use and demand such as offshore ships this represents the ship owners point of view as ship owners need to handle uncertainty throughout a vessel s lifecycle in this paper we take the latter approach and use platform instead product platform notation to be specific however in the literature there seems to be overlapping definitions a challenge in platform and product platform design is the tradeoff between the degree of modularity and the performance of products based on the same platform a generic platform may work for multiple purposes but will perhaps not be a successful design in competition with optimized alternatives d souza and simpson 2003 present a method for balancing these design properties studying a general aviation aircraft case hölltä et al 2005 use several metrics to quantify the degree of modularity for products that face both technical and business related constraints finding that technical constraints limit the degree to which a design should be modularized in a more thorough study hölttä otto and de weck 2007 find that designs driven by technical constraints in fact often exhibit integral architectures compared to less constrained designs these results are in partial opposition to the independence axiom of suh 1990 and the notion that modularization is always a positive several methods for design of product platforms under uncertainty exist these include the product platform concept exploration method ppcem simpson et al 2001 design for variety dfv martin and ishii 2002 and a design process for a product line design under uncertainty and competition li and azarm 2002 gonzalez zugasti et al 2000 present a method for architecting product platforms which are evaluated using a real options approach by gonzalez zugasti et al 2001 flexible product platform designs are addressed by suh et al 2007 coupling real options valuation with a structural model for the platform a real option is in this context normally defined as the right but not the obligation to change system configuration at a future time de neufville 2003 as there are technical limitations to using real options analysis in engineering compared to financial applications it has been necessary to device new methods for evaluation of options in physical engineering systems wang and de neufville 2005 as opposed to real options on projects real options in projects require understanding of underlying technical constraints identification of these options becomes equivalent to finding the design elements that should be flexible kalligeros et al 2006 present a method for identifying the system elements that should constitute the platform design beyond options theory flexibility is discussed from a broad perspective by saleh et al 2009 reviewing the literature on flexibility from a multi disciplinary perspective including management manufacturing engineering and design flexibility is considered as the ability of a system to be modified to meet new requirements chalupnik et al 2013 ross et al 2008 suggest that flexibility require an external change agent to actively intervene considering it beneath the umbrella term changeability along with adaptability the ability of the system to change itself through an internal change agent fricke and schulz 2005 outline design principles for changeability aimed at reducing complexity and present a framework for identification and implementation of characteristics that enable future system configuration changes in their paper they further discuss the difference between changeability and product platforms and point out that changeability can be incorporated into the platform itself which is appropriate when there is temporal uncertainty to the demand of the overall product family there is an important difference between valuation of changeability and quantification of the level of changeability in traditional real options literature focus is usually on the valuation of a given real option when it comes to systems design before we can evaluate the flexibility of a design alternative we need to be able to describe a design s level of flexibility in addition to understanding the technical implications of different levels of flexibility in this paper we focus on flexibility level quantification by use of the graph theoretical filtered outdegree metrics ross et al 2008 we do not focus on monetary valuation of flexibility but rather address the technical performance of the whole offshore ship to be able to understand impacts of increased levels of flexibility the approach applied for assessment of ship performance in this paper is based on multi criteria decision making methods in which a set of conflicting objectives are traded keeney and raiffa 1993 multi objective decision making methods have become popular within ship design investigating multiple technical caprace et al 2010 klanac et al 2009 martins and burgos 2009 and commercial compromises gaspar et al 2012 temple and collette 2016 in multi attribute tradespace exploration the point is not merely to identify a set of pareto optimal design but also to understand how the set of pareto optimal designs change with changing context and needs ross and rhodes 2008 from this discussion we address an interesting problem from the naval architects point of view how to identify good design alternatives that satisfy performance expectations while still being flexible to change in the future we will demonstrate a method for quantifying the level of flexibility of an offshore ship using filtered outdegree based on tradespace network system representations and use this for understanding the technical limitations and tradeoffs in performance and cost that platform flexibility leads to 2 multi attribute decision making 2 1 multi attribute tradespace exploration for evaluating designs multi attribute tradespace exploration is a technique for evaluation of many alternative designs against a set of value attributes reflecting the preferences of the stakeholders ross et al 2004 founded in multi attribute utility theory the utility function is a function of a set of single attribute utility functions adhering to several requirements the attribute set should be complete representing all important properties operational possible to represent in the analysis decomposable meaning that the utility function can be broken down to parts that can be analyzed more easily non redundant suggesting that the aspects of importance should not be double counted and minimal meaning that the set of attributes should be kept as small as possible keeney and raiffa 1993 the multi attribute utility function is often represented as a linear weighted sum of all the single attribute utility functions as shown in equation 1 in this function u j represents the multi attribute utility estimate for a design alternative j in the design set j while the single attribute utility function u i j scores design alternative j with respect to value attribute i in the set of attributes i k i denotes the weight for attribute i 1 u j i i k i u i j j j in the tradespace the multi attribute utility for each design alternative is plotted against a measure of costs the costs can be readily estimated for each design alternative in fig 1 we see an example of a tradespace the pareto front of non dominated designs is highlighted a significant difference between multi attribute tradespace exploration and similar forms for multi criteria decision making methods is the focus on further concept exploration rather than directly finding an optimal solution there are two primary reasons for this first we do not have much knowledge about the design alternatives at this stage beyond the low fidelity analysis done therefore we should seek out more information before reducing the number of system concepts to explore second future uncertainty may manifest itself in changes in the context and stakeholder needs effectively changing the utility function solutions that once looked bad may now look better this line of thinking is captured in epoch era analysis ross et al 2008 ross and rhodes 2008 2 2 extending the pareto set with fuzziness a compromise between keeping all solutions for exploration of the tradespace and identifying solutions on the pareto efficient frontier is to retain some of the dominated designs for further analysis smaling and de weck 2004 developed a framework for extending the set of pareto efficient design to a fuzzy pareto set by introducing a relaxation factor for dominance the relaxation factor k is a number between 0 and 1 where 0 will mean that we only consider the set of designs at the pareto front and 1 meaning that the whole feasible solution space is kept for consideration a design alternative falling within the fuzzy pareto set when k 0 1 can be considered to be within 10 of the range of costs and utility relative the pareto front fitzgerald and ross 2012 the fuzzy pareto number f p n j for a design alternative j is defined by fitzgerald and ross 2012 as the minimal k for which the design alternative j is still contained within the fuzzy pareto set p k as shown in equation 2 2 f p n j min k j p k the concept of fuzzy pareto sets is illustrated in fig 1 b the tradespace is divided into a region that is within the fuzzy pareto set and the solutions that are still considered dominated under the relaxed condition for pareto optimality keeping an extended amount of design alternatives for further investigation reduces the probability that potentially value robust solutions are discarded before a proper evaluation has been done considering that the performance may change under future operating conditions 2 3 tradespace networks for quantification of changeability level physical reconfiguration changeability between point designs in the tradespace is considered next where changeability simply represents an umbrella term for flexibility as discussed by ross et al 2008 if a design from the tradespace has been selected as the preferred concept to build and deploy the stakeholders could still reconfigure the design at a later stage in the lifetime by adding or removing features the addition or removal of a feature will be equivalent to moving from one system state to another in theory all designs can change into each other but not all such changes between two designs are rational when accounting for the cost and time of implementing the change in graph theoretical terms each design alternative is a node while a set of arcs represents feasible reconfigurations from the considered start node to nodes representing the new systems after reconfigurations multiple paths may exist between two nodes comprising an arc as different physical ways mechanisms of making the state transition exist resulting in the same change effect details of this concepts are described in the agent mechanism effect framework presented by ross et al 2008 associated with each transition path there is a cost and time ross et al 2008 introduce filtered outdegree fod a measure quantifying the level of changeability by counting the outgoing paths or arcs from a design counting either change mechanisms or end states respectively reachable at a given cost and time in this paper we only consider counting the number of end states for simplicity fig 2 illustrates a tradespace network in which a cost and time filter is applied resulting in a reduced set of feasible arcs an arc is thus defined to exist if there is a path between the nodes within the acceptable cost and time threshold the node representing an initially selected design j that may have previously been located on the pareto front is shown in fig 2 a in fig 2 b arcs which symbolize feasible transitions for given cost and time thresholds are illustrated using the graph theoretical constructs outlined above in combination with the notion of a tradespace network ross et al 2008 present a framework for quantification of changeability the central metric for changeability in this framework is based on the outdegree of the system the outdegree is the number of outgoing arcs from a node by applying a threshold cost and time for a state change between two nodes the filtered outdegree fod is defined the f o d j c ˆ t ˆ metric quantifies the number of feasible outgoing arcs from node j to all nodes in the set j under given cost c ˆ and time t ˆ thresholds as given by equation 3 3 f o d j c ˆ t ˆ d j h c j d t j d c j d c ˆ t j d t ˆ c j d and t j d are cost and time for transitioning from node j to d and h is the heaviside function defined as 1 if there exist a path where both change cost and time for the node transition are below the thresholds and 0 else thus we only count end state changeability in this particular case however the metric can easily be altered to counting the number of change paths between states if that is more relevant for the analysis counting end states enables easy analysis of the space of possible reconfigurations while counting paths is a more complex measure that enables detailed analyses of the state transitions i e analyses of the change mechanisms counting paths can be relevant for e g equipment slot modularization or steel reinforcement analyses on an offshore ship this level of fidelity remains outside the scope of this paper and thus we proceed to count end states the filtered outdegree allows an understanding of which real options in the design that should be evaluated the measure can also be adapted by fixing certain design variables that can constitute integral to a platform design 3 methodology to investigate tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility of offshore vessels we follow a stepwise procedure as outlined in fig 3 the first three steps comprise the initial part where the problem is outlined this involves defining the multi attribute utility function characterizing the design space and developing a model of the system to be able to evaluate the performance of a design it is necessary to connect the multi attribute utility function with the possible design alternatives in a system model depending on the chosen approach for design characterization it is important to screen alternatives to make sure they are physically viable the latter three steps comprise the analysis part first to get an overall understanding of the model a tradespace should be developed and explored for model verification purposes one can benchmark against ships that are built to see their modelled performance a separation is made between ships without equipment i e platforms and with equipment as we are interested in analyzing the retrofit flexibility of the platforms to investigate the impact of cost we reduce the tradespace and extract cost efficient solutions by use of a fuzzy pareto filter on the tradeoff between flexibility and cost this reduces the set of designs to analyze simplifying the problem last we investigate the tradeoffs between various performance attributes and flexibility for these cost efficient designs 4 case study this case study uses the multi attribute tradespace network theories to generate insights into the design of reconfigurable offshore ships the design of offshore construction vessels has been chosen due to the spatial complexity of the design space the heterogeneity of the markets in which they operate and the ambiguities in perceived ability to generate value this case study presented builds on material in rehn et al 2016 4 1 define multi attribute utility function 4 1 1 offshore ship generalized performance attributes when assessing the performance of an offshore ship the question what is a better ship must be explored benford 1970 ulstein and brett 2015 first when considering commercial systems it is reasonable to argue that a good ship is a profitable ship the ability to generate profits depends on the market situation and is not easy to untangle in terms of describing individual system substructures contributing to profitability from a technical point of view we can still identify a few generalized performance attributes defining valuable systems for example in the consumer car industry disregarding the price generalized attributes that define a good car include comfort driving capabilities such as traction and acceleration transportation capacity in terms of people and luggage eco friendliness aesthetics and safety if all these are met we have a good car however as one may find these attributes eventually meet a physical tradeoff either you get a sports car or you get an suv further not to mention that increasing attributes together quickly increases the price of the car for offshore ships we can follow the same analogy a ship designer is interested in developing designs that can be sold to their potential customers the ship owners what is desired of an offshore ship is the ability to meet the customer requirements to drive profitability we propose three generalized technical performance attributes that are assumed to serve as proxies for profitability and thus define a better ship as presented in table 1 however even when disregarding costs bigger is not always better for example issues with external physical constraints may occur such as maximum lengths at ports and canals in addition to these three performance attributes several others may be defined such as safety and reliability papanikolaou 2009 these are more difficult to quantify at the conceptual design level and were hence not included in this analysis in general it is important not to span too many attributes as short term memory limits the number of attributes to seven plus minus two miller 1956 further the proposed performance characteristics are physical descriptive measures that are important for most ship concepts these attributes must not be confused with the ilities such as flexibility and adaptability which are system characteristics on the lifecycle level these enter the discussion when we consider the filtered outdegree in later parts of the analysis 4 1 2 multi attribute utility mau function the multi attribute utility mau function for offshore construction vessels is decomposed into a set of three single attribute utility functions connected to the three aspects of performance capability capacity and operability the structure of the utility function is shown in fig 4 for simplicity the utility function is assumed a linear weighted sum as presented in equation 1 with equal weights however other representations of value are possible the hierarchy in fig 4 represents a generalized set of performance attributes for offshore construction and well intervention vessels and does not necessarily represent the multi attribute utility function of a particular industry actor the single attribute utility functions for capability and capacity are easily estimated as these are decomposable to descriptive elements of the ship topside equipment types and size measures the single attribute utility for operability is decomposed into further performance attributes based on hydrodynamic characteristics which map onto ship concepts through the knowledge base of naval architects 4 2 characterize the design space 4 2 1 generating feasible designs a set of designs is enumerated on basis of design variables that are related both to the main dimensions of the ship and to the systems installed on board the six design variables that provide description of the design alternatives are provided in table 2 only design alternatives that adhere to some basic constraints on physical feasibility in naval architecture are enumerated ship concepts need to comply with stability freeboard and structural integrity criteria stability is incorporated based in the requirement of that initial metacentric height g m must exceed a minimum required g m m i n 0 15 m the freeboard f must exceed a minimum required f m i n 1 5 m a model that ensures structural integrity in the hull is included to prevent unreasonably slender ships a simplified structural model is assumed and the maximal material stress allowed is σ m a x 220 m p a for an assumed maximum bending moment condition including a safety factor in addition we require that if well intervention tower is installed a moonpool is required initial design space enumerates to 16800 designs which reduces to 5803 after the physical compatibility screening 4 2 2 parametric assessment for ship properties the analysis relies on various physical parameters which are given in table 3 assumed parameters for the properties of the equipment that can be installed on the vessel are given in table 4 the ship platform represents the ship without equipment the acquisition cost c s h i p for the ship is calculated using equation 5 by adding two cost elements the cost of the ship without equipment and the cost of the equipment the scaling constant k c o s t represents the cost per metric tonnes of the ship without equipment and is given in table 3 c e q u i p e is the cost of including equipment e in the set e of possible equipment types that can be installed on the ship 5 c s h i p k c o s t w l s e e c e q u i p e the lightweight of the platform ship w l s is given in equation 6 k l s is a scaling constant given in table 3 6 w l s k l s l b d 4 3 develop system model performance attributes representing the single attribute utility functions are defined on a 0 to 1 scale where 1 is the best and 0 is the worst for every performance attribute the individual subcomponents are included using a linear weighted sum as shown in equation 1 the defined ranges for the individual performance subcomponents are given in table 5 4 3 1 capability capability is based on the equipment installed on the vessel and is for simplicity assumed a linear combination of crane lifting capacity and well intervention tower lifting capacity no additional calculations are needed since the capability can be estimated directly from the design description and connects to the utility function as shown in table 5 4 3 2 capacity the deck area a d e c k for a design is estimated by equation 7 the scaling constant k d a is given in table 3 a e q u i p e is the area that equipment e in the set e of possible equipment types takes up on deck in other words we care about the free deck area in accordance with table 5 the deck area should be maximized 7 a d e c k k d a l b e e a e q u i p e the deadweight d w t of a design is estimated by equation 8 δ m a x is the maximum weight displacement of the ship defined by the main dimensions maximum freeboard block coefficient and water density w e q u i p e is the weight of equipment e on deck in the set e given in table 4 and w l s is the lightweight of the platform ship given by equation 6 8 d w t δ m a x e e w e q u i p e w l s 4 3 3 operability offshore ships should be operable in rough seas hence the hydrodynamic ship response in waves is simplified and estimated the heave response is determined from the main ship characteristics in sea states described by a bretschneider wave spectrum to simplify only the translational vertical response is considered the ship is modelled as a damped mass spring system including added mass from water faltinsen 1990 the excitation force in the vertical direction is the sum of the froude krylov force and the diffraction forces added mass is represented by 2d strip theory assuming the ship as a simplified box shape we obtain equation 9 describing the transfer function for heave response h 3 ω 9 h 3 ω x ζ a 2 k sin k l 2 ρ b g e k z b o t t o m ω 2 a 33 2 d e k z m i d d l e c 33 m a 33 ω 2 2 b 33 ω 2 here m is the ship mass a 33 is the added mass b 33 is the damping coefficient and c 33 is the spring constant ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration ζ a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency and k is the wave number l and b refer to the length and beam of the ship s ω is the bretschneider wave spectrum maximization of operability implies minimization of the heave variance σ 2 obtained by integrating the heave response spectrum as shown in equation 10 10 σ 2 0 h 3 ω 2 s ω d ω when it comes to roll and pitch movement it is reasonable to desire a high period as slow vessel accelerations are assumed beneficial for operations the estimates for the pitch and roll period are given in equation 11 11 t i 2 π k g i g g m i here i represents the degree of freedom either 4 for roll or 5 for pitch k g i is the radius of gyration and g m i is the initial metacentric height under the objective of maximizing operability we further seek to minimize the total ship resistance shown in equation 12 12 r t o t 1 2 ρ v 2 a c t o t where v is the speed of the ship and c t o t is the total resistance number the wet surface area a is estimated using equation 13 13 a a l where a is a constant assumed to be 2 6 is the volume displacement of the vessel estimated as c b l b t where c b is the block coefficient and l b and t refer to the length beam and draft of the ship the non dimensional total resistance number is assumed to follow the relation in equation 14 in which f n is the froude number given by f n v g l assuming a constant design speed of 15 knots 14 c t o t 3 99 f n 5 59 0 00206 to account for the vessel being equipped with a moonpool the resistance is assumed to increase by 10 keep in mind the potential inaccuracy of the above mentioned estimations may not be that of an issue as they are included for enabling comparisons between the alternative vessel concepts and not for absolute estimations 4 4 develop and explore tradespace a design space of 5803 alternative designs is generated and analyzed these designs include ship platforms both with and without equipment installed the corresponding tradespace is shown in fig 5 where each point represents a design alternative the designs that are on the pareto frontier are highlighted as are the designs that are within the 3 fuzziness pareto set five existing offshore construction vessels in the industry are included in fig 5 to benchmark and validate the model detailed information about these vessels is given in table 6 where cost mau and performance attributes are estimated by the model two of these vessels are previous winners of the award for the norwegian ship of the year note that the results for these five vessels only reflect their value to the hypothetical ship owner in the case and are not indicative of their value to their actual owners in terms of profitability in table 7 the details of four pareto efficient 0 fuzziness designs identified from fig 5 are shown including the design variables performance attributes mau and acquisition cost these designs are selected based on their spread along the pareto front as can be seen on the increasing cost and mau values we look at these designs to better understand our model and the tradespace findings are discussed in chapter 5 4 5 extract cost efficient flexible platforms the most significant retrofit cost drivers are changes in the main dimensions of the ship that is changing the size of the ship platform we therefore fix platform parameters length beam depth and moonpool and only investigate change of equipment on deck crane and tower this enables a more meaningful comparison between platforms since they are similar in the functional space this reduces the platform design space to 640 alternatives the 5 fuzzy pareto optimal designs in the tradeoff between filtered outdegree fod and acquisition cost reduces the size of the set of platform designs from 640 to 158 these are the most cost effective flexible platforms available at a given cost these 158 platform designs are plotted in a tradespace in fig 6 where we can see the tradeoffs between platform flexibility as measured by fod acquisition cost and multi attribute utility the threshold cost and time for the calculation of fod are in this case manipulated so that it only enables retrofit of equipment and not of the platform which enables us to analyze physical aspects of retrofit feasibility table 8 presents more detailed information of interesting pareto optimal platforms in fig 6 the platforms analyzed do not have any equipment hence their capability levels are zero indicated with a these can obviously be changed in the events of adding equipment which is what we analyze here the maximum filtered outdegree for a platform in this analysis is 23 which represents being able to take all potential equipment configuration states as predefined in the tradespace network model 4 6 investigating tradeoffs between performance attributes and flexibility being on the fuzzy pareto front in the tradeoff between filtered outdegree and acquisition cost is preferable to enable maximum potential retrofit upside at the minimal initial cost fig 7 untangles the multi attribute utility measure of the designs plotted in fig 6 to enable further investigation of the implications of platform flexibility on capacity and operability fig 7 illustrates single utility attribute values for the platforms as a function of the level of flexibility quantified by the fod metric there is a relatively clear correlation between capacity and flexibility however operability seems to have a more complex relationship with flexibility and hence it is of interest to investigate operability vs flexibility further to its individual sub attributes fig 8 plots fod against roll heave response resistance and pitch flexible platforms with high operational performance at low cost are of interest to identify and understand three selected platforms at this complex pareto front are given in table 9 with best individual single subcomponent operability levels we can see that these designs are significantly different supporting the hypothesis of that conflicting objectives must be traded off against each other i e no solution is best at all performance metrics at the same time 5 discussion pareto optimal results in table 7 represent the offshore ships that give the highest performance for the lowest cost in the tradespace plotted in fig 5 design 2636 in table 4 is closest to utopia this design is long and slender has a large crane installed and a low acquisition cost compared to ships in the industry today this ship has a high length to beam ration of 9 3 it could be interesting to investigate further why this is not found in the market today it is just a modelling oversimplification or a so far unexplored opportunity this points to the need for an iterative analysis process where we for example can revisit the assumption of equal single attribute weights further the physical compatibility models in this analysis for structural integrity and stability are very simple and high fidelity analyses should be used to further investigate the potential use for such a design for deeper insights in the model and results fig 5 also includes five real offshore ships of which two are previous winners of the award for norwegian ship of the year these ships are mainly included for model validation purposes but it also allows us to investigate differences between them information about cost technical performance and design variables for these are estimated by the model and given in table 6 akofs seafarer is the only of the four designs that is pareto optimal based on our model island constructor represent a first generation light well intervention lwi vessel and has substantially lower technical performance compared to the other ships in table 6 we do not aim to criticize any of the designs and recognize that our model may be flawed to give wrong estimates our estimation approach is though transparent as presented in the paper and the results follow directly from this our goal with the comparisons is to provide insight to improve decision making in offshore ship design in fig 6 we can see the tradeoff between platform flexibility measured in filtered outdegree and platform multi attribute utility and acquisition cost if a platform is supposed to handle crane and tower retrofits extra stability and deck area is needed which comes at a cost we are therefore interested in identifying the most flexible designs at the lowest cost a key characteristic of the most cost effective flexible maritime platforms presented in table 8 is the non slenderness of these designs they are wide and short indicating that cheap flexibility compromises operability fig 7 illustrates the relationships between the individual performance attributes and flexibility we can see that in terms of capacity we have a positive correlation with flexibility this is intuitive as a larger platform can take on more equipment retrofits and has a larger deck area and deadweight which increases the capacity however the relationship between operability and flexibility is more ambiguous as shown in fig 8 we observe that all 158 prescreened cost effective flexible platform designs perform poor in terms of rolling these designs have low roll periods 10s contributing to unfavorably high accelerations further fig 8 shows that a compromise must be made between resistance and flexibility as excess stability deadweight and deck area are needed for a high fod the heave response and pitch still have an ambiguous relationship with flexibility as they seem relatively independent from fod for the 158 prescreened cost effective flexible designs however all have relatively undesirable roll periods for heave motion however good dynamic behavior should be able to be achieved independently of the degree of flexibility table 9 presents three interesting platform designs at low cost which have one highest individual subcomponent operability attribute while still being able to take on all possible types of equipment fod 23 the fact that these three designs are significantly different supports our conclusion that operability is a complex performance attribute with conflicting sub attributes to decide which platform design that is better one needs to determine what is more important to be able to find a compromised optimal solution this ties back to our comment in the introduction about the difference between valuation of changeability and quantification of changeability level the former will aid in determining what to do while we focus on the latter in this paper thus attempts at deciding the best tradeoff between the conflicting objectives remains outside the objectives of this paper these results leave us with some insight about the properties of flexible offshore ship platforms multiple compromises must be made in the design between enabling reconfigurations through excessive platform size and stability roll period and resistance ship slenderness is a critical factor that must be traded against flexibility when designing offshore ship platforms with reconfigurable topsides we have shown how tradespace exploration lets us study the trade offs between utility and costs however the single attribute utility weights in the model are assumed constant by considering explicitly what happens when the system context or stakeholder needs change in an epoch era analysis ross and rhodes 2008 strategies could be elaborated for exercising specific reconfiguration opportunities the tradespace network using filtered outdegree to quantify the level of flexibility can thus lead us to designs providing promising redesign alternatives in the dynamic setting however outdegree is only one measure of centrality in network theory further insight can be obtained by exploring other measures of centrality such as betweenness and closeness curry et al 2017 briefly include some other metrics of centrality in their tradespace analysis nevertheless we demonstrate that filtered outdegree represents a good measure for quantifying the level of flexibility for offshore ship platforms in terms of flexible platform analysis it could be interesting to further investigate sensitivities in terms of the design variables of the platform for the ships in this analysis this involves the length beam depth and moonpool however it is important to realize that it is also possible to change the platform with for example elongation knight and singer 2012 and moonpool readiness while the design study presented in this paper has taken a parametric approach other methods researched in the maritime literature could provide valuable for flexibility analyses these include using design building blocks andrews 2012 packing approach van oers 2011 or optimization of modular adaptable designs choi and erikstad 2017 with such higher fidelity design methods involving the internals of the ship one can potentially approach the operability concerns from for the flexible ships from new angles which can offset the unfavorable aspects identified from the simple approach presented in this paper 6 conclusion this paper investigates tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility of offshore ship platforms for measuring technical performance a generalized maritime model is defined based on capability capacity and operability a tradespace representation is used to explore the design space and to define the tradespace network that enables the quantification of flexibility level by use of filtered outdegree two main conclusions can be drawn from this work first we conclude that tradespace exploration methods and filtered outdegree are good methods to understand the design space and investigate tradeoffs between performance cost and flexibility it is particularly helpful to see which aspects of technical performance are affected by increasing the level of flexibility the second conclusion is regarding the insights gained from analyzing the flexible ship platforms with these methods flexible platforms are characterized by having excess stability deadweight and deck area to take on equipment retrofits increased platform flexibility does increase capacity but comes at a complex compromise with operability as resistance is increased and roll periods become unfavorable due to high accelerations although this latter conclusion may seem obvious from an experienced naval architect s point of view it is still beneficial to systematically quantify these tradeoffs with the aim of designing better ships under uncertainty 
23747,the present study deals with numerical investigation of a semi active flapping foil of which the kinematics is characterized by an imposed heave motion and a free pitch motion a torsion spring is attached to the foil and acts to restore the foil parallel to the advance velocity the prescribed flapping foil has been simulated using a boundary element method in combination with a newton euler solver in order to study the influence of flapping frequency and spring stiffness on the propulsive performance the spring stiffness has strong influence on the induced pitch angle and the effective angle of attack which consequently determines the openwater characteristics the stiff spring resists the foil from pitching resulting in high heave force while the more elastic hinge leads to drag generation at the end of each stroke the results demonstrate that the semi active flapping foil attached to an appropriate torsion spring performs efficiently over a wide range of advance ratio like a controllable pitch propeller the best efficiency is found for a strouhal number and a pitch amplitude as reported in biological researches the numerical results also imply that the resonance seems to have less influence on the propulsive performance keywords self pitching biomimetics bem fluid structure interaction openwater characteristics 1 introduction marine vessels mainly spend their time operating at nearly constant speed therefore the steady propulsion conditions are generally optimized for efficiency this type of vessels is usually equipped with a fixed pitch propeller optimized for a certain speed and load however some types of vessels may operate within a wide range of load or resistance e g fishing boats with purse seine or trawl basically fishing operation comprises of two main activities sailing and trawling resulting in at least two different resistance curves notti and sala 2012 this kind of operating vessel requires a controllable or a variable pitch propeller to maintain its optimal operating condition since this type of propeller is efficient for wide ranges of speed and load however a variable pitch propeller is costly complicated and frail compared to a fixed pitch propeller hence seemingly unaffordable for fishing boats as a result the propulsion system of a fishing boat typically consists of a diesel engine and a fixed pitch propeller which delivers its best efficiency only at a specific condition this leads to a drastic decrease of propulsive efficiency when operating at other different conditions mimicking aquatic animal fin or tail kinematics is potentially one of the most interesting concepts to improve the performance of ships and underwater vessels especially ships with large variable loads this is because the bio inspired flapping foil is naturally equivalent to variable pitch propulsion system floc h et al 2012 in addition cavitation characteristics of flapping foil propulsors is said to be more acceptable than that of conventional propellers rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 therefore the use of flapping foil can be an alternative choice for propulsion system the evolution of our understanding on flapping foil mechanism has progressed over decades through a combination of observations experiments and numerical simulations since 1970s a large number of works have been performed to study unsteady mechanisms of oscillating foil used for propulsion scherer 1968 lighthill 1970 wu 1971 webb 1975 grebeshov and sagoyan 1976 archer et al 1979 morikawa and isshiki 1980 several studies based on observation from the natural world bose et al 1990 fish 1998 taylor et al 2003 have concluded that the operating conditions of aquatic animals are within a certain parametric range using the heave amplitude as the reference lengths the strouhal number is reported between 0 2 and 0 4 whereas the pitch amplitude is found between 20 and 40 the operating conditions of flapping fins wings or tails have been confirmed by theoretical analysis eloy 2012 experimental studies triantafyllou et al 1993 anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 schouveiler et al 2005 and numerical investigations using different methods e g bem floc h et al 2012 politis and tsarsitalidis 2009 or ranse thaweewat et al 2009 mostly both the heave and the pitch motions are prescribed by simple harmonic functions which are useful in parametric space studies despite the model simplicity the results are in satisfactory agreement with the comparable observations particularly the regimes of operation closed to the observed parametric ranges give the optimal performance unsurprisingly this implies that aquatic animals have evolved toward hydrodynamic optimization a small number of works have been performed for comparison between the performance of flapping foil propulsor and a conventional marine propeller since the parameterization of both devices are different the hydrodynamic performance of a conventional propeller is traditionally presented in functions of advance ratio which is the ratio between the translational distance the propeller moves forward during one revolution and the propeller diameter whereas that of flapping propulsor is typically expressed in terms of strouhal number nevertheless hoppe 1989 has introduced dimensionless numbers making the comparison unbiased and has concluded that the efficiencies of both devices are approximately on par however a comparison on propulsive efficiency between oscillating cetacean flukes and a conventional propeller fish and lauder 2006 has showed that the former is superior this is likely due to the fluke elasticity another numerical investigation based on bem simulations floc h et al 2012 has introduced a comparison between the two regimes it has been concluded that the bio inspired propulsive foil can be used as a propulsion system since its efficiency is comparable to that of an efficient propeller in openwater the study has also reminded the disadvantages of the flapping foil e g strong forces fluctuation and mechanical complication since the motion is prescribed with two degrees of freedom heaving and pitching the former disadvantage can be avoided by operating several foils at different phase while the latter disadvantage could be alleviated by the use of semi active flapping foil murray and howle 2003 this results in a simple one actuator input which is less complicated compared to a two actuator system however the study murray and howle 2003 is questionable since the foil is actively actuated in the pitching direction and therefore passively driven in heaving direction which is the kinematics used for energy harvesting deng et al 2015 teng et al 2016 a flapping foil used for energy extraction generally gives drag instead of propulsive thrust the mechanism of semi active flapping foil has also been aerodynamically investigated in insect flight different aerodynamic tools bem and ranse used to simulate unsteady flow around insect flapping wing have shown good agreement willis et al 2008 in order to efficiently generate thrust it is recommended to maintain attached flow in flapping kinematics to minimize separation effects and kinetic energy lost to the surrounding fluid willis et al 2007 however the influence of torsion spring attached to the foil has not been studied and discussed in detail in addition the spring coefficient used in these studies is not non dimensionalized while investigations in fluid dynamics commonly use dimensionless variables since matching the dimensionless numbers is a key to achieve validity and similarity of simulations in ship design the hydrodynamic properties of propulsive devices i e the openwater characteristics are necessary for optimizing the propulsion system however few works have been done to provide such data of flapping foil propulsors the objective of the present research is to hydrodynamically study the propulsive characteristics of semi active flapping foil and to provide the necessary hydrodynamic information of such propulsion system particularly the influence of the torsion spring stiffness on propulsive performance will be investigated furthermore the openwater characteristics of the foil will be presented in functions of advance ratio similarly to that of conventional marine propeller in order to be able to compare the both systems 2 principles of semi active flapping propulsion in the present study a foil with naca0012 profile section is attached to a torsion spring allowing the pitch motion of the foil as illustrated in fig 1 the torsion spring is used to restore the foil toward the horizontal plane the foil is subjected to move horizontally with a constant advance velocity u and to heave vertically with a simple harmonic function h h 0 sin 2 π f t at its pivot point consequently the sinusoidal heave motion together with the advance velocity creates an oscillating hydrodynamic force and moment causing the foil to pitch in addition the foil is not allowed to move in any other degrees of freedom 2 1 flapping parameterization the flow around the flapping foil and the foil kinematics can be characterized by dimensionless parameters the dimensional analysis enables a systematic investigation of the influence of different foil kinematic parameters on the openwater performance the main dimensional variables are the flapping frequency f the heave amplitude h 0 the advance velocity u the foil geometry span b and chord c the fluid density ρ the foil moment of inertia i the torsion spring stiffness k and the location of pitching axis measured from foil leading edge d however it should be pointed out that the influence of inertial mass in heaving direction is not taken into account since the foil motion is directly imposed by applying the buckingham theorem the openwater characteristics such as the efficiency η can be defined as a function of dimensionless parameters 1 η ϕ u c f h 0 c b c d c i ρ c 5 k ρ f 2 c 5 or 2 η ϕ ˆ λ h λ d i k where the dimensionless heave amplitude h h 0 c the wing aspect ratio λ b c and the dimensionless pivot location d d c are the dimensionless parameters concerning foil geometry and length the dimensionless wavelength λ u c f is the essential dimensionless parameter that characterizes the inflow and unsteady conditions this parameter can be represented as the advance number j u n d for propeller study and also as the inverse of strouhal number s t 2 h 0 f u as schematically illustrated in fig 2 the figure also shows the definition of effective angle of attack α which is an angle between the chord line and the incident velocity i e the advance velocity in combination with the heave velocity in addition the inertia ratio i can be rewritten as i i i w where i w is moment of inertia of fluid volume displaced by the foil around the pitching axis the last parameter in eq 2 is the non dimensional spring coefficient which can be reformed as 3 k k 1 2 ρ u 2 a c where k is the spring coefficient non dimensionalized based on advance velocity and a b c is the wing planform area the non dimensional spring coefficient can be alternatively defined as 4 r 2 π i f 2 k f f n where r is the spring coefficient non dimensionalized based on frequency namely force to natural frequency ratio i is the foil moment of inertia and f n is the natural frequency of the foil in order to investigate the influence of spring stiffness on the propulsive performance the flapping foil parameters are defined as follow the foil is a rectangular wing of 5 m span and 1 m chord giving λ 5 the dimensionless heave amplitude is fixed as h 2 0 the pitching axis is located at the leading edge d 0 in order to ensure the foil orientation always facing against the inflow velocity since the center of hydrodynamic force is approximately at the quarter chord point the center of mass is also located at the pitching axis the inertia ratio are fixed as i 10 subsequently the effect of added mass is less relevant since the surrounding fluid is significantly less dense compared to the foil la mantia and dabnichki 2012 2 2 flapping foil performance the propulsive efficiency of flapping foil is the ratio between the average thrust power p t and the power required to drive the foil over a flapping period p req 5 η p t p req where 6 p t u t t t t x d t and 7 p req 1 t t t t y h d t where u represents the advance velocity t 1 f is the flapping period x is the resultant hydrodynamic force in forward direction or in other word the thrust force y is the force required to generate the heave motion and h is the translational velocity of the foil in the stroke plane i e the heave velocity similar to the thrust coefficient of screw propeller the thrust coefficient k t and the heave force coefficient k h of flapping foil can be defined respectively as 8 k t x ρ f 2 d eq 4 and 9 k h y max ρ f 2 d eq 4 where x is the average thrust and y max is the maximum heave force in a flapping period in order to compare hydrodynamic performance of the flapping foil with an efficient marine propeller a transition method between the two systems is introduced following floc h et al 2012 the two different propulsive systems are comparable when their obstruction areas are equivalent hoppe 1989 since the openwater characteristics of marine propeller is traditionally presented as a function of advance number j u n d where n is the rotation speed in revolutions per second and d is the propeller diameter an equivalent diameter of the foil has to be defined on the basis of similar obstruction area d eq 8 h 0 b π consequently the hydrodynamic performance of the flapping foil can be expressed as a function of equivalent advance number j eq u f d eq 3 numerical tool the numerical tool used to simulate the semi active flapping foil in this study consists of two models the hydrodynamic and the dynamic models the hydrodynamic model uses the foil motion as its input to determine the hydrodynamic force and moment as for the dynamic model the hydrodynamic force and moment from the hydrodynamic model are applied in the newton euler equation to determine the foil motion 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is an unsteady potential flow code more precisely a boundary element method bem solver the code has been validated many times floc h et al 2012 laurens and grosjean 2002 phoemsapthawee et al 2009 2013 in this code the foil surface and the wake sheet developed behind the foil are discretized into first order panels each panel on the foil surface carries constant source σ and doublet μ distributions while each wake panel carries only a constant doublet distribution the wake sheet geometry is generated in a lagrangian manner that is when a time step is advanced instead of relocating the foil position the wake sheet panels are projected with the foil translation and rotation as well as induced velocities the doublet distributions are also shaded with the projected panels as illustrate in fig 3 as a consequence new wake panels are formed to fill the space between the foil trailing edge and the projected wake sheet an example of wake panels shading downstream of the foil is presented in fig 4 the strengths of source distributions on the foil surface are determined directly corresponding to the zero normal flow condition v n ˆ 0 whereas the strengths of doublet distributions on both surface and wake panels are determined from the zero normal flow in combination with the kutta condition i e no pressure jump on the trailing edge panels the time dependence in the unsteady potential code is captured by the wake history and the unsteady bernoulli equation the first order backward finite difference is employed in the unsteady bernoulli equation calculation although the flow is considered inviscid the friction force is taken into account by the mean of friction coefficient c f this coefficient is defined as a function of the local reynolds number r e s v s s 0 ν where v is the local velocity s s 0 is curvilinear distance from the location of stagnation point and ν is the kinematic viscosity for r e s 5 10 5 the flow is theoretically supposed to be laminar and c f 0 664 r e s which is the blasius solution for higher reynolds number the flow is supposed to be turbulent and c f 0 027 r e s 7 which is the prandtl turbulent skin friction 3 2 dynamic model a solver of the 6 dof equations of motion phoemsapthawee et al 2013 is modified to simulate the semi active flapping foil however in this study only the pitch motion is calculated by solving the newton euler equations the positions and the velocities of the other motion are imposed the hydrodynamic moment together with the torsion spring moment is applied as an external moment to determine the pitch angle and the angular velocity of the foil the diagram of simulation scheme is illustrated in fig 5 starting from the initial conditions e g hydrodynamic forces as well as positions and velocities the newton euler equations are used to determine the new positions and velocities using the fourth order runge kutta method rk4 since the calculation is performed in body reference frame the fictitious forces f fic have to be added to the equations of motion as 10 m x f ext f fic where m is inertia matrix and x is a vector of the variables describing the motion the external forces considered in this simulation are the hydrodynamic force and the spring force 11 f ext f hydro f spring although the effects of added inertia have been already taken into account in the bem code a numerical stability term based on artificial inertia is added to both sides of eq 10 in order to reduce numerical error and instability as 12 m m a x t f ext f fic m a x t 1 where m a is the estimated added inertia matrix with respect to the body reference frame and t is the time step number the error reduction and stability have been studied and discussed in floc h et al 2008 that the stability term is needed when the foil oscillates in relatively dense fluid since the inertia ratio is fixed as i 10 the numerical stability term is not necessary in the present study and is set to null during the runge kutta iteration steps the hydrodynamic forces are treated as a time independence since the potential flow code does not allow the calculation within the runge kutta iteration steps once the new positions and velocities are obtained the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using the bem code after the hydrodynamic forces are updated the newton euler equations are recalculated for the advanced time step the simulation continues in this manner until the it meets the stopping criteria 4 results and discussions in the present study the foil is discretized into 20 panels in spanwise direction and 80 panels around foil perimeter this set of 1 600 panels is used to model the foil since each wake panel length depends on flapping kinematics and time step size the number of wake panels developing behind the foil is varied to ensure that the total wake length is at least 5 times the chord length the time step is constant and each oscillating period has 200 time steps the simulations are monitored for at least 5 periods to obtain solutions in case of aperiodic solution the simulation is further monitored until a periodic solution is obtained the results presented in this article are obtained from the last 2 periods of simulations 4 1 validation of numerical tool in spite of many validations mentioned in the last section it would be better to validate the numerical tool again for this study since the 6 dof code has been modified to allow simulations of both imposed and free motions imposed heave and free pitch simultaneously in order to validate the employed unsteady potential flow code a commercial cfd solver xflow 2016 based on lattice boltzmann method lbm is used to simulate the flow around the semi active flapping foil for the considered range of advance number this unsteady viscous solver provides a fully lagrangian particle based kinetic approach and has characteristics of wall modeled large eddy simulation wmles which is applied for turbulence closure and near wall treatment the governing equation is the discrete boltzmann equation for viscous incompressible three dimensional flow in combination with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision model the adaptive refinement is applied in the vicinity of both foil and wake giving lattice node size of c 32 where c is the chord length a time step size of t 400 is used for the lbm simulations which is considered sufficiently to capture the flow physics the numerical results corresponding to a finer time step of t 800 nearly coincide with that of the t 400 case whilst the results corresponding to the time step of t 200 slightly deviate from the others the comparison of thrust and heave force coefficients obtained from the employed bem code and the lbm solver are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that results of the two different numerical tools show good trend agreement despite noticeable deviation at small equivalent advance numbers the reliability of numerical results at small advance number will be discussed in the following section although the computational time is optimized for the two methods the lbm takes approximately 10 20 times longer than the bem to obtain a periodic result the fact that bem consumes low computational resources while providing acceptable results especially for lifting problems makes simulations practical on a normal personal computer moreover the bem provides simplicity to study the lifting geometry since meshing is required for the body and wake surfaces but not the fluid volume 4 2 performance of semi active flapping foil a comparison between different kinematics of flapping propulsors is presented in fig 7 where the propulsive efficiency η are plotted as functions of the equivalent advance number j eq in comparison with numerical results of the fully imposed flapping propulsors phoemsapthawee 2017 in which the heave and the pitch motions are prescribed by harmonic functions the semi active flapping foil in combination with a proper torsion spring k 0 3 performs efficiently η 80 over a wider range of advance ratio it can be seen that the efficiency curve of such semi active propulsor tends to connect the peaks of each efficiency curve of the fully imposed kinematics with different pitch amplitudes the propulsive performance of semi active flapping propulsor is similar to that of a variable pitch propeller as presented by floc h et al 2012 it should be noted that the maximum propulsive efficiency of the semi active flapping foil can be over 87 examples of pressure distribution around the foil over a flapping period corresponding to condition of the maximum efficiency are presented in fig 8 and expressed in dimensionless form as a pressure coefficient 13 c p p p 1 2 ρ u 2 h 2 where p is the pressure at the point of which pressure coefficient is calculated and p is the pressure in the freestream since the foil operates dynamically symmetric across the horizontal plane the pressure distributions in down stroke fig 8 left column are opposite to that in up stroke fig 8 right column respectively contours of propulsive efficiency along with the maximum angle of attack plotted as functions of j eq and k are presented in fig 9 a for small equivalent advance numbers the kinematic conditions result in effective angle of attack greater than static stall angle this might affect the reliability of the numerical results since the bem code is reliable when there is no flow separation however it has been reported that the time dependent motion of the foil could delay the flow separation to higher incidences compared to its normal static stall case the stall could be delayed to effective angle of attack approximately 20 to 25 depending on foil kinematics akbari and price 2003 the thrust and the heave force coefficients are also plotted as functions of equivalent advance number j eq and torsion spring coefficient k in fig 9b for the sake of ship propulsion design such information is necessary for matching a propulsor to a ship as well as for optimizing the prime mover power the pitch motion of semi active flapping foil is passively adjusted by hydrodynamic force as a result the pitch amplitude as well as the phase difference between the heave and the pitch motions is found to depend on both the advance ratio and the spring stiffness as shown in fig 9c in contrast to the fully imposed flapping foil of which the optimal efficiency occurred with a phase difference around 90 read et al 2003 pedro et al 2003 the semi active propulsor gives the best performance when the pitch motion leads the heave motion by a phase angle noticeably less than that of the fully prescribed propulsor which is around 65 70 in addition it can be seen that the stiffer spring and the higher advance ratio give a smaller pitch angle amplitude and a higher phase shift in order to compare the simulation results with observations of the aquatic world the propulsive efficiency together with the pitch amplitude are represented in fig 10 as a function of strouhal number s t as already mentioned in introduction observations from the natural world bose et al 1990 fish 1998 taylor et al 2003 indicate that aquatic animals flap their fins or tails with a strouhal number between 0 2 and 0 4 and a pitch amplitude between 20 and 40 fig 10 shows that the optimum efficiency of the semi active flapping foil takes place within the same range for both the strouhal number and the pitch amplitude it is also interesting to investigate the influence of resonance by representing the results as a function of equivalent advance ratio j eq and frequency ratio r as shown in fig 11 note that the high value of r represents small spring stiffness as indicated by eq 4 the optimal performance is obtained at frequency ratio about r 0 5 which lies outside resonance bandwidth this consequently implies that resonance is seemingly less relevant to the performance of the semi active flapping propulsor 4 3 influence of torsion spring stiffness fig 9a also shows that for relatively soft spring e g k 0 2 the flapping foil performance noticeably decreases when the equivalent advance ratio deviates from its optimal point this is because the effective angle of attack which directly determines the hydrodynamic force is more sensitive to the changes in advance ratio for relatively tough spring e g k 0 3 the effective angle of attack is less sensitive to the changes in advance ratio hence the foil could still performs within proximity of its best efficiency for wider range of advance ratio in order to demonstrate the semi active flapping foil mechanism time histories of pitch angle effective angle of attack thrust and heave forces over a flapping period are presented in fig 12 for the advance number of 3 17 and different spring stiffness the thrust and heave forces are represented in term of thrust loading and heave loading coefficients c t x 0 5 ρ u 2 b c and c h y 0 5 ρ u 2 b c respectively despite the appearance in fig 12a the response pitch angles are not a sinusoidal function the pitch motion significantly influences on propulsive performance of flapping foil since the pitch angle in combination with the incident velocity determine the effective angle of attack this results in more complicated response of effective angle of attack as shown in fig 12b in case of small spring stiffness k 0 1 the maximum angle of attack takes place slightly after the stroke reversal t t 0 05 or 0 55 since the spring force is not sufficient to bring the foil back to the horizontal plane that is the foil still pitches in the undesired direction at the beginning of a new stroke e g the foil lies nose up at the beginning of down stroke however when spring stiffness is increased the maximum angle of attack tends to occur close to the middle of strokes in either up or down direction this is because the spring strongly resists the foil from pitching and the maximum heave velocity takes place at the middle of strokes it should be noted that the optimum spring stiffness k 0 3 gives the lowest maximum angle of attack as shown in fig 12c the foil attached to a relatively soft spring e g k 0 1 momentarily produces drag instead of thrust at the end of each stroke this is because while the heave velocity is decreased the foil is over pitching due to insufficient spring force when the spring stiffness is increased the foil has more agility to return to the horizontal plane and avoids the temporary drag production however the tougher spring results in stronger heave force and eventually higher required power see fig 12d the optimum condition k 0 3 corresponds to the lowest heave force generation without drag production 5 conclusions and perspectives a potential flow code is used to simulate the flow around a foil attached to a torsion spring the foil heave motion is accurately prescribed by a simple harmonic function whereas the pitch motion is passively induced by the oscillatory hydrodynamic force in comparison with results of unsteady viscous solver the potential flow code appears to simulate the semi active propulsor with satisfactory agreement on force predictions despite 10 20 times less computational expense the results show that the semi active flapping propulsor has its openwater characteristics similar to that of a variable pitch propeller moreover the simulation results demonstrate that the best efficiency of the semi active flapping foil takes place in same range of strouhal number and pitch amplitude as observed in the natural world furthermore the resonance mechanism seems to have less relevant to the propulsive efficiency since the optimal performance is achieved at frequency ratio considerably outside resonance bandwidth a fully prescribed flapping foil propulsion possesses mechanical complication since it requires two actuators to drive both the heave and the pitch motions this drawback could be resolved by the use of semi active flapping foil for which only one actuator is required the semi active propulsion system therefore promises a more feasible approach in practice compared to fully prescribed motions in addition this self pitching propulsor performs efficiently over a wide range of operating conditions which could improve the performance of ships with large variable loads further investigations are recommended in order to study the influence of inertia ratio as well as the heave amplitude on the performance of such self pitching propulsive foil 
23747,the present study deals with numerical investigation of a semi active flapping foil of which the kinematics is characterized by an imposed heave motion and a free pitch motion a torsion spring is attached to the foil and acts to restore the foil parallel to the advance velocity the prescribed flapping foil has been simulated using a boundary element method in combination with a newton euler solver in order to study the influence of flapping frequency and spring stiffness on the propulsive performance the spring stiffness has strong influence on the induced pitch angle and the effective angle of attack which consequently determines the openwater characteristics the stiff spring resists the foil from pitching resulting in high heave force while the more elastic hinge leads to drag generation at the end of each stroke the results demonstrate that the semi active flapping foil attached to an appropriate torsion spring performs efficiently over a wide range of advance ratio like a controllable pitch propeller the best efficiency is found for a strouhal number and a pitch amplitude as reported in biological researches the numerical results also imply that the resonance seems to have less influence on the propulsive performance keywords self pitching biomimetics bem fluid structure interaction openwater characteristics 1 introduction marine vessels mainly spend their time operating at nearly constant speed therefore the steady propulsion conditions are generally optimized for efficiency this type of vessels is usually equipped with a fixed pitch propeller optimized for a certain speed and load however some types of vessels may operate within a wide range of load or resistance e g fishing boats with purse seine or trawl basically fishing operation comprises of two main activities sailing and trawling resulting in at least two different resistance curves notti and sala 2012 this kind of operating vessel requires a controllable or a variable pitch propeller to maintain its optimal operating condition since this type of propeller is efficient for wide ranges of speed and load however a variable pitch propeller is costly complicated and frail compared to a fixed pitch propeller hence seemingly unaffordable for fishing boats as a result the propulsion system of a fishing boat typically consists of a diesel engine and a fixed pitch propeller which delivers its best efficiency only at a specific condition this leads to a drastic decrease of propulsive efficiency when operating at other different conditions mimicking aquatic animal fin or tail kinematics is potentially one of the most interesting concepts to improve the performance of ships and underwater vessels especially ships with large variable loads this is because the bio inspired flapping foil is naturally equivalent to variable pitch propulsion system floc h et al 2012 in addition cavitation characteristics of flapping foil propulsors is said to be more acceptable than that of conventional propellers rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 therefore the use of flapping foil can be an alternative choice for propulsion system the evolution of our understanding on flapping foil mechanism has progressed over decades through a combination of observations experiments and numerical simulations since 1970s a large number of works have been performed to study unsteady mechanisms of oscillating foil used for propulsion scherer 1968 lighthill 1970 wu 1971 webb 1975 grebeshov and sagoyan 1976 archer et al 1979 morikawa and isshiki 1980 several studies based on observation from the natural world bose et al 1990 fish 1998 taylor et al 2003 have concluded that the operating conditions of aquatic animals are within a certain parametric range using the heave amplitude as the reference lengths the strouhal number is reported between 0 2 and 0 4 whereas the pitch amplitude is found between 20 and 40 the operating conditions of flapping fins wings or tails have been confirmed by theoretical analysis eloy 2012 experimental studies triantafyllou et al 1993 anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 schouveiler et al 2005 and numerical investigations using different methods e g bem floc h et al 2012 politis and tsarsitalidis 2009 or ranse thaweewat et al 2009 mostly both the heave and the pitch motions are prescribed by simple harmonic functions which are useful in parametric space studies despite the model simplicity the results are in satisfactory agreement with the comparable observations particularly the regimes of operation closed to the observed parametric ranges give the optimal performance unsurprisingly this implies that aquatic animals have evolved toward hydrodynamic optimization a small number of works have been performed for comparison between the performance of flapping foil propulsor and a conventional marine propeller since the parameterization of both devices are different the hydrodynamic performance of a conventional propeller is traditionally presented in functions of advance ratio which is the ratio between the translational distance the propeller moves forward during one revolution and the propeller diameter whereas that of flapping propulsor is typically expressed in terms of strouhal number nevertheless hoppe 1989 has introduced dimensionless numbers making the comparison unbiased and has concluded that the efficiencies of both devices are approximately on par however a comparison on propulsive efficiency between oscillating cetacean flukes and a conventional propeller fish and lauder 2006 has showed that the former is superior this is likely due to the fluke elasticity another numerical investigation based on bem simulations floc h et al 2012 has introduced a comparison between the two regimes it has been concluded that the bio inspired propulsive foil can be used as a propulsion system since its efficiency is comparable to that of an efficient propeller in openwater the study has also reminded the disadvantages of the flapping foil e g strong forces fluctuation and mechanical complication since the motion is prescribed with two degrees of freedom heaving and pitching the former disadvantage can be avoided by operating several foils at different phase while the latter disadvantage could be alleviated by the use of semi active flapping foil murray and howle 2003 this results in a simple one actuator input which is less complicated compared to a two actuator system however the study murray and howle 2003 is questionable since the foil is actively actuated in the pitching direction and therefore passively driven in heaving direction which is the kinematics used for energy harvesting deng et al 2015 teng et al 2016 a flapping foil used for energy extraction generally gives drag instead of propulsive thrust the mechanism of semi active flapping foil has also been aerodynamically investigated in insect flight different aerodynamic tools bem and ranse used to simulate unsteady flow around insect flapping wing have shown good agreement willis et al 2008 in order to efficiently generate thrust it is recommended to maintain attached flow in flapping kinematics to minimize separation effects and kinetic energy lost to the surrounding fluid willis et al 2007 however the influence of torsion spring attached to the foil has not been studied and discussed in detail in addition the spring coefficient used in these studies is not non dimensionalized while investigations in fluid dynamics commonly use dimensionless variables since matching the dimensionless numbers is a key to achieve validity and similarity of simulations in ship design the hydrodynamic properties of propulsive devices i e the openwater characteristics are necessary for optimizing the propulsion system however few works have been done to provide such data of flapping foil propulsors the objective of the present research is to hydrodynamically study the propulsive characteristics of semi active flapping foil and to provide the necessary hydrodynamic information of such propulsion system particularly the influence of the torsion spring stiffness on propulsive performance will be investigated furthermore the openwater characteristics of the foil will be presented in functions of advance ratio similarly to that of conventional marine propeller in order to be able to compare the both systems 2 principles of semi active flapping propulsion in the present study a foil with naca0012 profile section is attached to a torsion spring allowing the pitch motion of the foil as illustrated in fig 1 the torsion spring is used to restore the foil toward the horizontal plane the foil is subjected to move horizontally with a constant advance velocity u and to heave vertically with a simple harmonic function h h 0 sin 2 π f t at its pivot point consequently the sinusoidal heave motion together with the advance velocity creates an oscillating hydrodynamic force and moment causing the foil to pitch in addition the foil is not allowed to move in any other degrees of freedom 2 1 flapping parameterization the flow around the flapping foil and the foil kinematics can be characterized by dimensionless parameters the dimensional analysis enables a systematic investigation of the influence of different foil kinematic parameters on the openwater performance the main dimensional variables are the flapping frequency f the heave amplitude h 0 the advance velocity u the foil geometry span b and chord c the fluid density ρ the foil moment of inertia i the torsion spring stiffness k and the location of pitching axis measured from foil leading edge d however it should be pointed out that the influence of inertial mass in heaving direction is not taken into account since the foil motion is directly imposed by applying the buckingham theorem the openwater characteristics such as the efficiency η can be defined as a function of dimensionless parameters 1 η ϕ u c f h 0 c b c d c i ρ c 5 k ρ f 2 c 5 or 2 η ϕ ˆ λ h λ d i k where the dimensionless heave amplitude h h 0 c the wing aspect ratio λ b c and the dimensionless pivot location d d c are the dimensionless parameters concerning foil geometry and length the dimensionless wavelength λ u c f is the essential dimensionless parameter that characterizes the inflow and unsteady conditions this parameter can be represented as the advance number j u n d for propeller study and also as the inverse of strouhal number s t 2 h 0 f u as schematically illustrated in fig 2 the figure also shows the definition of effective angle of attack α which is an angle between the chord line and the incident velocity i e the advance velocity in combination with the heave velocity in addition the inertia ratio i can be rewritten as i i i w where i w is moment of inertia of fluid volume displaced by the foil around the pitching axis the last parameter in eq 2 is the non dimensional spring coefficient which can be reformed as 3 k k 1 2 ρ u 2 a c where k is the spring coefficient non dimensionalized based on advance velocity and a b c is the wing planform area the non dimensional spring coefficient can be alternatively defined as 4 r 2 π i f 2 k f f n where r is the spring coefficient non dimensionalized based on frequency namely force to natural frequency ratio i is the foil moment of inertia and f n is the natural frequency of the foil in order to investigate the influence of spring stiffness on the propulsive performance the flapping foil parameters are defined as follow the foil is a rectangular wing of 5 m span and 1 m chord giving λ 5 the dimensionless heave amplitude is fixed as h 2 0 the pitching axis is located at the leading edge d 0 in order to ensure the foil orientation always facing against the inflow velocity since the center of hydrodynamic force is approximately at the quarter chord point the center of mass is also located at the pitching axis the inertia ratio are fixed as i 10 subsequently the effect of added mass is less relevant since the surrounding fluid is significantly less dense compared to the foil la mantia and dabnichki 2012 2 2 flapping foil performance the propulsive efficiency of flapping foil is the ratio between the average thrust power p t and the power required to drive the foil over a flapping period p req 5 η p t p req where 6 p t u t t t t x d t and 7 p req 1 t t t t y h d t where u represents the advance velocity t 1 f is the flapping period x is the resultant hydrodynamic force in forward direction or in other word the thrust force y is the force required to generate the heave motion and h is the translational velocity of the foil in the stroke plane i e the heave velocity similar to the thrust coefficient of screw propeller the thrust coefficient k t and the heave force coefficient k h of flapping foil can be defined respectively as 8 k t x ρ f 2 d eq 4 and 9 k h y max ρ f 2 d eq 4 where x is the average thrust and y max is the maximum heave force in a flapping period in order to compare hydrodynamic performance of the flapping foil with an efficient marine propeller a transition method between the two systems is introduced following floc h et al 2012 the two different propulsive systems are comparable when their obstruction areas are equivalent hoppe 1989 since the openwater characteristics of marine propeller is traditionally presented as a function of advance number j u n d where n is the rotation speed in revolutions per second and d is the propeller diameter an equivalent diameter of the foil has to be defined on the basis of similar obstruction area d eq 8 h 0 b π consequently the hydrodynamic performance of the flapping foil can be expressed as a function of equivalent advance number j eq u f d eq 3 numerical tool the numerical tool used to simulate the semi active flapping foil in this study consists of two models the hydrodynamic and the dynamic models the hydrodynamic model uses the foil motion as its input to determine the hydrodynamic force and moment as for the dynamic model the hydrodynamic force and moment from the hydrodynamic model are applied in the newton euler equation to determine the foil motion 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is an unsteady potential flow code more precisely a boundary element method bem solver the code has been validated many times floc h et al 2012 laurens and grosjean 2002 phoemsapthawee et al 2009 2013 in this code the foil surface and the wake sheet developed behind the foil are discretized into first order panels each panel on the foil surface carries constant source σ and doublet μ distributions while each wake panel carries only a constant doublet distribution the wake sheet geometry is generated in a lagrangian manner that is when a time step is advanced instead of relocating the foil position the wake sheet panels are projected with the foil translation and rotation as well as induced velocities the doublet distributions are also shaded with the projected panels as illustrate in fig 3 as a consequence new wake panels are formed to fill the space between the foil trailing edge and the projected wake sheet an example of wake panels shading downstream of the foil is presented in fig 4 the strengths of source distributions on the foil surface are determined directly corresponding to the zero normal flow condition v n ˆ 0 whereas the strengths of doublet distributions on both surface and wake panels are determined from the zero normal flow in combination with the kutta condition i e no pressure jump on the trailing edge panels the time dependence in the unsteady potential code is captured by the wake history and the unsteady bernoulli equation the first order backward finite difference is employed in the unsteady bernoulli equation calculation although the flow is considered inviscid the friction force is taken into account by the mean of friction coefficient c f this coefficient is defined as a function of the local reynolds number r e s v s s 0 ν where v is the local velocity s s 0 is curvilinear distance from the location of stagnation point and ν is the kinematic viscosity for r e s 5 10 5 the flow is theoretically supposed to be laminar and c f 0 664 r e s which is the blasius solution for higher reynolds number the flow is supposed to be turbulent and c f 0 027 r e s 7 which is the prandtl turbulent skin friction 3 2 dynamic model a solver of the 6 dof equations of motion phoemsapthawee et al 2013 is modified to simulate the semi active flapping foil however in this study only the pitch motion is calculated by solving the newton euler equations the positions and the velocities of the other motion are imposed the hydrodynamic moment together with the torsion spring moment is applied as an external moment to determine the pitch angle and the angular velocity of the foil the diagram of simulation scheme is illustrated in fig 5 starting from the initial conditions e g hydrodynamic forces as well as positions and velocities the newton euler equations are used to determine the new positions and velocities using the fourth order runge kutta method rk4 since the calculation is performed in body reference frame the fictitious forces f fic have to be added to the equations of motion as 10 m x f ext f fic where m is inertia matrix and x is a vector of the variables describing the motion the external forces considered in this simulation are the hydrodynamic force and the spring force 11 f ext f hydro f spring although the effects of added inertia have been already taken into account in the bem code a numerical stability term based on artificial inertia is added to both sides of eq 10 in order to reduce numerical error and instability as 12 m m a x t f ext f fic m a x t 1 where m a is the estimated added inertia matrix with respect to the body reference frame and t is the time step number the error reduction and stability have been studied and discussed in floc h et al 2008 that the stability term is needed when the foil oscillates in relatively dense fluid since the inertia ratio is fixed as i 10 the numerical stability term is not necessary in the present study and is set to null during the runge kutta iteration steps the hydrodynamic forces are treated as a time independence since the potential flow code does not allow the calculation within the runge kutta iteration steps once the new positions and velocities are obtained the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using the bem code after the hydrodynamic forces are updated the newton euler equations are recalculated for the advanced time step the simulation continues in this manner until the it meets the stopping criteria 4 results and discussions in the present study the foil is discretized into 20 panels in spanwise direction and 80 panels around foil perimeter this set of 1 600 panels is used to model the foil since each wake panel length depends on flapping kinematics and time step size the number of wake panels developing behind the foil is varied to ensure that the total wake length is at least 5 times the chord length the time step is constant and each oscillating period has 200 time steps the simulations are monitored for at least 5 periods to obtain solutions in case of aperiodic solution the simulation is further monitored until a periodic solution is obtained the results presented in this article are obtained from the last 2 periods of simulations 4 1 validation of numerical tool in spite of many validations mentioned in the last section it would be better to validate the numerical tool again for this study since the 6 dof code has been modified to allow simulations of both imposed and free motions imposed heave and free pitch simultaneously in order to validate the employed unsteady potential flow code a commercial cfd solver xflow 2016 based on lattice boltzmann method lbm is used to simulate the flow around the semi active flapping foil for the considered range of advance number this unsteady viscous solver provides a fully lagrangian particle based kinetic approach and has characteristics of wall modeled large eddy simulation wmles which is applied for turbulence closure and near wall treatment the governing equation is the discrete boltzmann equation for viscous incompressible three dimensional flow in combination with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision model the adaptive refinement is applied in the vicinity of both foil and wake giving lattice node size of c 32 where c is the chord length a time step size of t 400 is used for the lbm simulations which is considered sufficiently to capture the flow physics the numerical results corresponding to a finer time step of t 800 nearly coincide with that of the t 400 case whilst the results corresponding to the time step of t 200 slightly deviate from the others the comparison of thrust and heave force coefficients obtained from the employed bem code and the lbm solver are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that results of the two different numerical tools show good trend agreement despite noticeable deviation at small equivalent advance numbers the reliability of numerical results at small advance number will be discussed in the following section although the computational time is optimized for the two methods the lbm takes approximately 10 20 times longer than the bem to obtain a periodic result the fact that bem consumes low computational resources while providing acceptable results especially for lifting problems makes simulations practical on a normal personal computer moreover the bem provides simplicity to study the lifting geometry since meshing is required for the body and wake surfaces but not the fluid volume 4 2 performance of semi active flapping foil a comparison between different kinematics of flapping propulsors is presented in fig 7 where the propulsive efficiency η are plotted as functions of the equivalent advance number j eq in comparison with numerical results of the fully imposed flapping propulsors phoemsapthawee 2017 in which the heave and the pitch motions are prescribed by harmonic functions the semi active flapping foil in combination with a proper torsion spring k 0 3 performs efficiently η 80 over a wider range of advance ratio it can be seen that the efficiency curve of such semi active propulsor tends to connect the peaks of each efficiency curve of the fully imposed kinematics with different pitch amplitudes the propulsive performance of semi active flapping propulsor is similar to that of a variable pitch propeller as presented by floc h et al 2012 it should be noted that the maximum propulsive efficiency of the semi active flapping foil can be over 87 examples of pressure distribution around the foil over a flapping period corresponding to condition of the maximum efficiency are presented in fig 8 and expressed in dimensionless form as a pressure coefficient 13 c p p p 1 2 ρ u 2 h 2 where p is the pressure at the point of which pressure coefficient is calculated and p is the pressure in the freestream since the foil operates dynamically symmetric across the horizontal plane the pressure distributions in down stroke fig 8 left column are opposite to that in up stroke fig 8 right column respectively contours of propulsive efficiency along with the maximum angle of attack plotted as functions of j eq and k are presented in fig 9 a for small equivalent advance numbers the kinematic conditions result in effective angle of attack greater than static stall angle this might affect the reliability of the numerical results since the bem code is reliable when there is no flow separation however it has been reported that the time dependent motion of the foil could delay the flow separation to higher incidences compared to its normal static stall case the stall could be delayed to effective angle of attack approximately 20 to 25 depending on foil kinematics akbari and price 2003 the thrust and the heave force coefficients are also plotted as functions of equivalent advance number j eq and torsion spring coefficient k in fig 9b for the sake of ship propulsion design such information is necessary for matching a propulsor to a ship as well as for optimizing the prime mover power the pitch motion of semi active flapping foil is passively adjusted by hydrodynamic force as a result the pitch amplitude as well as the phase difference between the heave and the pitch motions is found to depend on both the advance ratio and the spring stiffness as shown in fig 9c in contrast to the fully imposed flapping foil of which the optimal efficiency occurred with a phase difference around 90 read et al 2003 pedro et al 2003 the semi active propulsor gives the best performance when the pitch motion leads the heave motion by a phase angle noticeably less than that of the fully prescribed propulsor which is around 65 70 in addition it can be seen that the stiffer spring and the higher advance ratio give a smaller pitch angle amplitude and a higher phase shift in order to compare the simulation results with observations of the aquatic world the propulsive efficiency together with the pitch amplitude are represented in fig 10 as a function of strouhal number s t as already mentioned in introduction observations from the natural world bose et al 1990 fish 1998 taylor et al 2003 indicate that aquatic animals flap their fins or tails with a strouhal number between 0 2 and 0 4 and a pitch amplitude between 20 and 40 fig 10 shows that the optimum efficiency of the semi active flapping foil takes place within the same range for both the strouhal number and the pitch amplitude it is also interesting to investigate the influence of resonance by representing the results as a function of equivalent advance ratio j eq and frequency ratio r as shown in fig 11 note that the high value of r represents small spring stiffness as indicated by eq 4 the optimal performance is obtained at frequency ratio about r 0 5 which lies outside resonance bandwidth this consequently implies that resonance is seemingly less relevant to the performance of the semi active flapping propulsor 4 3 influence of torsion spring stiffness fig 9a also shows that for relatively soft spring e g k 0 2 the flapping foil performance noticeably decreases when the equivalent advance ratio deviates from its optimal point this is because the effective angle of attack which directly determines the hydrodynamic force is more sensitive to the changes in advance ratio for relatively tough spring e g k 0 3 the effective angle of attack is less sensitive to the changes in advance ratio hence the foil could still performs within proximity of its best efficiency for wider range of advance ratio in order to demonstrate the semi active flapping foil mechanism time histories of pitch angle effective angle of attack thrust and heave forces over a flapping period are presented in fig 12 for the advance number of 3 17 and different spring stiffness the thrust and heave forces are represented in term of thrust loading and heave loading coefficients c t x 0 5 ρ u 2 b c and c h y 0 5 ρ u 2 b c respectively despite the appearance in fig 12a the response pitch angles are not a sinusoidal function the pitch motion significantly influences on propulsive performance of flapping foil since the pitch angle in combination with the incident velocity determine the effective angle of attack this results in more complicated response of effective angle of attack as shown in fig 12b in case of small spring stiffness k 0 1 the maximum angle of attack takes place slightly after the stroke reversal t t 0 05 or 0 55 since the spring force is not sufficient to bring the foil back to the horizontal plane that is the foil still pitches in the undesired direction at the beginning of a new stroke e g the foil lies nose up at the beginning of down stroke however when spring stiffness is increased the maximum angle of attack tends to occur close to the middle of strokes in either up or down direction this is because the spring strongly resists the foil from pitching and the maximum heave velocity takes place at the middle of strokes it should be noted that the optimum spring stiffness k 0 3 gives the lowest maximum angle of attack as shown in fig 12c the foil attached to a relatively soft spring e g k 0 1 momentarily produces drag instead of thrust at the end of each stroke this is because while the heave velocity is decreased the foil is over pitching due to insufficient spring force when the spring stiffness is increased the foil has more agility to return to the horizontal plane and avoids the temporary drag production however the tougher spring results in stronger heave force and eventually higher required power see fig 12d the optimum condition k 0 3 corresponds to the lowest heave force generation without drag production 5 conclusions and perspectives a potential flow code is used to simulate the flow around a foil attached to a torsion spring the foil heave motion is accurately prescribed by a simple harmonic function whereas the pitch motion is passively induced by the oscillatory hydrodynamic force in comparison with results of unsteady viscous solver the potential flow code appears to simulate the semi active propulsor with satisfactory agreement on force predictions despite 10 20 times less computational expense the results show that the semi active flapping propulsor has its openwater characteristics similar to that of a variable pitch propeller moreover the simulation results demonstrate that the best efficiency of the semi active flapping foil takes place in same range of strouhal number and pitch amplitude as observed in the natural world furthermore the resonance mechanism seems to have less relevant to the propulsive efficiency since the optimal performance is achieved at frequency ratio considerably outside resonance bandwidth a fully prescribed flapping foil propulsion possesses mechanical complication since it requires two actuators to drive both the heave and the pitch motions this drawback could be resolved by the use of semi active flapping foil for which only one actuator is required the semi active propulsion system therefore promises a more feasible approach in practice compared to fully prescribed motions in addition this self pitching propulsor performs efficiently over a wide range of operating conditions which could improve the performance of ships with large variable loads further investigations are recommended in order to study the influence of inertia ratio as well as the heave amplitude on the performance of such self pitching propulsive foil 
23748,when medium and large amplitudes of rolling are analyzed then in most cases a mathematical model of rolling reveals nonlinear behavior the typical phenomenon for nonlinear oscillations is the resonance frequency dependency on the amplitude a strong shift of resonance frequency leads to bistability which means that for the same value of the excitation moment two different amplitudes of rolling are possible a direct consequence of bistability is the possibility of roll amplitude jumps which for some conditions are related to the bifurcation phenomenon when jumps occur then rolling can seem chaotic the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient to describe the extent and nature of these phenomena therefore a novel expanded form of the roll spectrum is proposed where bistability areas and the bistability origin point are included the bistability areas identification procedure is described examples of bistability areas are determined for ships with softening and hardening spring of the gz curve and an analysis of amplitude jumps is presented the bistability origin point is identified the simplified analysis of the influence of damping on the extent and location of bistability areas is performed all results presented in paper were obtained for a 1 dof rolling model keywords nonlinear resonance nonlinear oscillations bistability bifurcations amplitude jumps chaotic rolling 1 introduction rolling and in particular rolling in the resonant mode is a phenomenon adversely affecting the operation of a ship the amplitude of resonant oscillations frequently exceeds angles of 0 6 rad and sometimes even 0 7 rad naturally even such large amplitudes of oscillations will not lead directly to capsizing when the ship meets the intact stability criteria however the group of threats associated with large values of the heel angle is quite extensive they concern the safety of the crew cargo and equipment of the ship significant oscillations also affect the comfort of the crew decrease the speed and deteriorate the maneuverability of the ship in extreme cases strong rolling can cause cargo loss or damage additionally combined with the dynamic action of gusty wind it may induce excessive angles of heel at which cargo starts to shift the shifted cargo gives a constant heel and this can become a real threat of capsizing resonant rolling may be divided into parametric and synchronous oscillations the first one occurs in head or following seas or anywhere close to them and is caused by the periodic variation of the stability characteristics which are called excitations and not as a direct result of external excitation the phenomenon of parametric rolling can occur for several values of the ratio of the wave encounter period and the natural roll period of the ship however it is most probable in the first instability region ince strutt diagram i e for the ratio close to 0 5 in turn synchronous rolling is a direct result of an external force and takes place at beam and quartering seas when the period of the excitation is close to the natural roll period parametric resonance has been known for many years but almost all this time was recognized as radically unlikely for relatively large ships the situation has changed after 1998 when a post panamax container ship experienced extreme parametric rolling which caused massive cargo loss 400 containers were lost and additional 400 were damaged since that time parametric rolling became the subject of many studies france et al 2003 shin et al 2004 bulian 2005 neves and rodriguez 2006 holden et al 2007 spyrou et al 2008 ribeiro e silva and guedes soares 2013 studies on synchronous rolling are not as numerous as those on parametric resonance moreover most papers that can be found were published before 2000 probably the reason is that synchronous rolling is treated as a phenomenon quite simple to interpret and predict since resonance occurs when the natural roll frequency is equal or close to the excitation frequency avoidance of such situations appears to be fairly simple i e by alternation of the ships heading and or speed causing a change of wave aspect and encounter frequency the problem is that rolling exhibits significant nonlinearities which often result in a distinct change of oscillation period when the amplitude increases evidently this dependency is known and the need for taking it into account was noticed i e kruger and kluwe 2008 the relatively simple method for the roll period prediction with regards to the amplitude was developed and tested by wawrzyński and krata 2016a among studies describing the problem of nonlinearity of rolling of a ship are works of contento et al 1996 francescutto and contento 1999 murashige et al 1999 often works not directly dedicated to rolling can be a very useful source of information on phenomena which occur during nonlinear oscillations stoker 1992 kiewrel 2000 jordan and smith 2007 nowak 2008 brennan et al 2008 the main goal of the research presented in this paper was the analysis of the phenomena which are characteristic for rolling when strong nonlinearity occurs during the presented analysis the results obtained in previously completed studies have often been used wawrzyński and krata 2016a 2016b 2 rolling of the ship nonlinear dynamical system a mathematical model of rolling is described by the second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation when medium and large amplitudes of rolling are analyzed then in most cases a mathematical model of rolling can reveal the nonlinear behavior nonlinear oscillations can appear a typical phenomenon for nonlinear oscillations is that the resonance frequency depends on the amplitude of the oscillations falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 francescutto and contento 1999 kiewrel 2000 in rolling a parameter that determines the nonlinearity of oscillations is the nonlinear stiffness parameter wawrzyński and krata 2016b stiffness parameter also called restoring parameter usually is described by the gz curve changes in the resonance frequency due to roll amplitude are presented in the form of the resonance curve which is sometimes called the backbone curve a strong deviation of the resonance frequency leads to bistability sometimes called multivaluedness which means that for the same value of excitation moment rolling with two different amplitudes is possible this possibility refers to the different nature of these two oscillation modes resonant and non resonant francescutto and contento 1999 it is known that for a constant value of excitation the amplitude differs for resonant and non resonant oscillations since two different amplitudes of rolling are possible the transitions jumps between them are possible too the bistability and amplitude jumps phenomena were observed and tested during the experiment conducted by francescutto and contento 1999 and are widely described in sections 6 and 7 of the presented study when bistability and jumps are possible then at some frequencies another phenomenon can be observed bifurcation this phenomenon refers to the sudden qualitative change in the solution of the mathematical model due to a small smooth change made to the value of some parameter the bifurcation parameter in mathematical model of rolling bifurcation occurs when a very small change of for e g the excitation frequency or excitation value changes the solution of the rolling equation between stable and unstable however when the solution of the rolling equation becomes unstable this does not mean that capsizing will occur the solutions stability can be achieved at another point amplitude in the case of parametric rolling in the unstable region of the incestrutt diagram stability can be achieved due to nonlinear damping in this paper the bifurcation phenomenon is regarded in a more generalized then detailed way the example of a detailed mathematical analysis of the bifurcation phenomenon for rolling can be found in francescutto and contento 1999 liangqiang and fangqi 2008 in regards of the cause of rolling the bistability phenomenon refers only to synchronous rolling while the bifurcation phenomenon concerns both synchronous rolling francescutto and contento 1999 and parametric rolling fossen and nijmeijer 2012 galeazzi et al 2009 the above mentioned phenomena are not revealed in each of the rolling simulations the occurrence of bistability depends on the nonlinearity of the gz curve in the concerned loading condition on the value of excitation moment meaning the roll amplitude and on damping because a very strong nonlinearity can be found in the area of the maximum value of the gz curve the most susceptible to the bistability phenomenon are ships in loading conditions for which the maximum of the gz curve is located at small angles for an intact ship it concerns the angles in the range of 0 45 0 6 rad for the maximum located at bigger angles a bigger roll amplitude must be excited for the bistability occurrence for extreme and yet realistic values of the roll amplitude close to 0 5 0 7 rad these phenomena will not occur when the maximum of the gz curve is located at angles above 0 8 rad among 30 cases of loading conditions for seven different ships which were analyzed by wawrzyński and krata 2016b bistability did not occur in any of the cases satisfying the criterion of 0 8 rad and was a standard for the cases with the maximum of the gz curve located below 0 5 rad naturally when the roll amplitude is really small smaller than 0 2 rad the rolling system is almost linear and bistability will not occur when the bistability and especially bifurcation phenomena and amplitude jumps related to them are possible for a relatively wide range of excitation frequencies then rolling at irregular seas in the domain of such frequencies can reveal chaotic character to disclose the danger of a chaotic response of a ship to the waves action the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient therefore in order to achieve this goal a novel expanded form of the roll spectrum where bistability areas and the bistability origin point are included is proposed in the presented study in some approximation the possibility of the bistability and the amplitude jumps are described by the resonance curve these phenomena occur only for a sufficiently large deviation of the resonance curve from the initial value of the resonance frequency usually called the natural roll frequency when the features of the nonlinear dynamical system rolling of the ship like amplitude jumps and bifurcations are analyzed then a reference to the duffing equation duffing oscillator should be done the duffing oscillator is regarded as one of the prototypes for systems of nonlinear dynamics korsch et al 2008 it is very similar to the rolling equation with a constant value of damping and becomes identical to equation 2 when truncating the gz function 3 to the third order term among the papers where dynamical systems with references to duffing equation and amplitude jumps are discussed it is worthwhile to research the works jordan and smith 2007 brennan et al 2008 the differences in relation to ships rolling refer mainly to the terminology used 3 applied model of ship rolling bistability bifurcation and amplitude jumps are phenomena which are characteristic for oscillations when a strong nonlinearity occurs in rolling this strong nonlinearity is a derivative of the nonlinearity of the gz curve which is a parameter of each mathematical model of rolling 1 dof and multi dof and is independent from the excitation form nevertheless waves and couplings can have a significant impact on the nonlinearity phenomena since the righting arm depends on the instantaneous form of the submerged part of the hull changes of the gz curve due to the ships position in waves increase or decrease the nonlinearity effect with respect to the nonlinearity of the static gz curve for still water additionally it should be noted that roll damping can have a significant impact on the susceptibility of rolling to the phenomena assigned to nonlinear oscillations since the phenomena mentioned above are mainly the derivative of the gz curves nonlinearity and only a general analysis is made then the use of the 1 dof system is most convenient when the constant value of roll damping is assumed then for nonlinear stiffness studies the most commonly used 1 dof model of rolling including a small modification of its right side can be presented in the form 1 i x a 44 ϕ b e ϕ k ϕ m w t c o s ω e t m d t where i x denotes the transverse moment of ship s inertia a 44 is the moment of added mass due to water dragging

ω e is the encounter frequency of waves and t denotes time the moments m w and m d are time dependent in case of m w this allows for periodic changes in the value of roll excitation so groups of higher and lower waves can be simulated the time varying external moment m d can be used to simulate the short external excitation impulses e g caused by the wind dividing both sides of formula 1 by i

case of the righting arm curve to get the best fit most of the results presented in this study were obtained using equation 2 for two different constant values of the damping coefficient μ however the roll damping and as a consequence coefficients b e in equation 1 and μ in equation 2 depend on amplitude and frequency of rolling as well as on the forward speed of the ship therefore for one case the calculations were carried out with the damping dependent on the rolling amplitude and frequency but at zero forward speed to take into account the damping dependence on amplitude of rolling the damping term in equation 2 should be modified to the form given by himeno 1981 5 ϕ 2 α ϕ β ϕ ϕ γ ϕ 3 g r x 2 g z ϕ ξ w c o s ω e t ξ d t where α β and γ are coefficients which can be established for

kawahara et al 2012 was used with one modification the bilge keel component was calculated according to the full ikeda s method ittc 2011 this modification was made due to the inconsistency in the results for the bilge keel component calculated according to the full and simplified method when the surface of damping coefficients for the considered range of amplitudes and frequencies of rolling is obtained then for the constant values of roll frequency the coefficients α β and γ are fitted fulfilling condition 6 for full spectrum of considered amplitudes if this spectrum is too wide the

method is considered to be fully applicable for amplitudes not bigger than 0 4 rad and does not consider changes to roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence for the latter problem no exact analytical method is known at the moment some proposition of a solution can be found in bassler and reed 2010 all results presented in the paper were obtained with the use of the cas algebra computer system programs mathematica and matlab the numerical simulations of rolling for considered mathematical model were performed using the runge kutta method 4 rolling resonance frequency for a constant value of an exciting moment the largest roll amplitude occurs when the excitation frequency i e the encounter frequency of the waves ω e is equal to the natural roll frequency ω n such frequency very often is called the resonance frequency or most precisely the first harmonic resonance frequency ω r at resonance frequency and close to it the roll amplitude increases strongly fig 3 the calculation of the resonance frequency ω r is based on the value of the natural roll period τ 11 ω r 2 π τ the imo in the intact stability code imo 2008 gives the simple method for the calculation of the natural roll period 12 τ 2 c b g m 0 with the value of c coefficient c 0 373 0 023 b t 0 00043 l where gm 0 is the initial metacentric height c is the coefficient describing transverse gyration radius r x r x c b b is the breadth l is the length at the waterline and t is the mean draft of a ship however formula 12 is based on the initial metacentric height gm 0 which means that is valid only up to about 0 1 rad and assumes that the righting arms are linearized according to the formula gm 0 ϕ in some cases such a simplification can be used up to 0 3 0 4 rad fig 1 left and even up to 1 0 rad fig 1 right but very often clear discrepancies occur already at 0 2 rad fig 2 left and sometimes they even start from the origin of the gz curve fig 2 right as a consequence of the gz curve linearization the values of the natural roll period and resonance frequency are constant regardless the amplitude fig 3 left for a selected case using formulas 11 and 12 the resonance frequency is ω r0 0 491 rad s when the correction for the value of damping is made according to formula 13 the resonance frequency is ω r0 μ 0 486 rad s the index 0 at ω r0 means that the value of the resonance frequency was calculated using the gm 0 in fig 3 and subsequent figures the line of resonance frequency calculated using the gm 0 is marked gm0 fig 3 left shows that the maxima of all curves coincide with the gm0 line for comparison between the linear and nonlinear approach to the restoring moment roll spectra for the same case obtained from rolling simulations made using the real nonlinear form of the gz curve are shown in fig 3 right 13 ω r 0 μ ω r 0 2 2 μ 2 the analysis of roll period as a function of roll amplitude was done by wawrzyński and krata 2016a on the base of seven different ships the paper clearly shows how inaccurate the roll period calculated on the base of the gm 0 can be figs 4 and 5 illustrates the examples of convergence and discrepancy between the roll periods calculated according to the imo method description gm0 and obtained from simulations made using the gz curve description num in fig 4 the convergence is quite good but in fig 5 the discrepancy is unacceptable the accompanying graphs show the near linear characteristic of the gz curve up to 0 8 rad for the lng carrier fig 4 and the visible nonlinearity present almost from curve origin for the general cargo ship fig 5 among 30 loading conditions which were tested the unacceptable discrepancy concerns 13 cases and real convergence occurs only in 8 cases in the same paper wawrzyński and krata 2016a the method for the roll period prediction taking the nonlinearity of the gz curve and the roll amplitude into account is proposed the main formula is very similar to the imo one 14 τ ϕ a 2 c b g m e q ϕ a where the value of c coefficient remains the same as given in formula 12 and gmeq ϕ a denotes the equivalent metacentric height for a specified roll amplitude ϕ a the formula for the equivalent metacentric height calculation is the following 15 g m e q ϕ a 0 ϕ a g z ϕ d ϕ ϕ a 2 g z ϕ a 2 ϕ a according to formula 15 the value of the equivalent metacentric height gm eq and as a consequence the roll period and roll resonance frequency depend on the roll amplitude 16 ω r ϕ a 2 π τ ϕ a when the correction for the value of damping is made then formula 16 becomes 17 ω r 2 ϕ a 2 π τ ϕ a 2 2 μ 2 an alternative formula was proposed by contento et al 1996 and next explored by francescutto and contento 1999 when roll damping is taken into account the formula reads 18 ω r 2 ϕ a ω r 0 2 3 4 c 3 ϕ a 2 5 8 c 5 ϕ a 4 35 64 c 7 ϕ a 6 63 128 c 9 ϕ a 8 231 512 c 11 ϕ a 10 2 μ 2 where ω r0 denotes the roll resonance frequency obtained for small roll amplitudes i e with using gm 0 like in the imo formula and ϕ a is the roll amplitude the gz curve needs to be approximated by the polynomial in the form 19 g z ϕ g m 0 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 c 7 ϕ 7 c 9 ϕ 9 the coefficients c3 c5 in formula 18 are equal to the coefficients c3 c5 of the gz approximation function 19 formula 17 combined with 14 and 15 in the future will be called the gm eq method graphically the resonance frequencies for consecutive amplitudes are presented in the form of the resonance curve which in all of the following figures is marked gmeq the accuracy of the gm eq method is presented in fig 6 where the roll spectra for different values of an exciting moment calculated for two ships are shown the resonance curve calculated by the gm eq method accurately passes through the maximum of each curve which means that it reflects the resonance frequency of oscillations however for the loading conditions where the simulation results reveal the bifurcation phenomenon the resonance curve obtained from gm eq method is not very accurate fig 7 the inaccuracy is evident in regions with significant jumps of the amplitude finally it is worth mentioning that the gm eq method has been used with a quite good result in the research performed by acanfora et al 2017 during this research the 6 dof model of ships motions called laidyn was utilized roll simulations of a containership c11 class were conducted for the study of the synchronous and parametric resonance the simulations were performed for irregular seas described by the jonswap spectrum for the pacific ocean one of the effects of this simulations is the spectral analysis of the irregular sea and ships roll response for both presented cases i e synchronous and parametric roll the resonance frequency calculated according to the gm eq method shows a quite good coincidence with the peak of the roll spectrum the only objection concerns the arbitrary choice of the reference roll amplitude nonetheless this research shows clearly that the roll characteristic determined on the basis of the 1 dof equation can reveal a good coincidence with the results of simulations of the 6 dof model performed for irregular seas 5 considered ships for this study three ships are considered all of them were explored in the scope of the research mentioned above because of the extent of the simulations necessary to perform for every ship only one loading condition is selected the loading conditions were selected so as to obtain two cases of the gz curve with softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 and one case with hardening spring characteristic fig 10 the softening spring characteristic means that for an increasing angle of the heel the inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve decreases therefore the hardening spring means that for an increasing angle of the heel the inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve increases however when the hardening characteristic of the gz curve occurs it always concerns only the initial segment of the curve for angles coming to the curve maximum characteristic become softening fig 10 in fig 9 it can be seen that the initial segment of the gz curve is slightly hardening but regardless of this when large amplitudes of rolling are considered generally the characteristic in this case should be treated as softening this is because the maximum of the gz curve is located at the relatively small angle the main particulars of the considered ships and values of the initial metacentric height gm 0 roll period and frequency for selected loading conditions are shown in table 1 figs 8 10 show the gz curves and roll period curves for each case i e ship in the selected loading condition for each gz curve to get the best fit a different approximation function was used the used functions are given in the description under the figures the roll period curves are plotted according to the methods based on gm eq 14 and gm 0 12 6 bistability in rolling the typical and easiest way of determining a frequency response curve consists of performing rolling simulations for a series of consecutive exciting frequencies in the range of the examined values within the theoretical analysis the value of the exciting moment often is assumed to be constant however when research is combined with an experiment then it must be determined by the excitation frequency the exemplary frequency response curve for rolling also known as roll spectrum is shown in fig 11 the roll spectrum like in fig 11 does not show bistability areas but reveals only one frequency of bifurcation frequency 0 315 rad s where the jump of amplitude is visible roll time histories for frequencies 0 314 0 315 and 0 316 rad s are presented in fig 12 at ω 0 314 rad s the roll amplitude is equal 0 4 rad when at ω 0 315 rad s it achieves 0 715 rad however the frequency of bifurcation is not clear even though at ω 0 315 rad s the roll amplitude of 0 715 rad is achieved it occurs after 300 s of simulation between the frequencies 0 314 and 0 315 rad s the time needed to achieve the amplitude of 0 715 rad is much longer to get a better picture of the roll spectrum it is necessary to perform two rolling simulations with continuously changing frequency one simulation is performed for increasing values of the excitation frequency while the second one for decreasing values of the excitation frequency falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 the frequency should be slowly varied to get a quasi stationary process the effect of such performed simulations is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 when increasing the excitation frequency from 0 20 rad s the roll amplitude rises from 0 215 rad up to 0 4 rad at ω 0 314 rad s where the bifurcation occurs and the roll amplitude jumps to 0 715 rad when continuing the frequency increase the roll amplitude decreases starting the simulation from ω 0 55 rad s towards the smaller value of the excitation frequency the roll amplitude rises to 0 763 rad at ω 0 286 rad s where the bifurcation occurs and the amplitude suddenly falls to 0 31 rad such simulation results suggest that for frequencies between 0 286 and 0 314 rad s for the same value of excitation moment rolling with two different amplitudes is possible this phenomenon is called bistability and sometimes multivaluedness falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 in fig 13 the bistability region a is marked limited by two bifurcation frequencies the possibility of rolling with two different amplitudes for the same value of excitation moment refers to the different nature of these two oscillation modes it is known that for a constant value of an exciting moment roll amplitude differs for the oscillations in the resonant and non resonant mode in the case shown in fig 13 the resonance curve i e resonance frequency deviates in the direction of smaller frequencies with increasing amplitude for softening spring characteristic of the gz curve because of the nonlinearity of the restoring moment simplifying when this deviation is sufficiently large and the vertical distance between the amplitude of non resonant rolling and the resonance curve is big enough the non resonant and resonant oscillations are possible for the same value of excitation moment obviously in fig 13 at ω 0 30 rad s of the left lower branch of the roll spectrum the amplitude is higher than at ω 0 20 rad s which is caused by a better coincidence between the natural roll frequency ω n ω r0 and excitation moment frequency ω e however such rolling cannot be called resonant oscillations yet the oscillations will become resonant ones for the excitation frequency above the bifurcation frequency 0 314 rad s or above 0 286 rad s but only if the jump to the right upper branch of the roll spectrum is forced in bistability region a fig 13 for a transition between the non resonant and resonant oscillations mode amplitude an impulse is necessary this impulse can be a group of two or three higher or lower waves depending on the direction of the transition or another extortion caused for e g by the wind ships maneuvers or couplings with another degree of freedom fig 14 shows four cases of roll time history for the lng carrier in the selected loading condition with roll spectrum shown in fig 13 two cases are for ω 0 30 rad s and two for ω 0 29 rad s so both frequencies are within the bistability region initially in each case the rolling is non resonant after 300 s of the simulation the value of the exciting moment was increased by 30 for a period from 20 to 60 s 1 3 higher waves at frequency 0 30 rad s increasing the excitation value for 20 s has no effect however 40 s appear to be sufficient to force a jump into resonant oscillations at frequency 0 29 rad s to get a jump 60 s of increased excitation value were necessary when the value of excitation moment is increased more energy is transferred to the system at ω 0 30 rad s the distance between amplitudes of non resonant and resonant oscillations is smaller than at ω 0 29 rad s so to induce the transition less amount of added energy is needed the logical conclusion is that the probability of a jump rises with the decrease of the distance between the amplitudes of non resonant and resonant oscillations to induce the transition forcing a jump exactly to the amplitude of resonant rolling is not indispensable just achieving a certain minimal level of roll amplitude causes the system to reach the amplitude of resonant oscillations for the case in fig 13 the nonlinear system described by equation 2 for assumed parameters is unstable in area a the possible steady state solutions are the non resonant and resonant rolling with amplitude specified by limiting the area a by the lower and upper branch of the roll spectrum for each frequency in region a an analysis of domains of attraction can be made where the attractor for each domain will be the amplitude of the non resonant or resonant oscillations an example of an analysis of domains of attraction for rolling at the bifurcation frequency was made by francescutto and contento 1999 like increasing the excitation moment in an exact combination of the value and period causes the transition from the non resonant oscillations to the resonant ones so decreasing the value of the excitation moment for an exact period can induce the reverse transition as shown in fig 15 right performing rolling simulations for frequencies within the bistability region attention to the process of introducing the exciting moment is needed fig 16 shows two roll time histories obtained for the same loading condition of the lng carrier the same value of exciting moment and the same initial conditions of simulation the left graph shows resonant oscillations with the amplitude 0 84 rad while in the right one oscillations are non resonant with the amplitude 0 41 rad the difference between these two simulations is caused by the process of achieving the appointed value by the exciting moment coefficient in the first case the excitation was present with the appointed value from the beginning of the simulation while in the second case the excitation was continuously increasing from zero to the appointed value during the initial 100 s of the simulation the presence of the exciting moment with the appointed value from the beginning of the simulation means there was dynamic action therefore before rolling stabilization with an amplitude corresponding to the force of excitation a few swings with bigger amplitudes sometimes occur now if during these few swings the amplitude achieves the domain of attraction of resonant oscillations the amplitude of resonant rolling will become the stable solution of the roll equation 2 when the excitation is continuously increased from zero to the appointed value the action is semi static and the solution will always be non resonant rolling in bistability region additionally it should be noted that the analysis made in this chapter is valid if initial conditions of equation 2 are equal to 0 ϕ 0 ϕ 0 7 rolling bistability areas when the phenomena of bistability multivaluedness and amplitude jumps are discussed the roll spectrum like shown in fig 13 is most often used unfortunately the form of this graph as well as the analysis presented in the previous chapter do not show the complexity of rolling in the bistability region because of the variability of sea waves and the possibility of additional impulses occurrence e g wind couplings a two dimensional analysis is necessary this analysis should be made for the assumed surface of excitation frequency values in combination with external perturbations taking the form of an impact with a variable value of the force in the course of such an analysis rolling bistability areas were determined figs 17 21 and 24 show bistability areas for gz curves with softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 while fig 22 concerns the gz curve with hardening spring characteristic fig 10 figs 17 22 are the effect of simulations carried out with the use of equation 2 for two constant values of the damping coefficient while fig 24 is obtained using equation 10 where the damping depends on roll amplitude and frequency all simulations were performed for the same initial conditions ϕ 0 ϕ 0 and for the same time period 1 500 s the excitation moment was slowly increased from 0 to the target value during the early 200 s of each simulation for the frequencies where a large deviation of the resonance curve occurs for a period of 10 s the perturbation was introduced after 700 s of the simulation have passed the perturbation was introduced in the form of an additional external moment initially the value of this moment was equal to 20 of the exciting moment if the transition did not occur then in the next simulations its value was increased up to the jump occurrence or capsizing such a procedure implies a very large number of simulations which have to be done in order to determine the bistability areas obviously when the value of the additional external moment which causes the transition is established for one frequency then for nearby frequencies its value differs slightly finally it should be noted that bistability areas are applicable only for the loading condition of the ship for which they were determined in the following text the meaning of the terms area and region differs the term area is used concerning a separate part of the graph whereas the term region refers to the frequency range for example in fig 17 area b is limited by areas c and d and a dashed vertical line indicates the border between regions a and b at ω 0 287 rad s so in the same fig 17 region b means frequencies between 0 287 rad s dashed vertical line and 0 346 rad s point p additionally the two cases of bifurcation are differentiated the first case is the bifurcation due to the frequency change and this will be called type f the second one is the bifurcation due to the change of the excitation moment value and this will be called type e therefore the parts of figs 17 22 can be described as following point p the bistability origin point the point of contact between bistability areas c and d the appearance of this point starts the development of bistability areas the bistability region extends from this point towards lower frequencies for the softening spring gz curves and towards higher frequencies for the hardening spring gz curves the position of point p is always close to the resonance curve backbone curve areas c and d rolling bistability areas in area c the oscillations are non resonant but the energy provided by the excitation moment is big enough for resonant oscillations within the area d the transitions between the non resonant and resonant oscillations and so between c and d areas were discussed in chapter 6 when figs 14 and 15 were described each point of rolling within area c corresponds to one point of rolling within area d the lower limit of the area c dashed line determines the minimum value of the energy excitation moment needed for resonant oscillations with the amplitude close to the resonance curve it is worth noting that resonant oscillations within the area d can have amplitudes which slightly vary from the value of the resonance curve for a given frequency so in the bistability region the resonance curve does not determine the exact values of the resonant oscillations amplitude and this is why the resonance curve does not pass accurately through the maximum of each curve in fig 7 accordingly this is why in the bistability region the backbone curve seems to be a more adequate name than the resonance curve area b appears together with the bistability areas c and d area b is limited by areas c and d and the line of frequency of the bifurcation type f dashed vertical line in fig 17 usually this bifurcation frequency is the border between areas b and a however when the bistability areas c and d are not expanded enough area a does not appear like in fig 22 within area b the equation 2 is unstable upper and lower limits of this area are the lines of bifurcations type f and type e this means that regardless of the parameter which is changing entering into area b causes a jump because of bifurcation further entering area b at the lower limit causes a jump not to the upper limit of area b but the upper limit of area d by analogy entering area b at the upper limit causes a jump not to the lower limit of area b but the lower limit of area c the above means that results of rolling simulations performed for irregular wave for frequencies within region b can be very confusing and ambiguous in interpretation rolling can seem chaotic region a is the most often determined part of the bistability region like in fig 13 while the whole bistability region includes regions a and b usually region a is limited by areas c and d and the two frequencies of bifurcation type f internal between regions a and b and external appointed by the edge of areas c and d like in fig 17 or by the angle of vanishing like in fig 18 or by the roll spectrum curve like in fig 21 in the case of the offshore support vessel figs 19 and 20 the external border is not marked because of the inaccuracy of the gz curve approximation for angles over 1 1 rad area a the area of unstable solutions of the roll equation 2 for parameters resulting in oscillations within areas c and d depending on the instantaneous point of rolling within area a e g due to the external impulse or the transient change of the exciting moment or the process of introducing the exciting moment at the rolling simulation beginning or initial conditions of the roll equation the stable solution follows to areas c or d for each frequency of region a an analysis of domains of attraction the range of amplitudes can be made where the attractor for each domain will be the amplitude of the non resonant area c or resonant area d oscillations point k the critical point this point appears only in fig 17 although the roll amplitude of point k is smaller than the angle of vanishing decreasing the frequency or increasing the value of the excitation moment causes capsizing during the analysis of bistability areas point k appears only for sufficiently large values of the excitation moment the position of point k depends on the maximum value of the excitation moment which was considered during the bistability areas development process area g appears only together with the critical point k in area g despite the small roll amplitude the value of excitation moment is so big that transition about the resonance curve results in capsizing in fig 17 area g is not closed because it was not fully determined analysis was concluded at the left end of area c and d for the offshore support vessel figs 19 and 20 the external border for areas c and d as for region a was not designated because of the inaccuracy of the gz curve approximation for angles over 1 1 rad the gz curve shaped like in fig 8 cannot be approximated by the polynomial power series with acceptable accuracy wawrzyński 2015 therefore for this purpose the third order trigonometric polynomial in form 4 was adapted as an effect a good fitting of the gz curve was obtained but only for angles up to 1 1 rad to reveal how the value of damping affects the extent and location of the bistability areas for the lng carrier and the osv vessel the analysis was performed for two different values of damping coefficient μ 0 05 and 0 08 the corresponding graphs are figs 17 and 18 for the lng carrier and figs 19 and 20 for the offshore support vessel the changes of areas c and d but especially changes in the location of point p should show how much damping determines the susceptibility of the ship to bistability and amplitude jumps as well as bifurcations however to make sure that such a comparison is not trivial together with increasing the value of damping coefficient the value of exciting moment was increased too the goal was to keep the surfaces under the roll spectra and values of roll amplitude at similar levels it should also be noted that such an analysis is not all inclusive because damping nonlinearity and dependency on amplitude and frequency are not taken into account comparing graphs for the lng carrier figs 17 and 18 it can be stated that increased damping causes the bistability areas to decrease noticeably it seems to be a most reasonable conclusion but for the osv vessel figs 19 and 20 this effect did not occur it is very likely that it is caused by the shape of the gz curve which in the range of 0 25 0 85 rad is approximately flat fig 8 however to confirm this dependency additional simulations and analysis performed for other ships with similar characteristics of the gz curve are required additionally for the lng carrier the critical point k and area g vanished for both ships a shift of point p is evident for the bigger value of damping coefficient the distance between point p and the line of natural oscillation frequency ω r0 increases the vertical position of point p also is changing it shifts towards higher amplitudes both changes indicate a reduced susceptibility of the ship to the occurrence of the bistability and amplitude jumps phenomena interestingly the border between areas a and b does not shift at all for the lng carrier while for the osv a shift is clear for the lng carrier region b significantly decreases but for the osv it significantly increases this is important because as stated previously the results of rolling simulations performed for irregular wave for frequencies within region b can show rolling which seems chaotic as it was noted graphs in figs 18 and 20 were determined not only for the increased value of damping coefficient but also for the increased value of excitation moment nevertheless in both figures the roll spectra determined for the increased damping and the initial value of excitation are also plotted dot dash line a combination of the roll spectrum and bistability area determined for the higher value of the excitation moment provides a possibility of accessible interpretations of roll amplitude changes due to the excitation frequency change for the lng carrier fig 18 the roll spectrum for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 0316 does not pass the bistability areas this means that for μ 0 08 and ξ w 0 0316 despite the nonlinearity of rolling and a considerable deviation of the resonance curve in the range of amplitudes for ξ w 0 0316 the jumps of the amplitude will not occur the scheme for the osv ship is different fig 20 let us follow the roll spectrum curve starting from the frequency of 0 80 rad s initially approaching the resonance curve the roll amplitude increases due to the increase in strength of the resonance effect we can assume that at frequencies close to point p the oscillations become resonant at ω 0 513 rad s the roll curve enters area d and despite the relatively small value of the excitation moment and a considerable distance from ω r0 the amplitude still increases due to the almost accurate resonance effect the position is close to the resonance curve nevertheless the excitation moment is not large enough for the roll curve to be able to follow the resonance curve so the roll spectrum curve crosses area d approaching its lower limit drifting apart from the resonance curve the resonance effect is weakening and at a frequency slightly bigger than 0 40 rad s the roll amplitude significantly decreases when the area d lower limit is reached a jump bifurcation type f down to area c non resonant oscillations occurs the new roll amplitude stabilizes at the lower limit of area c with the value of merely 0 126 rad now following in the reverse direction we start at the frequency of 0 30 rad s and at ω 0 402 rad s the roll curve enters area c hereafter for the assumed value of the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 05 resonant oscillations are possible but to obtain them an accordingly strong impulse forcing the transition to area d is necessary further following in the direction of the resonance frequency ω r0 the slow increase of the roll amplitude is continued at ω 0 513 rad s the upper limit of area c is achieved and entering area b causes a jump bifurcation type f the oscillations become resonant and the new roll amplitude stabilizes at the upper limit of area d with the value of 0 557 rad the graph of bistability areas determined for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 07 fig 20 can be easily adapted to smaller values of the coefficients here for ξ w 0 05 the new graph includes parts of the bistability areas c and d located below the roll spectrum curve obtained for ξ w 0 05 the effect is shown in fig 21 bistability areas c and d like bistability regions a and b are reduced the frequency of bifurcation which separates regions a and b moves in the direction of point p additionally region a is limited on the left side at the new bifurcation frequency the position of the bistability origin point p does not change the presented above analysis concerns ships in loading conditions where the righting arm curve has the softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 usually the gz curve has such a feature when the value of the initial metacentric height gm 0 is significantly large for loading conditions with small values of the gm 0 most often the characteristic of the gz curve is the hardening spring like in fig 10 in the hardening spring system from the beginning the resonance curve deviates towards the higher frequencies together with the amplitude increase however when the roll amplitude approaches the angle of the maximum of the gz curve the character of the gz curve changes to the softening spring from this point the direction of the resonance curve deviation changes too such a scheme of the resonance curve change is presented in fig 6 where both graphs were determined for ships with relatively small values of the gm 0 1 50 m and 1 00 m therefore the analysis for the system with hardening spring characteristic of the restoring moment was made for the 5 000 teu container ship in loading condition with gm 0 0 50 m bistability areas for this container ship determined for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 025 and the damping coefficient μ 0 05 are shown in fig 22 as described above at small values of amplitude the resonance curve significantly deviates towards higher frequencies at the sufficiently large change of the resonance frequency 20 ω r ϕ a ω r 0 d m i n ϕ a μ the bistability origin point p appears right after bistability areas c and d and area b appear too at this stage of bistability areas development area and region a do not exist for its appearance a big enough vertical distance between the areas c and d is needed further deviation of the resonance curve in the current direction would result in the expansion of the bistability areas and the appearance of area a like in figs 17 21 however at the angle close to 0 7 rad the gz curve changes its character to softening spring and the resonance curve starts to deviate in the reverse direction so areas c d and b are no longer expanded the drawings discussed above concern the constant value of roll damping in fig 24 the bistability areas for damping dependent on amplitude and frequency are shown the calculations were made for the offshore support vessel where damping coefficients were calculated according to the simple ikeda s method fig 23 left and next were approximated using coefficients α ω β ω and γ ω in the roll equation 10 the effect of such an approximation is shown in fig 23 right drawing in the case presented in fig 23 for amplitudes in the range 0 1 0 8 rad the difference between the damping calculated and approximated does not exceed 6 the bigger differences for small and large amplitudes are caused by a too wide range of roll amplitudes taken into account in the course of the approximation generally it is known that the ikeda s method is not intended for large amplitudes and does not comply with changes to roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence nevertheless because this study is more of a qualitative than quantitative analysis this problems was omitted comparing fig 24 with figs 19 and 20 it can be stated that the roll damping dependence on amplitude and frequency is significant in the sense of its value for small amplitudes it has values smaller then 0 08 and even 0 05 and bigger values at large amplitudes additionally the value of damping decreases together with frequency this causes the bistability region to extend in the direction of lower frequencies the border between region a and b shifts in the same direction 8 summary in nonlinear oscillations rolling the primary reason for the appearance of bistability and related amplitude jumps for some conditions caused by bifurcation is a strong deviation of the resonance frequency resonance curve from the natural roll frequency ω n following with the increase in the roll amplitude the strength of the oscillations nonlinearity depends on the nonlinearity of the gz curve in the considered range of the roll amplitude therefore the most significant factor for the potential for the occurrence of the strong nonlinear oscillations is the location of the maximum of the gz curve the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient to describe the extent and nature of bistability and amplitude jumps in this study in order to achieve this goal the expanded form of the roll spectrum is proposed this new form of the roll spectrum includes the bistability areas the bistability origin point and the resonance curve the procedure for the identification of bistability areas is described and discussed in sections 6 and 7 the examples of bistability areas determined for three ships are shown in figs 17 22 and 24 the identification of bistability areas for the maximum considered value of the excitation moment provides the graph which can be called the roll bistability map the bistability map shows the complexity of nonlinear oscillations and allows for straightforward interpretation of the amplitude jumps which can occur during rolling simulations and ship model tests however it is important to notice that the new form of roll spectra which is proposed in the study does not describe the behavior of the ship at irregular sea but only shows the region of frequencies where chaotic rolling is likely additionally it should be highlighted that a bistability map is valid only for a given loading condition the results of the research presented by wawrzyński and krata 2016b suggest that the problem of bistability and related jumps of amplitude concern most of the loading conditions where the maximum of the gz curve is located at angles smaller than 0 8 rad the conductive factor is the significant value of the initial metacentric height gm 0 however the fundamental parameter of the susceptibility of the ship to amplitude jumps is the appearance and location of the bistability origin point p if point p does not exist or when at the frequency of point p the roll amplitude for the considered value of excitation moment is smaller than the amplitude of point p bistability and amplitude jumps does not occur another significant parameter is roll damping the most unpredictable are the oscillations within region b where jumps can be caused by a minimal change of the excitation frequency or excitation value or by a slight additional impulse e g wind couplings inside this region the rolling in irregular seas with moderate and large amplitudes can seem chaotic within region a especially its external part more distant from point p transitions between areas of non resonant and resonant oscillations need a distinctly bigger impulse so roll amplitude jumps are less probable it is especially important to emphasize that the presented study in its actual form is mainly a comprehensive description of the bistability phenomenon which can be observed in the mathematical model of rolling additionally the results of rolling simulations were obtained with the use of several simplifications 1 dof equation constant value of added mass or constant value of damping coefficient for most calculations the damping problem is not exhausted even in the case where the damping is dependent on roll amplitude and frequency fig 24 this is because changes to the roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence are not considered in the method used the bilge keel emergence strongly changes the roll damping since the damping caused by bilge keel responds to 50 80 of the overall value of damping for large amplitudes himeno 1981 regardless of the simplifications mentioned above the study shows the potential that lies in the analyzed issue the presented approach to the bistability phenomenon and amplitude jumps as to the bifurcation phenomenon can be used in the explanation of notable divergences between the results of numerical simulations for rolling with large amplitudes at resonance frequencies performed with the use of different multi dof mathematical models of ships motions the elaboration of the detection method for the p point existence can be useful in the optimization of a ships loading condition at the future of this research the use of more advanced mathematical models including the 6 dof nonlinear model of ships motions as well as the performance of the corresponding model tests are planned as it was stated in section 3 waves and couplings can have significant impact on the nonlinearity phenomena since the righting arm depends on the instantaneous form of the submerged part of the hull changes of the gz curve due to the ships position in waves increase or decrease the nonlinearity effect with respect to nonlinearity of the still water gz curve and this admittedly should be tested other very interesting issue is that a nonlinear ordinary differential equation such as equation 2 should yield certain nonlinearity in terms of higher harmonics of the simulated response 
23748,when medium and large amplitudes of rolling are analyzed then in most cases a mathematical model of rolling reveals nonlinear behavior the typical phenomenon for nonlinear oscillations is the resonance frequency dependency on the amplitude a strong shift of resonance frequency leads to bistability which means that for the same value of the excitation moment two different amplitudes of rolling are possible a direct consequence of bistability is the possibility of roll amplitude jumps which for some conditions are related to the bifurcation phenomenon when jumps occur then rolling can seem chaotic the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient to describe the extent and nature of these phenomena therefore a novel expanded form of the roll spectrum is proposed where bistability areas and the bistability origin point are included the bistability areas identification procedure is described examples of bistability areas are determined for ships with softening and hardening spring of the gz curve and an analysis of amplitude jumps is presented the bistability origin point is identified the simplified analysis of the influence of damping on the extent and location of bistability areas is performed all results presented in paper were obtained for a 1 dof rolling model keywords nonlinear resonance nonlinear oscillations bistability bifurcations amplitude jumps chaotic rolling 1 introduction rolling and in particular rolling in the resonant mode is a phenomenon adversely affecting the operation of a ship the amplitude of resonant oscillations frequently exceeds angles of 0 6 rad and sometimes even 0 7 rad naturally even such large amplitudes of oscillations will not lead directly to capsizing when the ship meets the intact stability criteria however the group of threats associated with large values of the heel angle is quite extensive they concern the safety of the crew cargo and equipment of the ship significant oscillations also affect the comfort of the crew decrease the speed and deteriorate the maneuverability of the ship in extreme cases strong rolling can cause cargo loss or damage additionally combined with the dynamic action of gusty wind it may induce excessive angles of heel at which cargo starts to shift the shifted cargo gives a constant heel and this can become a real threat of capsizing resonant rolling may be divided into parametric and synchronous oscillations the first one occurs in head or following seas or anywhere close to them and is caused by the periodic variation of the stability characteristics which are called excitations and not as a direct result of external excitation the phenomenon of parametric rolling can occur for several values of the ratio of the wave encounter period and the natural roll period of the ship however it is most probable in the first instability region ince strutt diagram i e for the ratio close to 0 5 in turn synchronous rolling is a direct result of an external force and takes place at beam and quartering seas when the period of the excitation is close to the natural roll period parametric resonance has been known for many years but almost all this time was recognized as radically unlikely for relatively large ships the situation has changed after 1998 when a post panamax container ship experienced extreme parametric rolling which caused massive cargo loss 400 containers were lost and additional 400 were damaged since that time parametric rolling became the subject of many studies france et al 2003 shin et al 2004 bulian 2005 neves and rodriguez 2006 holden et al 2007 spyrou et al 2008 ribeiro e silva and guedes soares 2013 studies on synchronous rolling are not as numerous as those on parametric resonance moreover most papers that can be found were published before 2000 probably the reason is that synchronous rolling is treated as a phenomenon quite simple to interpret and predict since resonance occurs when the natural roll frequency is equal or close to the excitation frequency avoidance of such situations appears to be fairly simple i e by alternation of the ships heading and or speed causing a change of wave aspect and encounter frequency the problem is that rolling exhibits significant nonlinearities which often result in a distinct change of oscillation period when the amplitude increases evidently this dependency is known and the need for taking it into account was noticed i e kruger and kluwe 2008 the relatively simple method for the roll period prediction with regards to the amplitude was developed and tested by wawrzyński and krata 2016a among studies describing the problem of nonlinearity of rolling of a ship are works of contento et al 1996 francescutto and contento 1999 murashige et al 1999 often works not directly dedicated to rolling can be a very useful source of information on phenomena which occur during nonlinear oscillations stoker 1992 kiewrel 2000 jordan and smith 2007 nowak 2008 brennan et al 2008 the main goal of the research presented in this paper was the analysis of the phenomena which are characteristic for rolling when strong nonlinearity occurs during the presented analysis the results obtained in previously completed studies have often been used wawrzyński and krata 2016a 2016b 2 rolling of the ship nonlinear dynamical system a mathematical model of rolling is described by the second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation when medium and large amplitudes of rolling are analyzed then in most cases a mathematical model of rolling can reveal the nonlinear behavior nonlinear oscillations can appear a typical phenomenon for nonlinear oscillations is that the resonance frequency depends on the amplitude of the oscillations falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 francescutto and contento 1999 kiewrel 2000 in rolling a parameter that determines the nonlinearity of oscillations is the nonlinear stiffness parameter wawrzyński and krata 2016b stiffness parameter also called restoring parameter usually is described by the gz curve changes in the resonance frequency due to roll amplitude are presented in the form of the resonance curve which is sometimes called the backbone curve a strong deviation of the resonance frequency leads to bistability sometimes called multivaluedness which means that for the same value of excitation moment rolling with two different amplitudes is possible this possibility refers to the different nature of these two oscillation modes resonant and non resonant francescutto and contento 1999 it is known that for a constant value of excitation the amplitude differs for resonant and non resonant oscillations since two different amplitudes of rolling are possible the transitions jumps between them are possible too the bistability and amplitude jumps phenomena were observed and tested during the experiment conducted by francescutto and contento 1999 and are widely described in sections 6 and 7 of the presented study when bistability and jumps are possible then at some frequencies another phenomenon can be observed bifurcation this phenomenon refers to the sudden qualitative change in the solution of the mathematical model due to a small smooth change made to the value of some parameter the bifurcation parameter in mathematical model of rolling bifurcation occurs when a very small change of for e g the excitation frequency or excitation value changes the solution of the rolling equation between stable and unstable however when the solution of the rolling equation becomes unstable this does not mean that capsizing will occur the solutions stability can be achieved at another point amplitude in the case of parametric rolling in the unstable region of the incestrutt diagram stability can be achieved due to nonlinear damping in this paper the bifurcation phenomenon is regarded in a more generalized then detailed way the example of a detailed mathematical analysis of the bifurcation phenomenon for rolling can be found in francescutto and contento 1999 liangqiang and fangqi 2008 in regards of the cause of rolling the bistability phenomenon refers only to synchronous rolling while the bifurcation phenomenon concerns both synchronous rolling francescutto and contento 1999 and parametric rolling fossen and nijmeijer 2012 galeazzi et al 2009 the above mentioned phenomena are not revealed in each of the rolling simulations the occurrence of bistability depends on the nonlinearity of the gz curve in the concerned loading condition on the value of excitation moment meaning the roll amplitude and on damping because a very strong nonlinearity can be found in the area of the maximum value of the gz curve the most susceptible to the bistability phenomenon are ships in loading conditions for which the maximum of the gz curve is located at small angles for an intact ship it concerns the angles in the range of 0 45 0 6 rad for the maximum located at bigger angles a bigger roll amplitude must be excited for the bistability occurrence for extreme and yet realistic values of the roll amplitude close to 0 5 0 7 rad these phenomena will not occur when the maximum of the gz curve is located at angles above 0 8 rad among 30 cases of loading conditions for seven different ships which were analyzed by wawrzyński and krata 2016b bistability did not occur in any of the cases satisfying the criterion of 0 8 rad and was a standard for the cases with the maximum of the gz curve located below 0 5 rad naturally when the roll amplitude is really small smaller than 0 2 rad the rolling system is almost linear and bistability will not occur when the bistability and especially bifurcation phenomena and amplitude jumps related to them are possible for a relatively wide range of excitation frequencies then rolling at irregular seas in the domain of such frequencies can reveal chaotic character to disclose the danger of a chaotic response of a ship to the waves action the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient therefore in order to achieve this goal a novel expanded form of the roll spectrum where bistability areas and the bistability origin point are included is proposed in the presented study in some approximation the possibility of the bistability and the amplitude jumps are described by the resonance curve these phenomena occur only for a sufficiently large deviation of the resonance curve from the initial value of the resonance frequency usually called the natural roll frequency when the features of the nonlinear dynamical system rolling of the ship like amplitude jumps and bifurcations are analyzed then a reference to the duffing equation duffing oscillator should be done the duffing oscillator is regarded as one of the prototypes for systems of nonlinear dynamics korsch et al 2008 it is very similar to the rolling equation with a constant value of damping and becomes identical to equation 2 when truncating the gz function 3 to the third order term among the papers where dynamical systems with references to duffing equation and amplitude jumps are discussed it is worthwhile to research the works jordan and smith 2007 brennan et al 2008 the differences in relation to ships rolling refer mainly to the terminology used 3 applied model of ship rolling bistability bifurcation and amplitude jumps are phenomena which are characteristic for oscillations when a strong nonlinearity occurs in rolling this strong nonlinearity is a derivative of the nonlinearity of the gz curve which is a parameter of each mathematical model of rolling 1 dof and multi dof and is independent from the excitation form nevertheless waves and couplings can have a significant impact on the nonlinearity phenomena since the righting arm depends on the instantaneous form of the submerged part of the hull changes of the gz curve due to the ships position in waves increase or decrease the nonlinearity effect with respect to the nonlinearity of the static gz curve for still water additionally it should be noted that roll damping can have a significant impact on the susceptibility of rolling to the phenomena assigned to nonlinear oscillations since the phenomena mentioned above are mainly the derivative of the gz curves nonlinearity and only a general analysis is made then the use of the 1 dof system is most convenient when the constant value of roll damping is assumed then for nonlinear stiffness studies the most commonly used 1 dof model of rolling including a small modification of its right side can be presented in the form 1 i x a 44 ϕ b e ϕ k ϕ m w t c o s ω e t m d t where i x denotes the transverse moment of ship s inertia a 44 is the moment of added mass due to water dragging by the rolling hull b e is the equivalent linear roll damping coefficient k ϕ describes the restoring moment e g stiffness of the ship m w is the exciting moment m d is the additional external moment ω e is the encounter frequency of waves and t denotes time the moments m w and m d are time dependent in case of m w this allows for periodic changes in the value of roll excitation so groups of higher and lower waves can be simulated the time varying external moment m d can be used to simulate the short external excitation impulses e g caused by the wind dividing both sides of formula 1 by i xx a 44 and performing a few transformations the roll equation becomes 2 ϕ 2 μ ϕ g r x 2 g z ϕ ξ w t c o s ω e t ξ d t where μ is the damping coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r x is the gyration radius of a ship and added masses which is assumed to be constant for the purpose of this study gz is the righting arm ξ w is the exciting moment coefficient and ξ d is the coefficient of the additional external moment the restoring moment is nonlinear and is described by the gz curve for the purpose of this study two approaches towards gz approximation are used e g the ninth or higher

o s 3 ϕ b 3 s i n 3 ϕ where c 1 to c a a 1 to a 3 and b 1 to b 3 are the coefficients obtained with the use of the least squares method the approximation function was selected individually for each case of the righting arm curve to get the best fit most of the results presented in this study were obtained using equation 2 for two different constant values of the damping coefficient μ however the roll damping and as a consequence coefficients b e in equation 1 and μ in equation 2 depend on amplitude and frequency of rolling as well as on the forward speed of the ship therefore for one case the calculations were carried out with the damping dependent on the rolling amplitude and frequency but at zero forward speed to take into account the damping dependence on amplitude of rolling the damping term in equation 2 should be modified to the form given by himeno 1981 5 ϕ 2 α ϕ β ϕ ϕ γ ϕ 3 g r x 2 g z ϕ ξ w c o s ω e t ξ d t where α β and γ are coefficients which can be established for the particular value of rolling frequency on the base of the damping determined during model tests or calculated analytically e g according to the ikeda s method in this study a simple ikeda s method kawahara et al 2012 was used with one modification the bilge keel component was calculated according to the full ikeda s method ittc 2011 this modification was made due to the inconsistency in the results for the bilge keel component calculated according to the full and simplified method when the surface of damping coefficients for the considered range of amplitudes and frequencies of rolling is obtained then for the constant values of roll frequency the coefficients α β and γ are fitted fulfilling condition 6 for full spectrum of considered amplitudes if this spectrum is too wide the method gives some inaccuracy 6 μ ϕ a ω α 4 3 π ϕ a ω β 3 8 ϕ a 2 ω 2 γ the last step is performed so that the coefficients α β and γ take rolling frequency into account then the series of each

method is considered to be fully applicable for amplitudes not bigger than 0 4 rad and does not consider changes to roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence for the latter problem no exact analytical method is known at the moment some proposition of a solution can be found in bassler and reed 2010 all results presented in the paper were obtained with the use of the cas algebra computer system programs mathematica and matlab the numerical simulations of rolling for considered mathematical model were performed using the runge kutta method 4 rolling resonance frequency for a constant value of an exciting moment the largest roll amplitude occurs when the excitation frequency i e the encounter frequency of the waves ω e is equal to the natural roll frequency ω n such frequency very often is called the resonance frequency or most precisely the first harmonic resonance frequency ω r at resonance frequency and close to it the roll amplitude increases strongly fig 3 the calculation of the resonance frequency ω r is based on the value of the natural roll period τ 11 ω r 2 π τ the imo in the intact stability code imo 2008 gives the simple method for the calculation of the natural roll period 12 τ 2 c b g m 0 with the value of c coefficient c 0 373 0 023 b t 0 00043 l where gm 0 is the initial metacentric height c is the coefficient describing transverse gyration radius r x r x c b b is the breadth l is the length at the waterline and t is the mean draft of a ship however formula 12 is based on the initial metacentric height gm 0 which means that is valid only up to about 0 1 rad and assumes that the righting arms are linearized according to the formula gm 0 ϕ in some cases such a simplification can be used up to 0 3 0 4 rad fig 1 left and even up to 1 0 rad fig 1 right but very often clear discrepancies occur already at 0 2 rad fig 2 left and sometimes they even start from the origin of the gz curve fig 2 right as a consequence of the gz curve linearization the values of the natural roll period and resonance frequency are constant regardless the amplitude fig 3 left for a selected case using formulas 11 and 12 the resonance frequency is ω r0 0 491 rad s when the correction for the value of damping is made according to formula 13 the resonance frequency is ω r0 μ 0 486 rad s the index 0 at ω r0 means that the value of the resonance frequency was calculated using the gm 0 in fig 3 and subsequent figures the line of resonance frequency calculated using the gm 0 is marked gm0 fig 3 left shows that the maxima of all curves coincide with the gm0 line for comparison between the linear and nonlinear approach to the restoring moment roll spectra for the same case obtained from rolling simulations made using the real nonlinear form of the gz curve are shown in fig 3 right 13 ω r 0 μ ω r 0 2 2 μ 2 the analysis of roll period as a function of roll amplitude was done by wawrzyński and krata 2016a on the base of seven different ships the paper clearly shows how inaccurate the roll period calculated on the base of the gm 0 can be figs 4 and 5 illustrates the examples of convergence and discrepancy between the roll periods calculated according to the imo method description gm0 and obtained from simulations made using the gz curve description num in fig 4 the convergence is quite good but in fig 5 the discrepancy is unacceptable the accompanying graphs show the near linear characteristic of the gz curve up to 0 8 rad for the lng carrier fig 4 and the visible nonlinearity present almost from curve origin for the general cargo ship fig 5 among 30 loading conditions which were tested the unacceptable discrepancy concerns 13 cases and real convergence occurs only in 8 cases in the same paper wawrzyński and krata 2016a the method for the roll period prediction taking the nonlinearity of the gz curve and the roll amplitude into account is proposed the main formula is very similar to the imo one 14 τ ϕ a 2 c b g m e q ϕ a where the value of c coefficient remains the same as given in formula 12 and gmeq ϕ a denotes the equivalent metacentric height for a specified roll amplitude ϕ a the formula for the equivalent metacentric height calculation is the following 15 g m e q ϕ a 0 ϕ a g z ϕ d ϕ ϕ a 2 g z ϕ a 2 ϕ a according to formula 15 the value of the equivalent metacentric height gm eq and as a consequence the roll period and roll resonance frequency depend on the roll amplitude 16 ω r ϕ a 2 π τ ϕ a when the correction for the value of damping is made then formula 16 becomes 17 ω r 2 ϕ a 2 π τ ϕ a 2 2 μ 2 an alternative formula was proposed by contento et al 1996 and next explored by francescutto and contento 1999 when roll damping is taken into account the formula reads 18 ω r 2 ϕ a ω r 0 2 3 4 c 3 ϕ a 2 5 8 c 5 ϕ a 4 35 64 c 7 ϕ a 6 63 128 c 9 ϕ a 8 231 512 c 11 ϕ a 10 2 μ 2 where ω r0 denotes the roll resonance frequency obtained for small roll amplitudes i e with using gm 0 like in the imo formula and ϕ a is the roll amplitude the gz curve needs to be approximated by the polynomial in the form 19 g z ϕ g m 0 ϕ c 3 ϕ 3 c 5 ϕ 5 c 7 ϕ 7 c 9 ϕ 9 the coefficients c3 c5 in formula 18 are equal to the coefficients c3 c5 of the gz approximation function 19 formula 17 combined with 14 and 15 in the future will be called the gm eq method graphically the resonance frequencies for consecutive amplitudes are presented in the form of the resonance curve which in all of the following figures is marked gmeq the accuracy of the gm eq method is presented in fig 6 where the roll spectra for different values of an exciting moment calculated for two ships are shown the resonance curve calculated by the gm eq method accurately passes through the maximum of each curve which means that it reflects the resonance frequency of oscillations however for the loading conditions where the simulation results reveal the bifurcation phenomenon the resonance curve obtained from gm eq method is not very accurate fig 7 the inaccuracy is evident in regions with significant jumps of the amplitude finally it is worth mentioning that the gm eq method has been used with a quite good result in the research performed by acanfora et al 2017 during this research the 6 dof model of ships motions called laidyn was utilized roll simulations of a containership c11 class were conducted for the study of the synchronous and parametric resonance the simulations were performed for irregular seas described by the jonswap spectrum for the pacific ocean one of the effects of this simulations is the spectral analysis of the irregular sea and ships roll response for both presented cases i e synchronous and parametric roll the resonance frequency calculated according to the gm eq method shows a quite good coincidence with the peak of the roll spectrum the only objection concerns the arbitrary choice of the reference roll amplitude nonetheless this research shows clearly that the roll characteristic determined on the basis of the 1 dof equation can reveal a good coincidence with the results of simulations of the 6 dof model performed for irregular seas 5 considered ships for this study three ships are considered all of them were explored in the scope of the research mentioned above because of the extent of the simulations necessary to perform for every ship only one loading condition is selected the loading conditions were selected so as to obtain two cases of the gz curve with softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 and one case with hardening spring characteristic fig 10 the softening spring characteristic means that for an increasing angle of the heel the inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve decreases therefore the hardening spring means that for an increasing angle of the heel the inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve increases however when the hardening characteristic of the gz curve occurs it always concerns only the initial segment of the curve for angles coming to the curve maximum characteristic become softening fig 10 in fig 9 it can be seen that the initial segment of the gz curve is slightly hardening but regardless of this when large amplitudes of rolling are considered generally the characteristic in this case should be treated as softening this is because the maximum of the gz curve is located at the relatively small angle the main particulars of the considered ships and values of the initial metacentric height gm 0 roll period and frequency for selected loading conditions are shown in table 1 figs 8 10 show the gz curves and roll period curves for each case i e ship in the selected loading condition for each gz curve to get the best fit a different approximation function was used the used functions are given in the description under the figures the roll period curves are plotted according to the methods based on gm eq 14 and gm 0 12 6 bistability in rolling the typical and easiest way of determining a frequency response curve consists of performing rolling simulations for a series of consecutive exciting frequencies in the range of the examined values within the theoretical analysis the value of the exciting moment often is assumed to be constant however when research is combined with an experiment then it must be determined by the excitation frequency the exemplary frequency response curve for rolling also known as roll spectrum is shown in fig 11 the roll spectrum like in fig 11 does not show bistability areas but reveals only one frequency of bifurcation frequency 0 315 rad s where the jump of amplitude is visible roll time histories for frequencies 0 314 0 315 and 0 316 rad s are presented in fig 12 at ω 0 314 rad s the roll amplitude is equal 0 4 rad when at ω 0 315 rad s it achieves 0 715 rad however the frequency of bifurcation is not clear even though at ω 0 315 rad s the roll amplitude of 0 715 rad is achieved it occurs after 300 s of simulation between the frequencies 0 314 and 0 315 rad s the time needed to achieve the amplitude of 0 715 rad is much longer to get a better picture of the roll spectrum it is necessary to perform two rolling simulations with continuously changing frequency one simulation is performed for increasing values of the excitation frequency while the second one for decreasing values of the excitation frequency falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 the frequency should be slowly varied to get a quasi stationary process the effect of such performed simulations is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 when increasing the excitation frequency from 0 20 rad s the roll amplitude rises from 0 215 rad up to 0 4 rad at ω 0 314 rad s where the bifurcation occurs and the roll amplitude jumps to 0 715 rad when continuing the frequency increase the roll amplitude decreases starting the simulation from ω 0 55 rad s towards the smaller value of the excitation frequency the roll amplitude rises to 0 763 rad at ω 0 286 rad s where the bifurcation occurs and the amplitude suddenly falls to 0 31 rad such simulation results suggest that for frequencies between 0 286 and 0 314 rad s for the same value of excitation moment rolling with two different amplitudes is possible this phenomenon is called bistability and sometimes multivaluedness falzarano and taz ul mulk 1994 in fig 13 the bistability region a is marked limited by two bifurcation frequencies the possibility of rolling with two different amplitudes for the same value of excitation moment refers to the different nature of these two oscillation modes it is known that for a constant value of an exciting moment roll amplitude differs for the oscillations in the resonant and non resonant mode in the case shown in fig 13 the resonance curve i e resonance frequency deviates in the direction of smaller frequencies with increasing amplitude for softening spring characteristic of the gz curve because of the nonlinearity of the restoring moment simplifying when this deviation is sufficiently large and the vertical distance between the amplitude of non resonant rolling and the resonance curve is big enough the non resonant and resonant oscillations are possible for the same value of excitation moment obviously in fig 13 at ω 0 30 rad s of the left lower branch of the roll spectrum the amplitude is higher than at ω 0 20 rad s which is caused by a better coincidence between the natural roll frequency ω n ω r0 and excitation moment frequency ω e however such rolling cannot be called resonant oscillations yet the oscillations will become resonant ones for the excitation frequency above the bifurcation frequency 0 314 rad s or above 0 286 rad s but only if the jump to the right upper branch of the roll spectrum is forced in bistability region a fig 13 for a transition between the non resonant and resonant oscillations mode amplitude an impulse is necessary this impulse can be a group of two or three higher or lower waves depending on the direction of the transition or another extortion caused for e g by the wind ships maneuvers or couplings with another degree of freedom fig 14 shows four cases of roll time history for the lng carrier in the selected loading condition with roll spectrum shown in fig 13 two cases are for ω 0 30 rad s and two for ω 0 29 rad s so both frequencies are within the bistability region initially in each case the rolling is non resonant after 300 s of the simulation the value of the exciting moment was increased by 30 for a period from 20 to 60 s 1 3 higher waves at frequency 0 30 rad s increasing the excitation value for 20 s has no effect however 40 s appear to be sufficient to force a jump into resonant oscillations at frequency 0 29 rad s to get a jump 60 s of increased excitation value were necessary when the value of excitation moment is increased more energy is transferred to the system at ω 0 30 rad s the distance between amplitudes of non resonant and resonant oscillations is smaller than at ω 0 29 rad s so to induce the transition less amount of added energy is needed the logical conclusion is that the probability of a jump rises with the decrease of the distance between the amplitudes of non resonant and resonant oscillations to induce the transition forcing a jump exactly to the amplitude of resonant rolling is not indispensable just achieving a certain minimal level of roll amplitude causes the system to reach the amplitude of resonant oscillations for the case in fig 13 the nonlinear system described by equation 2 for assumed parameters is unstable in area a the possible steady state solutions are the non resonant and resonant rolling with amplitude specified by limiting the area a by the lower and upper branch of the roll spectrum for each frequency in region a an analysis of domains of attraction can be made where the attractor for each domain will be the amplitude of the non resonant or resonant oscillations an example of an analysis of domains of attraction for rolling at the bifurcation frequency was made by francescutto and contento 1999 like increasing the excitation moment in an exact combination of the value and period causes the transition from the non resonant oscillations to the resonant ones so decreasing the value of the excitation moment for an exact period can induce the reverse transition as shown in fig 15 right performing rolling simulations for frequencies within the bistability region attention to the process of introducing the exciting moment is needed fig 16 shows two roll time histories obtained for the same loading condition of the lng carrier the same value of exciting moment and the same initial conditions of simulation the left graph shows resonant oscillations with the amplitude 0 84 rad while in the right one oscillations are non resonant with the amplitude 0 41 rad the difference between these two simulations is caused by the process of achieving the appointed value by the exciting moment coefficient in the first case the excitation was present with the appointed value from the beginning of the simulation while in the second case the excitation was continuously increasing from zero to the appointed value during the initial 100 s of the simulation the presence of the exciting moment with the appointed value from the beginning of the simulation means there was dynamic action therefore before rolling stabilization with an amplitude corresponding to the force of excitation a few swings with bigger amplitudes sometimes occur now if during these few swings the amplitude achieves the domain of attraction of resonant oscillations the amplitude of resonant rolling will become the stable solution of the roll equation 2 when the excitation is continuously increased from zero to the appointed value the action is semi static and the solution will always be non resonant rolling in bistability region additionally it should be noted that the analysis made in this chapter is valid if initial conditions of equation 2 are equal to 0 ϕ 0 ϕ 0 7 rolling bistability areas when the phenomena of bistability multivaluedness and amplitude jumps are discussed the roll spectrum like shown in fig 13 is most often used unfortunately the form of this graph as well as the analysis presented in the previous chapter do not show the complexity of rolling in the bistability region because of the variability of sea waves and the possibility of additional impulses occurrence e g wind couplings a two dimensional analysis is necessary this analysis should be made for the assumed surface of excitation frequency values in combination with external perturbations taking the form of an impact with a variable value of the force in the course of such an analysis rolling bistability areas were determined figs 17 21 and 24 show bistability areas for gz curves with softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 while fig 22 concerns the gz curve with hardening spring characteristic fig 10 figs 17 22 are the effect of simulations carried out with the use of equation 2 for two constant values of the damping coefficient while fig 24 is obtained using equation 10 where the damping depends on roll amplitude and frequency all simulations were performed for the same initial conditions ϕ 0 ϕ 0 and for the same time period 1 500 s the excitation moment was slowly increased from 0 to the target value during the early 200 s of each simulation for the frequencies where a large deviation of the resonance curve occurs for a period of 10 s the perturbation was introduced after 700 s of the simulation have passed the perturbation was introduced in the form of an additional external moment initially the value of this moment was equal to 20 of the exciting moment if the transition did not occur then in the next simulations its value was increased up to the jump occurrence or capsizing such a procedure implies a very large number of simulations which have to be done in order to determine the bistability areas obviously when the value of the additional external moment which causes the transition is established for one frequency then for nearby frequencies its value differs slightly finally it should be noted that bistability areas are applicable only for the loading condition of the ship for which they were determined in the following text the meaning of the terms area and region differs the term area is used concerning a separate part of the graph whereas the term region refers to the frequency range for example in fig 17 area b is limited by areas c and d and a dashed vertical line indicates the border between regions a and b at ω 0 287 rad s so in the same fig 17 region b means frequencies between 0 287 rad s dashed vertical line and 0 346 rad s point p additionally the two cases of bifurcation are differentiated the first case is the bifurcation due to the frequency change and this will be called type f the second one is the bifurcation due to the change of the excitation moment value and this will be called type e therefore the parts of figs 17 22 can be described as following point p the bistability origin point the point of contact between bistability areas c and d the appearance of this point starts the development of bistability areas the bistability region extends from this point towards lower frequencies for the softening spring gz curves and towards higher frequencies for the hardening spring gz curves the position of point p is always close to the resonance curve backbone curve areas c and d rolling bistability areas in area c the oscillations are non resonant but the energy provided by the excitation moment is big enough for resonant oscillations within the area d the transitions between the non resonant and resonant oscillations and so between c and d areas were discussed in chapter 6 when figs 14 and 15 were described each point of rolling within area c corresponds to one point of rolling within area d the lower limit of the area c dashed line determines the minimum value of the energy excitation moment needed for resonant oscillations with the amplitude close to the resonance curve it is worth noting that resonant oscillations within the area d can have amplitudes which slightly vary from the value of the resonance curve for a given frequency so in the bistability region the resonance curve does not determine the exact values of the resonant oscillations amplitude and this is why the resonance curve does not pass accurately through the maximum of each curve in fig 7 accordingly this is why in the bistability region the backbone curve seems to be a more adequate name than the resonance curve area b appears together with the bistability areas c and d area b is limited by areas c and d and the line of frequency of the bifurcation type f dashed vertical line in fig 17 usually this bifurcation frequency is the border between areas b and a however when the bistability areas c and d are not expanded enough area a does not appear like in fig 22 within area b the equation 2 is unstable upper and lower limits of this area are the lines of bifurcations type f and type e this means that regardless of the parameter which is changing entering into area b causes a jump because of bifurcation further entering area b at the lower limit causes a jump not to the upper limit of area b but the upper limit of area d by analogy entering area b at the upper limit causes a jump not to the lower limit of area b but the lower limit of area c the above means that results of rolling simulations performed for irregular wave for frequencies within region b can be very confusing and ambiguous in interpretation rolling can seem chaotic region a is the most often determined part of the bistability region like in fig 13 while the whole bistability region includes regions a and b usually region a is limited by areas c and d and the two frequencies of bifurcation type f internal between regions a and b and external appointed by the edge of areas c and d like in fig 17 or by the angle of vanishing like in fig 18 or by the roll spectrum curve like in fig 21 in the case of the offshore support vessel figs 19 and 20 the external border is not marked because of the inaccuracy of the gz curve approximation for angles over 1 1 rad area a the area of unstable solutions of the roll equation 2 for parameters resulting in oscillations within areas c and d depending on the instantaneous point of rolling within area a e g due to the external impulse or the transient change of the exciting moment or the process of introducing the exciting moment at the rolling simulation beginning or initial conditions of the roll equation the stable solution follows to areas c or d for each frequency of region a an analysis of domains of attraction the range of amplitudes can be made where the attractor for each domain will be the amplitude of the non resonant area c or resonant area d oscillations point k the critical point this point appears only in fig 17 although the roll amplitude of point k is smaller than the angle of vanishing decreasing the frequency or increasing the value of the excitation moment causes capsizing during the analysis of bistability areas point k appears only for sufficiently large values of the excitation moment the position of point k depends on the maximum value of the excitation moment which was considered during the bistability areas development process area g appears only together with the critical point k in area g despite the small roll amplitude the value of excitation moment is so big that transition about the resonance curve results in capsizing in fig 17 area g is not closed because it was not fully determined analysis was concluded at the left end of area c and d for the offshore support vessel figs 19 and 20 the external border for areas c and d as for region a was not designated because of the inaccuracy of the gz curve approximation for angles over 1 1 rad the gz curve shaped like in fig 8 cannot be approximated by the polynomial power series with acceptable accuracy wawrzyński 2015 therefore for this purpose the third order trigonometric polynomial in form 4 was adapted as an effect a good fitting of the gz curve was obtained but only for angles up to 1 1 rad to reveal how the value of damping affects the extent and location of the bistability areas for the lng carrier and the osv vessel the analysis was performed for two different values of damping coefficient μ 0 05 and 0 08 the corresponding graphs are figs 17 and 18 for the lng carrier and figs 19 and 20 for the offshore support vessel the changes of areas c and d but especially changes in the location of point p should show how much damping determines the susceptibility of the ship to bistability and amplitude jumps as well as bifurcations however to make sure that such a comparison is not trivial together with increasing the value of damping coefficient the value of exciting moment was increased too the goal was to keep the surfaces under the roll spectra and values of roll amplitude at similar levels it should also be noted that such an analysis is not all inclusive because damping nonlinearity and dependency on amplitude and frequency are not taken into account comparing graphs for the lng carrier figs 17 and 18 it can be stated that increased damping causes the bistability areas to decrease noticeably it seems to be a most reasonable conclusion but for the osv vessel figs 19 and 20 this effect did not occur it is very likely that it is caused by the shape of the gz curve which in the range of 0 25 0 85 rad is approximately flat fig 8 however to confirm this dependency additional simulations and analysis performed for other ships with similar characteristics of the gz curve are required additionally for the lng carrier the critical point k and area g vanished for both ships a shift of point p is evident for the bigger value of damping coefficient the distance between point p and the line of natural oscillation frequency ω r0 increases the vertical position of point p also is changing it shifts towards higher amplitudes both changes indicate a reduced susceptibility of the ship to the occurrence of the bistability and amplitude jumps phenomena interestingly the border between areas a and b does not shift at all for the lng carrier while for the osv a shift is clear for the lng carrier region b significantly decreases but for the osv it significantly increases this is important because as stated previously the results of rolling simulations performed for irregular wave for frequencies within region b can show rolling which seems chaotic as it was noted graphs in figs 18 and 20 were determined not only for the increased value of damping coefficient but also for the increased value of excitation moment nevertheless in both figures the roll spectra determined for the increased damping and the initial value of excitation are also plotted dot dash line a combination of the roll spectrum and bistability area determined for the higher value of the excitation moment provides a possibility of accessible interpretations of roll amplitude changes due to the excitation frequency change for the lng carrier fig 18 the roll spectrum for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 0316 does not pass the bistability areas this means that for μ 0 08 and ξ w 0 0316 despite the nonlinearity of rolling and a considerable deviation of the resonance curve in the range of amplitudes for ξ w 0 0316 the jumps of the amplitude will not occur the scheme for the osv ship is different fig 20 let us follow the roll spectrum curve starting from the frequency of 0 80 rad s initially approaching the resonance curve the roll amplitude increases due to the increase in strength of the resonance effect we can assume that at frequencies close to point p the oscillations become resonant at ω 0 513 rad s the roll curve enters area d and despite the relatively small value of the excitation moment and a considerable distance from ω r0 the amplitude still increases due to the almost accurate resonance effect the position is close to the resonance curve nevertheless the excitation moment is not large enough for the roll curve to be able to follow the resonance curve so the roll spectrum curve crosses area d approaching its lower limit drifting apart from the resonance curve the resonance effect is weakening and at a frequency slightly bigger than 0 40 rad s the roll amplitude significantly decreases when the area d lower limit is reached a jump bifurcation type f down to area c non resonant oscillations occurs the new roll amplitude stabilizes at the lower limit of area c with the value of merely 0 126 rad now following in the reverse direction we start at the frequency of 0 30 rad s and at ω 0 402 rad s the roll curve enters area c hereafter for the assumed value of the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 05 resonant oscillations are possible but to obtain them an accordingly strong impulse forcing the transition to area d is necessary further following in the direction of the resonance frequency ω r0 the slow increase of the roll amplitude is continued at ω 0 513 rad s the upper limit of area c is achieved and entering area b causes a jump bifurcation type f the oscillations become resonant and the new roll amplitude stabilizes at the upper limit of area d with the value of 0 557 rad the graph of bistability areas determined for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 07 fig 20 can be easily adapted to smaller values of the coefficients here for ξ w 0 05 the new graph includes parts of the bistability areas c and d located below the roll spectrum curve obtained for ξ w 0 05 the effect is shown in fig 21 bistability areas c and d like bistability regions a and b are reduced the frequency of bifurcation which separates regions a and b moves in the direction of point p additionally region a is limited on the left side at the new bifurcation frequency the position of the bistability origin point p does not change the presented above analysis concerns ships in loading conditions where the righting arm curve has the softening spring characteristic figs 8 and 9 usually the gz curve has such a feature when the value of the initial metacentric height gm 0 is significantly large for loading conditions with small values of the gm 0 most often the characteristic of the gz curve is the hardening spring like in fig 10 in the hardening spring system from the beginning the resonance curve deviates towards the higher frequencies together with the amplitude increase however when the roll amplitude approaches the angle of the maximum of the gz curve the character of the gz curve changes to the softening spring from this point the direction of the resonance curve deviation changes too such a scheme of the resonance curve change is presented in fig 6 where both graphs were determined for ships with relatively small values of the gm 0 1 50 m and 1 00 m therefore the analysis for the system with hardening spring characteristic of the restoring moment was made for the 5 000 teu container ship in loading condition with gm 0 0 50 m bistability areas for this container ship determined for the excitation coefficient ξ w 0 025 and the damping coefficient μ 0 05 are shown in fig 22 as described above at small values of amplitude the resonance curve significantly deviates towards higher frequencies at the sufficiently large change of the resonance frequency 20 ω r ϕ a ω r 0 d m i n ϕ a μ the bistability origin point p appears right after bistability areas c and d and area b appear too at this stage of bistability areas development area and region a do not exist for its appearance a big enough vertical distance between the areas c and d is needed further deviation of the resonance curve in the current direction would result in the expansion of the bistability areas and the appearance of area a like in figs 17 21 however at the angle close to 0 7 rad the gz curve changes its character to softening spring and the resonance curve starts to deviate in the reverse direction so areas c d and b are no longer expanded the drawings discussed above concern the constant value of roll damping in fig 24 the bistability areas for damping dependent on amplitude and frequency are shown the calculations were made for the offshore support vessel where damping coefficients were calculated according to the simple ikeda s method fig 23 left and next were approximated using coefficients α ω β ω and γ ω in the roll equation 10 the effect of such an approximation is shown in fig 23 right drawing in the case presented in fig 23 for amplitudes in the range 0 1 0 8 rad the difference between the damping calculated and approximated does not exceed 6 the bigger differences for small and large amplitudes are caused by a too wide range of roll amplitudes taken into account in the course of the approximation generally it is known that the ikeda s method is not intended for large amplitudes and does not comply with changes to roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence nevertheless because this study is more of a qualitative than quantitative analysis this problems was omitted comparing fig 24 with figs 19 and 20 it can be stated that the roll damping dependence on amplitude and frequency is significant in the sense of its value for small amplitudes it has values smaller then 0 08 and even 0 05 and bigger values at large amplitudes additionally the value of damping decreases together with frequency this causes the bistability region to extend in the direction of lower frequencies the border between region a and b shifts in the same direction 8 summary in nonlinear oscillations rolling the primary reason for the appearance of bistability and related amplitude jumps for some conditions caused by bifurcation is a strong deviation of the resonance frequency resonance curve from the natural roll frequency ω n following with the increase in the roll amplitude the strength of the oscillations nonlinearity depends on the nonlinearity of the gz curve in the considered range of the roll amplitude therefore the most significant factor for the potential for the occurrence of the strong nonlinear oscillations is the location of the maximum of the gz curve the roll spectrum used nowadays is insufficient to describe the extent and nature of bistability and amplitude jumps in this study in order to achieve this goal the expanded form of the roll spectrum is proposed this new form of the roll spectrum includes the bistability areas the bistability origin point and the resonance curve the procedure for the identification of bistability areas is described and discussed in sections 6 and 7 the examples of bistability areas determined for three ships are shown in figs 17 22 and 24 the identification of bistability areas for the maximum considered value of the excitation moment provides the graph which can be called the roll bistability map the bistability map shows the complexity of nonlinear oscillations and allows for straightforward interpretation of the amplitude jumps which can occur during rolling simulations and ship model tests however it is important to notice that the new form of roll spectra which is proposed in the study does not describe the behavior of the ship at irregular sea but only shows the region of frequencies where chaotic rolling is likely additionally it should be highlighted that a bistability map is valid only for a given loading condition the results of the research presented by wawrzyński and krata 2016b suggest that the problem of bistability and related jumps of amplitude concern most of the loading conditions where the maximum of the gz curve is located at angles smaller than 0 8 rad the conductive factor is the significant value of the initial metacentric height gm 0 however the fundamental parameter of the susceptibility of the ship to amplitude jumps is the appearance and location of the bistability origin point p if point p does not exist or when at the frequency of point p the roll amplitude for the considered value of excitation moment is smaller than the amplitude of point p bistability and amplitude jumps does not occur another significant parameter is roll damping the most unpredictable are the oscillations within region b where jumps can be caused by a minimal change of the excitation frequency or excitation value or by a slight additional impulse e g wind couplings inside this region the rolling in irregular seas with moderate and large amplitudes can seem chaotic within region a especially its external part more distant from point p transitions between areas of non resonant and resonant oscillations need a distinctly bigger impulse so roll amplitude jumps are less probable it is especially important to emphasize that the presented study in its actual form is mainly a comprehensive description of the bistability phenomenon which can be observed in the mathematical model of rolling additionally the results of rolling simulations were obtained with the use of several simplifications 1 dof equation constant value of added mass or constant value of damping coefficient for most calculations the damping problem is not exhausted even in the case where the damping is dependent on roll amplitude and frequency fig 24 this is because changes to the roll damping due to bilge keel emergence and deck submergence are not considered in the method used the bilge keel emergence strongly changes the roll damping since the damping caused by bilge keel responds to 50 80 of the overall value of damping for large amplitudes himeno 1981 regardless of the simplifications mentioned above the study shows the potential that lies in the analyzed issue the presented approach to the bistability phenomenon and amplitude jumps as to the bifurcation phenomenon can be used in the explanation of notable divergences between the results of numerical simulations for rolling with large amplitudes at resonance frequencies performed with the use of different multi dof mathematical models of ships motions the elaboration of the detection method for the p point existence can be useful in the optimization of a ships loading condition at the future of this research the use of more advanced mathematical models including the 6 dof nonlinear model of ships motions as well as the performance of the corresponding model tests are planned as it was stated in section 3 waves and couplings can have significant impact on the nonlinearity phenomena since the righting arm depends on the instantaneous form of the submerged part of the hull changes of the gz curve due to the ships position in waves increase or decrease the nonlinearity effect with respect to nonlinearity of the still water gz curve and this admittedly should be tested other very interesting issue is that a nonlinear ordinary differential equation such as equation 2 should yield certain nonlinearity in terms of higher harmonics of the simulated response 
23749,in order to analyze the fluctuating pressure and rudder force characteristics of a full scale hull propeller rudder system a hybrid structured unstructured grid was combined with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and volume of fluid vof methods to perform a numerical prediction of model and full scale performance for the kriso container ship kcs case a numerical simulation for the self propulsion test of a full scale ship was first performed to obtain the propeller velocity under the self propulsion point the results of which indicated a notable wake fraction and velocity scale effect at the self propulsion point transient two phase flow calculations were then performed for the model and full scale kcs hull propeller rudder systems according to the monitoring data the hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force fluctuated periodically over time and the full scale fluctuating pressure exhibited a higher time average value as compared to the model scale pressure the frequency spectrum curves were also generated by the fast fourier transform algorithm the analysis of the frequency spectrum data indicated that the peaks of the fluctuating pressure and rudder force reached their respective maximums at the blade passing frequency bpf after which the peak gradually decreased and the full scale ship reduced more quickly furthermore fluctuating amplitude of full scale ship was bigger than model scale keywords full scale propeller free surface fluctuating pressure rudder force scale effect 1 introduction1 propellers periodically produce time varying exciting forces in the three dimensional non uniform wake field of the stern including the bearing force transferred to the hull by the shaft system the fluctuating pressure and the fluctuating rudder force transferred to the hull surface by the fluid yousheng and guoqiang 1987 the hull surface fluctuating pressure overpowers these forces when the propeller is cavitating as it is the largest contributor of vibration and noise in the hull as a result studies have focused on the generation of variation pattern and prediction methods for this fluctuating pressure in fact the amplitude of the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure has already been categorized as a gauge to measure the success of a propeller design xiong 2002 research strategies for the measurement of the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure generally include theoretical calculations empirical formulae and test measurements in terms of theoretical research huse and wang 1982 generated a systematic study on the effect of the hull and free surface on the fluctuating pressure and obtained an estimation method to determining the free surface factor and solid wall factor thereby providing an important reference for subsequent theoretical research on fluctuating pressure van gent 1994 then established a new idea to examine the effect of the cavitation volume on the propeller blade and its variability on the fluctuating pressure given that the cavitation growth acceleration is the main contributor for the fluctuating pressure within the blade frequency and the low frequency noise empirical formula methods are generally applied to preliminary ship designs given their simple calculations and fairly rough results thus far mature empirical formulae include the holden method takahashi method fujino method and the calculation method described in the russian handbook of ship structural mechanics in addition the china classification society ccs also published a cb z method to estimate pressure fluctuations though it has not been widely accepted li 2013 pressure fluctuation test measurements started early and involved both model and full scale measurements previous literature huse 1972 friesch j 1984 duttweiler and brennen 2002 xiong et al 2002 wu et al 2010 has reported the findings and intensive studies performed on the effects of the propeller cavitation and air content in the test and model wake field correction nevertheless the complex coupling between the propeller and the rudder working at the stern has made it difficult to predict the accurate propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force by either theoretical calculation or test measurement however the development of the cfd numerical calculation method validated the effectiveness of numerical processes in predicting and analyzing the hull surface recently an increasing amount of studies have numerically calculated the fluctuating pressure of which the calculation results ji et al 2012 kehr and kao 2011 were well in agreement with the experimental values since the development of numerical research and predictions for the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure the majority of studies focused on the simulation of non uniform axial wake flow with minimal observations on the contribution of the free surface and the propeller rudder interference furthermore models have been generally categorized as research objects such that few full scale pressure fluctuation numerical predictions have been reported therefore it is essential to perform full scale numerical prediction studies on the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure for a hull propeller rudder system taking into account the effect of the free surface the present study characterized a kcs ship and kp505 propeller as the study objects a numerical pool model was established on ansys fluent software transient two phase flow calculations were first generated for the model hull propeller rudder system under self propulsion conditions to obtain the model scale hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force a full scale simulation was then performed on the hull propeller under self propulsion conditions to determine the self propulsion point of the ship based on the results the full scale propeller induced fluctuating pressure and rudder force on the hall surface were calculated and compared with the calculation results of the model we then identified the full scale and model flow fields and wave patterns a systematic analysis was also performed on the time and frequency domains of the hull surface fluctuating pressure the rudder force and their respective scale effects given the computational difficulties and the methods the present study focused on the pressure fluctuations induced by the propeller rotation to conduct a pressure analysis without cavitation future research must consider the influence of cavitation on the pressure fluctuations 2 mathematical approach 2 1 control equation and turbulence model fluid flow is governed by physical conservation laws basic conservation laws include the law of conservation of mass the law of momentum conservation and the law of conservation of energy the present study characterized water as the medium water is an incompressible fluid with negligible heat exchange thereby requiring only the mass and momentum conservation equations for calculations the detailed formulae are provided in previous literature wang 2004 the present study employed a shear stress transport sst turbulence model for the calculation of the propeller hydrodynamic performance this model effectively integrates the merits of both the k ε and k ω models and well simulates complex flows in the presence of flow separation and strong adverse pressure gradients 2 2 volume of fluid vof model the vof method karim et al 2014 calculates the free surface by investigating the fluid grid volume fraction function of the grid cells and tracing the variation of the fluid rather than the particle movement on the free surface if the value of the function on each grid of the flow field is known the movement interface can be traced the entire computational domain is defined as ω the main phase fluid domain is defined as ω 1 and the secondary phase fluid domain is defined as ω 2 the vof defines the following function 1 ω x t 1 x ω 1 0 x ω 2 in addition the velocity field is composed of two non intersoluble fluids is defined as v u v the function ω then conforms to 2 ω t u ω x v ω y 0 on each grid i i j the integer of ω x t on the grid is defined as c i j thereby defining the vop function 3 c i j 1 δ v i j i i j ω x t d v the vof function also conforms to eq 2 4 c t u c x v c y 0 when c 0 the fluids in the grids are all secondary phase fluids when c 1 the grids are filled with main phase fluids and when 0 c 1 the grids that contain fluid interfaces become interface grids 3 calculation modeling 3 1 calculation object the present study characterized a kcs container ship which was modeled at a reduced scale of 31 6 as the study object alejandro et al 2011 the ship was accompanied by a kp505 propeller the full scale parameters are presented in table 1 wang et al 2016 3 2 working conditions the presented calculation conditions include model scale and full scale simulations that did not consider the trim and sinkage the model scale calculation conditions included the bare hull resistance and the hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force on the integrated hull propeller rudder system the bare hull resistance was calculated by the steady vof method whereas the self propulsion calculations were performed by the transient vof method the full and model scale calculation conditions exhibited similarities though the full scale calculations involved more conditions such as the hull resistance and propeller thrust under various calculated velocities table 2 presents the details of the working conditions 3 3 establishment of the computational domain and setting of computational parameters the flow field computational domain is presented as follows the inlet is 1 l pp from the bow the outlet is 2 l pp from the stern and the side and bottom are both 1 l pp from the hull surface as illustrated in fig 1 the inlet included an air velocity inlet and a water velocity inlet which were identical the outlet was set as a pressure outlet using the user defined function in ansys fluent the vertical pressure of the outlet varied as follows 5 p p 0 z t p 0 ρ g z t z t where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration z is the vertical coordinate and t is the draught the upper boundary of the flow domain is defined as a symmetrical plane and the surface side and bottom of the hull are all defined as a nonslip wall the multiple reference frame method was employed for the steady calculation of the propeller rotation movement and the slide mesh method was applied to the transient calculations the time step was taken as δ t m 0 0001 s for the model scale calculations and δ t s 0 0004 s for the full scale calculations the blades rotate approximately 3 in each time step for both model and full scale calculations the vof method was employed to trace the free surface while the simplec method was applied for the pressure velocity coupled iteration 3 4 grid division the present study employed hybrid grids for calculations the entire grid division was executed using icem software ji 2011 a small part of the flow domain at the stern was divided into non structured grids to save grid division given that the large stern curvature of the contraction challenged the division of the structured grids the rest of the ship including the propeller was divided into hexahedron structured grids the structured grids were connected to the non structured grids by the interface information was transferred in the flow field by interface interpolations in the numerical calculations the model scale presented the same grid topology as the full scale simulation the hull surface grids are presented in fig 2 a the only differences were observed in the thickness of the first layer of the cells and the number of grid nodes in the 3 directions generally it is suitable to limit the model scale y values within the recommended value of about 60 which corresponds to the thickness of the first layer of grids about 0 8 1 mm few studies have reported on the controllable range of the full scale y values therefore the present study empirically and numerically determined a suitable y value of around 300 wang 2014 which corresponds the thickness of the first layer of grids about 1 2 mm the thickness of the first layer of grids in the structured part can be directly defined by the parameters whereas the non structured part of the stern required the addition of prism grid layers as presented in fig 2 b the details of the propeller grids are illustrated in fig 2 c notably when dividing the computational grids the number of cells was increased around the bow and stern as these areas presented more dramatic flow field changes to better capture the free surface more grid nodes were added near the free surface to enhance the grid resolution see fig 3 4 calculation results analysis 4 1 validation of the calculation method three grid cases were applied to the grid sensitivity analysis of the model calculations the number of grids and calculation results are listed in table 3 since comparison of the results with experiment fluid dynamics efd indicated an agreement between the cfd results and the efd when the whole grid number achieved 4 31 m case2 was applied in subsequent calculations 4 2 calculation results analysis of the full scale self propulsion simulation the self propulsion point of the full scale ship must first be obtained to calculate the full scale propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure the reynolds number of a full scale ship is different than that of a model with 24 knot velocity such that changes in the self propulsion point are observed following an increase of the scale therefore it is impossible to convert the full scale self propulsion point from the model scale test results the present study repredicted the full scale self propulsion point with the same velocity variable used in the model test given that the friction resistance correction was not included in the full scale calculation the propeller velocity at the self propulsion point was determined when the propeller produced thrust was counterbalanced with the full scale resistance the full scale self propulsion test curves for v s 12 346 m s are presented in table 4 the propulsive factor under self propulsion was determined by interpolation using the thrust identify method calculation results are given in table 4 wherein c t is the total resistance coefficient of the bare hull c t sp is the total resistance coefficient of the integrated hull propeller rudder system under self propulsion w m is the wake fraction and t m is the thrust deduction fraction the values in the table demonstrate good agreement between the presented calculations and the calculations and test conversion results from the literature alejandro et al 2011 significant differences between the full scale calculations and model test equivalents were observed in the velocity and wake faction at the self propulsion point where errors were 5 82 and 8 96 respectively which was due to the smaller ship wake fraction in the full scale simulation than in the model therefore the velocity of the full scale ship at the self propulsion point was expected to be larger than the equivalent of the model table 4 also lists the self propulsion test results at the given velocities and test results of the model by comparison except for the thrust coefficient and the thrust deduction all other calculations agreed with the test results hino 2005 as validated by the 3 errors the slightly larger thrust error was generated by a difference in the number of grid nodes in the pair of interfaces where the propeller rotation domain was connected to the non structured grid flow domain which increased the transfer errors of the flow field data interpolations as demonstrated our calculation method was feasible and provided the required accrual 4 3 calculation results analysis on the flow field and free surface wave patterns the intensity level of the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure was directly determined by the degree of uniformity in the wake field from the three components of the non uniform wake flow the axial wake has usually the largest impact on pressure fluctuations fig 4 compares the non dimensional axial velocities of the full scale and model scale self propulsions at a 0 3 diameter upstream of the propeller plane the red circle represents the position of the propeller plane the arrow indicates the rotation direction of the propeller based on fig 4 the clockwise rotation of the propeller drove the water current to flow at a higher velocity from the starboard side thereby resulting in a larger axial velocity at the starboard side than at the port side in addition the wake effect of the hull was most intense at the center buttock thereby resulting in the smallest axial forward velocity at this location this location could be inferred as the point where the propeller blades produced the maximum thrust and torque furthermore the full scale ship presented a larger reynolds number and a thinner boundary layer thereby increasing the significance of the wake field scale effect the non dimensional axial velocity contour of the full scale ship contracted badly toward the center buttock of the hull and the forward velocity at the propeller plane was far higher than that of the model the non dimensional velocity contour of the full scale ship ranged between 0 7 and 0 95 whereas the model ranged between 0 6 and 0 9 for the major part and between 0 9 and 0 95 for the minor part although the model had a larger wake fraction than the full scale ship overall the full scale ship presented a more obvious wake gradient in the high wake region than the model that is the model exhibited a more uniform wake field although the full scale propeller exhibited a smaller thrust and torque coefficient as compared to the model propeller as indicated in table 3 its induced hull surface fluctuating pressure was larger than that by the model propeller thereby increasing its likeliness to generate vibration and noise in the hull fig 5 compares the calculated free surface wave pattern with the test result wave pattern a comparison fig 5 a and b presents an agreement between the self propulsion calculations and the test results the wave heights were very close to each other and the peak and valley points were consistent especially at the bow thereby indicating that the presented cfd calculations captured the free surface satisfactorily the main difference between the 2 however was in the stern wave pattern due to the presence of the stern propeller during the calculation of the self propulsion of the model and the quick dissipation of the stern waves from the relatively large cells in the stern area away from the hull which were placed to achieve a higher calculation efficiency in addition a comparison of fig 5 b and c presents a wave pattern of the free surface that does not display an obvious scale effect which concurred with the assumption that the wave making resistance is only related to the froude number however some divergence was also observed between the 2 in the stern wave pattern the wave pattern of the full scale ship was more complex than that of the model and its wave pattern tended to move backward as a whole given its thinner boundary layer and faster wake velocity as more directly demonstrated by the near distance view of the stern waves in fig 6 the full scale ship exhibited a faster wake flow in addition its stern transom plate was not soaked in water whereas the model was partly wetted green part thereby indicating that the full scale ship was subject to a greater wave making resistance 4 4 calculation results analysis of the hull surface fluctuating pressure of the propeller the monitoring points of the hull surface fluctuating pressure are set out as presented in fig 7 after calculation converged the total pressure of the 5 measuring points was monitored to better compare the fluctuating pressures between the full scale ship and the model and determine the scale effect the resulting fluctuating pressure was expressed in a non dimensional form according to eq 6 6 k p p ρ n 2 d 2 where p is the fluctuating pressure at the monitoring point ρ is the density of water taken as 998 2 kg m3 n is the velocity of the propeller and d is the diameter of the propeller the time domain curves of the fluctuating pressure coefficients at the monitoring points are presented in fig 8 to compare the fluctuating pressure coefficients at the monitoring points of the model and the full scale ship the time averages were plotted into a bar diagram as presented in fig 9 analysis of the values in these figures generated the following rules 1 the fluctuating pressure coefficients at the monitoring points changed periodically over time p0 p2 and p4 on the center longitudinal section of the ship had the same phase angle whereas p1 and p3 at the sides of the propeller exhibited some phase difference from p0 which was caused by the rotation of the propeller 2 from momentum theory it is known that the propeller produces thrust by generating an underpressure in front of upstream the propeller disk and an overpressure behind downstream the propeller disk such under and overpressures affect to some extent gauge points located above the propeller plane this explains why the gauge at p2 has a lower average pressure level than that at p0 and why the gauge at p0 has a lower average pressure level than that at p4 on the other hand for a right handed propeller the stagnation point that usually lies at the hull center plane in the resistance tests without propeller is shifted above the propeller axis towards starboard in self propulsion tests and below the propeller axis towards the port side this may make the average pressure at gauge p1 starboard above the propeller axis slightly larger than that at the port side p3 3 a comparison of the time averaged fluctuating pressure coefficient between the model and the full scale ship exhibited a slightly larger time average for the full scale ship than the model which concurs with our inference in section 3 2 for non separated hull flows the pressure on fluid particles traveling along the hull first drops and then is recovered until it reaches the undisturbed hydrostatic value behind the hull however in the viscous flow computations separation occurs and the pressure cannot be fully recovered at the stern remaining at a lower level the fact that the separation area is larger at model scale than at full scale explains why the average value of pressure is larger at full scale on the gauges furthermore the differences between model scale and full scale are larger for gauges p0 p2 p4 than for gauges p1 p3 since the former ones are located in the separation zone being separation significantly affected by the scale effect on the other hand the pressure gradients are larger at full scale which may result in larger pressure fluctuations to clearly define the fluctuating pressure changes the fast fourier transform algorithm was performed on the pressure variation curve at each monitoring point the frequency domain curves were generated by processing the time domain signals into frequency domain signals following the assumption that the sampling frequency and the time step were identical in all the monitoring points as presented in fig 10 based on these frequency domain curves figures the fluctuating pressure coefficients across the monitoring points shared the same fluctuating frequency and exhibited different peak levels at the blade passing frequency bpf 47 5 hz for the model and 8 9 hz for the full scale ship in addition the amplitude and frequency of the pressure fluctuations at full scale were more concentrated and their attenuation velocities were faster and its high frequency components can be assumed negligible contrarily the fluctuating amplitude and frequency of the model were more widespread and still presented small peaks after the fourth order bpf thereby suggesting that its high frequency components can not be ignored a comparison between the fluctuating amplitudes at the first to fourth order blade frequencies at each of the monitoring points of the model and the full scale ship was plotted in separate bar diagrams as presented in fig 11 since the first harmonic of the fluctuating pressure coefficient is the dominant contribution fig 11 a will be further analyzed the pressure fluctuations of the first harmonic were the largest at p0 both at model and full scale and the smallest at p4 which was located at the back in addition p0 was right above the propeller and the closest to the blade tip which explains why the fluctuating pressure at p0 was the largest the difference however is that the values of the model scale were significantly divergent among the monitoring points while in fact the values of all the other monitoring points for the full scale ship were quite close to each other except at p0 in addition a comparison between the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the different orders between the model and the full scale ship present larger first to third order fluctuating pressure coefficients for the full scale ship than those for the model as analyzed in section 3 2 this was mainly due to a lack of uniformity in the wake field of the full scale ship as compared to the model an sssri test study wu et al 2009 also noted that the propeller induced fluctuating pressure in the wake field of a full scale ship was larger and can be about 35 larger at the maximum thereby suggesting that the vibration and noise intensities of the model were lower than those of the full scale ship and related to the detachment of the full scale tip vortex which did not occur in the model as such to guarantee the vibration and noise performances of the full scale ship some allowances must be added to the propeller designs in accordance with the model test results however the increase in the fluctuating pressure coefficient of the full scale ship was attenuated at a greater velocity than in the model as demonstrated in fig 11 d wherein starting from the fourth order the fluctuating pressure coefficient of the full scale ship was already smaller than the model 4 5 calculation results analysis for the unsteady rudder force the rudder was within the dynamic wake field of the propeller such that its resistance also varied periodically over time which can result in longitudinal rudder vibration the rudder force was non dimensionalized as follow 7 c x f x 0 5 ρ v 2 s where f x is the resistance of the rudder v is the ship velocity and s is the rudder s wetted surface area the rudder force coefficients were then plotted into the time and frequency domain curves as presented in fig 12 based on the time domain curves the full scale ship exhibited similar rudder force variation cycles and fluctuating pressure variations with the model however the time domain curves of rudder force were more obviously indented thereby suggesting that the time varying rudder force variation was not very smooth in addition the frequency domain curves indicated that the fluctuating amplitude of the rudder force coefficient was also the largest at the blade frequency and then gradually attenuated moreover the attenuation velocity of the full scale ship was faster than that of the model to better examine the rudder force relationship between the model and the full scale ship data are listed in table 5 wherein the appendage coefficient rudder represents the ratio of the rudder resistance to the bare hull resistance generally the appendage coefficient of the full scale ship was assumed to be equal to that of the model to determine the appendage resistance of the full scale ship zhenbang and yingzhong 2004 which is an assumption that was proved reasonable by our calculation results the error between the full scale ship and the model was merely 5 43 which was within the acceptable range however a tremendous difference was observed in terms of the time average of the rudder force coefficient due to the small rudder size and small reynolds number calculated for the model scale the rudder was virtually under laminar flow and was highly subject to viscosity therefore when no corrections were made the model generated a far larger rudder force coefficient than the full scale ship it was therefore impossible to compare the model and full scale ship by simply looking at the time average however in terms of the amplitude to time average ratio of the first order blade frequency of the rudder force coefficient the full scale ship was larger than the model 5 conclusions in the present study the kcs ship and the kp505 propeller models are selected for numerical predictions of hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force the analysis includes the effect of the free surface on the flow 1 by simulating full scale self propulsion we discovered that subject to the scale effect the full scale ship had a smaller wake fraction than the model and had a larger self propulsion velocity than the equivalent value of the model 2 from the propeller upstream axial velocity cloud the full scale ship exhibited a faster propeller plane forward velocity than the model and in the high wake region the full scale ship exhibited a more obvious wake gradient than the model that is the model presented a more uniform wake field the scale effect between the full scale and the model ship computations was visible mainly as a decrease of the stern wave at full scale relative to model scale due to the acceleration of the flow and consequent pressure reduction 3 the fluctuating pressure coefficient varied periodically over time p0 p2 and p4 on the center longitudinal section exhibited the same phase angle whereas p1 and p3 at the sides of the propeller exhibited some phase differences from p0 which was attributable to the rotation of the propeller 4 the frequency domain curves indicated that the fluctuating pressure coefficients at the monitoring points exhibited the same fluctuating frequency and that peaks appeared at the bpf and its integral multiples with the largest peak at the bpf and gradually attenuating afterward the attenuating velocity of the full scale ship was faster than that of the model however since our calculation conditions did not include cases of cavitation subsequent research will be based on these findings and will investigate the scale effect of propeller cavitation and its effect on the hull surface fluctuating pressure acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

23749,in order to analyze the fluctuating pressure and rudder force characteristics of a full scale hull propeller rudder system a hybrid structured unstructured grid was combined with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and volume of fluid vof methods to perform a numerical prediction of model and full scale performance for the kriso container ship kcs case a numerical simulation for the self propulsion test of a full scale ship was first performed to obtain the propeller velocity under the self propulsion point the results of which indicated a notable wake fraction and velocity scale effect at the self propulsion point transient two phase flow calculations were then performed for the model and full scale kcs hull propeller rudder systems according to the monitoring data the hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force fluctuated periodically over time and the full scale fluctuating pressure exhibited a higher time average value as compared to the model scale pressure the frequency spectrum curves were also generated by the fast fourier transform algorithm the analysis of the frequency spectrum data indicated that the peaks of the fluctuating pressure and rudder force reached their respective maximums at the blade passing frequency bpf after which the peak gradually decreased and the full scale ship reduced more quickly furthermore fluctuating amplitude of full scale ship was bigger than model scale keywords full scale propeller free surface fluctuating pressure rudder force scale effect 1 introduction1 propellers periodically produce time varying exciting forces in the three dimensional non uniform wake field of the stern including the bearing force transferred to the hull by the shaft system the fluctuating pressure and the fluctuating rudder force transferred to the hull surface by the fluid yousheng and guoqiang 1987 the hull surface fluctuating pressure overpowers these forces when the propeller is cavitating as it is the largest contributor of vibration and noise in the hull as a result studies have focused on the generation of variation pattern and prediction methods for this fluctuating pressure in fact the amplitude of the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure has already been categorized as a gauge to measure the success of a propeller design xiong 2002 research strategies for the measurement of the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure generally include theoretical calculations empirical formulae and test measurements in terms of theoretical research huse and wang 1982 generated a systematic study on the effect of the hull and free surface on the fluctuating pressure and obtained an estimation method to determining the free surface factor and solid wall factor thereby providing an important reference for subsequent theoretical research on fluctuating pressure van gent 1994 then established a new idea to examine the effect of the cavitation volume on the propeller blade and its variability on the fluctuating pressure given that the cavitation growth acceleration is the main contributor for the fluctuating pressure within the blade frequency and the low frequency noise empirical formula methods are generally applied to preliminary ship designs given their simple calculations and fairly rough results thus far mature empirical formulae include the holden method takahashi method fujino method and the calculation method described in the russian handbook of ship structural mechanics in addition the china classification society ccs also published a cb z method to estimate pressure fluctuations though it has not been widely accepted li 2013 pressure fluctuation test measurements started early and involved both model and full scale measurements previous literature huse 1972 friesch j 1984 duttweiler and brennen 2002 xiong et al 2002 wu et al 2010 has reported the findings and intensive studies performed on the effects of the propeller cavitation and air content in the test and model wake field correction nevertheless the complex coupling between the propeller and the rudder working at the stern has made it difficult to predict the accurate propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force by either theoretical calculation or test measurement however the development of the cfd numerical calculation method validated the effectiveness of numerical processes in predicting and analyzing the hull surface recently an increasing amount of studies have numerically calculated the fluctuating pressure of which the calculation results ji et al 2012 kehr and kao 2011 were well in agreement with the experimental values since the development of numerical research and predictions for the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure the majority of studies focused on the simulation of non uniform axial wake flow with minimal observations on the contribution of the free surface and the propeller rudder interference furthermore models have been generally categorized as research objects such that few full scale pressure fluctuation numerical predictions have been reported therefore it is essential to perform full scale numerical prediction studies on the propeller induced hull surface fluctuating pressure for a hull propeller rudder system taking into account the effect of the free surface the present study characterized a kcs ship and kp505 propeller as the study objects a numerical pool model was established on ansys fluent software transient two phase flow calculations were first generated for the model hull propeller rudder system under self propulsion conditions to obtain the model scale hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force a full scale simulation was then performed on the hull propeller under self propulsion conditions to determine the self propulsion point of the ship based on the results the full scale propeller induced fluctuating pressure and rudder force on the hall surface were calculated and compared with the calculation results of the model we then identified the full scale and model flow fields and wave patterns a systematic analysis was also performed on the time and frequency domains of the hull surface fluctuating pressure the rudder force and their respective scale effects given the computational difficulties and the methods the present study focused on the pressure fluctuations induced by the propeller rotation to conduct a pressure analysis without cavitation future research must consider the influence of cavitation on the pressure fluctuations 2 mathematical approach 2 1 control equation and turbulence model fluid flow is governed by physical conservation laws basic conservation laws include the law of conservation of mass the law of momentum conservation and the law of conservation of energy the present study characterized water as the medium water is an incompressible fluid with negligible heat exchange thereby requiring only the mass and momentum conservation equations for calculations the detailed formulae are provided in previous literature wang 2004 the present study employed a shear stress transport sst turbulence model for the calculation of the propeller hydrodynamic performance this model effectively integrates the merits of both the k ε and k ω models and well simulates complex flows in the presence of flow separation and strong adverse pressure gradients 2 2 volume of fluid vof model the vof method karim et al 2014 calculates the free surface by investigating the fluid grid volume fraction function of the grid cells and tracing the variation of the fluid rather than the particle movement on the free surface if the value of the function on each grid of the flow field is known the movement interface can be traced the entire computational domain is defined as ω the main phase fluid domain is defined as ω 1 and the secondary phase fluid domain is defined as ω 2 the vof defines the following function 1 ω x t 1 x ω 1 0 x ω 2 in addition the velocity field is composed of two non intersoluble fluids is defined as v u v the function ω then conforms to 2 ω t u ω x v ω y 0 on each grid i i j the integer of ω x t on the grid is defined as c i j thereby defining the vop function 3 c i j 1 δ v i j i i j ω x t d v the vof function also conforms to eq 2 4 c t u c x v c y 0 when c 0 the fluids in the grids are all secondary phase fluids when c 1 the grids are filled with main phase fluids and when 0 c 1 the grids that contain fluid interfaces become interface grids 3 calculation modeling 3 1 calculation object the present study characterized a kcs container ship which was modeled at a reduced scale of 31 6 as the study object alejandro et al 2011 the ship was accompanied by a kp505 propeller the full scale parameters are presented in table 1 wang et al 2016 3 2 working conditions the presented calculation conditions include model scale and full scale simulations that did not consider the trim and sinkage the model scale calculation conditions included the bare hull resistance and the hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force on the integrated hull propeller rudder system the bare hull resistance was calculated by the steady vof method whereas the self propulsion calculations were performed by the transient vof method the full and model scale calculation conditions exhibited similarities though the full scale calculations involved more conditions such as the hull resistance and propeller thrust under various calculated velocities table 2 presents the details of the working conditions 3 3 establishment of the computational domain and setting of computational parameters the flow field computational domain is presented as follows the inlet is 1 l pp from the bow the outlet is 2 l pp from the stern and the side and bottom are both 1 l pp from the hull surface as illustrated in fig 1 the inlet included an air velocity inlet and a water velocity inlet which were identical the outlet was set as a pressure outlet using the user defined function in ansys fluent the vertical pressure of the outlet varied as follows 5 p p 0 z t p 0 ρ g z t z t where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration z is the vertical coordinate and t is the draught the upper boundary of the flow domain is defined as a symmetrical plane and the surface side and bottom of the hull are all defined as a nonslip wall the multiple reference frame method was employed for the steady calculation of the propeller rotation movement and the slide mesh method was applied to the transient calculations the time step was taken as δ t m 0 0001 s for the model scale calculations and δ t s 0 0004 s for the full scale calculations the blades rotate approximately 3 in each time step for both model and full scale calculations the vof method was employed to trace the free surface while the simplec method was applied for the pressure velocity coupled iteration 3 4 grid division the present study employed hybrid grids for calculations the entire grid division was executed using icem software ji 2011 a small part of the flow domain at the stern was divided into non structured grids to save grid division given that the large stern curvature of the contraction challenged the division of the structured grids the rest of the ship including the propeller was divided into hexahedron structured grids the structured grids were connected to the non structured grids by the interface information was transferred in the flow field by interface interpolations in the numerical calculations the model scale presented the same grid topology as the full scale simulation the hull surface grids are presented in fig 2 a the only differences were observed in the thickness of the first layer of the cells and the number of grid nodes in the 3 directions generally it is suitable to limit the model scale y values within the recommended value of about 60 which corresponds to the thickness of the first layer of grids about 0 8 1 mm few studies have reported on the controllable range of the full scale y values therefore the present study empirically and numerically determined a suitable y value of around 300 wang 2014 which corresponds the thickness of the first layer of grids about 1 2 mm the thickness of the first layer of grids in the structured part can be directly defined by the parameters whereas the non structured part of the stern required the addition of prism grid layers as presented in fig 2 b the details of the propeller grids are illustrated in fig 2 c notably when dividing the computational grids the number of cells was increased around the bow and stern as these areas presented more dramatic flow field changes to better capture the free surface more grid nodes were added near the free surface to enhance the grid resolution see fig 3 4 calculation results analysis 4 1 validation of the calculation method three grid cases were applied to the grid sensitivity analysis of the model calculations the number of grids and calculation results are listed in table 3 since comparison of the results with experiment fluid dynamics efd indicated an agreement between the cfd results and the efd when the whole grid number achieved 4 31 m case2 was applied in

ignored a comparison between the fluctuating amplitudes at the first to fourth order blade frequencies at each of the monitoring points of the model and the full scale ship was plotted in separate bar diagrams as presented in fig 11 since the first harmonic of the fluctuating pressure coefficient is the dominant contribution fig 11 a will be further analyzed the pressure fluctuations of the first harmonic were the largest at p0 both at model and full scale and the smallest at p4 which was located at the back in addition p0 was right above the propeller and the closest to the blade tip which explains why the fluctuating pressure at p0 was the largest the difference however is that the values of the model scale were significantly divergent among the monitoring points while in fact the values of all the other monitoring points for the full scale ship were quite close to each other except at p0 in addition a comparison between the fluctuating pressure coefficients of the different orders between the model and the full scale ship present larger first to third order fluctuating pressure coefficients for the full scale ship than those for the model as analyzed in section 3 2 this was mainly due to a lack of uniformity in the wake field of the full scale ship as compared to the model an sssri test study wu et al 2009 also noted that the propeller induced fluctuating pressure in the wake field of a full scale ship was larger and can be about 35 larger at the maximum thereby suggesting that the vibration and noise intensities of the model were lower than those of the full scale ship and related to the detachment of the full scale tip vortex which did not occur in the model as such to guarantee the vibration and noise performances of the full scale ship some allowances must be added to the propeller designs in accordance with the model test results however the increase in the fluctuating pressure coefficient of the full scale ship was attenuated at a greater velocity than in the model as demonstrated in fig 11 d wherein starting from the fourth order the fluctuating pressure coefficient of the full scale ship was already smaller than the model 4 5 calculation results analysis for the unsteady rudder force the rudder was within the dynamic wake field of the propeller such that its resistance also varied periodically over time which can result in longitudinal rudder vibration the rudder force was non dimensionalized as follow 7 c x f x 0 5 ρ v 2 s where f x is the resistance of the rudder v is the ship velocity and s is the rudder s wetted surface area the rudder force coefficients were then plotted into the time and frequency domain curves as presented in fig 12 based on the time domain curves the full scale ship exhibited similar rudder force variation cycles and fluctuating pressure variations with the model however the time domain curves of rudder force were more obviously indented thereby suggesting that the time varying rudder force variation was not very smooth in addition the frequency domain curves indicated that the fluctuating amplitude of the rudder force coefficient was also the largest at the blade frequency and then gradually attenuated moreover the attenuation velocity of the full scale ship was faster than that of the model to better examine the rudder force relationship between the model and the full scale ship data are listed in table 5 wherein the appendage coefficient rudder represents the ratio of the rudder resistance to the bare hull resistance generally the appendage coefficient of the full scale ship was assumed to be equal to that of the model to determine the appendage resistance of the full scale ship zhenbang and yingzhong 2004 which is an assumption that was proved reasonable by our calculation results the error between the full scale ship and the model was merely 5 43 which was within the acceptable range however a tremendous difference was observed in terms of the time average of the rudder force coefficient due to the small rudder size and small reynolds number calculated for the model scale the rudder was virtually under laminar flow and was highly subject to viscosity therefore when no corrections were made the model generated a far larger rudder force coefficient than the full scale ship it was therefore impossible to compare the model and full scale ship by simply looking at the time average however in terms of the amplitude to time average ratio of the first order blade frequency of the rudder force coefficient the full scale ship was larger than the model 5 conclusions in the present study the kcs ship and the kp505 propeller models are selected for numerical predictions of hull surface fluctuating pressure and rudder force the analysis includes the effect of the free surface on the flow 1 by simulating full scale self propulsion we discovered that subject to the scale effect the full scale ship had a smaller wake fraction than the model and had a larger self propulsion velocity than the equivalent value of the model 2 from the propeller upstream axial velocity cloud the full scale ship exhibited a faster propeller plane forward velocity than the model and in the high wake region the full scale ship exhibited a more obvious wake gradient than the model that is the model presented a more uniform wake field the scale effect between the full scale and the model ship computations was visible mainly as a decrease of the stern wave at full scale relative to model scale due to the acceleration of the flow and consequent pressure reduction 3 the fluctuating pressure coefficient varied periodically over time p0 p2 and p4 on the center longitudinal section exhibited the same phase angle whereas p1 and p3 at the sides of the propeller exhibited some phase differences from p0 which was attributable to the rotation of the propeller 4 the frequency domain curves indicated that the fluctuating pressure coefficients at the monitoring points exhibited the same fluctuating frequency and that peaks appeared at the bpf and its integral multiples with the largest peak at the bpf and gradually attenuating afterward the attenuating velocity of the full scale ship was faster than that of the model however since our calculation conditions did not include cases of cavitation subsequent research will be based on these findings and will investigate the scale effect of propeller cavitation and its effect on the hull surface fluctuating pressure acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science
