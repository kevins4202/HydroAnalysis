8070,study region this study is focused on the lower athabasca basin in northwestern canada that has experienced rapid expansion of oil sands development study focus the goal of this study is to enhance the understanding of the regional role of the lower athabasca basin areas in overall runoff delivery to the downstream peace athabasca delta the cold regions hydrological indicators of change framework was applied to examine key hydro ecological relevant indicators influencing the delta new hydrological insights for the region our novel approach yielded new insights that should be considered in water management primarily a combined flow magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis by geography provides an improved understanding of contrasting runoff generation changes in terms of opposing responses occurring within a basin for instance open water low flows emanated from the upper regions and a generally increasing tendency from the lower regions furthermore peak summer flows generally experienced decreases from the upper and portions of the lower basin while contrary increasing tendencies emerged for the east bank of the lower athabasca river mainstem moving beyond the traditional approach of looking only at the climate landscape and geology were considered as potential causal factors for divergent runoff generation responses our approach is transferable to other regional studies keywords runoff generation trend analysis relative flow contributions basin geography hydrological indicators oil sands region 1 introduction variable and changing climatic conditions land use change and flow regulation have individually or cumulatively been associated with global streamflow regime alterations botter et al 2013 environment canada 2004 zeiringer et al 2018 in this context western canada has been identified as a region of particular concern regarding altered water availability issues due to climate warming and consequent changes in temperature snowfall rainfall and evapotranspiration bonsal et al 2020 2019 in this region the athabasca river is an important water source for oil sands mining projects and also provides key ecosystem services to the internationally recognized peace athabasca delta pad including maintenance of critical habitat for fish vegetation wildlife and associated traditional hunting and fishing practices timoney 2013 schindler and donahue 2006 postulated an impending crisis of water scarcity in this river system with potential impacts on environmental flow needs linked to diminishing summer streamflow quantity in response to this concern a regional surface water management framework was implemented to address expanding resource development in the lower part of the basin goa 2015 indigenous peoples have also raised water quantity concerns in their petition to unesco to reassess the protection status of wood buffalo national park unesco 2017 which includes the pad investigations into the abrupt decline in post 1950s flow of the athabasca river highlighted by schindler and donahue 2006 revealed that such a decline was not apparent when examining hydrometric records along the mainstem for the upper half of the basin peters et al 2013 rood et al 2015 also in contrast with declining trends in flow rates entering the lower regions where oil sands mining is occurring bawden et al 2014 monk et al 2012 rasouli et al 2013 rood et al 2015 schindler and donahue 2006 exploratory work by peters et al 2013 indicated no discernable trend in runoff from the lowermost portion of the basin eg downstream of athabasca river just below fort mcmurray the lack of within basin consensus on runoff generation response tendencies points to potentially divergent responses to multiple drivers such as climate water use and landscape alteration in addition to climate cumulative changes in land use and water withdrawal are likely also influencing net contributions to water movement and observed trends in flow of the athabasca mainstem squires et al 2010 and its tributaries bawden et al 2014 for example short term increases in water inputs may be expected with peatland ditching draining and overburden dewatering for accessing near surface oil sand deposits woynillowicz and severson baker 2006 while decreases may be expected from water use by industry long term influence on hydrology associated with the many disturbances associated with open pit and steam assisted gravity drainage oil extraction as well as from traditional oil and gas developments and maintenance within the basin schneider et al 2003 may result in potential changes to water partitioning storage and hydrological connectivity kompanizare et al 2018 previous flow analyses eg alexander and chambers 2016 bawden et al 2014 and modelling eg eum et al 2016 suggest that trends in the quantity and or timing of streamflow variables eg peak resulting from the effects of climate or natural resource development may be present in the hydrometric time series of the lower athabasca river lar and require further study to gain an understanding of causal factors although the general runoff regime is well understood eg peters et al 2013 there is a knowledge gap regarding the origin of these trends and how the geography of runoff production driving key deltaic hydro ecological events such as the spring ice jam and summer open water floods have changed over time here we present a novel approach that explicitly considers the importance of contributions from the lower athabasca basin where oil sands mining is concentrated to total flow generation during ice and open water conditions in this context the goal of this study was to assess potential changes in streamflow generation in tributaries draining the lar basin by applying the cold regions hydrological indicators of change chic framework peters et al 2014 furthermore distinct runoff generation pathways from upstream and downstream portions of the basin were considered to gain an improved understanding of regional contributions to ecologically important flows driving the downstream pad ecosystem 2 study area the athabasca river 159 000 km2 is the largest direct inflow to the pad and lake athabasca system in northwestern canada figs 1 and 2 originating in the columbia icefields in the rocky mountains and draining eight physiological sub regions of alberta downing and pettapiece 2006 the river travels through the rugged alpine sub alpine and forested montane natural sub regions of jasper national park further through foothills and onto the low relief mixed wood forest of the boreal plains low flows associated with these upper regions of the basin are 100 200 m3 s 1 during the ice covered months while peak flows range from 1000 up to 5000 m3 s 1 in response to the spring freshet and summer rainfall events peters and prowse 2006 at fort mcmurray the hangingstone boreal highlands and clearwater athabasca plains and boreal shield rivers join the mainstem the steepbank muskeg mackay firebag and richardson rivers drain the nearby hills with a strong spring freshet signal to the flow regimes influencing the downstream delta fig 3 the downstream pad is a wetland ecosystem of international significance recognized by the ramsar convention and 80 lies within the wood buffalo national park a unesco world heritage site agricultural oil and gas and forestry related land use change activities are present within the basin nrbs 1996 several pulp mills are located on the river between the town of hinton and athabasca and oil sand mining occurs near fort mcmurray landscape alteration associated with open pit mining of the oil sands commenced in the late 1960s approximately 767 km2 of the 4800 km2 available for surface mining have been disturbed as of 2017 goa 2019 fig 1 and table 1 less than 5 of the annual river flow is allocated for water use withdrawals by the oil sands industry comprise the bulk of this allocation goa 2015 3 methods 3 1 hydrometric data sources observed mean daily flows m3 s 1 were obtained for 12 hydrometric stations from the hydat archive eccc 2020 table 1 stations at the town of athabasca ta and just below the city of fort mcmurray fm represent cumulative runoff generated to the middle and lower portions of the basin alberta environment bothe 1982 estimates of monthly mean flow derived via regression analyses were used to fill in missing data and produce a new 1912 2017 time series for both these stations with the exception of the clearwater and hangingstone rivers 45 years tributaries downstream of fm were instrumented in the early 1970s as part of the alberta oil sands environmental research program aoserp neill and evans 1979 the steepbank muskeg mackay firebag and richardson river stations were reduced to seasonal gauging march to october between 1987 and 2013 the beaver river headwaters were altered by oil sands operations and thus a unit area runoff correction was applied to incorporate the 1974 75 data to the station that was relocated slightly downstream gauging of the ells river was interrupted between 1987 and 2000 missing years were infilled using a regression equation developed by alberta environment based on the adjacent mackay river seneka 2002 and missing ice affected dates were taken from this river station data availability and infilling details for the main study years spanning 1974 2017 and focused on march to october flow mof period are outlined in table 1 this annual period mof represents the bulk of the yearly flow regime that captured ice breakup and open water events 3 2 geographical flow balance the study basin was separated into two major zones upper athabasca river uar and lower athabasca river lar fig 1 and table 1 the lar was sub divided into southern lar s and northern lar n sectors the lar s comprises the of clearwater river with minor additions from the hangingstone river and 1 ungauged areas a unique time series of streamflow for the uar was derived by subtracting the lar s flow from those at the contiguous fm hydrometric station total flows from the lar n region 72 gauged were produced by adding measured flows on the east bank gauged via beaver mackay and ells rivers and west bank gauged via steepbank muskeg firebag and richardson rivers to unit area flow extrapolations 1 315 x lar n total areas gauged to account for ungauged areas this simple method yielded flow values that were within 10 of those measured on the athabasca river at embarras airport for the available years 1971 84 and 2014 2017 due to a lack of continuous daily observed flows at this station near the mouth of the river entering the pad total basin analyses that included these extrapolated estimates were restricted to mof and monthly flows indices and short timescale indices were referenced to fm 3 3 hydrological indicators peters et al 2014 adapted the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha tnc 2007 for cold regions to incorporate the effect of ice and snow processes on flow regimes and related ecology monk et al 2018 peters et al 2016 through the cold regions hydrological indicators of change chic framework the chic framework quantifies five components of the hydrological regime spanning the ice and open water periods namely magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change of events the time periods when flows were affected by open water conditions were separated by considering the b backwater flag designation in the hydat database eccc 2020 to identify the first and last day when channel hydraulics were affected by ice given that the study season was focused on the march 1st to october 31st period not all chic variables were extracted table 2 breakup information was typically available but on some occasions a slightly later than usual freeze up date was not captured prior to gauge removal in these few cases october 31 was assigned as the end of the open water period the date of the spring freshet initiation fid with corresponding flow magnitude fiq was identified as the first notable rise in the hydrograph building on the work of peters and prowse 2006 the date of the maximum water level hmd influenced by backwater flow conditions ice on the athabasca river along with the corresponding daily flow magnitude hmq were extracted for the mainstem hydrometric station located just below fm this information was not available at the other stations see de rham et al 2020 for all basins the date d and corresponding flow magnitude m were extracted for the following indices river ice breakup bud buq centre of mass date cmd mean march to october flow mof mean monthly flow mar apr may jun jul aug sep and oct open water condition one day low flow date magnitude lod loq peak flow date magnitude prior to p1d p1q and after june 1st p2d p2q and the 90 day mean peak flow date and magnitude p90d p90q readers are referred to richter et al 1996 peters and prowse 2006 tnc 2007 and peters et al 2014 for details on the calculations of these variables to consider intra basin geographical responses and change over time we expanded upon other hydrological indicator assessment studies of runoff generation e g monk et al 2012 bawden et al 2014 and assessed the relative flow contribution from the uar lar s and lar n regions to extreme ice influenced backwater potential spring ice jam flood events and open water peak flow events flashy and sustained 3 4 statistical analyses the strength and direction of possible trends in hydrological indicators were assessed using the non parametric mann kendall m k trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 which has been commonly applied in hydrological and climatological research e g burn and hag elnur 2002 monk et al 2011 m k trend tests were performed in r version 3 6 1 r development core team 2016 by using the zyp package of bronaugh and werner 2019 with zhang and zwiers 2004 iteratively pre whitening ipw method applied to remove significant serial autocorrelation in the time series bürger 2017 zhang et al 2000 the non parametric slope β of each time series was calculated using sen s estimate sen 1968 given that the goal of this study was to search for indications of runoff generation change significant trends were identified at p 0 10 bawden et al 2014 burn et al 2010 monk et al 2012 2011 peters et al 2013 to facilitate comparison with other studies results at p 0 05 were highlighted with an underline in the text the results of the m k trend tests β and p values are presented in table a1 to 24 in appendix a as previously done by other studies and to maximize the use of available data eg bawden et al 2014 peters et al 2013 the time series analyses were carried out for the 1913 2017 1958 2017 and 1974 2017 time periods 4 results and discussion 4 1 geographical flow balance a geographical flow analysis revealed that the combined lar 37 of the total contributing area produced 29 of the long term mean march to october flow hereafter mof of the athabasca river basin for the years spanning 1974 2017 the bulk of mof 71 emanated from the boreal plains foothill and mountain regions upstream 63 by area of the city of fort mcmurray fm fig 4 the fm hydrometric station includes runoff generated from the lar s basin draining the lake rich boreal shield areas which produced only 16 of the total flow but comprises 20 of the total basin area about 13 of the total flow was generated from the athabasca plains areas on both banks of the lar n feeding the mainstem downstream of fm although generally not as productive as the uar the lar s and lar n represent important water sources likely playing a role in driving components of the hydrograph ie indicators that have yet to be fully addressed in a basin scale context 4 2 march 1 to october 31 period indicators variability in mof observed in the last 45 years of record at the town of athabasca ta and fm were within the range experienced from 1912 to 2017 fig 5a although a slight decline in mof is perceptible over the last century there was no statistically notable p 0 10 monotonic trend at both ta and fm gauging locations these results are in broad agreement with chen and grasby 2014 and rood et al 2015 who reconstructed mean annual flows back to 1918 and 1937 respectively via empirical models further investigation of flows from 1958 or 1974 2017 illustrates the relative importance of the uar and lar to the total basin flows that enter the delta fig 5b a significant decrease β 2 89 m3 s 1 y 1 in mof from the uar was found post 1958 with a higher decline rate since 1974 β 4 05 m3 s 1 y 1 in line with schindler and donahue 2006 in contrast no significant trends in mof were observed in either the lar s or lar n indicating that overall their proportional contribution to the basin flow at the delta has gradually increased for this time period figs 5b and 6a the importance of the lar to total flow is further emphasized when considered as a percentage of basin scale streamflow generation over time from 1974 2017 mof emanating from the uar varied from 55 to 82 x 71 of the total basin and significantly decreased β 0 19 y 1 the proportion to the total basin mof emanating from the lar however varied between 18 and 45 x 29 and significantly increased β 0 19 y 1 over this period on a monthly basis significant and notable decreases in mean flow post 1958 for the uar emerged for jul β 5 8 m3 s 1 y 1 aug β 4 2 m3 s 1 y 1 sep β 4 9 m3 s 1 y 1 and oct β 3 0 m3 s 1 y 1 similar to mof the rate of decrease in mean monthly flow intensified post 1974 in the uar for these months with the addition of mar β 1 2 m3 s 1 y 1 contrasts in increasing and decreasing tendencies in flow from the tributaries downstream in the lar n were observed the lar n tributary contributions were insufficient to offset the significant decreases in flow passing fm and onwards to the delta for the months of mar and jul through oct β 1 0 9 9 8 2 8 8 4 7 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively the declining sep flows are highlighted in fig 6b since it is a time of year when waterway depth is critical to access traditional hunting activities along the lar and pad waterways carver and maclean 2016 overall although there is a slight general decline in certain monthly mean flows since 1974 on the river mainstem ie uar with the combination of weak decreases or increases from various tributaries in the lar appearing to moderate the rate of decline at the basin scale as compared to the larger decreases β in flow observed from the uar over this period the relative contributions of the uar and lar to the overall basin flow varied by season and highlight the importance of contributions from the lar to the pad during the spring snow freshet and rainfall dominated months the relative mean flow contributions from the lar were greatest during mar through may x 44 41 and 37 respectively as well as sep and oct x 30 36 but where lower during jun through aug x 25 22 and 24 conversely flow contributions from the uar were greater during jun through aug x 75 78 and 76 for the lar increasing flow contribution tendencies were discerned for all months since 1974 with several months statistically significant mar β 0 31 y 1 jul β 0 21 y 1 sep β 0 27 y 1 the centre of mass date cmd for the 1974 2017 period occurred significantly earlier for flow emanating from the uar β 0 33 d y 1 and flowing by fm β 0 30 d y 1 downstream the cmd tended to arrive earlier over time in the lar s tributaries which contrasts with the lar n tributaries fig 6c the overall results from analyses of broad march to october indicators reveal that flow declines have been largely driven by runoff generation from above the lar region as suggested in peters et al 2013 with potentially important shift in timing date of generation that may affect ice and open water period indicators 4 3 ice influenced period indicators the date and magnitude of maximum backwater level prior to the loss of an ice cover was only available at fm we thus used this date to examine the flow magnitude and relative flow contributions from all the tributaries on that day the complete set of spring breakup metrics at fm 1 sd 1958 2017 include the dates of freshet initiation fid x april 7 9 d maximum water level affected by ice hmd x april 21 6 d and river ice breakup bud x april 27 5 d no statistically significant p 0 10 trends were discerned for these three variables at fm nor for the freshet and breakup dates for the uar and lar for both study time periods from 1958 or 1974 the fiq emanating from the uar area significantly decreased β 0 68 m3 s 1 y 1 β 1 37 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively fig 7a the opposite trends were observed for fiq in the downstream tributaries of the lar region with significant increases for the lar n β 0 17 m3 s 1 y 1 since 1974 notably in the ells firebag and richardson rivers β 0 02 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 07 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 06 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively general decreases in flow for hmq and buq were observed from both the 1958 and 1974 periods for the uar and similar decreasing tendencies were also observed for all tributaries within the lar figs 7b and 7c in particular the lar s experienced significant decreases in hmq β 2 13 m3 s 1 y 1 and buq β 1 87 m3 s 1 y 1 since 1958 since 1974 significant decreases in hmq emerged for the hangingstone beaver steepbank and muskeg rivers β 0 06 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 01 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 12 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 07 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively while for buq only the ells river revealed noteworthy trends β 0 22 m3 s 1 y 1 of interest is the increasing relative role of lar compared to uar to the river mainstem at a time of year when ice jam generated floods can occur generally the uar contributed the majority of flow to hmq x 74 11 at fm with the remainder emanating from the lar s x 26 11 however the decreases from the uar correspond to concurrent increases from lar s regions in the relative amounts of flow driving hmq at fm since 1974 further although the proportion of flow from the lar n can range greatly adding as little as 8 in 2015 and up to 62 in 1974 x 25 13 to the downstream mainstem on the day of hmq the proportion of flow from the lower lar n to the overall basin flow has generally declined ie mackay β 0 07 y 1 steepbank β 0 02 y 1 4 4 open water period indicators the date of peak spring flow p1d may 17 12 5 d for water emanating from the uar has generally occurred 10 days later compared to the lar region overall the date has been occurring later at fm since 1958 and 1974 β 0 17 d y 1 β 0 42 d y 1 post 1974 notable occurrences of later dates included the uar β 0 30 d y 1 and lar n β 0 35 d y 1 with tributaries hangingstone beaver ells muskeg and firebag rivers β 0 24 0 25 0 41 0 33 and 0 41 d y 1 respectively for the considerably more variable date of summer peak flow p2d the date for the uar x july 5 21 d generally occurred earlier than for the lar s x july 10 35 d and lar n x july 19 40 d regions after 1974 only the beaver river β 0 61 d y 1 exhibited a significant change flow magnitude of peak spring p1q and summer p2q both important for overbank flooding of deltaic channels generally decreased since 1958 for the uar with a significant decreasing trend in p1q for the lar s β 2 85 m3 s 1 y 1 predominantly decreasing tendencies were found in p1q post 1974 ie richardson river β 0 12 m3 s 1 y 1 fig 8a and b later in the summer the uar experienced a significant decrease in p2q β 17 02 m3 s 1 y 1 with apparent decreases in the lar s and from west bank tributaries of the lar n however p2q on east bank tributaries generally increased post 1974 with a significant increase β 0 99 m3 s 1 y 1 for the firebag river on average the uar contributed the majority of the flow generating the p1q x 81 1 7 and p2q x 89 9 5 measured at fm over 1974 2017 with the lar s contributing the remainder of the flow on the days of the p1q and p2q at fm it was estimated that the river reach along lar n added an additional 19 3 11 and 8 8 7 to the peak flow passing fm respectively sustained high flows are important to replenish storage within the downstream delta lakes the p90d for the uar has occurred significantly earlier β 0 41 d y 1 since 1974 the relative contribution of water to p90q from the uar to fm generally decreased however there was a general increase in contributions from the lar s and downstream additions from the lar n with significant increasing trends for the firebag and richardson rivers β 0 04 y 1 β 0 01 y 1 the bulk of the flow driving p90q at fm originated from upstream areas x 84 1 5 with the lar n providing additional flow that augmented the magnitude arriving to the delta by an average of 13 6 5 the day of low flow lod generally occurred earlier p 0 10 for the uar and lar s since 1974 culminating into a significant trend with earlier lod for the fm station β 0 12 d y 1 fig 8c in contrast the general trend of a later lod in the lar n p 0 10 is influenced by significantly later trends in the beaver β 0 94 d y 1 and muskeg β 0 64 d y 1 rivers a similar contrast in low flow magnitude loq was noted with loq in the uar significantly decreasing since 1958 β 1 95 m3 s 1 y 1 and 1974 β 3 53 m3 s 1 y 1 this result was reflected in the relative flow contributions on lod at fm with an apparent declining trend for the uar apparent increasing trend for the lar s and significantly increasing trend for the lar n β 0 31 y 1 the uar contributed the majority of the flow generating loq x 73 2 8 at fm with the lar s contributing the difference the lar n was estimated to have provided an additional 20 4 9 of flow downstream of fm revealing that the lower regions of the basin generally played a larger role in generating runoff to the pad during low flow periods than during peak flows 4 5 potential causes of directional change and spatial divergence in runoff our results clearly highlighted the importance of basin geography and differential contributions to overall streamflow generation to the downstream delta and identified variations across the ice covered and open water periods observed decreases in runoff from the uar concomitant with no overall change in runoff from the lar indicate that the relative proportion of runoff from the lower athabasca basin has been increasing since 1974 this study also revealed potentially divergent trends in runoff regimes between the uar and lar as well as east versus west bank tributaries of the lar n factors that affect the partitioning of water over the landscape are important in determining the athabasca river flow regimes such as climate variability and change and the interaction with basin geography basin size geology landcover air temperatures have been warming over the past century in the region bonsal and cuell 2017 bush et al 2019 peters et al 2013 although peters et al 2013 found a significant increase in precipitation occurred over the 1913 2009 period β 0 50 mm y 1 they also noted significant decreases for the 1958 2009 and 1976 2009 periods β 0 99 0 21 mm y 1 respectively this trend in basin scale precipitation is associated with a decline 0 66 mm y 1 in the winter snowpack over 1950 2010 o neil et al 2017 similar to observations in the adjacent peace river beltaos et al 2006 the decline in snowpack and warming air temperatures across the athabasca river basin partly explains the earlier timing and widespread decline of summer peak flows and may have also influenced the relative contributions of tributary flow to buq and hmq near fm it is important to mention that in additional to regional influences outlined in this section air temperature precipitation and associated streamflow generation has been found to be correspond to broader synoptic scale climate teleconnections such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american pna indices at least partially explaining the post mid 1970s flow declines observed from the headwaters peters et al 2013 rood et al 2017 2015 sauchyn et al 2015 whitfield et al 2010 in a study of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei bonsal and cuell 2017 noted a general tendency 0 25 yr 1 towards drier and warmer conditions over 1950 2009 with the rate of decrease in spei greatest for the middle portions of the basin 0 40 and least for the lar 0 08 bawden et al 2014 presented data see their fig 5 that appear to suggest that march to october precipitation amounts 1976 2010 decreased on west bank versus increased on east bank tributaries the overall contrast in runoff water balance component tendencies in the uar and lar are similar to the observed spatially divergent runoff response in this study such as observed increase in fraction lar region to p2q and contrasting east vs west bank lar tributaries runoff generation in the lar was influenced by differences in landscape controls on water movement and balances as outlined in a stable isotope hydrograph separation study by gibson et al 2016 they found that the east bank tributaries steepbank muskeg and firebag rivers were generally groundwater dominated runoff systems whereas the west bank tributaries mackay and ells river that drain the birch mountains and wabasca lowlands and the clearwater river that drains the canadian shield were found to be mostly surface water dominated systems mainly derived from peatlands and lakes in parallel studies of lake isotope mass balance calculations in and around the lar gibson et al 2019 2015 postulated that permafrost thaw enhanced runoff contributions to 14 of 50 lakes in the region mostly the birch mountains the loss of permafrost is therefore another potential influence on the amount of runoff generation with gibson et al 2019 also proposing a permafrost thaw trajectory for bog dominated areas whereby water yields initially increase but then decreases as the frozen source waters are depleted all of which could drive observed flow trends across the boreal plains catchments of alberta the greatest long term runoff lowest evapotranspiration was observed in basins dominated with peatland and conifer swamp land cover combined with a large percentage 14 cover of coarse textured surficial geology devito et al 2017 in contrast reductions in flow higher evapotranspiration were associated with hummocky moraine landforms and deciduous forestland cover lar tributaries included in their regional study showed that long term runoff and runoff precipitation ratios were greater in two east bank steepbank 0 27 muskeg 0 21 versus two west bank beaver 0 19 mackay 0 17 tributaries peatland swamps dominate the land cover in both the west and east bank tributaries 49 18 and 51 24 respectively and runoff productivity is generally high in the region however gauged basins on the west bank representative of the wabasca lowlands are dominated by fine textured glacial deposits coarse 2 2 with a substantial coverage by hummocky moraine 18 6 these land cover characteristics limit west bank runoff production compared to tributaries of the east bank devito et al 2017 east bank tributaries are located in the athabasca plains fluvial depositional areas with no hummocky moraine and are characterized by large expanses of coarse glacial and aeolian deposits 29 22 and less productive pine conifer forests potentially increasing runoff production and extending low flows particularly during dry weather cycles devito pers comm differences in geology along the athabasca basin are also important in influencing the spatial response of rivers and relative lar flow contributions although peatlands have numerous negative feedbacks acting on future climate change waddington et al 2015 west bank tributaries and regions with a predominance of fine textured substrate hummock moraine landforms and deciduous forest may be more susceptible to climate warming devito et al 2017 schneider et al 2016 as suggested by declining flow from uar in contrast the east bank tributaries the richardson river and ungauged northern portion of the lar are located in areas dominated by coarse textured glacial fluvial and eolian deposits fenton et al 2013 regions with coarse texture soil and substrate are characterized by xeric ecosystem types jack pine forest with lower rates of evapotranspiration promoting infiltration groundwater recharge and regional runoff generation that is likely to persist under future climate change scenarios devito et al in prep schneider et al 2016 for instance contrary to athabasca river basin scale runoff summer flows 1 4 are estimated to increase under projected mid and late century climate change scenarios for the west bank firebag tributary eum et al 2017 extensive land cover change e g 35 55 may play a larger role in affecting the hydrological regime than climate change in the muskeg river basin eum et al 2016 the effects of current oil sands mining activity on runoff generation are difficult to assess given the multitudes of potential hydrological alterations that are not readily reported spatio temporarily and difficult to model year to year and over the long term for instance in the landscape most heavily affected by mining activity 17 the 2015 muskeg river hydrograph was estimated to have deviated from the baseline flow conditions mean annual open water 2 1 mean winter 11 1 maximum peak 3 8 and minimum 4 6 ramp 2016 there would also have been changes in mean annual flow throughout development phases as illustrated by the jackpine mine expansion environmental assessment which described an increase 1 during wetland drainage and overburden dewatering activities in 2012 a 8 maximum reduction from close circuit operations and 9 increase at closure of the mine shell canada 2007 the surface landscapes of other lar tributaries are considerably less affected by mining activities 2 table 1 with the flow regime expected to be less impacted than the illustrated muskeg river water allocation within the study basin has risen steadily since the 1960s but is still 5 of the total annual flow reaching the delta eg fig 5c aep 2019 according to the lower athabasca river water management framework goa 2015 the oil sands industry has a maximum cumulative allowable water extraction of 29 m3 s 1 from the athabasca river when flow is ample eg summer time reducing to 4 4 m3 s 1 when flow is restricted eg winter time aep 2019 in recent years 4 m3 s 1 on average has been extracted by the oil sands industry aer 2019 which is a small percentage of the mean annual flow although nevertheless contributing to a cumulative reduction in flows reaching the delta fig 5b anticipated climate change will likely change the relative importance of these allocations and the geography of the basin contributions with eum et al 2017 projecting 2050s and 2080s significant increases in spring flow 19 30 and 26 40 decreases in summer flow 8 to 0 6 and 2 to 8 and increases in peak flows 2 18 and 12 19 flow past fm on the athabasca river mainstem furthermore it can be suggested from the results of eum et al 2017 that the direction and magnitude of historical trends in the hydrological indicators may be reversed continue as is or intensified over the next decades 5 summary and conclusions understanding the availability of water in the athabasca river basin is a matter of ongoing public concern in light of climate change and with water use by oil and gas developments continuing to increase moreover there is a need to develop an environmental flow framework for the downstream pad that incorporates cold regions hydrological indicators our novel analysis approach yielded new insights that should be considered in water management plans and decision making for this basin a combined magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis by geography provides a clearer understanding of runoff generation change in terms of opposing responses occurring within a basin landscape and geology partly explain potential causes of divergent responses of runoff generation leading to diverging responses to climate mean mof over the past century did not exhibit a notable declining trend at fm but significant declines were detected for the post 1958 and 1974 periods the latter of which is largely driven by runoff generation originating from above the lar oil sands mining region the timing of spring freshet initiation and river ice breakup in the lar basin has not changed significantly over the past half century in line with the literature there was a general decrease in the amount of water emanating from the upper regions for these two spring breakup indicators with mixed results from the lower regions of the basin separating the open water season into pre and post june 1st periods yielded results consistent with the literature but also new results the magnitude of peak flow generally declined after 1958 in the uar and lar s however while generally decreasing peak flows occurred in the pre june 1st period throughout the lar over 1974 2017 the post june 1st open water period experienced decreases from the uar lar s and the west bank of the lar n with the east bank experiencing increasing peak flows similarly open water low flows decreased from upper regions and had a generally increasing tendency in the lower regions the approach developed and applied in this study can be transferred to other cold region basins as it relies on information that can be readily obtained and or generated it is recommended that our approach be considered in future runoff generation studies with a goal of better understanding how basin

8070,study region this study is focused on the lower athabasca basin in northwestern canada that has experienced rapid expansion of oil sands development study focus the goal of this study is to enhance the understanding of the regional role of the lower athabasca basin areas in overall runoff delivery to the downstream peace athabasca delta the cold regions hydrological indicators of change framework was applied to examine key hydro ecological relevant indicators influencing the delta new hydrological insights for the region our novel approach yielded new insights that should be considered in water management primarily a combined flow magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis by geography provides an improved understanding of contrasting runoff generation changes in terms of opposing responses occurring within a basin for instance open water low flows emanated from the upper regions and a generally increasing tendency from the lower regions furthermore peak summer flows generally experienced decreases from the upper and portions of the lower basin while contrary increasing tendencies emerged for the east bank of the lower athabasca river mainstem moving beyond the traditional approach of looking only at the climate landscape and geology were considered as potential causal factors for divergent runoff generation responses our approach is transferable to other regional studies keywords runoff generation trend analysis relative flow contributions basin geography hydrological indicators oil sands region 1 introduction variable and changing climatic conditions land use change and flow regulation have individually or cumulatively been associated with global streamflow regime alterations botter et al 2013 environment canada 2004 zeiringer et al 2018 in this context western canada has been identified as a region of particular concern regarding altered water availability issues due to climate warming and consequent changes in temperature snowfall rainfall and evapotranspiration bonsal et al 2020 2019 in this region the athabasca river is an important water source for oil sands mining projects and also provides key ecosystem services to the internationally recognized peace athabasca delta pad including maintenance of critical habitat for fish vegetation wildlife and associated traditional hunting and fishing practices timoney 2013 schindler and donahue 2006 postulated an impending crisis of water scarcity in this river system with potential impacts on environmental flow needs linked to diminishing summer streamflow quantity in response to this concern a regional surface water management framework was implemented to address expanding resource development in the lower part of the basin goa 2015 indigenous peoples have also raised water quantity concerns in their petition to unesco to reassess the protection status of wood buffalo national park unesco 2017 which includes the pad investigations into the abrupt decline in post 1950s flow of the athabasca river highlighted by schindler and donahue 2006 revealed that such a decline was not apparent when examining hydrometric records along the mainstem for the upper half of the basin peters et al 2013 rood et al 2015 also in contrast with declining trends in flow rates entering the lower regions where oil sands mining is occurring bawden et al 2014 monk et al 2012 rasouli et al 2013 rood et al 2015 schindler and donahue 2006 exploratory work by peters et al 2013 indicated no discernable trend in runoff from the lowermost portion of the basin eg downstream of athabasca river just below fort mcmurray the lack of within basin consensus on runoff generation response tendencies points to potentially divergent responses to multiple drivers such as climate water use and landscape alteration in addition to climate cumulative changes in land use and water withdrawal are likely also influencing net contributions to water movement and observed trends in flow of the athabasca mainstem squires et al 2010 and its tributaries bawden et al 2014 for example short term increases in water inputs may be expected with peatland ditching draining and overburden dewatering for accessing near surface oil sand deposits woynillowicz and severson baker 2006 while decreases may be expected from water use by industry long term influence on hydrology associated with the many disturbances associated with open pit and steam assisted gravity drainage oil extraction as well as from traditional oil and gas developments and maintenance within the basin schneider et al 2003 may result in potential changes to water partitioning storage and hydrological connectivity kompanizare et al 2018 previous flow analyses eg alexander and chambers 2016 bawden et al 2014 and modelling eg eum et al 2016 suggest that trends in the quantity and or timing of streamflow variables eg peak resulting from the effects of climate or natural resource development may be present in the hydrometric time series of the lower athabasca river lar and require further study to gain an understanding of causal factors although the general runoff regime is well understood eg peters et al 2013 there is a knowledge gap regarding the origin of these trends and how the geography of runoff production driving key deltaic hydro ecological events such as the spring ice jam and summer open water floods have changed over time here we present a novel approach that explicitly considers the importance of contributions from the lower athabasca basin where oil sands mining is concentrated to total flow generation during ice and open water conditions in this context the goal of this study was to assess potential changes in streamflow generation in tributaries draining the lar basin by applying the cold regions hydrological indicators of change chic framework peters et al 2014 furthermore distinct runoff generation pathways from upstream and downstream portions of the basin were considered to gain an improved understanding of regional contributions to ecologically important flows driving the downstream pad ecosystem 2 study area the athabasca river 159 000 km2 is the largest direct inflow to the pad and lake athabasca system in northwestern canada figs 1 and 2 originating in the columbia icefields in the rocky mountains and draining eight physiological sub regions of alberta downing and pettapiece 2006 the river travels through the rugged alpine sub alpine and forested montane natural sub regions of jasper national park further through foothills and onto the low relief mixed wood forest of the boreal plains low flows associated with these upper regions of the basin are 100 200 m3 s 1 during the ice covered months while peak flows range from 1000 up to 5000 m3 s 1 in response to the spring freshet and summer rainfall events peters and prowse 2006 at fort mcmurray the hangingstone boreal highlands and clearwater athabasca plains and boreal shield rivers join the mainstem the steepbank muskeg mackay firebag and richardson rivers drain the nearby hills with a strong spring freshet signal to the flow regimes influencing the downstream delta fig 3 the downstream pad is a wetland ecosystem of international significance recognized by the ramsar convention and 80 lies within the wood buffalo national park a unesco world heritage site agricultural oil and gas and forestry related land use change activities are present within the basin nrbs 1996 several pulp mills are located on the river between the town of hinton and athabasca and oil sand mining occurs near fort mcmurray landscape alteration associated with open pit mining of the oil sands commenced in the late 1960s approximately 767 km2 of the 4800 km2 available for surface mining have been disturbed as of 2017 goa 2019 fig 1 and table 1 less than 5 of the annual river flow is allocated for water use withdrawals by the oil sands industry comprise the bulk of this allocation goa 2015 3 methods 3 1 hydrometric data sources observed mean daily flows m3 s 1 were obtained for 12 hydrometric stations from the hydat archive eccc 2020 table 1 stations at the town of athabasca ta and just below the city of fort mcmurray fm represent cumulative runoff generated to the middle and lower portions of the basin alberta environment bothe 1982 estimates of monthly mean flow derived via regression analyses were used to fill in missing data and produce a new 1912 2017 time series for both these stations with the exception of the clearwater and hangingstone rivers 45 years tributaries downstream of fm were instrumented in the early 1970s as part of the alberta oil sands environmental research program aoserp neill and evans 1979 the steepbank muskeg mackay firebag and richardson river stations were reduced to seasonal gauging march to october between 1987 and 2013 the beaver river headwaters were altered by oil sands operations and thus a unit area runoff correction was applied to incorporate the 1974 75 data to the station that was relocated slightly downstream gauging of the ells river was interrupted between 1987 and 2000 missing years were infilled using a regression equation developed by alberta environment based on the adjacent mackay river seneka 2002 and missing ice affected dates were taken from this river station data availability and infilling details for the main study years spanning 1974 2017 and focused on march to october flow mof period are outlined in table 1 this annual period mof represents the bulk of the yearly flow regime that captured ice breakup and open water events 3 2 geographical flow balance the study basin was separated into two major zones upper athabasca river uar and lower athabasca river lar fig 1 and table 1 the lar was sub divided into southern lar s and northern lar n sectors the lar s comprises the of clearwater river with minor additions from the hangingstone river and 1 ungauged areas a unique time series of streamflow for the uar was derived by subtracting the lar s flow from those at the contiguous fm hydrometric station total flows from the lar n region 72 gauged were produced by adding measured flows on the east bank gauged via beaver mackay and ells rivers and west bank gauged via steepbank muskeg firebag and richardson rivers to unit area flow extrapolations 1 315 x lar n total areas gauged to account for ungauged areas this simple method yielded flow values that were within 10 of those measured on the athabasca river at embarras airport for the available years 1971 84 and 2014 2017 due to a lack of continuous daily observed flows at this station near the mouth of the river entering the pad total basin analyses that included these extrapolated estimates were restricted to mof and monthly flows indices and short timescale indices were referenced to fm 3 3 hydrological indicators peters et al 2014 adapted the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha tnc 2007 for cold regions to incorporate the effect of ice and snow processes on flow regimes and related ecology monk et al 2018 peters et al 2016 through the cold regions hydrological indicators of change chic framework the chic framework quantifies five components of the hydrological regime spanning the ice and open water periods namely magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change of events the time periods when flows were affected by open water conditions were separated by considering the b backwater flag designation in the hydat database eccc 2020 to identify the first and last day when channel hydraulics were affected by ice given that the study season was focused on the march 1st to october 31st period not all chic variables were extracted table 2 breakup information was typically available but on some occasions a slightly later than usual freeze up date was not captured prior to gauge removal in these few cases october 31 was assigned as the end of the open water period the date of the spring freshet initiation fid with corresponding flow magnitude fiq was identified as the first notable rise in the hydrograph building on the work of peters and prowse 2006 the date of the maximum water level hmd influenced by backwater flow conditions ice on the athabasca river along with the corresponding daily flow magnitude hmq were extracted for the mainstem hydrometric station located just below fm this information was not available at the other stations see de rham et al 2020 for all basins the date d and corresponding flow magnitude m were extracted for the following indices river ice breakup bud buq centre of mass date cmd mean march to october flow mof mean monthly flow mar apr may jun jul aug sep and oct open water condition one day low flow date magnitude lod loq peak flow date magnitude prior to p1d p1q and after june 1st p2d p2q and the 90 day mean peak flow date and magnitude p90d p90q readers are referred to richter et al 1996 peters and prowse 2006 tnc 2007 and peters et al 2014 for details on the calculations of these variables to consider intra basin geographical responses and change over time we expanded upon other hydrological indicator assessment studies of runoff generation e g monk et al 2012 bawden et al 2014 and assessed the relative flow contribution from the uar lar s and lar n regions to extreme ice influenced backwater potential spring ice jam flood events and open water peak flow events flashy and sustained 3 4 statistical analyses the strength and direction of possible trends in hydrological indicators were assessed using the non parametric mann kendall m k trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 which has been commonly applied in hydrological and climatological research e g burn and hag elnur 2002 monk et al 2011 m k trend tests were performed in r version 3 6 1 r development core team 2016 by using the zyp package of bronaugh and werner 2019 with zhang and zwiers 2004 iteratively pre whitening ipw method applied to remove significant serial autocorrelation in the time series bürger 2017 zhang et al 2000 the non parametric slope β of each time series was calculated using sen s estimate sen 1968 given that the goal of this study was to search for indications of runoff generation change significant trends were identified at p 0 10 bawden et al 2014 burn et al 2010 monk et al 2012 2011 peters et al 2013 to facilitate comparison with other studies results at p 0 05 were highlighted with an underline in the text the results of the m k trend tests β and p values are presented in table a1 to 24 in appendix a as previously done by other studies and to maximize the use of available data eg bawden et al 2014 peters et al 2013 the time series analyses were carried out for the 1913 2017 1958 2017 and 1974 2017 time periods 4 results and discussion 4 1 geographical flow balance a geographical flow analysis revealed that the combined lar 37 of the total contributing area produced 29 of the long term mean march to october flow hereafter mof of the athabasca river basin for the years spanning 1974 2017 the bulk of mof 71 emanated from the boreal plains foothill and mountain regions upstream 63 by area of the city of fort mcmurray fm fig 4 the fm hydrometric station includes runoff generated from the lar s basin draining the lake rich boreal shield areas which produced only 16 of the total flow but comprises 20 of the total basin area about 13 of the total flow was generated from the athabasca plains areas on both banks of the lar n feeding the mainstem downstream of fm although generally not as productive as the uar the lar s and lar n represent important water sources likely playing a role in driving components of the hydrograph ie indicators that have yet to be fully addressed in a basin scale context 4 2 march 1 to october 31 period indicators variability in mof observed in the last 45 years of record at the town of athabasca ta and fm were within the range experienced from 1912 to 2017 fig 5a although a slight decline in mof is perceptible over the last century there was no statistically notable p 0 10 monotonic trend at both ta and fm gauging locations these results are in broad agreement with chen and grasby 2014 and rood et al 2015 who reconstructed mean annual flows back to 1918 and 1937 respectively via empirical models further investigation of flows from 1958 or 1974 2017 illustrates the relative importance of the uar and lar to the total basin flows that enter the delta fig 5b a significant decrease β 2 89 m3 s 1 y 1 in mof from the uar was found post 1958 with a higher decline rate since 1974 β 4 05 m3 s 1 y 1 in line with schindler and donahue 2006 in contrast no significant trends in mof were observed in either the lar s or lar n indicating that overall their proportional contribution to the basin flow at the delta has gradually increased for this time period figs 5b and 6a the importance of the lar to total flow is further emphasized when considered as a percentage of basin scale streamflow generation over time from 1974 2017 mof emanating from the uar varied from 55 to 82 x 71 of the total basin and significantly decreased β 0 19 y 1 the proportion to the total basin mof emanating from the lar however varied between 18 and 45 x 29 and significantly increased β 0 19 y 1 over this period on a monthly basis significant and notable decreases in mean flow post 1958 for the uar emerged for jul β 5 8 m3 s 1 y 1 aug β 4 2 m3 s 1 y 1 sep β 4 9 m3 s 1 y 1 and oct β 3 0 m3 s 1 y 1 similar to mof the rate of decrease in mean monthly flow intensified post 1974 in the uar for these months with the addition of mar β 1 2 m3 s 1 y 1 contrasts in increasing and decreasing tendencies in flow from the tributaries downstream in the lar n were observed the lar n tributary contributions were insufficient to offset the significant decreases in flow passing fm and onwards to the delta for the months of mar and jul through oct β 1 0 9 9 8 2 8 8 4 7 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively the declining sep flows are highlighted in fig 6b since it is a time of year when waterway depth is critical to access traditional hunting activities along the lar and pad waterways carver and maclean 2016 overall although there is a slight general decline in certain monthly mean flows since 1974 on the river mainstem ie uar with the combination of weak decreases or increases from various tributaries in the lar appearing to moderate the rate of decline at the basin scale as compared to the larger decreases β in flow observed from the uar over this period the relative contributions of the uar and lar to the overall basin flow varied by season and highlight the importance of contributions from the lar to the pad during the spring snow freshet and rainfall dominated months the relative mean flow contributions from the lar were greatest during mar through may x 44 41 and 37 respectively as well as sep and oct x 30 36 but where lower during jun through aug x 25 22 and 24 conversely flow contributions from the uar were greater during jun through aug x 75 78 and 76 for the lar increasing flow contribution tendencies were discerned for all months since 1974 with several months statistically significant mar β 0 31 y 1 jul β 0 21 y 1 sep β 0 27 y 1 the centre of mass date cmd for the 1974 2017 period occurred significantly earlier for flow emanating from the uar β 0 33 d y 1 and flowing by fm β 0 30 d y 1 downstream the cmd tended to arrive earlier over time in the lar s tributaries which contrasts with the lar n tributaries fig 6c the overall results from analyses of broad march to october indicators reveal that flow declines have been largely driven by runoff generation from above the lar region as suggested in peters et al 2013 with potentially important shift in timing date of generation that may affect ice and open water period indicators 4 3 ice influenced period indicators the date and magnitude of maximum backwater level prior to the loss of an ice cover was only available at fm we thus used this date to examine the flow magnitude and relative flow contributions from all the tributaries on that day the complete set of spring breakup metrics at fm 1 sd 1958 2017 include the dates of freshet initiation fid x april 7 9 d maximum water level affected by ice hmd x april 21 6 d and river ice breakup bud x april 27 5 d no statistically significant p 0 10 trends were discerned for these three variables at fm nor for the freshet and breakup dates for the uar and lar for both study time periods from 1958 or 1974 the fiq emanating from the uar area significantly decreased β 0 68 m3 s 1 y 1 β 1 37 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively fig 7a the opposite trends were observed for fiq in the downstream tributaries of the lar region with significant increases for the lar n β 0 17 m3 s 1 y 1 since 1974 notably in the ells firebag and richardson rivers β 0 02 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 07 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 06 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively general decreases in flow for hmq and buq were observed from both the 1958 and 1974 periods for the uar and similar decreasing tendencies were also observed for all tributaries within the lar figs 7b and 7c in particular the lar s experienced significant decreases in hmq β 2 13 m3 s 1 y 1 and buq β 1 87 m3 s 1 y 1 since 1958 since 1974 significant decreases in hmq emerged for the hangingstone beaver steepbank and muskeg rivers β 0 06 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 01 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 12 m3 s 1 y 1 β 0 07 m3 s 1 y 1 respectively while for buq only the ells river revealed noteworthy trends β 0 22 m3 s 1 y 1 of interest is the increasing relative role of lar compared to uar to the river mainstem at a time of year when ice jam generated floods can occur generally the uar contributed the majority of flow to hmq x 74 11 at fm with the remainder emanating from the lar s x 26 11 however the decreases from the uar correspond to concurrent increases from lar s regions in the relative amounts of flow driving hmq at fm since 1974 further although the proportion of flow from the lar n can range greatly adding as little as 8 in 2015 and up to 62 in 1974 x 25 13 to the downstream mainstem on the day of hmq the proportion of flow from the lower lar n to the overall basin flow has generally declined ie mackay β 0 07 y 1 steepbank β 0 02 y 1 4 4 open water period indicators the date of peak spring flow p1d may 17 12 5 d for water emanating from the uar has generally occurred 10 days later compared to the lar region overall the date has been occurring later at fm since 1958 and 1974 β 0 17 d y 1 β 0 42 d y 1 post 1974 notable occurrences of later dates included the uar β 0 30 d y 1 and lar n β 0 35 d y 1 with tributaries hangingstone beaver ells muskeg and firebag rivers β 0 24 0 25 0 41 0 33 and 0 41 d y 1 respectively for the considerably more variable date of summer peak flow p2d the date for the uar x july 5 21 d generally occurred earlier than for the lar s x july 10 35 d and lar n x july 19 40 d regions after 1974 only the beaver river β 0 61 d y 1 exhibited a significant change flow magnitude of peak spring p1q and summer p2q both important for overbank flooding of deltaic channels generally decreased since 1958 for the uar with a significant decreasing trend in p1q for the lar s β 2 85 m3 s 1 y 1 predominantly decreasing tendencies were found in p1q post 1974 ie richardson river β 0 12 m3 s 1 y 1 fig 8a and b later in the summer the uar experienced a significant decrease in p2q β 17 02 m3 s 1 y 1 with apparent decreases in the lar s and from west bank tributaries of the lar n however p2q on east bank tributaries generally increased post 1974 with a significant increase β 0 99 m3 s 1 y 1 for the firebag river on average the uar contributed the majority of the flow generating the p1q x 81 1 7 and p2q x 89 9 5 measured at fm over 1974 2017 with the lar s contributing the remainder of the flow on the days of the p1q and p2q at fm it was estimated that the river reach along lar n added an additional 19 3 11 and 8 8 7 to the peak flow passing fm respectively sustained high flows are important to replenish storage within the downstream delta lakes the p90d for the uar has occurred significantly earlier β 0 41 d y 1 since 1974 the relative contribution of water to p90q from the uar to fm generally decreased however there was a general increase in contributions from the lar s and downstream additions from the lar n with significant increasing trends for the firebag and richardson rivers β 0 04 y 1 β 0 01 y 1 the bulk of the flow driving p90q at fm originated from upstream areas x 84 1 5 with the lar n providing additional flow that augmented the magnitude arriving to the delta by an average of 13 6 5 the day of low flow lod generally occurred earlier p 0 10 for the uar and lar s since 1974 culminating into a significant trend with earlier lod for the fm station β 0 12 d y 1 fig 8c in contrast the general trend of a later lod in the lar n p 0 10 is influenced by significantly later trends in the beaver β 0 94 d y 1 and muskeg β 0 64 d y 1 rivers a similar contrast in low flow magnitude loq was noted with loq in the uar significantly decreasing since 1958 β 1 95 m3 s 1 y 1 and 1974 β 3 53 m3 s 1 y 1 this result was reflected in the relative flow contributions on lod at fm with an apparent declining trend for the uar apparent increasing trend for the lar s and significantly increasing trend for the lar n β 0 31 y 1 the uar contributed the majority of the flow generating loq x 73 2 8 at fm with the lar s contributing the difference the lar n was estimated to have provided an additional 20 4 9 of flow downstream of fm revealing that the lower regions of the basin generally played a larger role in generating runoff to the pad during low flow periods than during peak flows 4 5 potential causes of directional change and spatial divergence in runoff our results clearly highlighted the importance of basin geography and differential contributions to overall streamflow generation to the downstream delta and identified variations across the ice covered and open water periods observed decreases in runoff from the uar concomitant with no overall change in runoff from the lar indicate that the relative proportion of runoff from the lower athabasca basin has been increasing since 1974 this study also revealed potentially divergent trends in runoff regimes between the uar and lar as well as east versus west bank tributaries of the lar n factors that affect the partitioning of water over the landscape are important in determining the athabasca river flow regimes such as climate variability and change and the interaction with basin geography basin size geology landcover air temperatures have been warming over the past century in the region bonsal and cuell 2017 bush et al 2019 peters et al 2013 although peters et al 2013 found a significant increase in precipitation occurred over the 1913 2009 period β 0 50 mm y 1 they also noted significant decreases for the 1958 2009 and 1976 2009 periods β 0 99 0 21 mm y 1 respectively this trend in basin scale precipitation is associated with a decline 0 66 mm y 1 in the winter snowpack over 1950 2010 o neil et al 2017 similar to observations in the adjacent peace river beltaos et al 2006 the decline in snowpack and warming air temperatures across the athabasca river basin partly explains the earlier timing and widespread decline of summer peak flows and may have also influenced the relative contributions of tributary flow to buq and hmq near fm it is important to mention that in additional to regional influences outlined in this section air temperature precipitation and associated streamflow generation has been found to be correspond to broader synoptic scale climate teleconnections such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american pna indices at least partially explaining the post mid 1970s flow declines observed from the headwaters peters et al 2013 rood et al 2017 2015 sauchyn et al 2015 whitfield et al 2010 in a study of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei bonsal and cuell 2017 noted a general tendency 0 25 yr 1 towards drier and warmer conditions over 1950 2009 with the rate of decrease in spei greatest for the middle portions of the basin 0 40 and least for the lar 0 08 bawden et al 2014 presented data see their fig 5 that appear to suggest that march to october precipitation amounts 1976 2010 decreased on west bank versus increased on east bank tributaries the overall contrast in runoff water balance component tendencies in the uar and lar are similar to the observed spatially divergent runoff response in this study such as observed increase in fraction lar region to p2q and contrasting east vs west bank lar tributaries runoff generation in the lar was influenced by differences in landscape controls on water movement and balances as outlined in a stable isotope hydrograph separation study by gibson et al 2016 they found that the east bank tributaries steepbank muskeg and firebag rivers were generally groundwater dominated runoff systems whereas the west bank tributaries mackay and ells river that drain the birch mountains and wabasca lowlands and the clearwater river that drains the canadian shield were found to be mostly surface water dominated systems mainly derived from peatlands and lakes in parallel studies of lake isotope mass balance calculations in and around the lar gibson et al 2019 2015 postulated that permafrost thaw enhanced runoff contributions to 14 of 50 lakes in the region mostly the birch mountains the loss of permafrost is therefore another potential influence on the amount of runoff generation with gibson et al 2019 also proposing a permafrost thaw trajectory for bog dominated areas whereby water yields initially increase but then decreases as the frozen source waters are depleted all of which could drive observed flow trends across the boreal plains catchments of alberta the greatest long term runoff lowest evapotranspiration was observed in basins dominated with peatland and conifer swamp land cover combined with a large percentage 14 cover of coarse textured surficial geology devito et al 2017 in contrast reductions in flow higher evapotranspiration were associated with hummocky moraine landforms and deciduous forestland cover lar tributaries included in their regional study showed that long term runoff and runoff precipitation ratios were greater in two east bank steepbank 0 27 muskeg 0 21 versus two west bank beaver 0 19 mackay 0 17 tributaries peatland swamps dominate the land cover in both the west and east bank tributaries 49 18 and 51 24 respectively and runoff productivity is generally high in the region however gauged basins on the west bank representative of the wabasca lowlands are dominated by fine textured glacial deposits coarse 2 2 with a substantial coverage by hummocky moraine 18 6 these land cover characteristics limit west bank runoff production compared to tributaries of the east bank devito et al 2017 east bank tributaries are located in the athabasca plains fluvial depositional areas with no hummocky moraine and are characterized by large expanses of coarse glacial and aeolian deposits 29 22 and less productive pine conifer forests potentially increasing runoff production and extending low flows particularly during dry weather cycles devito pers comm differences in geology along the athabasca basin are also important in influencing the spatial response of rivers and relative lar flow contributions although peatlands have numerous negative feedbacks acting on future climate change waddington et al 2015 west bank tributaries and regions with a predominance of fine textured substrate hummock moraine landforms and deciduous forest may be more susceptible to climate warming devito et al 2017 schneider et al 2016 as suggested by declining flow from uar in contrast the east bank tributaries the richardson river and ungauged northern portion of the lar are located in areas dominated by coarse textured glacial fluvial and eolian deposits fenton et al 2013 regions with coarse texture soil and substrate are characterized by xeric ecosystem types jack pine forest with lower rates of evapotranspiration promoting infiltration groundwater recharge and regional runoff generation that is likely to persist under future climate change scenarios devito et al in prep schneider et al 2016 for instance contrary to athabasca river basin scale runoff summer flows 1 4 are estimated to increase under projected mid and late century climate change scenarios for the west bank firebag tributary eum et al 2017 extensive land cover change e g 35 55 may play a larger role in affecting the hydrological regime than climate change in the muskeg river basin eum et al 2016 the effects of current oil sands mining activity on runoff generation are difficult to assess given the multitudes of potential hydrological alterations that are not readily reported spatio temporarily and difficult to model year to year and over the long term for instance in the landscape most heavily affected by mining activity 17 the 2015 muskeg river hydrograph was estimated to have deviated from the baseline flow conditions mean annual open water 2 1 mean winter 11 1 maximum peak 3 8 and minimum 4 6 ramp 2016 there would also have been changes in mean annual flow throughout development phases as illustrated by the jackpine mine expansion environmental assessment which described an increase 1 during wetland drainage and overburden dewatering activities in 2012 a 8 maximum reduction from close circuit operations and 9 increase at closure of the mine shell canada 2007 the surface landscapes of other lar tributaries are considerably less affected by mining activities 2 table 1 with the flow regime expected to be less impacted than the illustrated muskeg river water allocation within the study basin has risen steadily since the 1960s but is still 5 of the total annual flow reaching the delta eg fig 5c aep 2019 according to the lower athabasca river water management framework goa 2015 the oil sands industry has a maximum cumulative allowable water extraction of 29 m3 s 1 from the athabasca river when flow is ample eg summer time reducing to 4 4 m3 s 1 when flow is restricted eg winter time aep 2019 in recent years 4 m3 s 1 on average has been extracted by the oil sands industry aer 2019 which is a small percentage of the mean annual flow although nevertheless contributing to a cumulative reduction in flows reaching the delta fig 5b anticipated climate change will likely change the relative importance of these allocations and the geography of the basin contributions with eum et al 2017 projecting 2050s and 2080s significant increases in spring flow 19 30 and 26 40 decreases in summer flow 8 to 0 6 and 2 to 8 and increases in peak flows 2 18 and 12 19 flow past fm on the athabasca river mainstem furthermore it can be suggested from the results of eum et al 2017 that the direction and magnitude of historical trends in the hydrological indicators may be reversed continue as is or intensified over the next decades 5 summary and conclusions understanding the availability of water in the athabasca river basin is a matter of ongoing public concern in light of climate change and with water use by oil and gas developments continuing to increase moreover there is a need to develop an environmental flow framework for the downstream pad that incorporates cold regions hydrological indicators our novel analysis approach yielded new insights that should be considered in water management plans and decision making for this basin a combined magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis by geography provides a clearer understanding of runoff generation change in terms of opposing responses occurring within a basin landscape and geology partly explain potential causes of divergent responses of runoff generation leading to diverging responses to climate mean mof over the past century did not exhibit a notable declining trend at fm but significant declines were detected for the post 1958 and 1974 periods the latter of which is largely driven by runoff generation originating from above the lar oil sands mining region the timing of spring freshet initiation and river ice breakup in the lar basin has not changed significantly over the past half century in line with the literature there was a general decrease in the amount of water emanating from the upper regions for these two spring breakup indicators with mixed results from the lower regions of the basin separating the open water season into pre and post june 1st periods yielded results consistent with the literature but also new results the magnitude of peak flow generally declined after 1958 in the uar and lar s however while generally decreasing peak flows occurred in the pre june 1st period throughout the lar over 1974 2017 the post june 1st open water period experienced decreases from the uar lar s and the west bank of the lar n with the east bank experiencing increasing peak flows similarly open water low flows decreased from upper regions and had a generally increasing tendency in the lower regions the approach developed and applied in this study can be transferred to other cold region basins as it relies on information that can be readily obtained and or generated it is recommended that our approach be considered in future runoff generation studies with a goal of better understanding how basin

8071,study region qinghai tibet plateau study focus we focused on characterization and contributions of classified rain to total rain change for each decade between 1981 and 2020 rain events were categorized into four non overlapping groups based on percentile thresholds light rain lri 50th percentile moderate rain mri 50th 95th percentiles heavy rain hri 95th 99th percentiles and very heavy rain vhri 99th percentile with trends detected using robust non parametric approach thereafter we used relative weights and multiple regression models to assess the contribution of each categorized rain to the overall rainfall change new hydrological insights for the region classified rain represented rain features better than mean wet rain intensity mean rain intensity fluctuated as classified rain although 50th percentiles mri hri and vhri increased more weighted linear combination revealed that during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 majority of explained variance in total rain intensities was attributed to mri with 32 36 35 40 model r 2 respectively the mri year to year variation was also consistent with total wet rain r 0 8 implying that mri was the most significant predictor of total rain change p 0 05 although the annual wet rain mri hri and vhri all had positive linkages with temperature it is still important to investigate the variability of classified rain intensity and frequency in the context of other climatic factors this research will aid the understanding of changes in classified rain events keywords rain frequency rain intensity multiple linear regression relative weights climate change tibetan plateau 1 introduction climate projections for the twenty first century have predicted an increase in global temperature which could alter the global water cycle through intensification wang et al 2016 wan et al 2017 as the global water cycle intensifies huge modifications in climate patterns are expected trenberth 2011 berghuijs et al 2014 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 for instance the rising temperature will result in a corresponding increase in evaporation rates and moisture content thereby resulting in more frequent storms and increased danger of floods less precipitation is expected away from storm tracks increasing the risk of drought ayantobo et al 2021 the change from snow to rain due to rising temperatures has also been recorded by berghuijs et al 2014 climate change and its impact on the frequency and intensity of extreme events has recently sparked widespread concern because of their significant impacts on agriculture water resource structures natural ecosystems and other socio economic factors easterling 2000 min et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 kuriqi et al 2019 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 hence analyzing trends and variability in these events is a critical task for mitigating the potential impact of heavy precipitation and improving future climatic adaptation many studies have examined mean and extreme rain events fluctuations concentrating on changes in their long term climatic mean state as well as changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events under climate change pavan et al 2008 schindler et al 2012 few studies in china reveal that while precipitation days have decreased in most places except the northwest rain intensity has increased liu et al 2005 qian and lin 2005 from 1961 to 2015 li et al 2011 found a continuous rise in rain frequency and intensity in northwest china wang and zhou 2005 identified growing trends in eastern and northwestern china during summer and decreasing trends in central northern and northeastern china during spring and autumn studies on the tibetan plateau tp have revealed rapid warming and wetting trends over the past decades chen et al 2015 wan et al 2017 despite huge spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation across the tp the overall increasing rain trends have been supported by various ground based li et al 2021 and remote sensing and satellite observations lu et al 2020 fan et al 2021 tan et al 2020 ma et al 2018 li et al 2021 the results of these studies indicate substantial variability in time and space necessitating more study particularly in the variability of classified rain events the use of daily rainfall allows the separation into frequency fraction of rain days and intensity rainfall per rain day which may aid in a more in depth rain structure investigation sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 previous studies have found that classified rain intensities and frequencies reveal unique regional characteristics changes in rain variability wang and zhai 2008 li et al 2021 some notable studies have looked at changes in rain intensity and frequency brunetti et al 2000 for example classified all rain events in northern italy into five groups using 2 5 12 5 25 0 and 50 mm day as thresholds and discovered increases decreases in heavy light rain classes hennessy et al 1997 discovered more moderate and heavy rain and less light rain at high latitudes karl and knight 1998 employed percentile thresholds to generate 20th century rain trends of various intensities in the united states according to the findings positive trends in the top ten percentiles of the rain distribution accounted for more than half of the total rain increase osborn et al 2000 used a similar but improved approach to study the daily rain intensity in the uk during winter they found less light and moderate rain and more heavy rain which was the opposite of summer impact several comparable studies in china have considered historical patterns in the amount and frequency of rain of various intensities zhai et al 1999 classified rain intensity into three categories 10 50 and 100 mm day and found a decline in high intensity rain from 1951 to 1996 according to liu et al 2011 and qian et al 2007 light rain 1 0 mm day 1 has also decreased shi et al 2010 used the regcm3 model to predict changes in rain events of various intensities from 2071 to 2100 under the sres a2 scenario and found a general rise in heavy rain 20 mm day across many regions of china sun et al 2021 calculated the 99th percentile value of the whole precipitation series which was defined as the threshold value for extreme precipitation events although many studies have documented rain pattern variations over the tp li et al 2021 wei et al 2021 however classified rain events and their contributions to the total rain needs further investigation in this study we reexamine rain change patterns over the tp while making some methodological adjustments firstly since most previous studies focused on either mean or extreme rain changes we analyzed the change in the total rain intensity and frequency from light to extreme events secondly several earlier studies employed fixed thresholds to designate distinct rain intensities in homogeneous regions peng and liu 2009 groisman et al 2012 however in huge regions like the tp where rain intensity and frequency vary greatly a percentile based threshold will be utilized to identify rain intensity and frequency categories alexander et al 2006 li et al 2011 thirdly the parametric linear regression approach has been extensively used to calculate trends which could be problematic because the method presupposes a normal data distribution while rainfall variables are typically extremely skewed consequently a non parametric statistical method for trend detection is employed finally since it s relatively unclear how classified rain intensity contributes to total rain change we further examined the relative contributions of rain of different intensities to total rain change using multiple linear regression mlr models and relative weights rws the key goals of this research are as follows i to determine daily annual and decadal rain intensity and frequency from light to extreme events as well as their changes ii to examine the trends of classified rain events using a modified mann kendall mmk non parametric statistical test iii to evaluate the contributions of classified rain events to total rain variation using the mlr model and rws and iv to investigate possible linkages between classified rain events and climatic factors better knowledge of the characterization and contributions of classified rain events to total rain from this current study will significantly help one understand and interpret rain variability over the tp 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp is situated in southwestern china fig 1 its geographical coordinates are between 26 00 n 39 46 n and 73 18 e 104 46 e it covers more than 2 5 million square kilometers and has an average elevation of above 4000 m qiu 2008 thus making the region known as the roof of the world chen et al 2015 with an average annual temperature of roughly 3 1 to 4 4 c and average yearly precipitation of around 103 694 mm tp has a typical cold and dry alpine environment many rivers originate in the southeastern region including the yangtze river the yellow river and the lancang river earning the region the nickname asian water tower the southeastern part is warm and humid and the northwest region is cold and dry the distribution of precipitation is irregular in the southeast motuo and northwestern lenghu areas yearly rainfall can reach 4000 and 17 6 mm respectively the average annual wind speed is more than 3 0 m s due to the effect of the westerly circulation and the terrain of tp and gale weather with wind speeds greater than 17 m s occurs on more than 50 days each year li et al 2016 due to its unique geographical location and large scale topography the tp strongly influences regional and global climates feng et al 2020 2 2 datasets rain gauges have the most reliable sensors for providing direct and accurate point rainfall data across the ground surface but their geographical distribution throughout the tp is uneven and sparse to investigate geographical variation we combined two reanalysis datasets to create a uniformly spaced rainfall grid the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product and the global daily unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation dataset from the climate prediction center cpc the cfsr was developed by ncep and it incorporated substantial improvements such as a higher resolution of t382 38 km and 64 vertical levels extending up to 0 26 hpa from the surface saha et al 2010 from 1979 to 2010 ncar s research data archive https rda ucar edu has had cfsr data available at a 6 hourly time step and cfsv2 an expansion of cfsr data is available from 2011 forward on the other hand cpc is one of the noaa climate prediction center s cpc unified precipitation project cpc deliverables the project s primary purpose is to provide a suite of acceptable precipitation products with a consistent amount and better quality by merging all data sources accessible at cpc and utilizing the optimum interpolation oi objective analysis technique precipitation values are accumulated daily with a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 and a daily temporal resolution from 1979 to 2020 3 methods 3 1 categorization of rain events percentile based thresholds have been commonly used in past studies to define extreme events heavy and very heavy rain occurrences for example have been categorized as top 5 and 1 respectively alexander et al 2006 li et al 2011 heavy rain events included very heavy rain events therefore these categories were not mutually exclusive as a result these two categories rates of change were not independent of one another making it difficult to assess the contribution of different rain intensities to total rain change separately therefore this study uses three percentile values i e 50 95 and 99 as thresholds li et al 2011 these thresholds are first calculated for each dataset from 1981 to 2020 and later used to divide rain events into four non overlapping intensity and frequency classes rain intensities are classified as wet rain intensity wri r e 0 1 mm day light rain intensity lri wri 50th percentile mm day moderate rain intensity mri 50th wri 95th percentile mm day heavy rain intensity hri 95th wri 99th percentile mm day very heavy rain intensity vhri wri 99th percentile mm day rain frequencies are classified as dry rain frequency drf n re 0 1 mm day wet rain frequency wrf n re 0 1 mm day light rain frequency lrf wrf 50th percentile day moderate rain frequency mrf 50th wrf 95th percentile day heavy rain frequency hrf 95th wrf 99th percentile day very heavy rain frequency vhrf wrf 99th percentile day r e and n re are the intensity of rain events and days of rain events in each category daily yearly and decadal intensity and frequency are evaluated 3 2 contribution of classified rain events to total rain change standardized regression coefficients zero order correlation partial or semi partial correlation and structure coefficients have all been used to establish contribution rates of rain intensities murray and conner 2009 nimon and oswald 2013 when a significant correlation exists between the independent variable i e rates of change of classified rain x i and the dependent variable i e total rain change y none of these approaches can provide reasonable estimates of the contributions of x i to y johnson and lebreton 2004 nimon and oswald 2013 as a result we sought to apply ratio structure multiple linear regression mlr and relative weights rws in this study 3 2 1 the ratio structure we preliminarily use this ratio to examine the amount of independent variable i e classified rain x i in the dependent variable i e total rain event y this is presented as percentages as follows 1 r s x i y 100 where r s is the ratio structure x i is the classified rain events while y is the total rain events 3 2 2 multiple linear regression mlr is a commonly used statistical strategy for understanding how several independent factors interact to produce a single dependent variable nathans et al 2012 we will evaluate the role of rates of change for a rain of various intensities x i in accounting for the variance of total rain change y using the mlr as a result we used a regression model to investigate the contribution of changes in classified rain events to overall rainfall change 2 r total β 0 β 1 r light β 2 r moderate β 3 r heavy β 4 r very heavy ε where rtotal rlight rmoderate rheavy and rvery heavy denote the change rate for wri lri mri hri and vhri respectively ε is the random error and β s are regression coefficients to be determined 3 2 3 relative weights rws analysis is a relatively new statistical measure for partitioning r 2 of an mlr model between independent variables johnson 2000 when all categorized rain events x i s are uncorrelated the rws are computed as the squared correlation coefficient between each classified rain event x i and the total rain event y the rws represent each x i s contribution to the total model r 2 or the amount of variance in y that can be explained by all xi s the model r 2 and rws determine each rain event s contribution rate and the sum of all rws equals the model r 2 3 3 trends in classified rain events the annual and decadal change of the total and classified rain events over the tp from 1981 to 2020 are studied using the modified mann kendall mmk test owing to its ability to correct autocorrelations issues in datasets the mmk test is a non parametric test suitable for processing non normally distributed data and has been widely used to describe the trends of climate and hydrological time series data mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 this test is not sensitive to the interference of a few outliers and is especially effective for short term time series data the mmk test statistic z has a typical normal distribution if the data series is self correlated there is an upward downward trend if z is positive negative the null hypothesis is denied if z is greater than z 1 β 2 with a confidence level of β where z 1 β 2 is the 1 β 2 quantile when β is 0 05 and z is 1 96 the trend is supposed significant after introducing a corrective factor in z n 1 s the mmk statistic z m is calculated as follows 3 z z n 1 s where n 1 s 4 1 2 n 1 jj 1 n 1 1 n 1 1 r jj for jj 1 2 r 1 n 1 1 n 1 r 1 2 n 1 1 r 1 n 1 r 1 1 2 for jj 1 where r jj is the sample self correlation coefficient 3 4 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is the most extensively used correlation coefficient for measuring the degree of linear association between two variables we chose this method to analyze the correlation between each classified rain event x i and the total rain event y the calculation formula is as follows 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 in eq 5 x i and y i are the two variables x and y are average values of the variables and r is their correlation coefficient the two variables are favorably associated when r 0 and negatively correlated when r 0 the larger the r the stronger the association 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of classified rain intensity 4 1 1 temporal daily variation of total daily wet and classified rain intensities fig 2 shows the boxplots of the daily historical time series of wri and classified rain intensities from cfsr and cpc for four decades between 1981 and 2020 over the tp results showed that there was an increase in daily wri and the highest mean rain intensity was 2 82 and 2 03 mm day for cfsr and cpc respectively during the 2011 2020 decade fig 2a after rain categorization the obtained lri ranged from 0 62 to 0 76 mm day and 0 41 0 53 mm day for cfsr and cpc respectively with the highest intensities occurring during the 2011 2020 decade the average decadal mean of mri hri and vhri was 4 14 mm day 13 76 mm day and 23 60 mm day respectively i e cfsr which were relatively higher than those captured by cpc it was obvious that both datasets recorded the highest wri during the 2011 2020 decade which contributed to the intensities of lri mri hri and vhri in that decade however the 1991 2000 and 1981 1990 decades recorded the least intensities of wri lri mri and hri vhri respectively our results showed that classified rain intensities showed a better representation of rain characteristics than the mean wri and was significant for inter decadal rainfall variations research shi et al 2007 4 1 2 spatial patterns and trends of total daily wet and classified rain events fig 3 shows the decadal spatial patterns of wri and four classified rain intensities from cfsr a e and cpc f j over the tp region from 1981 to 2020 results from both datasets showed that wri exhibited apparent spatial features with average weighted rain intensities ranging from 0 to 10 mm day for all decades the pattern of rain distributions revealed that maximum intensity was recorded over the eastern tp which decreased northwestward classifying the rain intensity further we obtained more interesting results the lri mri hri and vhri patterns which ranged between 0 15 and 3 88 mm day 0 60 13 75 mm day 3 0 38 98 mm day and 5 40 77 05 mm day respectively exhibited similar patterns with wri most of the accumulations were over the northeast and southeastern regions which decreased hinterland towards the northwestern region the standard deviations of total daily wri and categorized rains were likewise climatologically consistent with larger values over southern tp and smaller values over the northwestern region fig 3 however hri and vhri standard deviations were much closer to that of wri over tp previous studies have also confirmed that the tp precipitation declines significantly from southeast to northwest and is primarily concentrated in the himalayan southern foothills liu et al 2019 the majority of the southern regions of the tp are prone to severe precipitation events maussion et al 2014 li et al 2021 fig 4 shows the decadal spatial patterns of the four classified rain intensities trends over the tp during 1981 2020 from the cfsr a e and cpc f j where varying patterns were observed the decadal lri trends ranged from 3 to 3 mm year and showed a consistent significant increasing trend across decades the highest positive trend was observed in most eastern regions for cfsr and the southeastern regions for cpc during 2011 2020 previous studies have shown limited water vapor in the north and west of the tp and daily rainfall was between 0 and 0 5 mm day liu et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2021 hence reasons for no trend generally except for the 2001 2010 decade in cpc which had no clear trend in most regions the lri increased compared with the previous decades also in fig 4 mri had the highest positive significant trend and a more pronounced negative significant trend which ranged from 15 to 35 mm year in the northeastern and southeastern parts of tp there were clear increasing trends during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 however a negative significant trend of 10 mm year was observed around the northwestern region during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 and around central regions during 2001 2010 the hri and vhri trends were from 14 to 25 mm year and 20 to 16 mm year respectively during 2001 2010 there were significant increasing trends of over 12 mm year in the northern and southern parts of the tp compared to other decades during 1981 1990 the significant negative trend was more pronounced especially in the cpc dataset when we compared the decadal mean to the overall mean trend fig 4 right panel we found some discrepancies as the overall mean was much lower than the decadal mean with a few exceptions for example in the analysis by decade we found positive trends for light rain events but negative trends for the entire period these findings imply that rainfall events exhibit both short term fluctuations and long term periodicities as a result the analysis based on decades could capture short term fluctuations whereas the overall trend captured long term periodicities 4 1 3 intra annual variations of total and classified rain events fig 5 a d shows the temporal variations of the intra annual wri and other classified rain intensities over tp during 1981 2020 results showed that the wri lri mri hri and vhri captured by both datasets vary significantly for instance the wri from cfsr ranged between 636 34 and 941 25 mm yr while that of cpc ranged between 274 83 and 541 56 mm yr fig 5a studies of ma et al 2018 using the tmpa dataset had previously reported that the mean annual precipitation varied from 500 mm year to 700 mm year over the tp without excluding rainfall less than 1 mm day sun et al 2006 as observed in fig 5a the mean annual precipitation from mri which ranges from 389 56 to 587 82 mm yr i e cfsr was the highest with a significant increasing trend of 2 69 and 1 84 mm yr for cfsr and cpc respectively table 1 conversely the rain accumulation resulting from vhri ranged from 47 54 to 144 01 mm yr i e cfsr fig 5e and had a significant increasing trend of 0 65 mm yr and 0 38 mm yr for cfsr and cpc respectively table 1 the lri from cfsr decreased by 0 36 mm yr while that from cpc showed no clear trend p 0 05 table 1 which was similar to previous studies that have shown a decrease and increase in the frequency of light and heavy precipitation events respectively wan et al 2017 in recent years precipitation over the plateau has increased significantly and variance was fairly considerable and in some places it even declined ma and hu 2005 wu et al 2007 xu et al 2008 wan et al 2017 extreme precipitation threshold in more than 65 of the stations in the north southeast and southwest of the tp generally showed an increasing trend during the 1960 2000s though decreased in some regions lu et al 2014 sun et al 2021 4 2 characterization of classified rain frequency 4 2 1 spatial patterns and trends of classified rain frequency the decadal variations in the classified rain frequencies are presented in fig 6 and they distinctively show different patterns in the number of rainy days in each decade consisting of roughly 3650 days lrf and mrf had relatively close values spatial patterns and also dominated the entire wrf over tp the maximum frequencies recorded for lrf and mrf from cfsr were 46 6 i e 1700 days and 41 1 i e 1600 days respectively the hrf ranged between 0 82 and 4 11 i e 30 150 days while vhrf ranged from 0 082 to 0 96 i e 3 35 days over the tp these findings are not surprising given that previous research has shown that heavy rainfall events are becoming less common and are being observed all over the world these frequencies were much higher in cfsr than cpc especially in the southeastern and northwestern regions clearly showing great disparities between the datasets this result was broadly consistent with previous studies on the distribution characteristics of summer precipitation over the tp where extreme rainfall events are more frequent in the south and east and less so in the north and west ji et al 2018 fig 7 describes the observed trends of the classified rain frequencies during each decade i e a d and f i and the entire study period i e e and j from cfsr and cpc during 1981 2020 over the tp we observed that the lrf and mrf trends were much higher than the hrf and vhrf with distinct regional patterns during each decade and entire study duration the decadal lrf and mrf trends were from 8 to 8 days yr which gave a more detailed pattern compared to the mean trend i e 1981 2020 that ranged from 0 4 to 2 0 days year for instance the largest increasing significant trend of about 8 days year was recorded during 2001 2010 in the western region i e lrf and northern i e mrf which increased slightly towards the eastern regions of the tp in the next decade however sharp decreasing negative trends of lrf and mrf were also observed in the northern and southern regions during 1981 1990 from both datasets the decadal hrf trends vary from 1 5 to 1 8 days year while vhrf was from 1 0 to 0 8 days year the values of which were much higher than their corresponding annual mean trends from 1981 to 2020 this study demonstrated that changes in rain frequency were mostly linked to changes in lrf and mrf shift in all decades moreover the overall mean trend for the entire period was significantly lower than the decadal trends for all of the different categories of rain frequency the majority of the positive trends captured over the decades were not captured over the entire period as explained in section 4 1 2 short term rain frequency fluctuations were well captured during the decade whereas the overall mean represents long term frequency change 4 2 2 intra annual variations of total and classified rain frequency the intra annual variations in drf wrf as well as that of the classified rain frequencies are presented in fig 8 a f the mean annual drf values obtained from cpc from 1981 to 2020 ranged from 187 to 267 days which was were relatively higher than cfsr for wrf cfsr ranged from 211 to 256 days and are much higher than those obtained from cpc fig 8a and b although the time series revealed large inter annual fluctuations however drf showed no visible trend change while wrf increase slightly at the rate of 0 39 days yr table 2 the rates of change in rain frequency differed between the four categories the classified lrf mrf hrf and vhrf ranged between 97 and 143 days 90 122 days 7 13 days and 2 4 days respectively for cfsr which were much higher than cpc values as shown in fig 8c and table 2 lrf showed a persistent significant declining tendency when compared to other rain classes with a change rate of 0 53 days yr for cfsr and no trend for cpc table 2 we observed that lri fell at a rate of 0 36 days yr due to the decrease in frequency the average increasing rates of days for cfsr were 0 35 days yr 0 10 days yr 0 03 days yr for mrf hrf and vhrf respectively which were all significant p 0 05 table 2 4 3 relationship between classified rain intensity and frequency distributions climate change impacts have necessitated various researches on rain distributions over the tp ma et al 2020 in this study daily rainfall observations from cfsr and cpc were analyzed as a combination of the frequency fraction of rain days and the intensity rainfall per rain day of rainfall events brown et al 2010 as explained in section 3 1 following sun et al 2006 rainfall less than 1 mm day was excluded as drizzle will generally contribute little to rain observations the remaining rain observations were then separated into different categories which may be considered to represent different classes of rainfall sun et al 2006 the decadal rain intensity and frequency estimated demonstrated distinct spatial patterns and could reveal more information about precipitation distributions especially in the eastern and southern regions of the tp during each decade majority of the classified rain intensities and frequencies were less variant in the northwestern region but varied significantly over the eastern and southeastern regions which was in agreement with previous studies regarding precipitation distributions over tp the mean annual precipitation received in the eastern and southeastern ranged from 300 mm year to 1000 mm year ma et al 2018 fan et al 2021 which could be 10 times lesser in the northern regions li et al 2021 moreover li et al 2021 also showed that water vapour and precipitation decreased sharply towards the northwest where precipitation ranged from 100 mm year to 300 mm year these findings showed that precipitation distribution was affected by topography implying that topography could play a significant role in the spatial distribution of rain intensity and frequency thus it is very necessary to understand the relationship between topography and precipitation as this is of great significance to realize the management of the river water resources over the tp tan et al 2020 li et al 2021 further as rain events increase in intensity from light to very heavy rain the corresponding rain frequencies decrease for instance the lri and vhri ranged between 0 15 and 3 88 mm day and 5 40 77 05 mm day while lrf and vhrf were 46 6 i e 1700 days and 1 10 i e 3 35 days respectively per decade hence lrf and mrf contribute more than 90 to the overall tp precipitation which confirms previous studies that the rising disproportionate frequency of precipitation events was the cause of the precipitation increase mohammed 2005 wan et al 2017 other studies have also confirmed that there could be a shift in frequency distribution in favor of more intense rainfall at a decreased frequency thus indicating that while rainfall is becoming less frequent it is becoming more intense trenberth 1999 generally precipitation frequency has declined annually and seasonally while intensity increased across china and the frequency decline was primarily due to the lowest decile of intensity decline zhai et al 1999 wan et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2021 the frequency of rain the intensity of rain or both could greatly affect the trends of total rain over the tp we observed that the largest increasing and decreasing rainfall intensities which were 35 mm year and 12 mm year respectively occurred during moderate rain correspondingly the highest frequency trend was also observed in this class which also ranged from 8 to 10 mm year most areas in the northern and southern regions during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 showed the highest increasing trend during moderate rain while northwestern regions of tp demonstrated decreasing frequency with very few exceptions previous studies have suggested that characteristics such as rainfall frequency and intensity are central to understanding and predicting the response of rainfall to climate change sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 therefore it is important to evaluate the ability of climate models to capture the spatial and temporal patterns of classified rainfall frequency and intensity and their relationship with atmospheric circulation regimes sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 4 4 relationship between classified rain events and total wet rain 4 4 1 correlation between total daily wet rain and classified rain events to determine how the classified rain events relate to the total wri we examined the pearson correlation r association between each of the classified events and the total wri and presents the results in fig 9 for cfsr a d and cpc e h datasets generally the spatial pattern revealed that r ranged between 0 90 0 9 0 2 1 00 0 08 0 90 and 0 80 0 98 for lri mri hri and vhri respectively during the four decades the lri showed the slightest association with total daily wri followed by vhri over the tp conversely mri correlates significantly well with the total daily wri with r coefficients well above 0 80 especially over the southern and eastern regions of the tp and along the borders and surroundings of the tp by inter comparisons fig 9 also demonstrated that the distribution of the decadal correlation of hri has characteristics next to mri as shown in section 4 2 the mrf was greater than 47 clearly dominating the rain amount therefore this relationship implies that the year to year variability in the distribution of the total wet rain over the tp could be attributed to changes in the intensity and frequency of mri 4 4 2 contributions of classified rain intensities to total rain change as the climate over the tp is influenced by different atmospheric circulation patterns the contribution of classified rain intensities to the total wri varies temporally and spatially ma et al 2018 fig 10 a d shows the temporal variations of the intra annual contributions of different rain intensities to the total wri over tp during 1981 2020 results obtained from both datasets revealed significant differences in their intra annual contributions to the yearly wetting trends our result showed that mri contributed the greatest percentage which ranged between 57 36 and 65 95 and between 57 31 and 69 09 for cfsr and cpc fig 10b followed by hri fig 10c the mann kendal trend results in table 3 showed significantly decreased lri contributions from cfsr 0 13 mm yr and cpc 0 08 mm yr and also mri contributions from cfsr 0 12 mm yr during 1981 2020 table 3 however hri and vhri contributions both increased significantly at 0 1 mm year p 0 05 for cfsr while mri hri and vhri showed no obvious trend in the cpc dataset table 3 fig 11 shows the decadal spatial patterns of classified rain intensities contributions to total wri from cfsr a d and cpc e h over the tp region as shown in the figure the contributions revealed significant differences for both datasets and the pattern seemed consistent for all decades the proportion of lri in the total wri from both datasets ranged between 7 and 21 across all decades with the highest contribution in the southern i e cfsr and northern i e cpc regions also the percentage contribution of hri was between 10 and 44 with a maximum rate in the northwestern part which could result from spring and winter precipitation ma et al 2018 besides some areas in the northwest region with values close to 65 the overall contributions of vhri were minimal with values below 30 overall mri accounted for the most significant contributions to the total wri across the four decades in most parts of the tp and the rate varied between 42 and 70 with the maximum along the southern himalayas and the southeast tp hence mri played a dominant role in the year to year variability of wri followed by hri previous studies have also shown that most precipitation occurs in summer contributing to around 70 of annual precipitation in the central band from the arabic sea to the northeast part of the tp as well as most of the southeast tp ma et al 2018 similar to the seasonal precipitation contributions the largest precipitation occurs in july and the second and the third largest precipitation occur in august and june respectively the classified rain intensities contributions to decadal precipitation demonstrated not only the precipitation in each decade but also the combined and competitive influences of the westerlies and the east asian and southern asian monsoons which was in line with previous studies ma et al 2018 4 4 3 variance and relative weights of classified rain intensity an mlr model was developed to examine the decadal contributions of lri mri hri and vhri to total wri change the model r 2 which represents the explained variance in the dependent variable i e wri change and the rws which shows each independent variable s contribution i e classified rain intensities to the overall model r 2 were determined tables 4 and 5 shows the model r 2 and rws for each independent variable from both datasets which revealed that the weighted linear combination of lri mri hri and vhri could explain all the variance in wri change with models having very high r 2 98 99 for instance in table 4 showing cfsr decades model r 2 was 0 999 0 997 0 999 and 0 994 while their adjusted r 2 were 0 998 0 995 0 999 and 0 989 respectively which means that our model roughly explains 99 of the total variance in the wri similar results were also obtained for cpc decades shown in table 5 the rws revealed that lri mri hri and vhri explained significant variance in wri change as none of the 95 cis for the significance tests contained zero for cfsr mri was the most important variable with rws of 0 32 0 36 0 35 and 0 41 during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively while lri relative contributions to the overall r 2 were the least and these values were significantly different from the remaining variables table 4 except for lri during 1981 1990 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 all other variables are indeed significant predictors of the wri change p 0 05 for different t val table 4 the cpc also revealed mri as the most important variable with rws slightly higher than cfsr table 5 furthermore the relative weight of vhri rws 0 163 0 048 and 0 054 during 1981 1990 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively was significantly lower except for lri during 1991 2000 rws 0 012 considering lri during 1981 1990 2011 2020 and hri during 2001 2010 all other variables were indeed significant predictors of wri change p 0 05 for different t val table 5 overall mri and hri contributed the most to the overall wri change with lri and vhri contributing the least majority of the explained variance in total wri in cfsr was attributed to mri having 32 36 35 40 of model r 2 during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively similar results were observed for cpc except that the mri had a higher variance than cfsr as shown in table 5 4 5 relationship between classified rain events and climatic factors the spatiotemporal change of precipitation is the result of the interaction among many climatic factors of which the temperature is important because of its association with global warming as temperature increases evaporation rates also increases correspondingly probably accelerating the global hydrological cycle zhang et al 2011 wan et al 2017 li et al 2020 2021 given the expected intensification it is important to understand the relationship between rainfall distributions and atmospheric temperature increasing precipitation has been linked to rising temperatures during the 1990s and li et al 2020 found a good relationship between monthly precipitation and temperature however this study examined the relationship between classified rain events and temperature by obtaining temperature composites during each event and later examined the correlation between classified rain events and temperature fig 12 a d shows the temperature composites during light moderate heavy and very heavy rainfall while fig 12 e h shows the mean difference between the average temperature classified rain events between 1981 and 2020 over the tp as shown from the figure the temperature pattern showed that more intensity was associated with very heavy rain than light rain events previous studies have also shown that atmospheric temperature strongly influences the intensity of extreme rainfall as warmer air is capable of holding more water than cooler air and therefore has the potential to provide more moisture to rainfall events brown et al 2010 maussion et al 2014 the associations between temperature and classified rain events from cfsr and cpc during 1981 2020 are given in table 6 despite the increase in temperature from light to very heavy rain events the decadal relationships defined by correlation coefficients showed different outcomes in some cases lri had a significant negative r of 0 79 and 0 64 during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 respectively while mri hri and vhri had r values of 0 30 0 37 and 0 58 during 1981 1990 and 0 25 0 43 and 0 47 respectively during 2011 2020 these relationships showed that vhri had the highest association with temperature according to du et al 2004 surface air temperature over china has increased substantially resulting in a warmer and wetter climate particularly in northwest china wang et al 2004 wu et al 2005 shi et al 2007 wei et al 2021 these conclusions were in line with our findings conversely vhri had a somewhat negative relationship with temperature for instance there was a negative relationship between lri r 0 39 and mri r 0 45 during 1991 2000 and with mri r 0 65 hri r 0 58 and vhri r 0 42 during 2001 2010 also except for hrf r 0 35 vhrf r 0 49 during 1981 1990 vhrf r 0 08 during 1991 2000 and hrf r 0 68 vhrf r 0 53 during 2011 2020 wrf and classified rain frequencies all had significant negative correlations with mean annual temperature in cfsr this study implies that while it may be valid that increased surface temperatures may cause an increase in regional and global precipitation wentz et al 2007 wan et al 2017 some other climatic factors might have influenced these relationships li et al 2020 2021 sun et al 2021 4 6 limitations and future research direction even though this study objectively and qualitatively evaluated cfsr and cpc rain intensities and frequencies their estimations differ widely across the tp overall the cfsr datasets recorded higher rain intensity than the cpc datasets introducing some uncertainty about which datasets overestimated or underestimated rain intensities and frequencies as a result remote sensing and satellite based precipitation observations should be used to provide better cognitions of precise characterizations of rain intensity and frequency over complicated terrain as the tp ma et al 2018 tan et al 2020 lu et al 2020 over the last 30 years there have been substantial developments in remote sensing techniques and satellite based retrieval algorithms fan et al 2021 and satellite precipitation products have been produced and they have shown enormous potential in various domains fan et al 2021 tan et al 2020 ma et al 2018 li et al 2020 2021 in estimating precipitation amount tan et al 2020 recommended asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite daily gridded precipitation and temperature datasets due to its performance high accuracy and most detailed precipitation pattern than the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr while for rainfall occurrence aphrodite had the strongest ability to correctly detect rain events followed by persiann cdr and chirps li et al 2020 however the three precipitation products generally tend to estimate heavy rainfall inaccurately furthermore fan et al 2021 showed that the daily performance of global precipitation measurement integrated multi satellite retrievals gpm imerg and soil moisture to rain advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat sm2rasc is comparable imerg on the other hand outperforms sm2rasc in terms of precipitation detectability the sm2rasc product estimates light to moderate rainfall 5 25 mm day more precisely than the imerg however tests have shown that the imerg product can catch places with drizzle and heavy rainfall 25 mm day better than trmm xu et al 2019 ma et al 2020 fan et al 2021 this study reveals the sm2rasc product s superior performance over tp fan et al 2021 despite the study s limitations the overall results from both datasets revealed that moderate rain contributes significantly to total rain change over the tp 5 summary and conclusion this study examined the characterization and contributions of classified rain events to total rain change over tp using cfsr and cpc datasets from 1981 to 2020 rain events are classified into four non overlapping categories lri values less than 50th percentile mri values between 50th and 95th percentile hri values between 95th and 99th percentile and vhri values above 99th percentile the rain totals of different intensity categories were then calculated on a daily yearly and decadal scale and their trends and variations were investigated in addition we calculated the contributions of rain changes of various intensities to total rain change using multiple regression models and relative weights the following are the study s main findings classified rain intensities showed a better representation of decadal rain characteristics than the mean wri the 2011 2020 decade had the highest wri resulting in high lri mri hri and vhri the largest amounts of hri and vhri were more frequent and widely distributed along the edge of the south and eastern tp and less in the north and west consistent with previous studies yang et al 2014 ji et al 2018 sun et al 2021 lri had a slight interannual variation and a decreasing trend when compared to other rain categories lri has decreased in general which could be due to china s rising temperatures many previous studies also reported that in a warmer climate upper 50 percentile rain was likely to increase more than the lower 50 percentile mri had the highest positive significant trend about 35 mm year which was more evident during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 in the northern and southeastern tp the northwestern part during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 and the central regions during 2001 2010 experienced a significant negative trend of 10 mm year hri and vhri trends were from 14 to 25 mm yr and 20 to 16 mm yr our analysis shows that mri dominates in total wri variability over the past four decades most regions had r coefficients well over 0 80 which was amazing the year to year variability of mri was quite similar to that of total wri however rain frequency changes were mostly linked to the change in hrf the proportion of classified rains in total wri showed significant differences across all decades lri ranged between 7 and 21 while hri was between 10 and 44 except for some northwestern regions with 65 vhri contributions were below 35 overall mri 42 70 accounted for the greatest contribution to wri playing the most crucial role in its year to year variability the weighted linear combination of the classified rain events could roughly explain almost all the variance in total wri change with models having very high r 2 98 99 the majority of the explained variance in total wri was attributed to mri having 32 36 35 40 respectively of model r 2 in each decade and lri was not significant p 0 05 the annual wri mri hri and vhri had a significant positive association with mean yearly temperature and a negative with lri this shows that a warmer environment may be connected with more hri and vhri than lri and mri wang et al 2004 wu et al 2005 it is well understood that the climate change process particularly the change in precipitation that the factors affecting precipitation the consequence of several elements including topography atmospheric pressure wind speed radiation surface heat flux cloud cover change and humidity li et al 2020 2021 sun et al 2021 and most studies have addressed the changes in precipitation across different regions and timescales however considering the complexity of the tp it is limiting to examine the change in classified rain intensities based just on temperature therefore it remains of great significance to explore precipitation distribution in light of these considerations besides further analysis of convective processes moisture transport and sources cloud processes and el niño southern oscillation enso impacts in producing different categories of rain brown et al 2010 however the characterization and contributions of classified rain to total rain in this current study will aid scientific

8071,study region qinghai tibet plateau study focus we focused on characterization and contributions of classified rain to total rain change for each decade between 1981 and 2020 rain events were categorized into four non overlapping groups based on percentile thresholds light rain lri 50th percentile moderate rain mri 50th 95th percentiles heavy rain hri 95th 99th percentiles and very heavy rain vhri 99th percentile with trends detected using robust non parametric approach thereafter we used relative weights and multiple regression models to assess the contribution of each categorized rain to the overall rainfall change new hydrological insights for the region classified rain represented rain features better than mean wet rain intensity mean rain intensity fluctuated as classified rain although 50th percentiles mri hri and vhri increased more weighted linear combination revealed that during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 majority of explained variance in total rain intensities was attributed to mri with 32 36 35 40 model r 2 respectively the mri year to year variation was also consistent with total wet rain r 0 8 implying that mri was the most significant predictor of total rain change p 0 05 although the annual wet rain mri hri and vhri all had positive linkages with temperature it is still important to investigate the variability of classified rain intensity and frequency in the context of other climatic factors this research will aid the understanding of changes in classified rain events keywords rain frequency rain intensity multiple linear regression relative weights climate change tibetan plateau 1 introduction climate projections for the twenty first century have predicted an increase in global temperature which could alter the global water cycle through intensification wang et al 2016 wan et al 2017 as the global water cycle intensifies huge modifications in climate patterns are expected trenberth 2011 berghuijs et al 2014 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 for instance the rising temperature will result in a corresponding increase in evaporation rates and moisture content thereby resulting in more frequent storms and increased danger of floods less precipitation is expected away from storm tracks increasing the risk of drought ayantobo et al 2021 the change from snow to rain due to rising temperatures has also been recorded by berghuijs et al 2014 climate change and its impact on the frequency and intensity of extreme events has recently sparked widespread concern because of their significant impacts on agriculture water resource structures natural ecosystems and other socio economic factors easterling 2000 min et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 kuriqi et al 2019 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 hence analyzing trends and variability in these events is a critical task for mitigating the potential impact of heavy precipitation and improving future climatic adaptation many studies have examined mean and extreme rain events fluctuations concentrating on changes in their long term climatic mean state as well as changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events under climate change pavan et al 2008 schindler et al 2012 few studies in china reveal that while precipitation days have decreased in most places except the northwest rain intensity has increased liu et al 2005 qian and lin 2005 from 1961 to 2015 li et al 2011 found a continuous rise in rain frequency and intensity in northwest china wang and zhou 2005 identified growing trends in eastern and northwestern china during summer and decreasing trends in central northern and northeastern china during spring and autumn studies on the tibetan plateau tp have revealed rapid warming and wetting trends over the past decades chen et al 2015 wan et al 2017 despite huge spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation across the tp the overall increasing rain trends have been supported by various ground based li et al 2021 and remote sensing and satellite observations lu et al 2020 fan et al 2021 tan et al 2020 ma et al 2018 li et al 2021 the results of these studies indicate substantial variability in time and space necessitating more study particularly in the variability of classified rain events the use of daily rainfall allows the separation into frequency fraction of rain days and intensity rainfall per rain day which may aid in a more in depth rain structure investigation sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 previous studies have found that classified rain intensities and frequencies reveal unique regional characteristics changes in rain variability wang and zhai 2008 li et al 2021 some notable studies have looked at changes in rain intensity and frequency brunetti et al 2000 for example classified all rain events in northern italy into five groups using 2 5 12 5 25 0 and 50 mm day as thresholds and discovered increases decreases in heavy light rain classes hennessy et al 1997 discovered more moderate and heavy rain and less light rain at high latitudes karl and knight 1998 employed percentile thresholds to generate 20th century rain trends of various intensities in the united states according to the findings positive trends in the top ten percentiles of the rain distribution accounted for more than half of the total rain increase osborn et al 2000 used a similar but improved approach to study the daily rain intensity in the uk during winter they found less light and moderate rain and more heavy rain which was the opposite of summer impact several comparable studies in china have considered historical patterns in the amount and frequency of rain of various intensities zhai et al 1999 classified rain intensity into three categories 10 50 and 100 mm day and found a decline in high intensity rain from 1951 to 1996 according to liu et al 2011 and qian et al 2007 light rain 1 0 mm day 1 has also decreased shi et al 2010 used the regcm3 model to predict changes in rain events of various intensities from 2071 to 2100 under the sres a2 scenario and found a general rise in heavy rain 20 mm day across many regions of china sun et al 2021 calculated the 99th percentile value of the whole precipitation series which was defined as the threshold value for extreme precipitation events although many studies have documented rain pattern variations over the tp li et al 2021 wei et al 2021 however classified rain events and their contributions to the total rain needs further investigation in this study we reexamine rain change patterns over the tp while making some methodological adjustments firstly since most previous studies focused on either mean or extreme rain changes we analyzed the change in the total rain intensity and frequency from light to extreme events secondly several earlier studies employed fixed thresholds to designate distinct rain intensities in homogeneous regions peng and liu 2009 groisman et al 2012 however in huge regions like the tp where rain intensity and frequency vary greatly a percentile based threshold will be utilized to identify rain intensity and frequency categories alexander et al 2006 li et al 2011 thirdly the parametric linear regression approach has been extensively used to calculate trends which could be problematic because the method presupposes a normal data distribution while rainfall variables are typically extremely skewed consequently a non parametric statistical method for trend detection is employed finally since it s relatively unclear how classified rain intensity contributes to total rain change we further examined the relative contributions of rain of different intensities to total rain change using multiple linear regression mlr models and relative weights rws the key goals of this research are as follows i to determine daily annual and decadal rain intensity and frequency from light to extreme events as well as their changes ii to examine the trends of classified rain events using a modified mann kendall mmk non parametric statistical test iii to evaluate the contributions of classified rain events to total rain variation using the mlr model and rws and iv to investigate possible linkages between classified rain events and climatic factors better knowledge of the characterization and contributions of classified rain events to total rain from this current study will significantly help one understand and interpret rain variability over the tp 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp is situated in southwestern china fig 1 its geographical coordinates are between 26 00 n 39 46 n and 73 18 e 104 46 e it covers more than 2 5 million square kilometers and has an average elevation of above 4000 m qiu 2008 thus making the region known as the roof of the world chen et al 2015 with an average annual temperature of roughly 3 1 to 4 4 c and average yearly precipitation of around 103 694 mm tp has a typical cold and dry alpine environment many rivers originate in the southeastern region including the yangtze river the yellow river and the lancang river earning the region the nickname asian water tower the southeastern part is warm and humid and the northwest region is cold and dry the distribution of precipitation is irregular in the southeast motuo and northwestern lenghu areas yearly rainfall can reach 4000 and 17 6 mm respectively the average annual wind speed is more than 3 0 m s due to the effect of the westerly circulation and the terrain of tp and gale weather with wind speeds greater than 17 m s occurs on more than 50 days each year li et al 2016 due to its unique geographical location and large scale topography the tp strongly influences regional and global climates feng et al 2020 2 2 datasets rain gauges have the most reliable sensors for providing direct and accurate point rainfall data across the ground surface but their geographical distribution throughout the tp is uneven and sparse to investigate geographical variation we combined two reanalysis datasets to create a uniformly spaced rainfall grid the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product and the global daily unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation dataset from the climate prediction center cpc the cfsr was developed by ncep and it incorporated substantial improvements such as a higher resolution of t382 38 km and 64 vertical levels extending up to 0 26 hpa from the surface saha et al 2010 from 1979 to 2010 ncar s research data archive https rda ucar edu has had cfsr data available at a 6 hourly time step and cfsv2 an expansion of cfsr data is available from 2011 forward on the other hand cpc is one of the noaa climate prediction center s cpc unified precipitation project cpc deliverables the project s primary purpose is to provide a suite of acceptable precipitation products with a consistent amount and better quality by merging all data sources accessible at cpc and utilizing the optimum interpolation oi objective analysis technique precipitation values are accumulated daily with a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 and a daily temporal resolution from 1979 to 2020 3 methods 3 1 categorization of rain events percentile based thresholds have been commonly used in past studies to define extreme events heavy and very heavy rain occurrences for example have been categorized as top 5 and 1 respectively alexander et al 2006 li et al 2011 heavy rain events included very heavy rain events therefore these categories were not mutually exclusive as a result these two categories rates of change were not independent of one another making it difficult to assess the contribution of different rain intensities to total rain change separately therefore this study uses three percentile values i e 50 95 and 99 as thresholds li et al 2011 these thresholds are first calculated for each dataset from 1981 to 2020 and later used to divide rain events into four non overlapping intensity and frequency classes rain intensities are classified as wet rain intensity wri r e 0 1 mm day light rain intensity lri wri 50th percentile mm day moderate rain intensity mri 50th wri 95th percentile mm day heavy rain intensity hri 95th wri 99th percentile mm day very heavy rain intensity vhri wri 99th percentile mm day rain frequencies are classified as dry rain frequency drf n re 0 1 mm day wet rain frequency wrf n re 0 1 mm day light rain frequency lrf wrf 50th percentile day moderate rain frequency mrf 50th wrf 95th percentile day heavy rain frequency hrf 95th wrf 99th percentile day very heavy rain frequency vhrf wrf 99th percentile day r e and n re are the intensity of rain events and days of rain events in each category daily yearly and decadal intensity and frequency are evaluated 3 2 contribution of classified rain events to total rain change standardized regression coefficients zero order correlation partial or semi partial correlation and structure coefficients have all been used to establish contribution rates of rain intensities murray and conner 2009 nimon and oswald 2013 when a significant correlation exists between the independent variable i e rates of change of classified rain x i and the dependent variable i e total rain change y none of these approaches can provide reasonable estimates of the contributions of x i to y johnson and lebreton 2004 nimon and oswald 2013 as a result we sought to apply ratio structure multiple linear regression mlr and relative weights rws in this study 3 2 1 the ratio structure we preliminarily use this ratio to examine the amount of independent variable i e classified rain x i in the dependent variable i e total rain event y this is presented as percentages as follows 1 r s x i y 100 where r s is the ratio structure x i is the classified rain events while y is the total rain events 3 2 2 multiple linear regression mlr is a commonly used statistical strategy for understanding how several independent factors interact to produce a single dependent variable nathans et al 2012 we will evaluate the role of rates of change for a rain of various intensities x i in accounting for the variance of total rain change y using the mlr as a result we used a regression model to investigate the contribution of changes in classified rain events to overall rainfall change 2 r total β 0 β 1 r light β 2 r moderate β 3 r heavy β 4 r very heavy ε where rtotal rlight rmoderate rheavy and rvery heavy denote the change rate for wri lri mri hri and vhri respectively ε is the random error and β s are regression coefficients to be determined 3 2 3 relative weights rws analysis is a relatively new statistical measure for partitioning r 2 of an mlr model between independent variables johnson 2000 when all categorized rain events x i s are uncorrelated the rws are computed as the squared correlation coefficient between each classified rain event x i and the total rain event y the rws represent each x i s contribution to the total model r 2 or the amount of variance in y that can be explained by all xi s the model r 2 and rws determine each rain event s contribution rate and the sum of all rws equals the model r 2 3 3 trends in classified rain events the annual and decadal change of the total and classified rain events over the tp from 1981 to 2020 are studied using the modified mann kendall mmk test owing to its ability to correct autocorrelations issues in datasets the mmk test is a non parametric test suitable for processing non normally distributed data and has been widely used to describe the trends of climate and hydrological time series data mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 this test is not sensitive to the interference of a few outliers and is especially effective for short term time series data the mmk test statistic z has a typical normal distribution if the data series is self correlated there is an upward downward trend if z is positive negative the null hypothesis is denied if z is greater than z 1 β 2 with a confidence level of β where z 1 β 2 is the 1 β 2 quantile when β is 0 05 and z is 1 96 the trend is supposed significant after introducing a corrective factor in z n 1 s the mmk statistic z m is calculated as follows 3 z z n 1 s where n 1 s 4 1 2 n 1 jj 1 n 1 1 n 1 1 r jj for jj 1 2 r 1 n 1 1 n 1 r 1 2 n 1 1 r 1 n 1 r 1 1 2 for jj 1 where r jj is the sample self correlation coefficient 3 4 correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient is the most extensively used correlation coefficient for measuring the degree of linear association between two variables we chose this method to analyze the correlation between each classified rain event x i and the total rain event y the calculation formula is as follows 5 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 in eq 5 x i and y i are the two variables x and y are average values of the variables and r is their correlation coefficient the two variables are favorably associated when r 0 and negatively correlated when r 0 the larger the r the stronger the association 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of classified rain intensity 4 1 1 temporal daily variation of total daily wet and classified rain intensities fig 2 shows the boxplots of the daily historical time series of wri and classified rain intensities from cfsr and cpc for four decades between 1981 and 2020 over the tp results showed that there was an increase in daily wri and the highest mean rain intensity was 2 82 and 2 03 mm day for cfsr and cpc respectively during the 2011 2020 decade fig 2a after rain categorization the obtained lri ranged from 0 62 to 0 76 mm day and 0 41 0 53 mm day for cfsr and cpc respectively with the highest intensities occurring during the 2011 2020 decade the average decadal mean of mri hri and vhri was 4 14 mm day 13 76 mm day and 23 60 mm day respectively i e cfsr which were relatively higher than those captured by cpc it was obvious that both datasets recorded the highest wri during the 2011 2020 decade which contributed to the intensities of lri mri hri and vhri in that decade however the 1991 2000 and 1981 1990 decades recorded the least intensities of wri lri mri and hri vhri respectively our results showed that classified rain intensities showed a better representation of rain characteristics than the mean wri and was significant for inter decadal rainfall variations research shi et al 2007 4 1 2 spatial patterns and trends of total daily wet and classified rain events fig 3 shows the decadal spatial patterns of wri and four classified rain intensities from cfsr a e and cpc f j over the tp region from 1981 to 2020 results from both datasets showed that wri exhibited apparent spatial features with average weighted rain intensities ranging from 0 to 10 mm day for all decades the pattern of rain distributions revealed that maximum intensity was recorded over the eastern tp which decreased northwestward classifying the rain intensity further we obtained more interesting results the lri mri hri and vhri patterns which ranged between 0 15 and 3 88 mm day 0 60 13 75 mm day 3 0 38 98 mm day and 5 40 77 05 mm day respectively exhibited similar patterns with wri most of the accumulations were over the northeast and southeastern regions which decreased hinterland towards the northwestern region the standard deviations of total daily wri and categorized rains were likewise climatologically consistent with larger values over southern tp and smaller values over the northwestern region fig 3 however hri and vhri standard deviations were much closer to that of wri over tp previous studies have also confirmed that the tp precipitation declines significantly from southeast to northwest and is primarily concentrated in the himalayan southern foothills liu et al 2019 the majority of the southern regions of the tp are prone to severe precipitation events maussion et al 2014 li et al 2021 fig 4 shows the decadal spatial patterns of the four classified rain intensities trends over the tp during 1981 2020 from the cfsr a e and cpc f j where varying patterns were observed the decadal lri trends ranged from 3 to 3 mm year and showed a consistent significant increasing trend across decades the highest positive trend was observed in most eastern regions for cfsr and the southeastern regions for cpc during 2011 2020 previous studies have shown limited water vapor in the north and west of the tp and daily rainfall was between 0 and 0 5 mm day liu et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2021 hence reasons for no trend generally except for the 2001 2010 decade in cpc which had no clear trend in most regions the lri increased compared with the previous decades also in fig 4 mri had the highest positive significant trend and a more pronounced negative significant trend which ranged from 15 to 35 mm year in the northeastern and southeastern parts of tp there were clear increasing trends during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 however a negative significant trend of 10 mm year was observed around the northwestern region during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 and around central regions during 2001 2010 the hri and vhri trends were from 14 to 25 mm year and 20 to 16 mm year respectively during 2001 2010 there were significant increasing trends of over 12 mm year in the northern and southern parts of the tp compared to other decades during 1981 1990 the significant negative trend was more pronounced especially in the cpc dataset when we compared the decadal mean to the overall mean trend fig 4 right panel we found some discrepancies as the overall mean was much lower than the decadal mean with a few exceptions for example in the analysis by decade we found positive trends for light rain events but negative trends for the entire period these findings imply that rainfall events exhibit both short term fluctuations and long term periodicities as a result the analysis based on decades could capture short term fluctuations whereas the overall trend captured long term periodicities 4 1 3 intra annual variations of total and classified rain events fig 5 a d shows the temporal variations of the intra annual wri and other classified rain intensities over tp during 1981 2020 results showed that the wri lri mri hri and vhri captured by both datasets vary significantly for instance the wri from cfsr ranged between 636 34 and 941 25 mm yr while that of cpc ranged between 274 83 and 541 56 mm yr fig 5a studies of ma et al 2018 using the tmpa dataset had previously reported that the mean annual precipitation varied from 500 mm year to 700 mm year over the tp without excluding rainfall less than 1 mm day sun et al 2006 as observed in fig 5a the mean annual precipitation from mri which ranges from 389 56 to 587 82 mm yr i e cfsr was the highest with a significant increasing trend of 2 69 and 1 84 mm yr for cfsr and cpc respectively table 1 conversely the rain accumulation resulting from vhri ranged from 47 54 to 144 01 mm yr i e cfsr fig 5e and had a significant increasing trend of 0 65 mm yr and 0 38 mm yr for cfsr and cpc respectively table 1 the lri from cfsr decreased by 0 36 mm yr while that from cpc showed no clear trend p 0 05 table 1 which was similar to previous studies that have shown a decrease and increase in the frequency of light and heavy precipitation events respectively wan et al 2017 in recent years precipitation over the plateau has increased significantly and variance was fairly considerable and in some places it even declined ma and hu 2005 wu et al 2007 xu et al 2008 wan et al 2017 extreme precipitation threshold in more than 65 of the stations in the north southeast and southwest of the tp generally showed an increasing trend during the 1960 2000s though decreased in some regions lu et al 2014 sun et al 2021 4 2 characterization of classified rain frequency 4 2 1 spatial patterns and trends of classified rain frequency the decadal variations in the classified rain frequencies are presented in fig 6 and they distinctively show different patterns in the number of rainy days in each decade consisting of roughly 3650 days lrf and mrf had relatively close values spatial patterns and also dominated the entire wrf over tp the maximum frequencies recorded for lrf and mrf from cfsr were 46 6 i e 1700 days and 41 1 i e 1600 days respectively the hrf ranged between 0 82 and 4 11 i e 30 150 days while vhrf ranged from 0 082 to 0 96 i e 3 35 days over the tp these findings are not surprising given that previous research has shown that heavy rainfall events are becoming less common and are being observed all over the world these frequencies were much higher in cfsr than cpc especially in the southeastern and northwestern regions clearly showing great disparities between the datasets this result was broadly consistent with previous studies on the distribution characteristics of summer precipitation over the tp where extreme rainfall events are more frequent in the south and east and less so in the north and west ji et al 2018 fig 7 describes the observed trends of the classified rain frequencies during each decade i e a d and f i and the entire study period i e e and j from cfsr and cpc during 1981 2020 over the tp we observed that the lrf and mrf trends were much higher than the hrf and vhrf with distinct regional patterns during each decade and entire study duration the decadal lrf and mrf trends were from 8 to 8 days yr which gave a more detailed pattern compared to the mean trend i e 1981 2020 that ranged from 0 4 to 2 0 days year for instance the largest increasing significant trend of about 8 days year was recorded during 2001 2010 in the western region i e lrf and northern i e mrf which increased slightly towards the eastern regions of the tp in the next decade however sharp decreasing negative trends of lrf and mrf were also observed in the northern and southern regions during 1981 1990 from both datasets the decadal hrf trends vary from 1 5 to 1 8 days year while vhrf was from 1 0 to 0 8 days year the values of which were much higher than their corresponding annual mean trends from 1981 to 2020 this study demonstrated that changes in rain frequency were mostly linked to changes in lrf and mrf shift in all decades moreover the overall mean trend for the entire period was significantly lower than the decadal trends for all of the different categories of rain frequency the majority of the positive trends captured over the decades were not captured over the entire period as explained in section 4 1 2 short term rain frequency fluctuations were well captured during the decade whereas the overall mean represents long term frequency change 4 2 2 intra annual variations of total and classified rain frequency the intra annual variations in drf wrf as well as that of the classified rain frequencies are presented in fig 8 a f the mean annual drf values obtained from cpc from 1981 to 2020 ranged from 187 to 267 days which was were relatively higher than cfsr for wrf cfsr ranged from 211 to 256 days and are much higher than those obtained from cpc fig 8a and b although the time series revealed large inter annual fluctuations however drf showed no visible trend change while wrf increase slightly at the rate of 0 39 days yr table 2 the rates of change in rain frequency differed between the four categories the classified lrf mrf hrf and vhrf ranged between 97 and 143 days 90 122 days 7 13 days and 2 4 days respectively for cfsr which were much higher than cpc values as shown in fig 8c and table 2 lrf showed a persistent significant declining tendency when compared to other rain classes with a change rate of 0 53 days yr for cfsr and no trend for cpc table 2 we observed that lri fell at a rate of 0 36 days yr due to the decrease in frequency the average increasing rates of days for cfsr were 0 35 days yr 0 10 days yr 0 03 days yr for mrf hrf and vhrf respectively which were all significant p 0 05 table 2 4 3 relationship between classified rain intensity and frequency distributions climate change impacts have necessitated various researches on rain distributions over the tp ma et al 2020 in this study daily rainfall observations from cfsr and cpc were analyzed as a combination of the frequency fraction of rain days and the intensity rainfall per rain day of rainfall events brown et al 2010 as explained in section 3 1 following sun et al 2006 rainfall less than 1 mm day was excluded as drizzle will generally contribute little to rain observations the remaining rain observations were then separated into different categories which may be considered to represent different classes of rainfall sun et al 2006 the decadal rain intensity and frequency estimated demonstrated distinct spatial patterns and could reveal more information about precipitation distributions especially in the eastern and southern regions of the tp during each decade majority of the classified rain intensities and frequencies were less variant in the northwestern region but varied significantly over the eastern and southeastern regions which was in agreement with previous studies regarding precipitation distributions over tp the mean annual precipitation received in the eastern and southeastern ranged from 300 mm year to 1000 mm year ma et al 2018 fan et al 2021 which could be 10 times lesser in the northern regions li et al 2021 moreover li et al 2021 also showed that water vapour and precipitation decreased sharply towards the northwest where precipitation ranged from 100 mm year to 300 mm year these findings showed that precipitation distribution was affected by topography implying that topography could play a significant role in the spatial distribution of rain intensity and frequency thus it is very necessary to understand the relationship between topography and precipitation as this is of great significance to realize the management of the river water resources over the tp tan et al 2020 li et al 2021 further as rain events increase in intensity from light to very heavy rain the corresponding rain frequencies decrease for instance the lri and vhri ranged between 0 15 and 3 88 mm day and 5 40 77 05 mm day while lrf and vhrf were 46 6 i e 1700 days and 1 10 i e 3 35 days respectively per decade hence lrf and mrf contribute more than 90 to the overall tp precipitation which confirms previous studies that the rising disproportionate frequency of precipitation events was the cause of the precipitation increase mohammed 2005 wan et al 2017 other studies have also confirmed that there could be a shift in frequency distribution in favor of more intense rainfall at a decreased frequency thus indicating that while rainfall is becoming less frequent it is becoming more intense trenberth 1999 generally precipitation frequency has declined annually and seasonally while intensity increased across china and the frequency decline was primarily due to the lowest decile of intensity decline zhai et al 1999 wan et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2021 the frequency of rain the intensity of rain or both could greatly affect the trends of total rain over the tp we observed that the largest increasing and decreasing rainfall intensities which were 35 mm year and 12 mm year respectively occurred during moderate rain correspondingly the highest frequency trend was also observed in this class which also ranged from 8 to 10 mm year most areas in the northern and southern regions during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 showed the highest increasing trend during moderate rain while northwestern regions of tp demonstrated decreasing frequency with very few exceptions previous studies have suggested that characteristics such as rainfall frequency and intensity are central to understanding and predicting the response of rainfall to climate change sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 therefore it is important to evaluate the ability of climate models to capture the spatial and temporal patterns of classified rainfall frequency and intensity and their relationship with atmospheric circulation regimes sun et al 2006 brown et al 2010 4 4 relationship between classified rain events and total wet rain 4 4 1 correlation between total daily wet rain and classified rain events to determine how the classified rain events relate to the total wri we examined the pearson correlation r association between each of the classified events and the total wri and presents the results in fig 9 for cfsr a d and cpc e h datasets generally the spatial pattern revealed that r ranged between 0 90 0 9 0 2 1 00 0 08 0 90 and 0 80 0 98 for lri mri hri and vhri respectively during the four decades the lri showed the slightest association with total daily wri followed by vhri over the tp conversely mri correlates significantly well with the total daily wri with r coefficients well above 0 80 especially over the southern and eastern regions of the tp and along the borders and surroundings of the tp by inter comparisons fig 9 also demonstrated that the distribution of the decadal correlation of hri has characteristics next to mri as shown in section 4 2 the mrf was greater than 47 clearly dominating the rain amount therefore this relationship implies that the year to year variability in the distribution of the total wet rain over the tp could be attributed to changes in the intensity and frequency of mri 4 4 2 contributions of classified rain intensities to total rain change as the climate over the tp is influenced by different atmospheric circulation patterns the contribution of classified rain intensities to the total wri varies temporally and spatially ma et al 2018 fig 10 a d shows the temporal variations of the intra annual contributions of different rain intensities to the total wri over tp during 1981 2020 results obtained from both datasets revealed significant differences in their intra annual contributions to the yearly wetting trends our result showed that mri contributed the greatest percentage which ranged between 57 36 and 65 95 and between 57 31 and 69 09 for cfsr and cpc fig 10b followed by hri fig 10c the mann kendal trend results in table 3 showed significantly decreased lri contributions from cfsr 0 13 mm yr and cpc 0 08 mm yr and also mri contributions from cfsr 0 12 mm yr during 1981 2020 table 3 however hri and vhri contributions both increased significantly at 0 1 mm year p 0 05 for cfsr while mri hri and vhri showed no obvious trend in the cpc dataset table 3 fig 11 shows the decadal spatial patterns of classified rain intensities contributions to total wri from cfsr a d and cpc e h over the tp region as shown in the figure the contributions revealed significant differences for both datasets and the pattern seemed consistent for all decades the proportion of lri in the total wri from both datasets ranged between 7 and 21 across all decades with the highest contribution in the southern i e cfsr and northern i e cpc regions also the percentage contribution of hri was between 10 and 44 with a maximum rate in the northwestern part which could result from spring and winter precipitation ma et al 2018 besides some areas in the northwest region with values close to 65 the overall contributions of vhri were minimal with values below 30 overall mri accounted for the most significant contributions to the total wri across the four decades in most parts of the tp and the rate varied between 42 and 70 with the maximum along the southern himalayas and the southeast tp hence mri played a dominant role in the year to year variability of wri followed by hri previous studies have also shown that most precipitation occurs in summer contributing to around 70 of annual precipitation in the central band from the arabic sea to the northeast part of the tp as well as most of the southeast tp ma et al 2018 similar to the seasonal precipitation contributions the largest precipitation occurs in july and the second and the third largest precipitation occur in august and june respectively the classified rain intensities contributions to decadal precipitation demonstrated not only the precipitation in each decade but also the combined and competitive influences of the westerlies and the east asian and southern asian monsoons which was in line with previous studies ma et al 2018 4 4 3 variance and relative weights of classified rain intensity an mlr model was developed to examine the decadal contributions of lri mri hri and vhri to total wri change the model r 2 which represents the explained variance in the dependent variable i e wri change and the rws which shows each independent variable s contribution i e classified rain intensities to the overall model r 2 were determined tables 4 and 5 shows the model r 2 and rws for each independent variable from both datasets which revealed that the weighted linear combination of lri mri hri and vhri could explain all the variance in wri change with models having very high r 2 98 99 for instance in table 4 showing cfsr decades model r 2 was 0 999 0 997 0 999 and 0 994 while their adjusted r 2 were 0 998 0 995 0 999 and 0 989 respectively which means that our model roughly explains 99 of the total variance in the wri similar results were also obtained for cpc decades shown in table 5 the rws revealed that lri mri hri and vhri explained significant variance in wri change as none of the 95 cis for the significance tests contained zero for cfsr mri was the most important variable with rws of 0 32 0 36 0 35 and 0 41 during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively while lri relative contributions to the overall r 2 were the least and these values were significantly different from the remaining variables table 4 except for lri during 1981 1990 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 all other variables are indeed significant predictors of the wri change p 0 05 for different t val table 4 the cpc also revealed mri as the most important variable with rws slightly higher than cfsr table 5 furthermore the relative weight of vhri rws 0 163 0 048 and 0 054 during 1981 1990 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively was significantly lower except for lri during 1991 2000 rws 0 012 considering lri during 1981 1990 2011 2020 and hri during 2001 2010 all other variables were indeed significant predictors of wri change p 0 05 for different t val table 5 overall mri and hri contributed the most to the overall wri change with lri and vhri contributing the least majority of the explained variance in total wri in cfsr was attributed to mri having 32 36 35 40 of model r 2 during 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively similar results were observed for cpc except that the mri had a higher variance than cfsr as shown in table 5 4 5 relationship between classified rain events and climatic factors the spatiotemporal change of precipitation is the result of the interaction among many climatic factors of which the temperature is important because of its association with global warming as temperature increases evaporation rates also increases correspondingly probably accelerating the global hydrological cycle zhang et al 2011 wan et al 2017 li et al 2020 2021 given the expected intensification it is important to understand the relationship between rainfall distributions and atmospheric temperature increasing precipitation has been linked to rising temperatures during the 1990s and li et al 2020 found a good relationship between monthly precipitation and temperature however this study examined the relationship between classified rain events and temperature by obtaining temperature composites during each event and later examined the correlation between classified rain events and temperature fig 12 a d shows the temperature composites during light moderate heavy and very heavy rainfall while fig 12 e h shows the mean difference between the average temperature classified rain events between 1981 and 2020 over the tp as shown from the figure the temperature pattern showed that more intensity was associated with very heavy rain than light rain events previous studies have also shown that atmospheric temperature strongly influences the intensity of extreme rainfall as warmer air is capable of holding more water than cooler air and therefore has the potential to provide more moisture to rainfall events brown et al 2010 maussion et al 2014 the associations between temperature and classified rain events from cfsr and cpc during 1981 2020 are given in table 6 despite the increase in temperature from light to very heavy rain events the decadal relationships defined by correlation coefficients showed different outcomes in some cases lri had a significant negative r of 0 79 and 0 64 during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 respectively while mri hri and vhri had r values of 0 30 0 37 and 0 58 during 1981 1990 and 0 25 0 43 and 0 47 respectively during 2011 2020 these relationships showed that vhri had the highest association with temperature according to du et al 2004 surface air temperature over china has increased substantially resulting in a warmer and wetter climate particularly in northwest china wang et al 2004 wu et al 2005 shi et al 2007 wei et al 2021 these conclusions were in line with our findings conversely vhri had a somewhat negative relationship with temperature for instance there was a negative relationship between lri r 0 39 and mri r 0 45 during 1991 2000 and with mri r 0 65 hri r 0 58 and vhri r 0 42 during 2001 2010 also except for hrf r 0 35 vhrf r 0 49 during 1981 1990 vhrf r 0 08 during 1991 2000 and hrf r 0 68 vhrf r 0 53 during 2011 2020 wrf and classified rain frequencies all had significant negative correlations with mean annual temperature in cfsr this study implies that while it may be valid that increased surface temperatures may cause an increase in regional and global precipitation wentz et al 2007 wan et al 2017 some other climatic factors might have influenced these relationships li et al 2020 2021 sun et al 2021 4 6 limitations and future research direction even though this study objectively and qualitatively evaluated cfsr and cpc rain intensities and frequencies their estimations differ widely across the tp overall the cfsr datasets recorded higher rain intensity than the cpc datasets introducing some uncertainty about which datasets overestimated or underestimated rain intensities and frequencies as a result remote sensing and satellite based precipitation observations should be used to provide better cognitions of precise characterizations of rain intensity and frequency over complicated terrain as the tp ma et al 2018 tan et al 2020 lu et al 2020 over the last 30 years there have been substantial developments in remote sensing techniques and satellite based retrieval algorithms fan et al 2021 and satellite precipitation products have been produced and they have shown enormous potential in various domains fan et al 2021 tan et al 2020 ma et al 2018 li et al 2020 2021 in estimating precipitation amount tan et al 2020 recommended asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite daily gridded precipitation and temperature datasets due to its performance high accuracy and most detailed precipitation pattern than the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr while for rainfall occurrence aphrodite had the strongest ability to correctly detect rain events followed by persiann cdr and chirps li et al 2020 however the three precipitation products generally tend to estimate heavy rainfall inaccurately furthermore fan et al 2021 showed that the daily performance of global precipitation measurement integrated multi satellite retrievals gpm imerg and soil moisture to rain advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat sm2rasc is comparable imerg on the other hand outperforms sm2rasc in terms of precipitation detectability the sm2rasc product estimates light to moderate rainfall 5 25 mm day more precisely than the imerg however tests have shown that the imerg product can catch places with drizzle and heavy rainfall 25 mm day better than trmm xu et al 2019 ma et al 2020 fan et al 2021 this study reveals the sm2rasc product s superior performance over tp fan et al 2021 despite the study s limitations the overall results from both datasets revealed that moderate rain contributes significantly to total rain change over the tp 5 summary and conclusion this study examined the characterization and contributions of classified rain events to total rain change over tp using cfsr and cpc datasets from 1981 to 2020 rain events are classified into four non overlapping categories lri values less than 50th percentile mri values between 50th and 95th percentile hri values between 95th and 99th percentile and vhri values above 99th percentile the rain totals of different intensity categories were then calculated on a daily yearly and decadal scale and their trends and variations were investigated in addition we calculated the contributions of rain changes of various intensities to total rain change using multiple regression models and relative weights the following are the study s main findings classified rain intensities showed a better representation of decadal rain characteristics than the mean wri the 2011 2020 decade had the highest wri resulting in high lri mri hri and vhri the largest amounts of hri and vhri were more frequent and widely distributed along the edge of the south and eastern tp and less in the north and west consistent with previous studies yang et al 2014 ji et al 2018 sun et al 2021 lri had a slight interannual variation and a decreasing trend when compared to other rain categories lri has decreased in general which could be due to china s rising temperatures many previous studies also reported that in a warmer climate upper 50 percentile rain was likely to increase more than the lower 50 percentile mri had the highest positive significant trend about 35 mm year which was more evident during 2001 2010 and 2011 2020 in the northern and southeastern tp the northwestern part during 1981 1990 and 2011 2020 and the central regions during 2001 2010 experienced a significant negative trend of 10 mm year hri and vhri trends were from 14 to 25 mm yr and 20 to 16 mm yr our analysis shows that mri dominates in total wri variability over the past four decades most regions had r coefficients well over 0 80 which was amazing the year to year variability of mri was quite similar to that of total wri however rain frequency changes were mostly linked to the change in hrf the proportion of classified rains in total wri showed significant differences across all decades lri ranged between 7 and 21 while hri was between 10 and 44 except for some northwestern regions with 65 vhri contributions were below 35 overall mri 42 70 accounted for the greatest contribution to wri playing the most crucial role in its year to year variability the weighted linear combination of the classified rain events could roughly explain almost all the variance in total wri change with models having very high r 2 98 99 the majority of the explained variance in total wri was attributed to mri having 32 36 35 40 respectively of model r 2 in each decade and lri was not significant p 0 05 the annual wri mri hri and vhri had a significant positive association with mean yearly temperature and a negative with lri this shows that a warmer environment may be connected with more hri and vhri than lri and mri wang et al 2004 wu et al 2005 it is well understood that the climate change process particularly the change in precipitation that the factors affecting precipitation the consequence of several elements including topography atmospheric pressure wind speed radiation surface heat flux cloud cover change and humidity li et al 2020 2021 sun et al 2021 and most studies have addressed the changes in precipitation across different regions and timescales however considering the complexity of the tp it is limiting to examine the change in classified rain intensities based just on temperature therefore it remains of great significance to explore precipitation distribution in light of these considerations besides further analysis of convective processes moisture transport and sources cloud processes and el niño southern oscillation enso impacts in producing different categories of rain brown et al 2010 however the characterization and contributions of classified rain to total rain in this current study will aid scientific

8072,study region urban built up area of zhengzhou china study focus a coupled urban flood forecasting model based on wrf swmm is proposed different spatial resolution data as input for wrf weather research and forecasting model to study the characteristics of forecasting precipitation combined with measured precipitation series the swmm storm water management model was driven to forecast the urban flood process new hydrological insights for the study region using the wrf swmm coupling model to simulate flood disasters can effectively improve the timeliness of urban flood prediction the results indicate that a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree improved the overall precipitation prediction results with an increase in lead time the prediction performance of the wrf decreased the wrf model can simulate results effectively owing to its sensitivity to bimodal rainfall patterns when the wrf model produces an overestimate or underestimate part of the urban canals in the swmm model will also carry out a high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge the swmm model also has a cumulative amplification effect on the results of flood simulation in addition the quantitative accuracy of precipitation forecasts plays a vital role in urban flood simulation and the existing coupling models based on wrf swmm can generate reasonable forecasts 3 6 h in advance graphical abstract ga1 keywords urban waterlogging wrf swmm coupling model evaluation 1 introduction in recent years with the acceleration of urbanization urban flooding has gradually become one of the most severe natural disasters causing significant economic losses to cities apel et al 2015 alexander et al 2019 miller et al 2014 meng et al 2017 at present most studies commonly use measured rainfall series as the basis and then use hydrological models to simulate the rainfall runoff process which establishes a preliminary urban flood warning system for cities the swmm model is a hydrodynamics based rainfall runoff model and it is widely recognized owing to its simple operation and open source code method gironas et al 2010 in this case the use of numerical simulation can not only increase the researcher s in depth understanding of the flood process but also provide a faster and more intuitive visual analysis of the urban flooding process precipitation is the direct driving factor of urban flood disasters and the methods and conditions for controlling it are limited freitag et al 2018 merz and thieken 2005 both the amount of rainfall and rainfall patterns significantly impact the evolution of flood processes therefore they are one of the most critical inputs for flood simulation models singh and woolhiser 2002 numerical model methods are gradually being developed to advance the research while it is also essential to improve urban flood simulations the wrf model is an advanced mesoscale numerical model used globally which considers the relatively detailed physical process and provides many alternative parameterization schemes enhancing its accuracy it is an effective tool for generating quantitative precipitation forecasts and has been widely used in precipitation prediction in recent years many scholars believe that wrf precipitation can effectively increase flood prediction lead time for example kovalets et al 2015 used the ncep reanalysis 1 meteorological data and proposed a meteorological and distributed hydrological model chain wrf dhsvm to simulate extreme flood events in the ukrainian mountain watershed the results show that the model chain can reconstruct flood events using wrf precipitation shih et al 2014 used precipitation inputs from nearly 20 different rainfall events and the ncep final analysis fnl data to produce flood forecasts the simulation results suggest that precipitation forecasts generated by wrf may help in early warning of potentially destructive floods in the near future many scholars have studied the characteristics of urban flooding warnings saksena et al 2020 seenu et al 2020 determined peak rainfall events based on the intensity duration frequency relationship and simulated the urban flood process using the swmm model to determine the influence of different rainfall events on the flooding process a general consensus is that excessive accumulated rainfall usually leads to waterlogging in cities brooks and stensrud 2000 believe that under the same accumulated rainfall conditions rainfall intensity is the dominant factor causing flood disasters in recent years it has been widely recognized that using weather forecast precipitation to drive hydrological models can further improve the practicability of rainfall prediction and increase the timeliness of urban flood warnings for example calvetti and pereira 2014 used wrf prediction to drive the topmodel to simulate 32 flood events in the brazilian basin and showed that combining wrf with topmodel can extend the lead time of flow prediction yao et al 2019 used wrf prediction to drive the gxm model to simulate the flood prediction of the xixian basin and showed that the occurrence of flood events could be predicted earlier in advance with wrf prediction yang et al 2016 proposed to combine the rainfall threshold with a comprehensive precipitation forecast and found that the performance of flood forecasting largely depends on rainfall forecast technology at present the wrf model is widely used in large scale and long duration quantitative precipitation forecasting in large watersheds and the wrf based precipitation and hydrological coupling model method has also been applied in many basins however owing to the limited conditions of hydrological monitoring stations in urban areas and observation effects the practical application of urban small scale high precision spatio temporal resolution precipitation data is still in the exploratory stage furthermore as an urban rainwater model based on hydraulics swmm needs to produce refined precipitation data to meet the actual needs of the flood evolution process in other words it is crucial to study the applicability and effect of high precision wrf precipitation simulation data to drive the swmm model in urban areas therefore this study aims to establish a wrf swmm coupling model and analyze the characteristics of urban waterlogging under different rainfall conditions taking zhengzhou city as an example the rationality and feasibility of applying the wrf swmm coupling model in urban areas were compared and verified 2 research area and methods 2 1 research area and data zhengzhou a chinese city was chosen as the study area as shown in fig 1 zhengzhou city a major urban center is at present one of the nine national central cities it is located in the southern part of the north china plain and the lower reaches of the yellow river the terrain of zhengzhou is a step shaped transition from a mountainous area to a plain zhengzhou city has a population of more than 10 million and an urban area of 1010 square kilometers it is a low lying city with an average elevation of 50 m above sea level and an average slope of less than 5 c according to the zhengzhou statistical bulletin of national economic and social development in 2019 published by the zhengzhou statistical bureau 2020 the average urbanization rate has reached 74 6 the average annual rainfall is 542 15 mm however due to the influence of the temperate monsoon climate and urbanization more than 65 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer making the study area vulnerable to urban waterlogging from 2011 2018 38 waterlogging events occurred nearly five times per year on average and 26 of them had extensive impacts hu et al 2021 mainly dominated by short duration precipitation existing studies have shown that the duration of disaster causing precipitation is generally less than two hours recently the zhengzhou 720 heavy rain event has attracted wide attention therefore it is necessary to study the characteristics of floods in this city to provide a decision making basis for urban flood control and reduction in this study rainfall data from 13 representative and uniformly distributed stations from 2011 to 2018 were selected a distribution diagram of the basic information for each station is shown in fig 1 among them three precipitation events 20170706 20160605 and 20160805 were selected to evaluate the prediction ability of the swmm flood process in addition meteorological field data used in the numerical weather model were obtained from the fnl reanalysis data jointly developed by the national centers for environmental prediction necp and the national center for atmospheric research ncar the spatial resolution of the fnl reanalysis data was 1 1 and 0 25 0 25 at 6 hour intervals respectively 2 2 methodology the method includes the coupling of the wrf model and the swmm urban stormwater model the swmm model which has been set up to simulate urban flood processes using gauged precipitation in zhengzhou city has exhibited satisfactory performance in the city flood process simulation yang et al 2014 building on past studies a flood process simulation based on the wrf swmm coupling model was established for this purpose the model compares the urban flood simulation results using the wrf precipitation forecast and measured precipitation data the following is a brief description of the wrf model and setup of the swmm model 2 2 1 wrf model the wrf model is a high resolution and non static equilibrium mesoscale numerical weather prediction and assimilation system which is freely available to all users because the wrf model has many advantages such as convenient calculation and high efficiency it is easy to expand transplant and maintain in time which can establish a general model structure for weather forecasting and studying the atmosphere thus it can be widely applied to weather forecasting and simulation in most regions considering the terrain resolution and the urban area of zhengzhou a sequence of two nested computational domains with spatial resolutions of 9 and 3 km were used for the simulation the wrf model includes multiple parameterized schemes such as the radiation process boundary layer process road surface process cumulus convection and microphysical processes the boundary layer parameterization method is commonly used to indicate changes in surface flux it uses land surface process parameters to describe the primary flux exchange process the cumulus convection parameterization process is mainly used to calculate the grid rainfall process and the physical multiphase change of water in the atmosphere there are several corresponding schemes to choose from within each category each type of process interacts with the other forming an inseparable connection the flow chart of the wrf model is shown in fig 2 in this study the noah model was used to simulate the surface processes in the wrf simulation the surface layer scheme uses the monin obukhov scheme and the boundary layer scheme adopts the mellor yamada janjic tke scheme in terms of selecting parameterized schemes zhang 2016 conducted sensitivity tests on three typical severe weather processes in henan province using the wsm6 hail thompson and lin schemes finding that each scheme had its own advantages therefore referring to the above research and considering the requirements of the study area for high resolution accuracy the thompson scheme was adopted as the parameterization scheme in this simulation 2 2 2 swmm model the swmm model is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model which is mainly used to simulate a single precipitation event or long term water and water quality simulation in a city in this study the process of urban flooding caused by different disaster causing precipitation was studied by numerical simulation and a detailed comparison of the entire process was attempted the swmm model is a relatively practical model in current urban waterlogging simulation research which is suitable for the needs of this study it is an urban stormwater management model proposed by the us environmental protection agency epa the swmm model is simple practical and easy to operate it is widely used in the calculation of urban pipeline hydraulic models and the establishment of hydraulic models swmm model is mainly composed of runoff generation confluence and hydrodynamic models which simulate runoff and flood processes in urban areas in the runoff model the river basin is divided into different sub regions based on land use and surface drainage trends and the surface water yield of each sub region is calculated using the flow algorithm the flow concentration model adopts the nonlinear reservoir model and the continuity and manning equations are coupled into the nonlinear differential equation which is solved using the finite difference method and then the surface runoff is calculated the hydrodynamic model is also known as the confluence model of a pipeline network in this study the dynamic wave simulation method was adopted its governing equations are the saint venant equations composed of continuous and momentum equations eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 g a h x q 2 a x q t g a s f 0 2 q x a t 0 where h is the water depth in m q is the flow discharge in m3 s a is the discharge section area in m2 g 9 8 m s2 is the acceleration of gravity t is the rainfall time s and s f is the friction slope which can be determined by eq 3 3 s f gn 2 g a r 4 3 q v where n is the comprehensive roughness of the pipeline r is the hydraulic radius in m v is the average flow velocity of the section in m s and the absolute value indicates that the direction of friction resistance is opposite to the direction of water flow after a simplified calculation the flow discharge is given by eq 4 4 q t δ t q t 2 a δ a v 2 a 2 a 1 l δ t g a h 2 h 1 l δ t 1 g n 2 δ t r 4 3 v where l is the pipe section or river section length in m v a and r are the weighted averages of the end of the pipeline at time t and subscripts 1 and 2 represent the upstream and downstream nodes of the pipe section or river section respectively in addition the nodes on the pipeline or river must meet the continuity condition as shown in eq 5 5 h t q i a s k the finite difference format of the water level at node can be expressed using eq 6 where h is the node water level or head in m q i is the flow discharge of the node in m3 s and a sk is the free water surface area at the node in m2 6 h t δ t h t q i δ t a s k combining eq 4 and eq 6 the flow discharge and node water level of each pipe section or river section can be obtained 2 2 3 strategy for flood prediction based on the wrf swmm coupling model an urban rain flood model based on wrf swmm coupling was established to simulate different disaster causing precipitation processes taking zhengzhou as an example first the regional climate model wrf model is used to forecast precipitation and the applicability of the wrf model to urban precipitation under different conditions is discussed second the swmm model calibrated for zhengzhou city is used to simulate urban flood processes based on wrf results and measured precipitation to support urban flood disaster forecasting and early warning the zhengzhou rainfall station provided the precipitation time series data assimilation techniques were not used in the present study 3 results 3 1 results of wrf precipitation forecasts eight extreme precipitation events were selected and meteorological field data with different spatial resolutions were used to generate quantitative precipitation forecast results using the wrf model the 20 min maximum peak rainfall 1 h maximum rainfall and 1 5 h cumulative maximum rainfall were used to compare the difference between the predicted and measured values under different spatial resolutions among them the comparison of rainfall values did not consider the time error the root mean square error rmse mean error me and correlation coefficient cor between the actual observed values and predicted values were calculated taking 1 h maximum rainfall as an example and the data import with different spatial resolutions was evaluated in addition the classification and comparison of rainfall patterns were carried out to investigate the influence of rainfall patterns on the wrf simulation mode figs 3 5 compare the differences between the measured values and the maximum accumulated rainfall of 20 min 1 h and 1 5 h when data with different spatial resolutions 1 degree 0 25 degree were used when a spatial resolution of 1 degree was used the 20 min peak and 1 h maximum rainfall of the 20160801 event were both underestimated while the overall rainfall of the 20170807 event and the 1 5 h maximum rainfall of the 20170706 event were overestimated leading to a larger overall result in general data with a spatial resolution of 1 degree overestimated the simulation results however when the spatial resolution was increased to 0 25 degree the error of the 20 min rainfall peak was smaller than the measured value and the overall fitting extent was high which could reasonably simulate the peak rainfall the 1 h and the 1 5 h maximum rainfall values were only overestimated for the 20160805 event while the accumulated rainfall for other events was underestimated but closer to the measured value which narrowed the error range on the whole and improved the rainfall simulation results in addition in terms of the peak time error between the predicted peak and the measured rainfall peak more than half of the simulated precipitation occurrence time reduced the error range to less than 30 min compared with the measured precipitation record which significantly improved the forecast period of extreme precipitation although some rainfall events still cannot accurately predict the time of rainfall peak they can show relatively similar peak effects and the time error is less than 3 h which can still play a key role in warning and forecasting urban flood and flood prevention combined with the long forecast period of large scale meteorological processes the root mean square error rmse mean error me and correlation cor between the actual observed values and forecast values of the maximum 1 h precipitation with different spatial resolution data for different rainfall events were calculated as shown in table 1 to quantitatively analyze the numerical simulation and prediction ability of the wrf model with different spatial resolution data analysis of the mean error values in the simulation results under different spatial resolutions revealed that the mean error between the forecast value and the actual observed value within the maximum 1 h was mostly negative indicating that the biggest 1 h rainfall sequence prediction value is generally smaller than the observed values which shows that there are systematic errors in the wrf model the boxplot in fig 6 represents the maximum 75th percentile median 25th percentile and minimum cor rmse and me statistics it can be found that the simulation results obtained by using data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree show significant advantages in both correlation and error values therefore this study will focus on the precipitation simulation results obtained when the spatial resolution of 0 25 degree is used to input the data and extract the fitting results of the peak process which can be applied to flood warnings in the urban area of zhengzhou as shown in fig 7 meteorological field data input with different advance periods 7 h 19 h and 31 h was used to forecast the wrf precipitation for the 20160805 and 20170706 events the prediction results of the 20160805 event are shown in fig 7 a when the lead time was 7 h the wrf model could correctly predict the precipitation process and peak compared with the measured precipitation the precipitation process line was consistent when the lead time was 19 h the predicted peak value was underestimated the rainfall period was advanced and the rainfall peak value could not be accurately captured when the lead time was 31 h wrf forecasts were further underestimated the 1 h maximum rainfall was underestimated by 83 the 20 min rainfall was underestimated by 66 and the time error was advanced by 1 h which indicates that the precipitation prediction skill of the wrf model will be significantly reduced when the lead time is sufficiently long the prediction results of the 20170706 event are shown in fig 7 b when the lead time was 7 h although wrf prediction results had a certain lag in the occurrence time of precipitation they could correctly capture the precipitation peak and process when the forecast period was 19 h the wrf did not effectively predict the precipitation when the advance time was further increased to 31 h the 20 min maximum rainfall in the wrf results was overestimated by 11 the total rainfall was overestimated by 29 and the prediction time was 1 h ahead of the measured precipitation occurrence time which also shows that the peak prediction is not accurate within a long forecast advance time indicating that the quantitative precipitation prediction is uncertain zhengzhou mainly experiences short duration precipitation research shows that the intensity of extreme precipitation events is concentrated around 1 h and the single peak rainfall pattern is the highest followed by the double peak pattern the wrf forecast results of 26 disaster causing precipitation events in zhengzhou were analyzed among them 19 precipitation processes showed a unimodal rain pattern and seven showed bimodal rain patterns however only 53 of unimodal precipitation events could be effectively predicted by the wrf model while 71 of bimodal precipitation events could be predicted the results for the specific rainfall field are shown in table 2 among them t represents rainfall events for which the wrf model could simulate results whereas f represents those for which no simulation was possible 3 2 coupling application of wrf swmm model in order to distinguish the flooding caused by rainfall intensity rainfall amount or both three representative extreme rainfall events 20170706 20160605 and 20160805 were selected the measured data and wrf predicted rainfall were used to drive swmm model to simulate urban waterlogging as listed in table 3 the characteristics between the measured and predicted events including the highest 20 min rainfall intensity the maximum 1 h rainfall flow the total rainfall rainstorm type and the peak flood discharge among them the 20170706 event caused urban flood disaster due to excessive rainfall intensity which was called intensity dominated flooding rainstorm next the 20160605 event caused urban flood disaster which show uniform rainfall intensity but substantial total rainfall which was called volume dominated flooding rainstorm lastly the 20160805 event not only had high rainfall intensity but also large total rainfall showing the characteristics of double dominated flooding rainstorm here the variation in flow value at the flood exit in the zhengzhou urban area was taken as an important indicator for comparing the urban flood process this pipe section is located at the confluence outlet of the zhengzhou pipe network and can effectively express the total flow process of precipitation as shown in fig 8 the flood peak discharge results of the swmm model with measured and wrf forecast data were used as inputs for the rainfall series among them excluding the time error the rainfall was the maximum 1 h rainfall sequence and the flow process was calculated 6 h after the beginning of the rainfall fig 8 a shows that as the representative event of intensity dominated flooding rainstorm type 20170706 the rainfall intensity was high and the flooding process started together when t 160 min peaked at t 270 min over 110 min in total for the representative event 20160605 manifested as volume dominated flooding rainstorm type rainfall intensity was relatively uniform fig 8 b the flood flow at the exit began to converge at t 130 min approximately 30 min earlier than the representative rainfall event of intensity dominated flooding rainstorm type reached the peak at t 230 min and shortened the confluence time by 10 min the maximum 20 min rainfall value predicted by wrf was less than the measured value however the maximum 1 h rainfall was greater than the measured value the simulated peak flow driven by the wrf rainfall forecast was greater than that driven by the measured value fig 8 c shows the representative event of the double dominated flooding rainstorm type 20160805 the flood flow at the exit began to converge at t 90 min approximately 40 min earlier than the representative rainfall event of the volume dominated flooding rainstorm type at this time the simulated peak flow driven by the wrf rainfall forecast was still larger than that driven by the measured values it is evident that with an increase in rainfall the peak discharge simulated by the swmm model also increased and the concentration time decreased table 4 shows the comparison results of the wrf and swmm simulations for the three rainfall events in the 20170706 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by wrf and the total flow value at the flood exit simulated by the swmm model were overestimated by 7 and 10 respectively compared with the measured series value in the 20160605 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by wrf and the total discharge value at the flood exit simulated by swmm were underestimated by 12 and 17 respectively compared with the measured series value similarly in the 20160805 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by the wrf and the total flow value at the exit of the swmm simulation were overestimated by 21 and 26 respectively compared with the measured series value figs 9 11 show the prediction results of the temporal and spatial distribution of water accumulation points in the swmm model when the measured rainfall and the wrf predicted rainfall were used as the input of the rainfall series fig 9 shows the flood simulation results of a representative intensity dominated flooding rainstorm event 20170706 as shown in table 4 the result is consistent with the measured precipitation value which had a low error rate the rainfall process was a single peak rainfall pattern and the rainfall was concentrated in the first half hour when measured precipitation was used as the driving force at t 40 min after the beginning of rainfall the urban surface reached the peak of the water accumulation point surface water completely disappeared at t 100 min while when rainfall sequence predicted by wrf was used as input surface flood water completely disappeared at t 110 min in terms of forecasting time errors the waterlogging point predicted by wrf reached the peak time 1 5 h later than the measured time as shown in table 5 the time distribution comparison of swmm simulated the flood waterlogging points for the 20170706 event fig 10 shows the simulation results of the representative volume dominated flooding rainstorm event 20160605 as shown in table 3 the wrf underestimated the precipitation process the maximum 20 min rainfall was consistent with the measured value however the maximum 1 h rainfall was 6 2 mm less than the measured value when the measured rainfall sequence was input to the stormwater model at t 70 min to reach peak water most of the flood water disappeared at t 210 min because the measured 1 h rainfall was 22 5 mm higher than that of the 20170706 event in addition when the sequence of the wrf rainfall forecast was input at t 60 min to reach peak water ground flood water at t 170 min completely disappeared compared with the measured values the time taken for the entire flood process was shortened by 40 min but in terms of forecasting time errors the peak time of the waterlogging point using the wrf forecast rainfall series was 3 5 h earlier than the measured one fig 11 shows the simulation results of the representative double dominated flooding rainstorm event 20160805 as shown in table 3 the wrf overestimated the precipitation process the maximum 20 min rainfall predicted by wrf was 3 1 mm less than the measured one however the maximum 1 h rainfall was 15 mm more than the measured value the measured rainfall process was a unimodal whereas the rainfall predicted by the wrf is a bimodal rainfall pattern when driven by the measured precipitation series at t 50 min the peak value of surface water was reached because the measured maximum 1 h rainfall reached 75 mm at t 220 min it completely disappeared while when using the wrf precipitation forecast sequence input the surface flood water reached a peak value at t 70 min it was not until t 330 min that the flood water subsided completely in terms of forecasting time errors the waterlogging point predicted by the wrf reached a peak time 20 min later than the measured rainfall however the entire flooding process lasted longer 4 discussion when using the simulated results of the numerical weather model to drive the swmm model the accurate characterization of the rainfall structure and the accurate prediction of rainfall are challenging and complex in other words the actual rainfall mechanism is determined by many factors and when the numerical model is run the use of different spatial resolution data as input also has a certain influence on the rainfall mechanism predicted by the wrf model with an increase in the spatial resolution of the input data the average error decreased overall indicating that a detailed resolution is conducive to the characterization of fine physical processes thus giving full play to the model capability in addition because the wrf prediction results were imprecise when the spatial resolution data of 1 degree was taken as input they cannot accurately describe the precipitation process information however when the spatial resolution data of 0 25 degree was used the wrf results were closer to the measured precipitation process and could better describe the peak change information therefore the 0 25 degree spatial resolution data provided an ideal input condition for the prediction ability of the model in addition the use of different lead times of the initial meteorological field data also affected the wrf precipitation forecast results to a certain extent showing that when the lead time was 7 h wrf had better prediction performance moreover with an increase in lead time the wrf results began to exhibit different extents of deviation and were unable to accurately capture the precipitation peak and process which shows that there is uncertainty in the quantitative prediction of precipitation over a long forecast advance time the experimental results show that when wrf and measured precipitation were used to simulate the flooding the swmm model driven by wrf precipitation could also produce good results and extend the forecast period of urban floods in addition if the rainfall process lasts for a long time and the measured rainfall data cannot be obtained quickly or in cities where data are scarce the wrf swmm coupling model can quickly obtain urban flood simulation results the maximum 20 min rainfall was underestimated by wrf however the maximum 1 h rainfall was overestimated the peak discharge predicted by the swmm model was greater than the simulated value of the measured rainfall which means that although the peak estimate may be insufficient there is a possibility that the total precipitation estimate is higher than measured enhancing the significance of the total rainfall floods at the outlet are greatly affected by the total precipitation thus a higher discharge process could occur in addition comparing the changes in the simulation results of the rain flood model caused by the difference in precipitation process determined that the flow process of disaster causing precipitation caused by diverse rain intensities was not significantly different however the difference in total rainfall had a more prominent impact on the urban flow process numerical models often have difficulty simulating extreme precipitation events dominated by rainfall intensity at present this method also faces the same limitations the urban flood simulation method based on the wrf swmm coupling model has shown more promising results than that of traditional flood simulation methods that use measured rainfall data based on this the flood prediction period was improved although there is still a need to improve the accuracy of wrf based precipitation forecasts qualitative information related to swmm simulation forecasts is still valuable for addressing urban flooding processes caused by extreme rainfall events this information is significant for urban flood disaster management decisions shih et al 2014 it is also worth noting that the city simulation results are different from those of the river basin because the basin has a large area and the temporal and spatial resolution requirements are not high moreover precipitation usually lasts for a long time and can produce continuous floods therefore the precipitation input in the previous period is the groundwork and only the peak input of precipitation is needed for forecasting yao et al 2019 however cities are dominated by heavy precipitation of short duration and the early precipitation is usually zero therefore complete precipitation process data are needed and using numerical models to forecast precipitation plays a positive role in flood warnings the study shows that the accuracy of precipitation forecasts is a key factor in improving the practicality of urban flood simulation and forecasting singh and woolhiser 2002 the simulation results show that the wrf model is more sensitive to bimodal rainfall patterns and it is easier to simulate effective results however some precipitation events still cannot be simulated completely which indicates that this method has objective limitations and needs to improve the data assimilation technology to provide better support for the development of numerical simulation according to the flood simulation results of measured rainfall data and the wrf model when the wrf model overestimates or underestimates part of the urban canals in the swmm model will carry out a high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge moreover the overestimation rate of the swmm peak flow value was higher than that of the wrf result indicating that the swmm model or hydrologic simulation method had a cumulative amplification effect on the flood simulation results the results also show that the forecast results not only include the forecast flow process of the urban drainage outlet but also include the spatial and temporal distribution of urban water points which are all affected by precipitation forecast results indicating that wrf forecast results are of great significance in improving the simulation accuracy of flood processes therefore improving the accuracy of wrf forecasts is a crucial aspect of numerical simulation methods the zhengzhou 20210720 torrential rain event recently drew wide attention paralyzing the city and causing heavy economic losses as shown in fig 12 the wrf model was used to simulate the rainfall process from 0 to 24 on july 20 for the 20210720 extraordinarily heavy rain in zhengzhou and the swmm model was imported to simulate the flood flow process it was found that the wrf model peak characteristics can capture precipitation but the peak value was underestimated the maximum 1 h rainfall in the afternoon of july 20 in zhengzhou city was as high as 201 9 mm which far exceeded the original disaster standard in the wrf simulation results the maximum 1 h rainfall was 108 mm which was 1 h earlier than the actual occurrence it can better simulate the trend characteristics of rainfall and rain patterns and the resulting flood flow process is consistent with the measured flow process trend which can produce effective flood disaster warnings thus verifying the feasibility of the wrf swmm coupling model established in this study currently the prediction period of a real time urban flood simulation system based on the wrf swmm coupling model can reach 3 6 h however the time of flood disaster will advance or lag compared with the actual time furthermore the fluctuation range was within 3 h indicating that this method has a certain forecasting ability which is better than relying only on the observation data of ground stations as shown in fig 13 the simulated spatial and temporal distributions of the 20210720 rainstorm flood driven by the wrf model correspond to the measured flood process the measured flood subsidence time was advanced by 2 h at t 36 h the urban surface flood subsided almost completely while the flood driven by the wrf model was advanced by 3 h in addition it is difficult to directly estimate the extent and level of the impending flood in a city just from a precipitation warning while swmm model can predict the occurrence scene and impact range of the flood disaster so as to achieve rapid and effective rainfall and flood warning there is a formal deviation in the wrf results which affects the flooding process in view of this a cause analysis of the weather background field should be conducted then it is necessary to increase data sources use radar data for correction and combine local precipitation characteristics to post process the model results to improve the level of urban flood warning and forecasting the uncertainty assessment of prediction results based on the wrf swmm coupling model needs to be improved in future research therefore applying wrf prediction to urban flood prediction remains challenging and requires further research 5 conclusion numerical simulation is an important method for solving urban flood disasters in the future in traditional research methods measured data play a significant role and a basic urban flood simulation method has been established in recent years urban flood prediction using numerical weather models coupled with urban flood models has been shown to effectively improve the timeliness of urban flood prediction therefore in this study a wrf swmm coupling model is established the wrf model was used to generate forecast precipitation which was compared with the measured rainfall series and then the swmm model was used to evaluate the prediction ability of the urban flood process for the urban area of zhengzhou the use of fine spatial resolution data can better predict the precipitation process and meet the requirements of urban flood simulation however with an increase in lead time the prediction performance of the wrf decreased when the wrf model overestimates or underestimates part of the urban canals in the swmm model will also carry out high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge the swmm model has a cumulative amplification effect on the results of flood simulation moreover the use of wrf precipitation forecast data for numerical simulations will effectively improve the prediction period of the numerical simulation of flood disasters more importantly the accurate characterization of the quantitative accuracy of precipitation forecasts plays an important role in urban flood simulations the results show that the wrf model is more sensitive to bimodal rainfall patterns and it is easier to simulate effective results which can provide more accurate flood process warning information thus providing an important reference for flood disaster warning and forecasting credit authorship contribution statement huiliang wang data

8072,study region urban built up area of zhengzhou china study focus a coupled urban flood forecasting model based on wrf swmm is proposed different spatial resolution data as input for wrf weather research and forecasting model to study the characteristics of forecasting precipitation combined with measured precipitation series the swmm storm water management model was driven to forecast the urban flood process new hydrological insights for the study region using the wrf swmm coupling model to simulate flood disasters can effectively improve the timeliness of urban flood prediction the results indicate that a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree improved the overall precipitation prediction results with an increase in lead time the prediction performance of the wrf decreased the wrf model can simulate results effectively owing to its sensitivity to bimodal rainfall patterns when the wrf model produces an overestimate or underestimate part of the urban canals in the swmm model will also carry out a high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge the swmm model also has a cumulative amplification effect on the results of flood simulation in addition the quantitative accuracy of precipitation forecasts plays a vital role in urban flood simulation and the existing coupling models based on wrf swmm can generate reasonable forecasts 3 6 h in advance graphical abstract ga1 keywords urban waterlogging wrf swmm coupling model evaluation 1 introduction in recent years with the acceleration of urbanization urban flooding has gradually become one of the most severe natural disasters causing significant economic losses to cities apel et al 2015 alexander et al 2019 miller et al 2014 meng et al 2017 at present most studies commonly use measured rainfall series as the basis and then use hydrological models to simulate the rainfall runoff process which establishes a preliminary urban flood warning system for cities the swmm model is a hydrodynamics based rainfall runoff model and it is widely recognized owing to its simple operation and open source code method gironas et al 2010 in this case the use of numerical simulation can not only increase the researcher s in depth understanding of the flood process but also provide a faster and more intuitive visual analysis of the urban flooding process precipitation is the direct driving factor of urban flood disasters and the methods and conditions for controlling it are limited freitag et al 2018 merz and thieken 2005 both the amount of rainfall and rainfall patterns significantly impact the evolution of flood processes therefore they are one of the most critical inputs for flood simulation models singh and woolhiser 2002 numerical model methods are gradually being developed to advance the research while it is also essential to improve urban flood simulations the wrf model is an advanced mesoscale numerical model used globally which considers the relatively detailed physical process and provides many alternative parameterization schemes enhancing its accuracy it is an effective tool for generating quantitative precipitation forecasts and has been widely used in precipitation prediction in recent years many scholars believe that wrf precipitation can effectively increase flood prediction lead time for example kovalets et al 2015 used the ncep reanalysis 1 meteorological data and proposed a meteorological and distributed hydrological model chain wrf dhsvm to simulate extreme flood events in the ukrainian mountain watershed the results show that the model chain can reconstruct flood events using wrf precipitation shih et al 2014 used precipitation inputs from nearly 20 different rainfall events and the ncep final analysis fnl data to produce flood forecasts the simulation results suggest that precipitation forecasts generated by wrf may help in early warning of potentially destructive floods in the near future many scholars have studied the characteristics of urban flooding warnings saksena et al 2020 seenu et al 2020 determined peak rainfall events based on the intensity duration frequency relationship and simulated the urban flood process using the swmm model to determine the influence of different rainfall events on the flooding process a general consensus is that excessive accumulated rainfall usually leads to waterlogging in cities brooks and stensrud 2000 believe that under the same accumulated rainfall conditions rainfall intensity is the dominant factor causing flood disasters in recent years it has been widely recognized that using weather forecast precipitation to drive hydrological models can further improve the practicability of rainfall prediction and increase the timeliness of urban flood warnings for example calvetti and pereira 2014 used wrf prediction to drive the topmodel to simulate 32 flood events in the brazilian basin and showed that combining wrf with topmodel can extend the lead time of flow prediction yao et al 2019 used wrf prediction to drive the gxm model to simulate the flood prediction of the xixian basin and showed that the occurrence of flood events could be predicted earlier in advance with wrf prediction yang et al 2016 proposed to combine the rainfall threshold with a comprehensive precipitation forecast and found that the performance of flood forecasting largely depends on rainfall forecast technology at present the wrf model is widely used in large scale and long duration quantitative precipitation forecasting in large watersheds and the wrf based precipitation and hydrological coupling model method has also been applied in many basins however owing to the limited conditions of hydrological monitoring stations in urban areas and observation effects the practical application of urban small scale high precision spatio temporal resolution precipitation data is still in the exploratory stage furthermore as an urban rainwater model based on hydraulics swmm needs to produce refined precipitation data to meet the actual needs of the flood evolution process in other words it is crucial to study the applicability and effect of high precision wrf precipitation simulation data to drive the swmm model in urban areas therefore this study aims to establish a wrf swmm coupling model and analyze the characteristics of urban waterlogging under different rainfall conditions taking zhengzhou city as an example the rationality and feasibility of applying the wrf swmm coupling model in urban areas were compared and verified 2 research area and methods 2 1 research area and data zhengzhou a chinese city was chosen as the study area as shown in fig 1 zhengzhou city a major urban center is at present one of the nine national central cities it is located in the southern part of the north china plain and the lower reaches of the yellow river the terrain of zhengzhou is a step shaped transition from a mountainous area to a plain zhengzhou city has a population of more than 10 million and an urban area of 1010 square kilometers it is a low lying city with an average elevation of 50 m above sea level and an average slope of less than 5 c according to the zhengzhou statistical bulletin of national economic and social development in 2019 published by the zhengzhou statistical bureau 2020 the average urbanization rate has reached 74 6 the average annual rainfall is 542 15 mm however due to the influence of the temperate monsoon climate and urbanization more than 65 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer making the study area vulnerable to urban waterlogging from 2011 2018 38 waterlogging events occurred nearly five times per year on average and 26 of them had extensive impacts hu et al 2021 mainly dominated by short duration precipitation existing studies have shown that the duration of disaster causing precipitation is generally less than two hours recently the zhengzhou 720 heavy rain event has attracted wide attention therefore it is necessary to study the characteristics of floods in this city to provide a decision making basis for urban flood control and reduction in this study rainfall data from 13 representative and uniformly distributed stations from 2011 to 2018 were selected a distribution diagram of the basic information for each station is shown in fig 1 among them three precipitation events 20170706 20160605 and 20160805 were selected to evaluate the prediction ability of the swmm flood process in addition meteorological field data used in the numerical weather model were obtained from the fnl reanalysis data jointly developed by the national centers for environmental prediction necp and the national center for atmospheric research ncar the spatial resolution of the fnl reanalysis data was 1 1 and 0 25 0 25 at 6 hour intervals respectively 2 2 methodology the method includes the coupling of the wrf model and the swmm urban stormwater model the swmm model which has been set up to simulate urban flood processes using gauged precipitation in zhengzhou city has exhibited satisfactory performance in the city flood process simulation yang et al 2014 building on past studies a flood process simulation based on the wrf swmm coupling model was established for this purpose the model compares the urban flood simulation results using the wrf precipitation forecast and measured precipitation data the following is a brief description of the wrf model and setup of the swmm model 2 2 1 wrf model the wrf model is a high resolution and non static equilibrium mesoscale numerical weather prediction and assimilation system which is freely available to all users because the wrf model has many advantages such as convenient calculation and high efficiency it is easy to expand transplant and maintain in time which can establish a general model structure for weather forecasting and studying the atmosphere thus it can be widely applied to weather forecasting and simulation in most regions considering the terrain resolution and the urban area of zhengzhou a sequence of two nested computational domains with spatial resolutions of 9 and 3 km were used for the simulation the wrf model includes multiple parameterized schemes such as the radiation process boundary layer process road surface process cumulus convection and microphysical processes the boundary layer parameterization method is commonly used to indicate changes in surface flux it uses land surface process parameters to describe the primary flux exchange process the cumulus convection parameterization process is mainly used to calculate the grid rainfall process and the physical multiphase change of water in the atmosphere there are several corresponding schemes to choose from within each category each type of process interacts with the other forming an inseparable connection the flow chart of the wrf model is shown in fig 2 in this study the noah model was used to simulate the surface processes in the wrf simulation the surface layer scheme uses the monin obukhov scheme and the boundary layer scheme adopts the mellor yamada janjic tke scheme in terms of selecting parameterized schemes zhang 2016 conducted sensitivity tests on three typical severe weather processes in henan province using the wsm6 hail thompson and lin schemes finding that each scheme had its own advantages therefore referring to the above research and considering the requirements of the study area for high resolution accuracy the thompson scheme was adopted as the parameterization scheme in this simulation 2 2 2 swmm model the swmm model is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model which is mainly used to simulate a single precipitation event or long term water and water quality simulation in a city in this study the process of urban flooding caused by different disaster causing precipitation was studied by numerical simulation and a detailed comparison of the entire process was attempted the swmm model is a relatively practical model in current urban waterlogging simulation research which is suitable for the needs of this study it is an urban stormwater management model proposed by the us environmental protection agency epa the swmm model is simple practical and easy to operate it is widely used in the calculation of urban pipeline hydraulic models and the establishment of hydraulic models swmm model is mainly composed of runoff generation confluence and hydrodynamic models which simulate runoff and flood processes in urban areas in the runoff model the river basin is divided into different sub regions based on land use and surface drainage trends and the surface water yield of each sub region is calculated using the flow algorithm the flow concentration model adopts the nonlinear reservoir model and the continuity and manning equations are coupled into the nonlinear differential equation which is solved using the finite difference method and then the surface runoff is calculated the hydrodynamic model is also known as the confluence model of a pipeline network in this study the dynamic wave simulation method was adopted its governing equations are the saint venant equations composed of continuous and momentum equations eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 g a h x q 2 a x q t g a s f 0 2 q x a t 0 where h is the water depth in m q

f gn 2 g a r 4 3 q v where n is the comprehensive roughness of the pipeline r is the hydraulic radius in m v is the average flow velocity of the section in m s and the absolute value indicates that the direction of friction resistance is opposite to the direction of water flow after a simplified calculation the flow discharge is given by eq 4 4 q t δ t q t 2 a δ a v 2 a 2 a 1 l δ t g a h 2 h 1 l

prediction based on the wrf swmm coupling model an urban rain flood model based on wrf swmm coupling was established to simulate different disaster causing precipitation processes taking zhengzhou as an example first the regional climate model wrf model is used to forecast precipitation and the applicability of the wrf model to urban precipitation under different conditions is discussed second the swmm model calibrated for zhengzhou city is used to simulate urban flood processes based on wrf results and measured precipitation to support urban flood disaster forecasting and early warning the zhengzhou rainfall station provided the precipitation time series data assimilation techniques were not used in the present study 3 results 3 1 results of wrf precipitation forecasts eight extreme precipitation events were selected and meteorological field data with different spatial resolutions were used to generate quantitative precipitation forecast results using the wrf model the 20 min maximum peak rainfall 1 h maximum rainfall and 1 5 h cumulative maximum rainfall were used to compare the difference between the predicted and measured values under different spatial resolutions among them the comparison of rainfall values did not consider the time error the root mean square error rmse mean error me and correlation coefficient cor between the actual observed values and predicted values were calculated taking 1 h maximum rainfall as an example and the data import with different spatial resolutions was evaluated in addition the classification and comparison of rainfall patterns were carried out to investigate the influence of rainfall patterns on the wrf simulation mode figs 3 5 compare the differences between the measured values and the maximum accumulated rainfall of 20 min 1 h and 1 5 h when data with different spatial resolutions 1 degree 0 25 degree were used when a spatial resolution of 1 degree was used the 20 min peak and 1 h maximum rainfall of the 20160801 event were both underestimated while the overall rainfall of the 20170807 event and the 1 5 h maximum rainfall of the 20170706 event were overestimated leading to a larger overall result in general data with a spatial resolution of 1 degree overestimated the simulation results however when the spatial resolution was increased to 0 25 degree the error of the 20 min rainfall peak was smaller than the measured value and the overall fitting extent was high which could reasonably simulate the peak rainfall the 1 h and the 1 5 h maximum rainfall values were only overestimated for the 20160805 event while the accumulated rainfall for other events was underestimated but closer to the measured value which narrowed the error range on the whole and improved the rainfall simulation results in addition in terms of the peak time error between the predicted peak and the measured rainfall peak more than half of the simulated precipitation occurrence time reduced the error range to less than 30 min compared with the measured precipitation record which significantly improved the forecast period of extreme precipitation although some rainfall events still cannot accurately predict the time of rainfall peak they can show relatively similar peak effects and the time error is less than 3 h which can still play a key role in warning and forecasting urban flood and flood prevention combined with the long forecast period of large scale meteorological processes the root mean square error rmse mean error me and correlation cor between the actual observed values and forecast values of the maximum 1 h precipitation with different spatial resolution data for different rainfall events were calculated as shown in table 1 to quantitatively analyze the numerical simulation and prediction ability of the wrf model with different spatial resolution data analysis of the mean error values in the simulation results under different spatial resolutions revealed that the mean error between the forecast value and the actual observed value within the maximum 1 h was mostly negative indicating that the biggest 1 h rainfall sequence prediction value is generally smaller than the observed values which shows that there are systematic errors in the wrf model the boxplot in fig 6 represents the maximum 75th percentile median 25th percentile and minimum cor rmse and me statistics it can be found that the simulation results obtained by using data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degree show significant advantages in both correlation and error values therefore this study will focus on the precipitation simulation results obtained when the spatial resolution of 0 25 degree is used to input the data and extract the fitting results of the peak process which can be applied to flood warnings in the urban area of zhengzhou as shown in fig 7 meteorological field data input with different advance periods 7 h 19 h and 31 h was used to forecast the wrf precipitation for the 20160805 and 20170706 events the prediction results of the 20160805 event are shown in fig 7 a when the lead time was 7 h the wrf model could correctly predict the precipitation process and peak compared with the measured precipitation the precipitation process line was consistent when the lead time was 19 h the predicted peak value was underestimated the rainfall period was advanced and the rainfall peak value could not be accurately captured when the lead time was 31 h wrf forecasts were further underestimated the 1 h maximum rainfall was underestimated by 83 the 20 min rainfall was underestimated by 66 and the time error was advanced by 1 h which indicates that the precipitation prediction skill of the wrf model will be significantly reduced when the lead time is sufficiently long the prediction results of the 20170706 event are shown in fig 7 b when the lead time was 7 h although wrf prediction results had a certain lag in the occurrence time of precipitation they could correctly capture the precipitation peak and process when the forecast period was 19 h the wrf did not effectively predict the precipitation when the advance time was further increased to 31 h the 20 min maximum rainfall in the wrf results was overestimated by 11 the total rainfall was overestimated by 29 and the prediction time was 1 h ahead of the measured precipitation occurrence time which also shows that the peak prediction is not accurate within a long forecast advance time indicating that the quantitative precipitation prediction is uncertain zhengzhou mainly experiences short duration precipitation research shows that the intensity of extreme precipitation events is concentrated around 1 h and the single peak rainfall pattern is the highest followed by the double peak pattern the wrf forecast results of 26 disaster causing precipitation events in zhengzhou were analyzed among them 19 precipitation processes showed a unimodal rain pattern and seven showed bimodal rain patterns however only 53 of unimodal precipitation events could be effectively predicted by the wrf model while 71 of bimodal precipitation events could be predicted the results for the specific rainfall field are shown in table 2 among them t represents rainfall events for which the wrf model could simulate results whereas f represents those for which no simulation was possible 3 2 coupling application of wrf swmm model in order to distinguish the flooding caused by rainfall intensity rainfall amount or both three representative extreme rainfall events 20170706 20160605 and 20160805 were selected the measured data and wrf predicted rainfall were used to drive swmm model to simulate urban waterlogging as listed in table 3 the characteristics between the measured and predicted events including the highest 20 min rainfall intensity the maximum 1 h rainfall flow the total rainfall rainstorm type and the peak flood discharge among them the 20170706 event caused urban flood disaster due to excessive rainfall intensity which was called intensity dominated flooding rainstorm next the 20160605 event caused urban flood disaster which show uniform rainfall intensity but substantial total rainfall which was called volume dominated flooding rainstorm lastly the 20160805 event not only had high rainfall intensity but also large total rainfall showing the characteristics of double dominated flooding rainstorm here the variation in flow value at the flood exit in the zhengzhou urban area was taken as an important indicator for comparing the urban flood process this pipe section is located at the confluence outlet of the zhengzhou pipe network and can effectively express the total flow process of precipitation as shown in fig 8 the flood peak discharge results of the swmm model with measured and wrf forecast data were used as inputs for the rainfall series among them excluding the time error the rainfall was the maximum 1 h rainfall sequence and the flow process was calculated 6 h after the beginning of the rainfall fig 8 a shows that as the representative event of intensity dominated flooding rainstorm type 20170706 the rainfall intensity was high and the flooding process started together when t 160 min peaked at t 270 min over 110 min in total for the representative event 20160605 manifested as volume dominated flooding rainstorm type rainfall intensity was relatively uniform fig 8 b the flood flow at the exit began to converge at t 130 min approximately 30 min earlier than the representative rainfall event of intensity dominated flooding rainstorm type reached the peak at t 230 min and shortened the confluence time by 10 min the maximum 20 min rainfall value predicted by wrf was less than the measured value however the maximum 1 h rainfall was greater than the measured value the simulated peak flow driven by the wrf rainfall forecast was greater than that driven by the measured value fig 8 c shows the representative event of the double dominated flooding rainstorm type 20160805 the flood flow at the exit began to converge at t 90 min approximately 40 min earlier than the representative rainfall event of the volume dominated flooding rainstorm type at this time the simulated peak flow driven by the wrf rainfall forecast was still larger than that driven by the measured values it is evident that with an increase in rainfall the peak discharge simulated by the swmm model also increased and the concentration time decreased table 4 shows the comparison results of the wrf and swmm simulations for the three rainfall events in the 20170706 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by wrf and the total flow value at the flood exit simulated by the swmm model were overestimated by 7 and 10 respectively compared with the measured series value in the 20160605 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by wrf and the total discharge value at the flood exit simulated by swmm were underestimated by 12 and 17 respectively compared with the measured series value similarly in the 20160805 event the maximum 1 h rainfall predicted by the wrf and the total flow value at the exit of the swmm simulation were overestimated by 21 and 26 respectively compared with the measured series value figs 9 11 show the prediction results of the temporal and spatial distribution of water accumulation points in the swmm model when the measured rainfall and the wrf predicted rainfall were used as the input of the rainfall series fig 9 shows the flood simulation results of a representative intensity dominated flooding rainstorm event 20170706 as shown in table 4 the result is consistent with the measured precipitation value which had a low error rate the rainfall process was a single peak rainfall pattern and the rainfall was concentrated in the first half hour when measured precipitation was used as the driving force at t 40 min after the beginning of rainfall the urban surface reached the peak of the water accumulation point surface water completely disappeared at t 100 min while when rainfall sequence predicted by wrf was used as input surface flood water completely disappeared at t 110 min in terms of forecasting time errors the waterlogging point predicted by wrf reached the peak time 1 5 h later than the measured time as shown in table 5 the time distribution comparison of swmm simulated the flood waterlogging points for the 20170706 event fig 10 shows the simulation results of the representative volume dominated flooding rainstorm event 20160605 as shown in table 3 the wrf underestimated the precipitation process the maximum 20 min rainfall was consistent with the measured value however the maximum 1 h rainfall was 6 2 mm less than the measured value when the measured rainfall sequence was input to the stormwater model at t 70 min to reach peak water most of the flood water disappeared at t 210 min because the measured 1 h rainfall was 22 5 mm higher than that of the 20170706 event in addition when the sequence of the wrf rainfall forecast was input at t 60 min to reach peak water ground flood water at t 170 min completely disappeared compared with the measured values the time taken for the entire flood process was shortened by 40 min but in terms of forecasting time errors the peak time of the waterlogging point using the wrf forecast rainfall series was 3 5 h earlier than the measured one fig 11 shows the simulation results of the representative double dominated flooding rainstorm event 20160805 as shown in table 3 the wrf overestimated the precipitation process the maximum 20 min rainfall predicted by wrf was 3 1 mm less than the measured one however the maximum 1 h rainfall was 15 mm more than the measured value the measured rainfall process was a unimodal whereas the rainfall predicted by the wrf is a bimodal rainfall pattern when driven by the measured precipitation series at t 50 min the peak value of surface water was reached because the measured maximum 1 h rainfall reached 75 mm at t 220 min it completely disappeared while when using the wrf precipitation forecast sequence input the surface flood water reached a peak value at t 70 min it was not until t 330 min that the flood water subsided completely in terms of forecasting time errors the waterlogging point predicted by the wrf reached a peak time 20 min later than the measured rainfall however the entire flooding process lasted longer 4 discussion when using the simulated results of the numerical weather model to drive the swmm model the accurate characterization of the rainfall structure and the accurate prediction of rainfall are challenging and complex in other words the actual rainfall mechanism is determined by many factors and when the numerical model is run the use of different spatial resolution data as input also has a certain influence on the rainfall mechanism predicted by the wrf model with an increase in the spatial resolution of the input data the average error decreased overall indicating that a detailed resolution is conducive to the characterization of fine physical processes thus giving full play to the model capability in addition because the wrf prediction results were imprecise when the spatial resolution data of 1 degree was taken as input they cannot accurately describe the precipitation process information however when the spatial resolution data of 0 25 degree was used the wrf results were closer to the measured precipitation process and could better describe the peak change information therefore the 0 25 degree spatial resolution data provided an ideal input condition for the prediction ability of the model in addition the use of different lead times of the initial meteorological field data also affected the wrf precipitation forecast results to a certain extent showing that when the lead time was 7 h wrf had better prediction performance moreover with an increase in lead time the wrf results began to exhibit different extents of deviation and were unable to accurately capture the precipitation peak and process which shows that there is uncertainty in the quantitative prediction of precipitation over a long forecast advance time the experimental results show that when wrf and measured precipitation were used to simulate the flooding the swmm model driven by wrf precipitation could also produce good results and extend the forecast period of urban floods in addition if the rainfall process lasts for a long time and the measured rainfall data cannot be obtained quickly or in cities where data are scarce the wrf swmm coupling model can quickly obtain urban flood simulation results the maximum 20 min rainfall was underestimated by wrf however the maximum 1 h rainfall was overestimated the peak discharge predicted by the swmm model was greater than the simulated value of the measured rainfall which means that although the peak estimate may be insufficient there is a possibility that the total precipitation estimate is higher than measured enhancing the significance of the total rainfall floods at the outlet are greatly affected by the total precipitation thus a higher discharge process could occur in addition comparing the changes in the simulation results of the rain flood model caused by the difference in precipitation process determined that the flow process of disaster causing precipitation caused by diverse rain intensities was not significantly different however the difference in total rainfall had a more prominent impact on the urban flow process numerical models often have difficulty simulating extreme precipitation events dominated by rainfall intensity at present this method also faces the same limitations the urban flood simulation method based on the wrf swmm coupling model has shown more promising results than that of traditional flood simulation methods that use measured rainfall data based on this the flood prediction period was improved although there is still a need to improve the accuracy of wrf based precipitation forecasts qualitative information related to swmm simulation forecasts is still valuable for addressing urban flooding processes caused by extreme rainfall events this information is significant for urban flood disaster management decisions shih et al 2014 it is also worth noting that the city simulation results are different from those of the river basin because the basin has a large area and the temporal and spatial resolution requirements are not high moreover precipitation usually lasts for a long time and can produce continuous floods therefore the precipitation input in the previous period is the groundwork and only the peak input of precipitation is needed for forecasting yao et al 2019 however cities are dominated by heavy precipitation of short duration and the early precipitation is usually zero therefore complete precipitation process data are needed and using numerical models to forecast precipitation plays a positive role in flood warnings the study shows that the accuracy of precipitation forecasts is a key factor in improving the practicality of urban flood simulation and forecasting singh and woolhiser 2002 the simulation results show that the wrf model is more sensitive to bimodal rainfall patterns and it is easier to simulate effective results however some precipitation events still cannot be simulated completely which indicates that this method has objective limitations and needs to improve the data assimilation technology to provide better support for the development of numerical simulation according to the flood simulation results of measured rainfall data and the wrf model when the wrf model overestimates or underestimates part of the urban canals in the swmm model will carry out a high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge moreover the overestimation rate of the swmm peak flow value was higher than that of the wrf result indicating that the swmm model or hydrologic simulation method had a cumulative amplification effect on the flood simulation results the results also show that the forecast results not only include the forecast flow process of the urban drainage outlet but also include the spatial and temporal distribution of urban water points which are all affected by precipitation forecast results indicating that wrf forecast results are of great significance in improving the simulation accuracy of flood processes therefore improving the accuracy of wrf forecasts is a crucial aspect of numerical simulation methods the zhengzhou 20210720 torrential rain event recently drew wide attention paralyzing the city and causing heavy economic losses as shown in fig 12 the wrf model was used to simulate the rainfall process from 0 to 24 on july 20 for the 20210720 extraordinarily heavy rain in zhengzhou and the swmm model was imported to simulate the flood flow process it was found that the wrf model peak characteristics can capture precipitation but the peak value was underestimated the maximum 1 h rainfall in the afternoon of july 20 in zhengzhou city was as high as 201 9 mm which far exceeded the original disaster standard in the wrf simulation results the maximum 1 h rainfall was 108 mm which was 1 h earlier than the actual occurrence it can better simulate the trend characteristics of rainfall and rain patterns and the resulting flood flow process is consistent with the measured flow process trend which can produce effective flood disaster warnings thus verifying the feasibility of the wrf swmm coupling model established in this study currently the prediction period of a real time urban flood simulation system based on the wrf swmm coupling model can reach 3 6 h however the time of flood disaster will advance or lag compared with the actual time furthermore the fluctuation range was within 3 h indicating that this method has a certain forecasting ability which is better than relying only on the observation data of ground stations as shown in fig 13 the simulated spatial and temporal distributions of the 20210720 rainstorm flood driven by the wrf model correspond to the measured flood process the measured flood subsidence time was advanced by 2 h at t 36 h the urban surface flood subsided almost completely while the flood driven by the wrf model was advanced by 3 h in addition it is difficult to directly estimate the extent and level of the impending flood in a city just from a precipitation warning while swmm model can predict the occurrence scene and impact range of the flood disaster so as to achieve rapid and effective rainfall and flood warning there is a formal deviation in the wrf results which affects the flooding process in view of this a cause analysis of the weather background field should be conducted then it is necessary to increase data sources use radar data for correction and combine local precipitation characteristics to post process the model results to improve the level of urban flood warning and forecasting the uncertainty assessment of prediction results based on the wrf swmm coupling model needs to be improved in future research therefore applying wrf prediction to urban flood prediction remains challenging and requires further research 5 conclusion numerical simulation is an important method for solving urban flood disasters in the future in traditional research methods measured data play a significant role and a basic urban flood simulation method has been established in recent years urban flood prediction using numerical weather models coupled with urban flood models has been shown to effectively improve the timeliness of urban flood prediction therefore in this study a wrf swmm coupling model is established the wrf model was used to generate forecast precipitation which was compared with the measured rainfall series and then the swmm model was used to evaluate the prediction ability of the urban flood process for the urban area of zhengzhou the use of fine spatial resolution data can better predict the precipitation process and meet the requirements of urban flood simulation however with an increase in lead time the prediction performance of the wrf decreased when the wrf model overestimates or underestimates part of the urban canals in the swmm model will also carry out high forecast or low forecast output of flood peak discharge the swmm model has a cumulative amplification effect on the results of flood simulation moreover the use of wrf precipitation forecast data for numerical simulations will effectively improve the prediction period of the numerical simulation of flood disasters more importantly the accurate characterization of the quantitative accuracy of precipitation forecasts plays an important role in urban flood simulations the results show that the wrf model is more sensitive to bimodal rainfall patterns and it is easier to simulate effective results which can provide more accurate flood process warning information thus providing an important reference for flood disaster warning and forecasting credit authorship contribution statement huiliang wang data

8073,study region alaska and hydrologically connected portions of canada study focus rugged terrain and harsh conditions make observational hydroclimatic data especially runoff data extremely limited across most of alaska consequently many previous hydrologic studies in alaska have focused on smaller domain trends where pockets of hydroclimatic observations are clustered using a combination of reanalysis and remotely sensed gridded products we develop a calibration framework for a monthly resolution water budget model over the entire alaskan domain that does not rely on runoff the domain is comprised of distributed model response units mrus each representing a hydrologic unit code 12 basin we use a fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast to inform a two step calibration process first calibrating to actual evapotranspiration and then to fractional snow covered area fsca resulting in a range of parameter solutions for each mru new hydrological insights for the region using this framework the model performs best in the moderate to dry alaskan interior in the absence of glaciation and where permafrost is generally not continuous modelled runoff for recent decades shows increased runoff trends at lower latitudes and slightly decreased runoff trends at higher latitudes within the alaskan domain these findings reveal that reliance upon non runoff fluxes for model calibration is viable in this cold region and that better characterization of hydroclimatic data is necessary to improve confidence in cold region modeling studies keywords calibration alaska sensitivity analysis evapotranspiration runoff water balance 1 introduction northern latitudes are some of the most sensitive regions to increasing global temperatures hinzman et al 2005 these areas are often dominated by snow ice and permafrost resulting in human and natural systems that are shaped and controlled by cryospheric processes as global temperature increases observations reveal changing trends in hydrologic processes that are controlled by freezing temperatures in particular water that was previously stored in the cryosphere is melting and being transported through other parts of the water cycle in alaska and surrounding regions these changes are especially evident through earlier seasonal snowmelt curtis et al 1998 stone et al 2002 changing glacier mass balance arendt et al 2002 sea ice loss screen and simmonds 2010 permafrost thaw jorgenson shur and pullman 2006 increased base flow in rivers bennett cannon and hinzman 2015 greater contributions of groundwater to surface runoff walvoord and striegl 2007 gibson et al 2020 earlier seasonal riverine breakup lesack et al 2014 cooley and pavelsky 2016 and increasing magnitude and frequency of boreal forest wildfires kasischke et al 2010 these changes have implications for alaska s ecology and economy arctic monitoring and assessment programme amap 2017 and have global implications as sea ice loss alters the atmospheric energy balance screen and simmonds 2010 and glacial waste contributes to sea level rise arendt et al 2002 modelling hydrologic processes in the alaskan domain comes with a unique set of challenges most significantly the vast and heterogeneous landscape is not well characterized by hydrologic or meteorological data monaghan et al 2018 thus previous hydrologic modeling studies in alaska have generally focused on smaller basin scale or in some cases regional scale study areas van beusekom and viger 2018 beamer et al 2016 where sufficient observational hydroclimatic data was available to meet model forcing and parameterization requirements even parsimonious hydrologic models that lack extensive parameterization requirements are limited by hydrologic data availability in alaska in particular streamflow or runoff information valentin et al 2018 despite these limitations recent advances in model capabilities and improved availability of satellite and other gridded products create opportunities for the modeling community to better characterize and reproduce hydrologic conditions in alaska and other cold regions many hydrologic models have demonstrated suitable performance in alaska including conceptual surface hydrology models but many such studies only address regional areas of alaska bui lu and nie 2020 gridded water budget products available over alaska include those from reanalysis data sets global hydro meteorological models or remote sensing products still many such gridded products have coarse spatial resolutions and or relatively short periods of record geospatial products that represent permafrost and glaciation in alaska tend to be temporally static rgi consortium 2017 pastick et al 2015 additionally many gridded climate forcing datasets available for the alaskan domain do not adequately adjust climatic variables for orographic influences monaghan et al 2018 despite these limitations on various hydrologic data enough information now exists to develop constraints on hydrologic models that can provide insight on hydrologic trends through time and across the entire domain traditionally hydrologic models are calibrated and validated against measured streamflow gupta sorooshian and yapo 1998 immerzeel and droogers 2008 however most rivers in the world are ungauged and large domain models are often forced to rely on streamflow predictions in ungauged basins pub mcglynn et al 2012 or to extrapolate a small sample of measured streamflow to a larger region for example bock and others 2016 used measured streamflow to calibrate and parameterize the u s geological survey s usgs monthly water balance model mwbm in behaviorally similar calibration regions within the contiguous united states conus later using a statistical method to estimate streamflow farmer 2016 lafontaine and others produced synthetic streamflow time series to calibrate a daily hydrologic model in ungauged basins in the southeastern united states lafontaine et al 2019 in both of these instances some observational streamflow was required for either regional extrapolation or spatial interpolation over ungauged basins in addition the observed streamflow used in these examples had to meet performance criteria the observational streamflow network in alaska is patchy at best where streamflow gauges are most dense around the more populated areas of the gulf of alaska coastline and become increasingly sparse moving inward toward the alaskan interior usgs nwis 2020 temporal streamflow records are also often severely abbreviated by frozen rivers making annual streamflow trends difficult to quantify while many previous modelling efforts centered around pub use physical similarity spatial proximity or statistical methods to extrapolate known streamflow to unknown areas poissant arsenault and brissette 2017 this study relies on gridded evapotranspiration et and snow covered area products the use of gridded datasets in the calibration of hydrologic models is a growing field of research immerzeel and droogers were some of the early pioneers in using et in model calibration and they argue that in data scarce areas where model calibration relies on too few discharge stations hydrologic processes over large areas are effectively lumped together and increase the risk of equifinality problems immerzeel and droogers 2008 dile et al 2020 provide a summary of studies that have coupled satellite based et to hydrologic applications for purposes of estimating water budgets or improving model skill dile et al 2020 similarly jiang and others review applications of remotely sensed et that are specifically used in hydrologic model calibration jiang et al 2020 from many of the studies outlined in the overviews presented by dile et al 2020 and jiang et al 2020 we see that incorporating gridded et products into model calibration has promise to deliver reasonable modeled discharge estimates at small and large scales for example lopez et al 2017 and even to improve model skill when coupled with measured streamflow during calibration for example jin and jin 2020 remotely sensed snow cover products have also been shown to improve streamflow forecasting in cold regions for example bennet and others found that by incorporating modis based fractional snow covered area fsca into the snow 17 model model skill is improved in predicting both streamflow and snow depletion timing in interior alaska bennett et al 2019 they argue that well calibrated conceptual models are likely a better option in alaska than process based models because 1 the severe lack of high quality hydrologic observations limits our understanding of true hydrologic processes in alaska and 2 well calibrated conceptual models rely on parameterizations rather than observations that lack accuracy in alaska applying modis based fsca products to land surface models have also shown improvements in streamflow predictions in alaska déry et al 2005 liu et al 2013 the mwbm has been vetted in numerous previous studies evaluating water budgets in a range of climatic conditions mccabe and wolock 2008 2011 bock et al 2016 including as a component of the usgs national hydrologic model nhm where its monthly predictions are used to constrain a higher resolution daily model regan et al 2019 and in alaska hay and mccabe 2010 due to the parsimonious and conceptual nature of the mwbm it has promise to deliver reasonable approximations of monthly hydrologic fluxes in data sparse regions in this study the purpose of the mwbm is not to produce high resolution runoff predictions for narrow temporal windows but rather its purpose is to constrain the surface water budget over longer study periods using available surface water flux information rather than looking at a single catchment or region that is well monitored in alaska we use the mwbm to develop a calibration framework over the entire alaskan domain that does not rely on the virtually nonexistent observational streamflow network the goals of the current work are to 1 constrain a simple surface water budget across the entire alaskan domain by parameterizing and validating a conceptual monthly resolution water balance model without the use of runoff data and 2 to demonstrate the usefulness of such a tool by evaluating long term trends in simulated runoff to achieve these goals we discretize the alaskan domain into hydrologic unit code huc 12 basins and used a combination of remotely sensed reanalysis and hydrologically modelled gridded actual evapotranspiration aet products as well as fsca to calibrate and validate the mwbm ultimately producing a range of parameter solutions for each mru while the employment of non runoff based gridded products specifically aet in calibration is not a new modelling technique using them in a large domain cold region is to our knowledge reliance solely on aet and fsca observations to constrain a water budget model over a large cold region domain has not yet been presented in the literature 2 methods this study was designed with the intention of reducing model uncertainty where possible strategies we employed to undertake the proposed work includes performing a stepwise calibration informed by parameter sensitivities associated with each calibration step where each calibration step evaluates a different component of the water budget utilizing multiple objective functions in each calibration step to curb the biases associated with any one objective function see legates and mccabe 1999 utilizing a suite of gridded aet products with strong seasonal agreements rather than placing confidence in a single dataset for calibration and validation a similar method was used by ha et al 2018 arriving at a range of parameter solutions for each huc rather than a single deterministic solution that has a non trivial chance of being selected purely because it can survive the mathematical hurdles during calibration and not because it is truly representative of the natural environment beven 2006 another intention was to balance these uncertainty reducing strategies with maintaining the simplistic nature of the original mwbm this was in part to minimize computational requirements which allowed for more model iterations during calibration 2 1 description of mwbm a desktop application of the original mwbm is publicly available for planning research educational or personal use https wwwbrr cr usgs gov projects sw mows thornthwaite html the parameters that we developed are compatible with that tool and may be useful to alaskan communities that are otherwise poorly monitored one of the greatest strengths of the mwbm is its low demand for parameterization which minimizes concerns over equifinality and makes it a readily accessible tool for longer term water budget analyses in a variety of environments for application in alaska two versions of the mwbm exist the original mwbm previously described and a version that accounts for additional cryospheric processes mwbmglacier the original mwbm was first applied in alaska by hay and mccabe 2010 to the yukon river basin for purposes of evaluating potential future hydrologic conditions under various future climate scenarios more recently mwbmglacier was developed valentin et al 2018 to account for glaciation as an additional cryospheric store valentin 2019 piloted mwbmglacier in the highly glacierized copper river basin in southcentral alaska which is relatively well monitored compared to the rest of the state the cryospheric processes that mwbmglacier represents glaciation permafrost are parameterized as initial conditions taken from temporally static raster information glacier coverage rasters such as those in the randolph glacier inventory rgi consortium 2017 and permafrost coverage maps like those presented by pastick 2015 are representative of a fixed time period this becomes problematic when static glacier and or permafrost rasters are not temporally congruent with the beginning of a simulation period mwbmglacier clearly represents cryospheric land cover and stores that the original mwbm does not however unlike the copper river basin the majority of alaska is poorly monitored hydrologically and unglaciated and while we understand the deficiencies of the original mwbm for application in a cryospheric domain we believe an application of the original mwbm is a good first step in understanding broad hydrologic trends in alaska and may contribute to future applications of the nhm or mwbmglacier across the entire alaskan domain relevant mwbm accounting processes are described here however for an in depth description of the water budget accounting procedure of the mwbm see mccabe and markstrom 2007 the mwbm is based on the water accounting methodology first described by thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 computes surface water budget components at a monthly time step and is driven by mean monthly temperature monthly total precipitation and the latitude of the location of interest for computation of day length used to compute potential evapotranspiration pet following the hamon equation hamon 1961 the initial computation in the mwbm is the partitioning of precipitation as rain or snow where snow is accumulated or liquid water either enters the ground or produces direct surface runoff water available for evaporative processes p total is the sum of snow melt and precipitation that falls as rain less any water that runs directly off the land surface when p total pet relatively dry conditions aet is equal to the sum of p total plus available soil moisture when p total pet relatively wet conditions then aet is equal to pet and any water in excess of pet replenishes soil moisture storage as snow melts during a simulation period water is routed into soil moisture storage and may eventually be routed to aet surplus runoff when the ground is saturated or may stay as soil moisture storage snow that does not melt during a simulation time step stays as snow storage for that time step thus the hydrologic stores accounted for in the mwbm are simply snow storage and soil moisture storage fig 1 the mwbm has only six calibration parameters fig 1 several of which are coefficients used to modify physically based algorithms within the model and others such as stc can be approximated using empirical data when available instead of calibration the selection of the mwbm in alaska allowed for minimal parameter data requirements and focus on development of calibration techniques to alternative datasets the mwbm does not account for dynamic subsurface flow processes in areas where groundwater flow is truly minimal over monthly time periods the exclusion of groundwater flow processes in model representation is arguably reasonable the mwbm assumes that water entering the land surface either stays in the unsaturated vadose zone as soil moisture storage or leaves as evapotranspiration or surplus runoff so while groundwater meaning literally water in the ground is not ignored in the mwbm dynamic groundwater flow processes that may cause water to leave the ground store are not accounted for in the mwbm a relevant consideration is that much of the alaskan ground surface stays frozen as permafrost year round or freezes seasonally and groundwater flow is considered minimal however as global surface temperatures increase permafrost is diminishing and active layer thickness is increasing which may open up significant preferential groundwater flow paths in the form of thermokarst and taliks pastick et al 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 as preferential flow paths continue opening up in alaska the mwbm s lack of groundwater flow representation may limit accurate representation of the water budget 2 2 model domain the model domain encompasses all of alaska and hydrologically connected portions of western canada along the us canadian border fig 2 within this domain the surface landscape is highly variable from a surface water budget perspective hydrologically prominent features of the alaskan domain are the extensive coastline and associated maritime effects high latitude position numerous considerable mountain ranges as well as permafrost and glacial coverage it follows that climate types within alaska are also variable as they are controlled by such features bieniek and others bieniek et al 2012 identified 13 distinct climate divisions within alaska based on an objective clustering method on observational temperature 2 3 data sources data sources used in model setup calibration and validation are summarized in table 1 to stay within the methodological framework of the nhm watershed boundary dataset huc watershed delineations were used to spatially discretize the model domain due to the extreme variability in topography and land cover and climate the three highest resolution huc delineations available for the domain huc 8 huc 10 and huc 12 were considered as feasible model response units mrus the uncalibrated mwbm was evaluated at all three huc scales for selected test basins with a relatively strong observational streamflow record this preliminary spatial scale analysis revealed that the highest resolution spatial scale huc 12 generally outperformed the two lower resolution spatial scales in both glaciated and unglaciated test basins thus a huc 12 scale was selected as the spatial discretization for this study monthly precipitation and temperature sourced from daymet version 3 was used to force the mwbm from wy 1981 wy 2011 table 1 while daymet and certainly all gridded climate products have shortcomings daymet was chosen for this application because of its relatively high spatial resolution and period of record long enough to allow for model spin up calibration and validation in 2018 monaghan and others with the weather research and forecasting wrf model released high resolution historical climate simulations that robustly reproduce meteorological processes in alaska monaghan et al 2018 the wrf dataset was not used in this study due to a relatively short period of coverage roughly 14 years but may be a candidate for forcing shorter term hydrologic studies in alaska total monthly precipitation maximum and minimum monthly temperature rasters were sourced from daymet and bilinearly extracted by weight to mrus maximum and minimum temperatures were averaged for each model response unit mru to approximate average monthly temperature evapotranspiration products derived by any means are notoriously difficult to validate especially in water budget modeling efforts that are calibrated to observational streamflow any residual error that is not explicitly quantified can inadvertently end up lumped into harder to validate water budget components such as aet additionally the users choice of water budget product can strongly influence results of a water budget analysis saxe et al 2020a here instead of utilizing any single aet product we have sourced a suite of monthly gridded aet products with good seasonal agreement to inform model calibration and validation the suite of aet products are derived from reanalysis remote sensing and hydrologic model data sets products were selected based on their available period of record and relative seasonal agreement eight products were considered and seven were ultimately chosen and are summarized in table 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16 was the only aet product considered and not selected due to poor seasonal agreement with other products particularly during winter months the seven selected aet products were bilinearly extracted to mrus and averaged each aet product considered for this study approximates true aet and like all gridded data is subject to error and uncertainty using a product average does not eliminate all error associated with gridded aet products but it does represent the zone of agreement between all products and serves to reduce bias resulting from spurious errors in any single gridded aet product duan et al 2007 saxe et al 2020b product averaged aet was used as observational aet during calibration and validation remotely sensed snow cover data was also used for model calibration and validation and was sourced from modis terra mod10c1 daily snow cover fraction and cloud cover rasters were extracted to mrus snow fraction pixels were filtered with cloud cover information and were only kept if daily cloud cover pixels did not exceed 20 selected daily snow fraction pixels were averaged by month and the resulting monthly snow fraction dataset was used as observational fsca during calibration and validation observational aet and fsca data sets both have temporal coverage between 2000 and 2012 allowing 6 water years wy for calibration wy 2001 2006 and 5 water years for model validation wy 2007 2011 however model simulations were started in wy 1981 the earliest available date for climate forcing data daymet to allow a substantial window for model spin up the purpose of model spin up is to fill stores buckets within the model to mimic real world initial storage conditions while four or five years is typically the acceptable minimum window for mwbm spin up we elected to utilize the maximum possible window for spin up particularly because alaska has substantial cryospheric storage allowing a long spin up window 1981 2000 helps to ensure that model stores were adequately filled prior to the calibration window wy 2001 2006 2 4 modelling approach 2 4 1 sensitivity analysis most hydrologic models rely totally or at least in part on streamflow for calibration because observational streamflow is so limited across the alaskan domain we explore a stepwise calibration procedure where the first step calibrates to observational aet and the second step calibrates to observational snow fraction following a binary comparison between observational snow fraction and modelled snow water equivalent swe aet was calibrated first because of its robustness compared to the swe calibration the aet calibration utilizes a direct comparison between modelled aet and observational aet whereas the swe relies on a binary comparison between modelled swe and observational fsca before calibration a fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast was performed to determine which model parameters are most sensitive to aet and swe respectively parameters more sensitive to aet were calibrated in the first calibration step and parameters more sensitive to swe were calibrated in the second calibration step the fourier transformation decomposes information in a time domain a time series combining both hydrologic signals and noise into a frequency domain a power spectrum for purposes of sa fast samples a parameter space by varying each parameter according to a sine wave function where each sine wave has a different frequency and the amplitude of each wave matches the range of the corresponding parameter at each x axis increment along the sine function trial parameter sets are selected based on the corresponding y values of each parameter s sine wave bock et al 2016 the model is executed using all trial parameter sets holding other variables constant and the resulting outputs from model trials are passed through a user selected performance metric to produce a time series of performance information the performance metric series is fourier transformed into a power spectrum of frequencies associated with each parameter since model outputs are produced using unique combinations of parameters that can be identified by their unique frequencies the resulting power spectrum reveals relative contributions or sensitivities of each parameter when this process is applied to modeled output for aet we learn which model parameters have the greatest influence on modeled aet the same applies for modeled swe or any model output component the fast method is an extremely computationally efficient global sensitivity analysis sa bock et al 2016 previously fast has been used to explore spatial variability of dominant processes and sensitive parameters in the mwbm bock et al 2016 and precipitation runoff modelling system prms markstrom hay and clark 2016 since fast is a well established sa method is minimally computationally expensive and has previously been used to evaluate parameter sensitivity in the mwbm it stands out as a strong method for the application of the mwbm in alaska when bock and others 2016 applied fast to the mwbm in the conus they did not use comparative statistics in their sa that require observational streamflow information such as root mean squared error or nash sutcliffe efficiency but instead used runoff ratio simulated runoff precipitation and runoff variance standard deviation of simulated runoff standard deviation of precipitation as performance statistics markstrom and others 2016 note that for fast sensitivity analysis performance measures do not need to include comparisons to observational measurements but only to track relative changes in model output their methodologies demonstrate that fast is a robust sa method even without observational streamflow this is especially important for the application of fast on the mwbm in alaska as observational streamflow is practically non existent here we used the fast library package in the statistical software r reusser 2015 to generate fast trial parameter sets and to perform a fourier analysis on output performance metrics specifically the fast fast parameters function was called to generate fast parameter sets and the fast sensitivity function was called to calculate sensitivity of corresponding model output the fast package determined that 91 trial parameter sets was the minimum number of sets to cover the parameter space in keeping with minimizing computational expense we elected to proceed with 91 trial parameter sets for sensitivity analysis while utilizing more than the minimum number of parameter sets is certainly cautious it may also be redundant and introduce unnecessary computation expense because fast is fairly insensitive to sample size as long as the minimum criterion is met saltelli and bolado 1998 trial parameter sets were executed through the mwbm and percent change was computed on model output for each model run percent change was computed using summed model output using fast parameter values versus summed model output using default parameter values fig 1 where summing occurred over wys 2003 2017 allowing ample time for model spin up the fast package was utilized again to perform a fourier analysis on the series of performance statistics which highlighted relative sensitivities of each parameter in each mru the process described above was applied to each mru so that in addition to having parameter sa information to inform calibration we can also evaluate spatial patterns in parameter sensitivity across the alaskan domain for several components of the water budget aet swe and runoff in this way we hope to better characterize modeled hydrologic processes as they vary over the domain space 2 4 2 calibration previous applications of the mwbm have followed exhaustive search hay and mccabe 2002 and shuffled complex evolution sce hay and mccabe 2010 valentin et al 2018 bock et al 2016 calibration approaches however major goals of the present study were to reduce computational demand and procedural complexity due to both computational limitations and desired ease of reproducibility associated with model calibration thus latin hypercube sampling lhs was employed to vet the parameter space similar to monte carlo sampling lhs also randomly samples a parameter space according to a distribution function monte carlo samples the distribution entirely randomly which can lead to under represented outliers even with high numbers of samples however lhs is less random in that lhs samples a distribution that is broken down into strata each of which are uniformly sampled in systematically sampling a distribution through strata results in less biased sampling with a smaller number of samples thereby lowering computational expense because the lhs approach does not represent all possible parameter combinations nor does it employ a search algorithm to optimize chosen parameter sets as with sce we assume that the lhs sample is adequately representative of the entire parameter space in choosing the number of parameter set samples to draw following lhs one must consider the trade off between high computational larger number of samples demand and underrepresenting the parameter space lower number of samples to determine an optimal number of lhs samples to use in calibration different numbers of parameter set samples were tested on 10 random mrus in the alaskan domain this test evaluated 500 1000 3000 6000 and 10 000 lhs parameter sets where all 6 parameters are varied and compared modeled aet to observed aet using both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias as comparative metrics these objective functions were chosen for this study because they especially nse have been used in the calibration of the mwbm in previous studies hay and mccabe 2002 bock et al 2016 valentin et al 2018 however it is worth nothing that pattern based objective functions have recently been employed in multivariate calibration of hydrologic models and have promise to reduce parameter selection bias in studies relying on gridded datasets during calibration dembélé et al 2020 nse is the magnitude of model residual variance to the variance of observed data eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 where nse 1 suggests a perfect relationship between modelled and observed data nse 0 indicates that the model is as arcuate as the mean of observed data and nse 0 reveals that the mean of observed data is a better predictor than the model nse is defined below where i represents each time step in a modeled m or observed o time series and n represents the total number of time steps 1 nse i 1 n m i o i i 1 n o i o percent bias pbias gives the average tendency of modeled values to be greater than or less than observed values eq 2 zero pbias is optimal while positive and negative pbias indicate model overestimation and underestimation respectively percent bias is defined below 2 pbias 100 i 1 n m i o i i 1 n o i percent bias and nse were computed using the hydrogof library package in the statistical software r zambrano bigiarini 2020 studying the distribution of comparative metrics revealed that using 3000 or more parameter sets tended to produce similar distributions of nse and percent bias outcomes thus erring on the side of caution 6000 parameter sets were drawn for the first calibration step where all 6 parameters are varied and 3000 parameter sets were drawn for each iteration of the second calibration step where only 2 swe sensitive parameters are varied in the current work we undertake a two step multi objective function calibration approach where the first step calibrates only aet sensitive parameters and the second step calibrates remaining parameters that are more sensitive to swe thus the second calibration step does not significantly influence the parameters chosen during the first calibration step the first step evaluates modeled aet using 6000 lsh parameter sets against observational aet nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are computed for each parameter set and are ranked within each mru for the top 20 nse ranking parameter sets selected for each mru percent bias is computed and they are further filtered to the best 5 bias ranking parameter sets top ranking nse values were those closest to 1 and top ranking percent bias values were those closest to 0 in this way the first calibration step concludes with the selection of 5 aet sensitive parameter sets for each mru each of the 5 selected aet sensitive parameter sets from the first calibration step are passed to 1 of 5 calibration groups in the second calibration step where aet sensitive parameter values are held constant and other parameters are varied by lhs drawing 3000 new parameter sets within each group modeled swe is vetted against observed fsca using a binary scoring technique where for any month when modeled swe and observed fsca were both greater than one or both equal to zero that month was given a snow score of 1 otherwise a score of 0 monthly snow scores were summed over the calibration period and parameter sets associated with the top 5 scores were selected for each group ultimately resulting in 25 unique parameter combinations for each mru see fig 3 in certain cases some mrus were only assigned 5 unique parameter combinations instead of 25 for mru s where the top ranking snow scores were identical we assume an equifinality problem cannot distinguish which among the top scores are the actual best and in those cases default values were assigned to swe sensitive parameters for mru s where observed fsca was not available due to cloud cover etc default values were assigned to swe sensitive parameters in either of these cases mru s were ultimately assigned 5 unique calibration parameter combinations 2 4 3 evaluation metrics calibrated parameter sets are executed through the model for calibration and validation periods several evaluation metrics are used to examine the calibrated model performance modeled aet is evaluated against observed aet using nse and absolute difference modeled swe is evaluated against observed fsca using the previously defined snow score the mwbm is not calibrated against observational streamflow however the calibrated model does constrain the surface water budget from observations of aet and fsca such that runoff can be reasonably approximated the calibrated model is also used to produce synthetic runoff scenarios for the 25 year period of wys 1992 2017 where the period of wys 1981 1991 is used for model spin up trends in synthetic runoff are determined using sen s slope sen 1968 for multiple confidence levels sen s slope is a nonparametric trend test related to kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient and is not strongly affected by outliers helsel and hirsch 2002 the trend library package in the statistical software r pohlert 2020 is used to compute sen s slope since all mrus have numerous modelled scenarios associated with different calibration parameters sets evaluation metrics are computed for all modelled scenarios and the arithmetic average of those evaluation metrics are illustrated to show spatial and temporal trends with choropleth maps 3 results 3 1 fourier analysis the fast analysis yielded parameter sensitivities unique to each mru for each type of modeled output allowing for spatial evaluation of parameter sensitivities across the model domain to inform our aet and fsca calibration steps we evaluated fast results for modeled aet and swe parameters with the greatest sensitivities for modelled aet are considered aet sensitive but perhaps a more literal description is that these parameters have the greatest relative controls over modelled aet the same logic applies to swe sensitive parameters since the fast analysis is performed separately for each type of modelled output results from fast on modeled aet sometimes match results from fast on modeled swe making it impossible to designate the 6 calibration parameters as either exclusively aet sensitive or swe sensitive for that mru for example for any given mru tsnow could be the most sensitive parameter regardless of output type thus we synthesize fast results across the entire spatial domain to determine which parameters are generally more sensitive to modelled aet and swe respectively mapping parameter sensitivities spatially illustrates that tsnow and train have the greatest control on modelled swe while meltmax and rfactor tend to strongly influence modelled aet fig 4 interestingly mrus that are more sensitive to meltmax tend to occur in higher elevation mountainous areas remaining calibration parameters drofrac and stc are generally non sensitive and are calibrated during the first calibration step 3 2 calibration and validation calibrated parameter sets were validated over wys 2007 2011 against both observational aet and fsca ultimately resulting in 5 25 validation runs per mru both calibration and validation windows were limited by periods of overlapping observational data again looking at general trends across the model domain we can understand how the model performs spatially in alaska and temporally over the study period to show these trends performance metrics were computed on calibration and validation runs for each mru and the average performance metric is illustrated with choropleth mapping to highlight spatial patterns since both aet and fsca are used in calibration we explore how the model performs against each fig 5 shows nse as a performance metric for observed verses modelled aet for calibration and validation periods generally the model performs better during the calibration period than during the validation period however for much of the alaskan interior the calibrated model performs well average nse 0 75 during validation not surprisingly even during calibration the model is weak average nse 0 50 in areas with extensive permafrost and glaciation particularly along the north slope and gulf of alaska coastline a lack of performance in these areas is likely related to both 1 failure of the model to account for permafrost and glacier stores and 2 uncertainty associated with observational aet datasets in frozen areas variability in nse for each mru is generally minimal across the model domain standard deviation of nse 0 1 indicating similar model performance for all calibrated parameter sets since much of the alaskan domain has an above zero probability of near surface permafrost or is covered by perennial snow and ice pastick et al 2015 a lack of cryospheric representation in the wmbm is a concern model performance nse against cryospheric coverage binned into quartiles reveals that model performance is indeed limited in largely frozen basins but is not totally compromised in the case of both 1 probability of near surface permafrost and 2 percentage of perennial snow and ice coverage mean nse during validation exceeds 0 75 for each quartile except for the 75 100 group fig 6 a these findings are also reflected in a breakdown of model performance against the 13 climate divisions described by bieniek 2015 fig 6 b the model tended to perform best nse 0 75 during validation in more moderate to dry or continental climates notably se interior central interior ne interior west coast and cook inlet and worse nse 0 75 in wetter or maritime climates where glaciers tend to be present notably n panhandle ne gulf s panhandle and north slope for a temporal perspective over the full spatial domain fig 7 shows the actual difference between modeled and observed aet for each month in the calendar year where the actual aet difference is computed for all months during the validation period and for all model runs and the average of those values is plotted for each mru during colder months when aet is minimal modelled aet most closely matches observational aet stronger agreement shown by lighter shades weaker agreement shown by darker shades however during warmer months when aet is at or near its annual peak the model tends to overestimate aet in lower latitudes and underestimate aet at higher latitudes the overestimation of aet at lower latitudes during warm months is likely related to 1 the lack of cryospheric store representation in the model and 2 errors in gridded aet products around glaciation the underestimation of aet at higher latitudes during warm months is likely a result of long hours of daylight at high latitude locations while the mwbm does rely on hours of daylight in its et computation calibration datasets may not fully capture aet implications due to these extreme daylight conditions average snow scores are mapped for calibration and validation periods in fig 8 in some rare cases snow scores may be biased low because the cloud cover filtering step may have prevented an mru from receiving a perfect score for example if all days in a month had cloud cover greater than 20 that month could not have an observational fsca value and automatically received a score of zero regardless of modeled swe so in a sense these snow scores reflect both model performance and the quality of observational fsca both relevant factors in spotlighting where the model is most reliable in general snow scores are better in lower latitudes than in higher latitudes since snow scores may be biased low in some mrus we assume that snow scores are at least as high as they appear in fig 8 3 3 runoff trends while the calibrated mwbm has limitations in the alaskan domain it is still a useful tool for approximating long term hydrologic trends in the alaskan domain fig 9 highlights mrus in alaska that experienced significant p 0 05 and p 0 10 trends in surface runoff over wys 1992 2017 blue and red colors respectively indicate significant decreases or increases in surface runoff over this 25 year period lighter shades are associated with lower magnitude trends while darker colors represent greater magnitude trends for both significance levels runoff trends are both more prevalent and stronger at lower latitudes in general with the exception of the aleutian islands and parts of the southern panhandle simulated runoff is trending upward at lower latitudes and is trending downward at higher latitudes 4 discussion findings from this study reinforce the need for more ground based observations of hydroclimatic phenomena in alaska including runoff and precipitation in particular availability of large domain gridded products aet and fsca made calibration over a large domain feasible and while steps were taken to reduce model uncertainty our confidence in developed parameter solutions would be strengthened if calibrations were anchored to in situ measurements representing adequate spatial coverage and temporal resolutions the fast analysis showed that aet is largely sensitive to controlled by the rfactor parameter and at higher elevations the meltmax parameter the rfactor parameter determines the amount of soil moisture surplus that becomes surface runoff each month and meltmax is the maximum melt rate of snow storage taken together results reveal that at lower elevations excess soil moisture has a relatively strong control on evapotranspiration and at higher elevations the rate of snowmelt may influence evapotranspiration more strongly those results are intuitive however when applying the sensitivity analysis to surface runoff not used in calibration rfactor has a strong relative control on simulated runoff for much of the alaskan interior but train and tsnow have stronger controls on surface runoff in the heavily glaciated gulf of alaska fig 10 train and tsnow are temperature thresholds used in the partitioning of precipitation as rain or snow in other words excess soil water tends to dominate surface runoff in non glaciated areas while temperature tends to dominate surface runoff in glaciated areas as high latitude regions continue to experience increasing temperatures ipcc 2014 these results suggest that glaciated watersheds may be vulnerable to the greatest flux thus results from the fast analysis not only inform the calibration process but they also support a deeper understanding of dominant hydrologic processes in alaska the modeling methodology described here certainly has limitations in particular the model is less reliable in areas with extensive glaciation such as the gulf of alaska coast and extensive permafrost such as the north slope while unreliability in those areas is likely associated with errors in climate forcing and calibration datasets it is also related to the absence of permafrost and glacial stores in the mwbm despite these shortcomings we anticipated even weaker performance than we observed and much of the alaskan interior remains free of glaciation and permafrost in areas without extensive ice stores this methodology may provide valuable insight into hydrologic trends at a monthly resolution the parameter solutions developed in this work will be available for all huc 12 basins in alaska please contact the authors to request a copy and represent a range of possible hydrologic outcomes for any user specified climate scenario parameter solutions that we developed can be used in conjunction with desktop app version of the mwbm that is publicly available through the usgs modeling of watershed systems mows web portal further this application of the mwbm may serve as starting point for large scale monthly resolution hydrologic representation across the entire alaskan domain where future iterations could and should include representation of cryospheric processes like those described by valentin and others in 2018 the most confidence in modelled fluxes can be placed in modelled aet and swe as these were the two fluxes calibrated against observational datasets although observed runoff was not used in calibration given the lack of observed data observational aet and fsca constrain modelled surface water fluxes so that runoff can be approximated by the mwbm evaluation of modelled runoff trends over the period of available historic climate forcing data discarding the first ten water years for model spin up showed significant runoff trends are evident in mrus at lower latitudes fig 9 where trends are generally increasing compared to more northern mrus where trends are generally decreasing we do not attempt to dissect runoff into all the possible contributing signals weather oscillations land cover changes storage changes etc instead we highlight areas where significant trends are present and the direction and relative magnitude of those trends in areas where runoff trends are decreasing we assume that less water is available to runoff and that those areas are becoming dryer conversely in areas where runoff is increasing we assume that more water is available to runoff and that those areas are either becoming wetter or that water is leaving ice snow or ground stores we found that higher magnitude trends are concentrated around the gulf of alaska where many mrus are glacierized and thus have greater potential for storage loss than mrus with less stored water however the magnitude of many significant runoff trends is slight plus or minus 0 1 especially in the alaskan interior however even slight changes in surface runoff are indicative that those systems are deviating from steady state conditions and will likely continue to do so even if runoff trends remain slight or especially if they become more exaggerated these changes could have lasting implications for ecological communities and for water resource availability others have also shown similar trends in alaskan runoff over the last several decades which ultimately strengthens confidence in our modeled runoff findings for example young and others found increases in modeled spring glacier ice melt volumes and total watershed runoff in southeast alaska over the 1980 2016 period young et al 2021 the geographic contrast in simulated runoff trends is notable in our study indicating that northern alaska approximately fairbanks and northward may not yet be experiencing the same degree of hydrologic disturbance as lower latitude portions of the state while southern coastal portions of the state are currently experiencing wetter conditions and or storage loss in a modeling study by little et al near term 2020 s future hydrologic conditions under two emissions scenarios are expected to follow similar hydrologic trends where the highest magnitude decreases to snowfall occur in the southern coastal portions of the state along with a higher fraction of precipitation falling as rain while snowfall in the higher latitude interior portions alaska experience little to no change but worsen over the coming century littell mcafee and hayward 2018 previous work has also shown variable but increasing discharge in two arctic coastal watersheds where our analysis did not show significant runoff trends stuefer et al 2017 clearly additional study and especially improved ground based hydroclimatic observations are critical for better characterizing alaskan hydrology ultimately our results support a growing body of literature indicating that change in hydrologic fluxes is well underway in alaska and especially in southern coastal regions 5 conclusions in the current work we developed a framework for calibrating a monthly resolution water balance model over the entire alaskan domain without the use of observational runoff data and evaluated modeled runoff trends over several recent decades our modeling framework demonstrates the feasibility of employing gridded aet and fsca without relying on runoff products in model calibration to constrain an operational surface water budget model which to our knowledge has not yet been explored for a large domain cold study region the calibrated model performed best in the moderate to dry alaskan interior where glaciers are absent and permafrost is generally discontinuous sporadic or absent and the model is weaker in wetter maritime areas dominated by ice stores like the north slope and gulf of alaska coastline these shortcomings highlight the need for 1 better representation of cryospheric processes in both observational datasets and in conceptual models 2 greater spatial and temporal representation of hydrologic phenomena in ground based datasets and 3 availability of robust climate products in alaska while our modelling approach does have promise to deliver hydrologic representation in a data sparse region confidence in the modelled scenarios would be greatly increased by the inclusion of more robust climate forcing data and with validation against in situ measurements of water budget components particularly runoff at adequate spatial and temporal resolutions our calibration methodology may be transferrable to other domains where gridded water budget components are available but are otherwise poorly hydrologically monitored to illustrate the applicability of a calibrated monthly resolution model in the alaskan domain we produce synthetic streamflow from wy 1992 2017 during this time period significant temporal trends in modeled runoff are present across the alaskan domain where in lower latitudes runoff tends to be increasing over time at various magnitudes and in higher latitudes runoff tends to be slightly decreasing while we do not explicitly identify phenomena responsible for causing these trends they highlight areas where more or less water is becoming available for runoff and agree with hydrologic trends detected in other studies while this was one example of the functionality of the calibrated mwbm in alaska it may also be used to investigate other hydrologic fluxes or future scenarios in alaska down to a huc 12 resolution the parameter solutions developed in this work are also compatible with a desktop version of the mwbm and may inform decision making for water supply and management and support educational research efforts credit authorship contribution statement katie schneider

8073,study region alaska and hydrologically connected portions of canada study focus rugged terrain and harsh conditions make observational hydroclimatic data especially runoff data extremely limited across most of alaska consequently many previous hydrologic studies in alaska have focused on smaller domain trends where pockets of hydroclimatic observations are clustered using a combination of reanalysis and remotely sensed gridded products we develop a calibration framework for a monthly resolution water budget model over the entire alaskan domain that does not rely on runoff the domain is comprised of distributed model response units mrus each representing a hydrologic unit code 12 basin we use a fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast to inform a two step calibration process first calibrating to actual evapotranspiration and then to fractional snow covered area fsca resulting in a range of parameter solutions for each mru new hydrological insights for the region using this framework the model performs best in the moderate to dry alaskan interior in the absence of glaciation and where permafrost is generally not continuous modelled runoff for recent decades shows increased runoff trends at lower latitudes and slightly decreased runoff trends at higher latitudes within the alaskan domain these findings reveal that reliance upon non runoff fluxes for model calibration is viable in this cold region and that better characterization of hydroclimatic data is necessary to improve confidence in cold region modeling studies keywords calibration alaska sensitivity analysis evapotranspiration runoff water balance 1 introduction northern latitudes are some of the most sensitive regions to increasing global temperatures hinzman et al 2005 these areas are often dominated by snow ice and permafrost resulting in human and natural systems that are shaped and controlled by cryospheric processes as global temperature increases observations reveal changing trends in hydrologic processes that are controlled by freezing temperatures in particular water that was previously stored in the cryosphere is melting and being transported through other parts of the water cycle in alaska and surrounding regions these changes are especially evident through earlier seasonal snowmelt curtis et al 1998 stone et al 2002 changing glacier mass balance arendt et al 2002 sea ice loss screen and simmonds 2010 permafrost thaw jorgenson shur and pullman 2006 increased base flow in rivers bennett cannon and hinzman 2015 greater contributions of groundwater to surface runoff walvoord and striegl 2007 gibson et al 2020 earlier seasonal riverine breakup lesack et al 2014 cooley and pavelsky 2016 and increasing magnitude and frequency of boreal forest wildfires kasischke et al 2010 these changes have implications for alaska s ecology and economy arctic monitoring and assessment programme amap 2017 and have global implications as sea ice loss alters the atmospheric energy balance screen and simmonds 2010 and glacial waste contributes to sea level rise arendt et al 2002 modelling hydrologic processes in the alaskan domain comes with a unique set of challenges most significantly the vast and heterogeneous landscape is not well characterized by hydrologic or meteorological data monaghan et al 2018 thus previous hydrologic modeling studies in alaska have generally focused on smaller basin scale or in some cases regional scale study areas van beusekom and viger 2018 beamer et al 2016 where sufficient observational hydroclimatic data was available to meet model forcing and parameterization requirements even parsimonious hydrologic models that lack extensive parameterization requirements are limited by hydrologic data availability in alaska in particular streamflow or runoff information valentin et al 2018 despite these limitations recent advances in model capabilities and improved availability of satellite and other gridded products create opportunities for the modeling community to better characterize and reproduce hydrologic conditions in alaska and other cold regions many hydrologic models have demonstrated suitable performance in alaska including conceptual surface hydrology models but many such studies only address regional areas of alaska bui lu and nie 2020 gridded water budget products available over alaska include those from reanalysis data sets global hydro meteorological models or remote sensing products still many such gridded products have coarse spatial resolutions and or relatively short periods of record geospatial products that represent permafrost and glaciation in alaska tend to be temporally static rgi consortium 2017 pastick et al 2015 additionally many gridded climate forcing datasets available for the alaskan domain do not adequately adjust climatic variables for orographic influences monaghan et al 2018 despite these limitations on various hydrologic data enough information now exists to develop constraints on hydrologic models that can provide insight on hydrologic trends through time and across the entire domain traditionally hydrologic models are calibrated and validated against measured streamflow gupta sorooshian and yapo 1998 immerzeel and droogers 2008 however most rivers in the world are ungauged and large domain models are often forced to rely on streamflow predictions in ungauged basins pub mcglynn et al 2012 or to extrapolate a small sample of measured streamflow to a larger region for example bock and others 2016 used measured streamflow to calibrate and parameterize the u s geological survey s usgs monthly water balance model mwbm in behaviorally similar calibration regions within the contiguous united states conus later using a statistical method to estimate streamflow farmer 2016 lafontaine and others produced synthetic streamflow time series to calibrate a daily hydrologic model in ungauged basins in the southeastern united states lafontaine et al 2019 in both of these instances some observational streamflow was required for either regional extrapolation or spatial interpolation over ungauged basins in addition the observed streamflow used in these examples had to meet performance criteria the observational streamflow network in alaska is patchy at best where streamflow gauges are most dense around the more populated areas of the gulf of alaska coastline and become increasingly sparse moving inward toward the alaskan interior usgs nwis 2020 temporal streamflow records are also often severely abbreviated by frozen rivers making annual streamflow trends difficult to quantify while many previous modelling efforts centered around pub use physical similarity spatial proximity or statistical methods to extrapolate known streamflow to unknown areas poissant arsenault and brissette 2017 this study relies on gridded evapotranspiration et and snow covered area products the use of gridded datasets in the calibration of hydrologic models is a growing field of research immerzeel and droogers were some of the early pioneers in using et in model calibration and they argue that in data scarce areas where model calibration relies on too few discharge stations hydrologic processes over large areas are effectively lumped together and increase the risk of equifinality problems immerzeel and droogers 2008 dile et al 2020 provide a summary of studies that have coupled satellite based et to hydrologic applications for purposes of estimating water budgets or improving model skill dile et al 2020 similarly jiang and others review applications of remotely sensed et that are specifically used in hydrologic model calibration jiang et al 2020 from many of the studies outlined in the overviews presented by dile et al 2020 and jiang et al 2020 we see that incorporating gridded et products into model calibration has promise to deliver reasonable modeled discharge estimates at small and large scales for example lopez et al 2017 and even to improve model skill when coupled with measured streamflow during calibration for example jin and jin 2020 remotely sensed snow cover products have also been shown to improve streamflow forecasting in cold regions for example bennet and others found that by incorporating modis based fractional snow covered area fsca into the snow 17 model model skill is improved in predicting both streamflow and snow depletion timing in interior alaska bennett et al 2019 they argue that well calibrated conceptual models are likely a better option in alaska than process based models because 1 the severe lack of high quality hydrologic observations limits our understanding of true hydrologic processes in alaska and 2 well calibrated conceptual models rely on parameterizations rather than observations that lack accuracy in alaska applying modis based fsca products to land surface models have also shown improvements in streamflow predictions in alaska déry et al 2005 liu et al 2013 the mwbm has been vetted in numerous previous studies evaluating water budgets in a range of climatic conditions mccabe and wolock 2008 2011 bock et al 2016 including as a component of the usgs national hydrologic model nhm where its monthly predictions are used to constrain a higher resolution daily model regan et al 2019 and in alaska hay and mccabe 2010 due to the parsimonious and conceptual nature of the mwbm it has promise to deliver reasonable approximations of monthly hydrologic fluxes in data sparse regions in this study the purpose of the mwbm is not to produce high resolution runoff predictions for narrow temporal windows but rather its purpose is to constrain the surface water budget over longer study periods using available surface water flux information rather than looking at a single catchment or region that is well monitored in alaska we use the mwbm to develop a calibration framework over the entire alaskan domain that does not rely on the virtually nonexistent observational streamflow network the goals of the current work are to 1 constrain a simple surface water budget across the entire alaskan domain by parameterizing and validating a conceptual monthly resolution water balance model without the use of runoff data and 2 to demonstrate the usefulness of such a tool by evaluating long term trends in simulated runoff to achieve these goals we discretize the alaskan domain into hydrologic unit code huc 12 basins and used a combination of remotely sensed reanalysis and hydrologically modelled gridded actual evapotranspiration aet products as well as fsca to calibrate and validate the mwbm ultimately producing a range of parameter solutions for each mru while the employment of non runoff based gridded products specifically aet in calibration is not a new modelling technique using them in a large domain cold region is to our knowledge reliance solely on aet and fsca observations to constrain a water budget model over a large cold region domain has not yet been presented in the literature 2 methods this study was designed with the intention of reducing model uncertainty where possible strategies we employed to undertake the proposed work includes performing a stepwise calibration informed by parameter sensitivities associated with each calibration step where each calibration step evaluates a different component of the water budget utilizing multiple objective functions in each calibration step to curb the biases associated with any one objective function see legates and mccabe 1999 utilizing a suite of gridded aet products with strong seasonal agreements rather than placing confidence in a single dataset for calibration and validation a similar method was used by ha et al 2018 arriving at a range of parameter solutions for each huc rather than a single deterministic solution that has a non trivial chance of being selected purely because it can survive the mathematical hurdles during calibration and not because it is truly representative of the natural environment beven 2006 another intention was to balance these uncertainty reducing strategies with maintaining the simplistic nature of the original mwbm this was in part to minimize computational requirements which allowed for more model iterations during calibration 2 1 description of mwbm a desktop application of the original mwbm is publicly available for planning research educational or personal use https wwwbrr cr usgs gov projects sw mows thornthwaite html the parameters that we developed are compatible with that tool and may be useful to alaskan communities that are otherwise poorly monitored one of the greatest strengths of the mwbm is its low demand for parameterization which minimizes concerns over equifinality and makes it a readily accessible tool for longer term water budget analyses in a variety of environments for application in alaska two versions of the mwbm exist the original mwbm previously described and a version that accounts for additional cryospheric processes mwbmglacier the original mwbm was first applied in alaska by hay and mccabe 2010 to the yukon river basin for purposes of evaluating potential future hydrologic conditions under various future climate scenarios more recently mwbmglacier was developed valentin et al 2018 to account for glaciation as an additional cryospheric store valentin 2019 piloted mwbmglacier in the highly glacierized copper river basin in southcentral alaska which is relatively well monitored compared to the rest of the state the cryospheric processes that mwbmglacier represents glaciation permafrost are parameterized as initial conditions taken from temporally static raster information glacier coverage rasters such as those in the randolph glacier inventory rgi consortium 2017 and permafrost coverage maps like those presented by pastick 2015 are representative of a fixed time period this becomes problematic when static glacier and or permafrost rasters are not temporally congruent with the beginning of a simulation period mwbmglacier clearly represents cryospheric land cover and stores that the original mwbm does not however unlike the copper river basin the majority of alaska is poorly monitored hydrologically and unglaciated and while we understand the deficiencies of the original mwbm for application in a cryospheric domain we believe an application of the original mwbm is a good first step in understanding broad hydrologic trends in alaska and may contribute to future applications of the nhm or mwbmglacier across the entire alaskan domain relevant mwbm accounting processes are described here however for an in depth description of the water budget accounting procedure of the mwbm see mccabe and markstrom 2007 the mwbm is based on the water accounting methodology first described by thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 computes surface water budget components at a monthly time step and is driven by mean monthly temperature monthly total precipitation and the latitude of the location of interest for computation of day length used to compute potential evapotranspiration pet following the hamon equation hamon 1961 the initial computation in the mwbm is the partitioning of precipitation as rain or snow where snow is accumulated or liquid water either enters the ground or produces direct surface runoff water available for evaporative processes p total is the sum of snow melt and precipitation that falls as rain less any water that runs directly off the land surface when p total pet relatively dry conditions aet is equal to the sum of p total plus available soil moisture when p total pet relatively wet conditions then aet is equal to pet and any water in excess of pet replenishes soil moisture storage as snow melts during a simulation period water is routed into soil moisture storage and may eventually be routed to aet surplus runoff when the ground is saturated or may stay as soil moisture storage snow that does not melt during a simulation time step stays as snow storage for that time step thus the hydrologic stores accounted for in the mwbm are simply snow storage and soil moisture storage fig 1 the mwbm has only six calibration parameters fig 1 several of which are coefficients used to modify physically based algorithms within the model and others such as stc can be approximated using empirical data when available instead of calibration the selection of the mwbm in alaska allowed for minimal parameter data requirements and focus on development of calibration techniques to alternative datasets the mwbm does not account for dynamic subsurface flow processes in areas where groundwater flow is truly minimal over monthly time periods the exclusion of groundwater flow processes in model representation is arguably reasonable the mwbm assumes that water entering the land surface either stays in the unsaturated vadose zone as soil moisture storage or leaves as evapotranspiration or surplus runoff so while groundwater meaning literally water in the ground is not ignored in the mwbm dynamic groundwater flow processes that may cause water to leave the ground store are not accounted for in the mwbm a relevant consideration is that much of the alaskan ground surface stays frozen as permafrost year round or freezes seasonally and groundwater flow is considered minimal however as global surface temperatures increase permafrost is diminishing and active layer thickness is increasing which may open up significant preferential groundwater flow paths in the form of thermokarst and taliks pastick et al 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 as preferential flow paths continue opening up in alaska the mwbm s lack of groundwater flow representation may limit accurate representation of the water budget 2 2 model domain the model domain encompasses all of alaska and hydrologically connected portions of western canada along the us canadian border fig 2 within this domain the surface landscape is highly variable from a surface water budget perspective hydrologically prominent features of the alaskan domain are the extensive coastline and associated maritime effects high latitude position numerous considerable mountain ranges as well as permafrost and glacial coverage it follows that climate types within alaska are also variable as they are controlled by such features bieniek and others bieniek et al 2012 identified 13 distinct climate divisions within alaska based on an objective clustering method on observational temperature 2 3 data sources data sources used in model setup calibration and validation are summarized in table 1 to stay within the methodological framework of the nhm watershed boundary dataset huc watershed delineations were used to spatially discretize the model domain due to the extreme variability in topography and land cover and climate the three highest resolution huc delineations available for the domain huc 8 huc 10 and huc 12 were considered as feasible model response units mrus the uncalibrated mwbm was evaluated at all three huc scales for selected test basins with a relatively strong observational streamflow record this preliminary spatial scale analysis revealed that the highest resolution spatial scale huc 12 generally outperformed the two lower resolution spatial scales in both glaciated and unglaciated test basins thus a huc 12 scale was selected as the spatial discretization for this study monthly precipitation and temperature sourced from daymet version 3 was used to force the mwbm from wy 1981 wy 2011 table 1 while daymet and certainly all gridded climate products have shortcomings daymet was chosen for this application because of its relatively high spatial resolution and period of record long enough to allow for model spin up calibration and validation in 2018 monaghan and others with the weather research and forecasting wrf model released high resolution historical climate simulations that robustly reproduce meteorological processes in alaska monaghan et al 2018 the wrf dataset was not used in this study due to a relatively short period of coverage roughly 14 years but may be a candidate for forcing shorter term hydrologic studies in alaska total monthly precipitation maximum and minimum monthly temperature rasters were sourced from daymet and bilinearly extracted by weight to mrus maximum and minimum temperatures were averaged for each model response unit mru to approximate average monthly temperature evapotranspiration products derived by any means are notoriously difficult to validate especially in water budget modeling efforts that are calibrated to observational streamflow any residual error that is not explicitly quantified can inadvertently end up lumped into harder to validate water budget components such as aet additionally the users choice of water budget product can strongly influence results of a water budget analysis saxe et al 2020a here instead of utilizing any single aet product we have sourced a suite of monthly gridded aet products with good seasonal agreement to inform model calibration and validation the suite of aet products are derived from reanalysis remote sensing and hydrologic model data sets products were selected based on their available period of record and relative seasonal agreement eight products were considered and seven were ultimately chosen and are summarized in table 1 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16 was the only aet product considered and not selected due to poor seasonal agreement with other products particularly during winter months the seven selected aet products were bilinearly extracted to mrus and averaged each aet product considered for this study approximates true aet and like all gridded data is subject to error and uncertainty using a product average does not eliminate all error associated with gridded aet products but it does represent the zone of agreement between all products and serves to reduce bias resulting from spurious errors in any single gridded aet product duan et al 2007 saxe et al 2020b product averaged aet was used as observational aet during calibration and validation remotely sensed snow cover data was also used for model calibration and validation and was sourced from modis terra mod10c1 daily snow cover fraction and cloud cover rasters were extracted to mrus snow fraction pixels were filtered with cloud cover information and were only kept if daily cloud cover pixels did not exceed 20 selected daily snow fraction pixels were averaged by month and the resulting monthly snow fraction dataset was used as observational fsca during calibration and validation observational aet and fsca data sets both have temporal coverage between 2000 and 2012 allowing 6 water years wy for calibration wy 2001 2006 and 5 water years for model validation wy 2007 2011 however model simulations were started in wy 1981 the earliest available date for climate forcing data daymet to allow a substantial window for model spin up the purpose of model spin up is to fill stores buckets within the model to mimic real world initial storage conditions while four or five years is typically the acceptable minimum window for mwbm spin up we elected to utilize the maximum possible window for spin up particularly because alaska has substantial cryospheric storage allowing a long spin up window 1981 2000 helps to ensure that model stores were adequately filled prior to the calibration window wy 2001 2006 2 4 modelling approach 2 4 1 sensitivity analysis most hydrologic models rely totally or at least in part on streamflow for calibration because observational streamflow is so limited across the alaskan domain we explore a stepwise calibration procedure where the first step calibrates to observational aet and the second step calibrates to observational snow fraction following a binary comparison between observational snow fraction and modelled snow water equivalent swe aet was calibrated first because of its robustness compared to the swe calibration the aet calibration utilizes a direct comparison between modelled aet and observational aet whereas the swe relies on a binary comparison between modelled swe and observational fsca before calibration a fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast was performed to determine which model parameters are most sensitive to aet and swe respectively parameters more sensitive to aet were calibrated in the first calibration step and parameters more sensitive to swe were calibrated in the second calibration step the fourier transformation decomposes information in a time domain a time series combining both hydrologic signals and noise into a frequency domain a power spectrum for purposes of sa fast samples a parameter space by varying each parameter according to a sine wave function where each sine wave has a different frequency and the amplitude of each wave matches the range of the corresponding parameter at each x axis increment along the sine function trial parameter sets are selected based on the corresponding y values of each parameter s sine wave bock et al 2016 the model is executed using all trial parameter sets holding other variables constant and the resulting outputs from model trials are passed through a user selected performance metric to produce a time series of performance information the performance metric series is fourier transformed into a power spectrum of frequencies associated with each parameter since model outputs are produced using unique combinations of parameters that can be identified by their unique frequencies the resulting power spectrum reveals relative contributions or sensitivities of each parameter when this process is applied to modeled output for aet we learn which model parameters have the greatest influence on modeled aet the same applies for modeled swe or any model output component the fast method is an extremely computationally efficient global sensitivity analysis sa bock et al 2016 previously fast has been used to explore spatial variability of dominant processes and sensitive parameters in the mwbm bock et al 2016 and precipitation runoff modelling system prms markstrom hay and clark 2016 since fast is a well established sa method is minimally computationally expensive and has previously been used to evaluate parameter sensitivity in the mwbm it stands out as a strong method for the application of the mwbm in alaska when bock and others 2016 applied fast to the mwbm in the conus they did not use comparative statistics in their sa that require observational streamflow information such as root mean squared error or nash sutcliffe efficiency but instead used runoff ratio simulated runoff precipitation and runoff variance standard deviation of simulated runoff standard deviation of precipitation as performance statistics markstrom and others 2016 note that for fast sensitivity analysis performance measures do not need to include comparisons to observational measurements but only to track relative changes in model output their methodologies demonstrate that fast is a robust sa method even without observational streamflow this is especially important for the application of fast on the mwbm in alaska as observational streamflow is practically non existent here we used the fast library package in the statistical software r reusser 2015 to generate fast trial parameter sets and to perform a fourier analysis on output performance metrics specifically the fast fast parameters function was called to generate fast parameter sets and the fast sensitivity function was called to calculate sensitivity of corresponding model output the fast package determined that 91 trial parameter sets was the minimum number of sets to cover the parameter space in keeping with minimizing computational expense we elected to proceed with 91 trial parameter sets for sensitivity analysis while utilizing more than the minimum number of parameter sets is certainly cautious it may also be redundant and introduce unnecessary computation expense because fast is fairly insensitive to sample size as long as the minimum criterion is met saltelli and bolado 1998 trial parameter sets were executed through the mwbm and percent change was computed on model output for each model run percent change was computed using summed model output using fast parameter values versus summed model output using default parameter values fig 1 where summing occurred over wys 2003 2017 allowing ample time for model spin up the fast package was utilized again to perform a fourier analysis on the series of performance statistics which highlighted relative sensitivities of each parameter in each mru the process described above was applied to each mru so that in addition to having parameter sa information to inform calibration we can also evaluate spatial patterns in parameter sensitivity across the alaskan domain for several components of the water budget aet swe and runoff in this way we hope to better characterize modeled hydrologic processes as they vary over the domain space 2 4 2 calibration previous applications of the mwbm have followed exhaustive search hay and mccabe 2002 and shuffled complex evolution sce hay and mccabe 2010 valentin et al 2018 bock et al 2016 calibration approaches however major goals of the present study were to reduce computational demand and procedural complexity due to both computational limitations and desired ease of reproducibility associated with model calibration thus latin hypercube sampling lhs was employed to vet the parameter space similar to monte carlo sampling lhs also randomly samples a parameter space according to a distribution function monte carlo samples the distribution entirely randomly which can lead to under represented outliers even with high numbers of samples however lhs is less random in that lhs samples a distribution that is broken down into strata each of which are uniformly sampled in systematically sampling a distribution through strata results in less biased sampling with a smaller number of samples thereby lowering computational expense because the lhs approach does not represent all possible parameter combinations nor does it employ a search algorithm to optimize chosen parameter sets as with sce we assume that the lhs sample is adequately representative of the entire parameter space in choosing the number of parameter set samples to draw following lhs one must consider the trade off between high computational larger number of samples demand and underrepresenting the parameter space lower number of samples to determine an optimal number of lhs samples to use in calibration different numbers of parameter set samples were tested on 10 random mrus in the alaskan domain this test evaluated 500 1000 3000 6000 and 10 000 lhs parameter sets where all 6 parameters are varied and compared modeled aet to observed aet using both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias as comparative metrics these objective functions were chosen for this study because they especially nse have been used in the calibration of the mwbm in previous studies hay and mccabe 2002 bock et al 2016 valentin et al 2018 however it is worth nothing that pattern based objective functions have recently been employed in multivariate calibration of hydrologic models and have promise to reduce parameter selection bias in studies relying on gridded datasets during calibration dembélé et al 2020 nse is the magnitude of model residual variance to the variance of observed data eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 where nse 1 suggests a perfect relationship between modelled and observed data nse 0 indicates that the model is as arcuate as the mean of observed data and nse 0 reveals that the mean of observed data is a better predictor than the model nse is defined below where i represents each time step in a modeled m or observed o time series and n represents the total number of time steps 1 nse i 1 n m i o i i 1 n o i o percent bias pbias gives the average tendency of modeled values to be greater than or less than observed values eq 2 zero pbias is optimal while positive and negative pbias indicate model overestimation and underestimation respectively percent bias is defined below 2 pbias 100 i 1 n m i o i i 1 n o i percent bias and nse were computed using the hydrogof library package in the statistical software r zambrano bigiarini 2020 studying the distribution of comparative metrics revealed that using 3000 or more parameter sets tended to produce similar distributions of nse and percent bias outcomes thus erring on the side of caution 6000 parameter sets were drawn for the first calibration step where all 6 parameters are varied and 3000 parameter sets were drawn for each iteration of the second calibration step where only 2 swe sensitive parameters are varied in the current work we undertake a two step multi objective function calibration approach where the first step calibrates only aet sensitive parameters and the second step calibrates remaining parameters that are more sensitive to swe thus the second calibration step does not significantly influence the parameters chosen during the first calibration step the first step evaluates modeled aet using 6000 lsh parameter sets against observational aet nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients are computed for each parameter set and are ranked within each mru for the top 20 nse ranking parameter sets selected for each mru percent bias is computed and they are further filtered to the best 5 bias ranking parameter sets top ranking nse values were those closest to 1 and top ranking percent bias values were those closest to 0 in this way the first calibration step concludes with the selection of 5 aet sensitive parameter sets for each mru each of the 5 selected aet sensitive parameter sets from the first calibration step are passed to 1 of 5 calibration groups in the second calibration step where aet sensitive parameter values are held constant and other parameters are varied by lhs drawing 3000 new parameter sets within each group modeled swe is vetted against observed fsca using a binary scoring technique where for any month when modeled swe and observed fsca were both greater than one or both equal to zero that month was given a snow score of 1 otherwise a score of 0 monthly snow scores were summed over the calibration period and parameter sets associated with the top 5 scores were selected for each group ultimately resulting in 25 unique parameter combinations for each mru see fig 3 in certain cases some mrus were only assigned 5 unique parameter combinations instead of 25 for mru s where the top ranking snow scores were identical we assume an equifinality problem cannot distinguish which among the top scores are the actual best and in those cases default values were assigned to swe sensitive parameters for mru s where observed fsca was not available due to cloud cover etc default values were assigned to swe sensitive parameters in either of these cases mru s were ultimately assigned 5 unique calibration parameter combinations 2 4 3 evaluation metrics calibrated parameter sets are executed through the model for calibration and validation periods several evaluation metrics are used to examine the calibrated model performance modeled aet is evaluated against observed aet using nse and absolute difference modeled swe is evaluated against observed fsca using the previously defined snow score the mwbm is not calibrated against observational streamflow however the calibrated model does constrain the surface water budget from observations of aet and fsca such that runoff can be reasonably approximated the calibrated model is also used to produce synthetic runoff scenarios for the 25 year period of wys 1992 2017 where the period of wys 1981 1991 is used for model spin up trends in synthetic runoff are determined using sen s slope sen 1968 for multiple confidence levels sen s slope is a nonparametric trend test related to kendall s tau rank correlation coefficient and is not strongly affected by outliers helsel and hirsch 2002 the trend library package in the statistical software r pohlert 2020 is used to compute sen s slope since all mrus have numerous modelled scenarios associated with different calibration parameters sets evaluation metrics are computed for all modelled scenarios and the arithmetic average of those evaluation metrics are illustrated to show spatial and temporal trends with choropleth maps 3 results 3 1 fourier analysis the fast analysis yielded parameter sensitivities unique to each mru for each type of modeled output allowing for spatial evaluation of parameter sensitivities across the model domain to inform our aet and fsca calibration steps we evaluated fast results for modeled aet and swe parameters with the greatest sensitivities for modelled aet are considered aet sensitive but perhaps a more literal description is that these parameters have the greatest relative controls over modelled aet the same logic applies to swe sensitive parameters since the fast analysis is performed separately for each type of modelled output results from fast on modeled aet sometimes match results from fast on modeled swe making it impossible to designate the 6 calibration parameters as either exclusively aet sensitive or swe sensitive for that mru for example for any given mru tsnow could be the most sensitive parameter regardless of output type thus we synthesize fast results across the entire spatial domain to determine which parameters are generally more sensitive to modelled aet and swe respectively mapping parameter sensitivities spatially illustrates that tsnow and train have the greatest control on modelled swe while meltmax and rfactor tend to strongly influence modelled aet fig 4 interestingly mrus that are more sensitive to meltmax tend to occur in higher elevation mountainous areas remaining calibration parameters drofrac and stc are generally non sensitive and are calibrated during the first calibration step 3 2 calibration and validation calibrated parameter sets were validated over wys 2007 2011 against both observational aet and fsca ultimately resulting in 5 25 validation runs per mru both calibration and validation windows were limited by periods of overlapping observational data again looking at general trends across the model domain we can understand how the model performs spatially in alaska and temporally over the study period to show these trends performance metrics were computed on calibration and validation runs for each mru and the average performance metric is illustrated with choropleth mapping to highlight spatial patterns since both aet and fsca are used in calibration we explore how the model performs against each fig 5 shows nse as a performance metric for observed verses modelled aet for calibration and validation periods generally the model performs better during the calibration period than during the validation period however for much of the alaskan interior the calibrated model performs well average nse 0 75 during validation not surprisingly even during calibration the model is weak average nse 0 50 in areas with extensive permafrost and glaciation particularly along the north slope and gulf of alaska coastline a lack of performance in these areas is likely related to both 1 failure of the model to account for permafrost and glacier stores and 2 uncertainty associated with observational aet datasets in frozen areas variability in nse for each mru is generally minimal across the model domain standard deviation of nse 0 1 indicating similar model performance for all calibrated parameter sets since much of the alaskan domain has an above zero probability of near surface permafrost or is covered by perennial snow and ice pastick et al 2015 a lack of cryospheric representation in the wmbm is a concern model performance nse against cryospheric coverage binned into quartiles reveals that model performance is indeed limited in largely frozen basins but is not totally compromised in the case of both 1 probability of near surface permafrost and 2 percentage of perennial snow and ice coverage mean nse during validation exceeds 0 75 for each quartile except for the 75 100 group fig 6 a these findings are also reflected in a breakdown of model performance against the 13 climate divisions described by bieniek 2015 fig 6 b the model tended to perform best nse 0 75 during validation in more moderate to dry or continental climates notably se interior central interior ne interior west coast and cook inlet and worse nse 0 75 in wetter or maritime climates where glaciers tend to be present notably n panhandle ne gulf s panhandle and north slope for a temporal perspective over the full spatial domain fig 7 shows the actual difference between modeled and observed aet for each month in the calendar year where the actual aet difference is computed for all months during the validation period and for all model runs and the average of those values is plotted for each mru during colder months when aet is minimal modelled aet most closely matches observational aet stronger agreement shown by lighter shades weaker agreement shown by darker shades however during warmer months when aet is at or near its annual peak the model tends to overestimate aet in lower latitudes and underestimate aet at higher latitudes the overestimation of aet at lower latitudes during warm months is likely related to 1 the lack of cryospheric store representation in the model and 2 errors in gridded aet products around glaciation the underestimation of aet at higher latitudes during warm months is likely a result of long hours of daylight at high latitude locations while the mwbm does rely on hours of daylight in its et computation calibration datasets may not fully capture aet implications due to these extreme daylight conditions average snow scores are mapped for calibration and validation periods in fig 8 in some rare cases snow scores may be biased low because the cloud cover filtering step may have prevented an mru from receiving a perfect score for example if all days in a month had cloud cover greater than 20 that month could not have an observational fsca value and automatically received a score of zero regardless of modeled swe so in a sense these snow scores reflect both model performance and the quality of observational fsca both relevant factors in spotlighting where the model is most reliable in general snow scores are better in lower latitudes than in higher latitudes since snow scores may be biased low in some mrus we assume that snow scores are at least as high as they appear in fig 8 3 3 runoff trends while the calibrated mwbm has limitations in the alaskan domain it is still a useful tool for approximating long term hydrologic trends in the alaskan domain fig 9 highlights mrus in alaska that experienced significant p 0 05 and p 0 10 trends in surface runoff over wys 1992 2017 blue and red colors respectively indicate significant decreases or increases in surface runoff over this 25 year period lighter shades are associated with lower magnitude trends while darker colors represent greater magnitude trends for both significance levels runoff trends are both more prevalent and stronger at lower latitudes in general with the exception of the aleutian islands and parts of the southern panhandle simulated runoff is trending upward at lower latitudes and is trending downward at higher latitudes 4 discussion findings from this study reinforce the need for more ground based observations of hydroclimatic phenomena in alaska including runoff and precipitation in particular availability of large domain gridded products aet and fsca made calibration over a large domain feasible and while steps were taken to reduce model uncertainty our confidence in developed parameter solutions would be strengthened if calibrations were anchored to in situ measurements representing adequate spatial coverage and temporal resolutions the fast analysis showed that aet is largely sensitive to controlled by the rfactor parameter and at higher elevations the meltmax parameter the rfactor parameter determines the amount of soil moisture surplus that becomes surface runoff each month and meltmax is the maximum melt rate of snow storage taken together results reveal that at lower elevations excess soil moisture has a relatively strong control on evapotranspiration and at higher elevations the rate of snowmelt may influence evapotranspiration more strongly those results are intuitive however when applying the sensitivity analysis to surface runoff not used in calibration rfactor has a strong relative control on simulated runoff for much of the alaskan interior but train and tsnow have stronger controls on surface runoff in the heavily glaciated gulf of alaska fig 10 train and tsnow are temperature thresholds used in the partitioning of precipitation as rain or snow in other words excess soil water tends to dominate surface runoff in non glaciated areas while temperature tends to dominate surface runoff in glaciated areas as high latitude regions continue to experience increasing temperatures ipcc 2014 these results suggest that glaciated watersheds may be vulnerable to the greatest flux thus results from the fast analysis not only inform the calibration process but they also support a deeper understanding of dominant hydrologic processes in alaska the modeling methodology described here certainly has limitations in particular the model is less reliable in areas with extensive glaciation such as the gulf of alaska coast and extensive permafrost such as the north slope while unreliability in those areas is likely associated with errors in climate forcing and calibration datasets it is also related to the absence of permafrost and glacial stores in the mwbm despite these shortcomings we anticipated even weaker performance than we observed and much of the alaskan interior remains free of glaciation and permafrost in areas without extensive ice stores this methodology may provide valuable insight into hydrologic trends at a monthly resolution the parameter solutions developed in this work will be available for all huc 12 basins in alaska please contact the authors to request a copy and represent a range of possible hydrologic outcomes for any user specified climate scenario parameter solutions that we developed can be used in conjunction with desktop app version of the mwbm that is publicly available through the usgs modeling of watershed systems mows web portal further this application of the mwbm may serve as starting point for large scale monthly resolution hydrologic representation across the entire alaskan domain where future iterations could and should include representation of cryospheric processes like those described by valentin and others in 2018 the most confidence in modelled fluxes can be placed in modelled aet and swe as these were the two fluxes calibrated against observational datasets although observed runoff was not used in calibration given the lack of observed data observational aet and fsca constrain modelled surface water fluxes so that runoff can be approximated by the mwbm evaluation of modelled runoff trends over the period of available historic climate forcing data discarding the first ten water years for model spin up showed significant runoff trends are evident in mrus at lower latitudes fig 9 where trends are generally increasing compared to more northern mrus where trends are generally decreasing we do not attempt to dissect runoff into all the possible contributing signals weather oscillations land cover changes storage changes etc instead we highlight areas where significant trends are present and the direction and relative magnitude of those trends in areas where runoff trends are decreasing we assume that less water is available to runoff and that those areas are becoming dryer conversely in areas where runoff is increasing we assume that more water is available to runoff and that those areas are either becoming wetter or that water is leaving ice snow or ground stores we found that higher magnitude trends are concentrated around the gulf of alaska where many mrus are glacierized and thus have greater potential for storage loss than mrus with less stored water however the magnitude of many significant runoff trends is slight plus or minus 0 1 especially in the alaskan interior however even slight changes in surface runoff are indicative that those systems are deviating from steady state conditions and will likely continue to do so even if runoff trends remain slight or especially if they become more exaggerated these changes could have lasting implications for ecological communities and for water resource availability others have also shown similar trends in alaskan runoff over the last several decades which ultimately strengthens confidence in our modeled runoff findings for example young and others found increases in modeled spring glacier ice melt volumes and total watershed runoff in southeast alaska over the 1980 2016 period young et al 2021 the geographic contrast in simulated runoff trends is notable in our study indicating that northern alaska approximately fairbanks and northward may not yet be experiencing the same degree of hydrologic disturbance as lower latitude portions of the state while southern coastal portions of the state are currently experiencing wetter conditions and or storage loss in a modeling study by little et al near term 2020 s future hydrologic conditions under two emissions scenarios are expected to follow similar hydrologic trends where the highest magnitude decreases to snowfall occur in the southern coastal portions of the state along with a higher fraction of precipitation falling as rain while snowfall in the higher latitude interior portions alaska experience little to no change but worsen over the coming century littell mcafee and hayward 2018 previous work has also shown variable but increasing discharge in two arctic coastal watersheds where our analysis did not show significant runoff trends stuefer et al 2017 clearly additional study and especially improved ground based hydroclimatic observations are critical for better characterizing alaskan hydrology ultimately our results support a growing body of literature indicating that change in hydrologic fluxes is well underway in alaska and especially in southern coastal regions 5 conclusions in the current work we developed a framework for calibrating a monthly resolution water balance model over the entire alaskan domain without the use of observational runoff data and evaluated modeled runoff trends over several recent decades our modeling framework demonstrates the feasibility of employing gridded aet and fsca without relying on runoff products in model calibration to constrain an operational surface water budget model which to our knowledge has not yet been explored for a large domain cold study region the calibrated model performed best in the moderate to dry alaskan interior where glaciers are absent and permafrost is generally discontinuous sporadic or absent and the model is weaker in wetter maritime areas dominated by ice stores like the north slope and gulf of alaska coastline these shortcomings highlight the need for 1 better representation of cryospheric processes in both observational datasets and in conceptual models 2 greater spatial and temporal representation of hydrologic phenomena in ground based datasets and 3 availability of robust climate products in alaska while our modelling approach does have promise to deliver hydrologic representation in a data sparse region confidence in the modelled scenarios would be greatly increased by the inclusion of more robust climate forcing data and with validation against in situ measurements of water budget components particularly runoff at adequate spatial and temporal resolutions our calibration methodology may be transferrable to other domains where gridded water budget components are available but are otherwise poorly hydrologically monitored to illustrate the applicability of a calibrated monthly resolution model in the alaskan domain we produce synthetic streamflow from wy 1992 2017 during this time period significant temporal trends in modeled runoff are present across the alaskan domain where in lower latitudes runoff tends to be increasing over time at various magnitudes and in higher latitudes runoff tends to be slightly decreasing while we do not explicitly identify phenomena responsible for causing these trends they highlight areas where more or less water is becoming available for runoff and agree with hydrologic trends detected in other studies while this was one example of the functionality of the calibrated mwbm in alaska it may also be used to investigate other hydrologic fluxes or future scenarios in alaska down to a huc 12 resolution the parameter solutions developed in this work are also compatible with a desktop version of the mwbm and may inform decision making for water supply and management and support educational research efforts credit authorship contribution statement katie schneider

introduction one of the important components of addressing challenges related to water resource management is understanding the interaction between water resources and the soil profile kahmen et al

store water significantly affect the water balance in watersheds geroy et al 2011 krpec et al 2020 these soil properties include texture organic matter content bulk density porosity hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics some of these properties e g texture and organic matter are easily measured and typically recorded during routine soil surveys these properties are then used to predict those properties which are laborious and expensive to measure e g water retention and hydraulic conductivity through pedotransfer functions bouma 1989 vereecken 1992 vereecken et al 2016 poor results in hydrological modelling are however produced when simulation models assume homogeneity in soil properties and particularly pedotransfer functions as these functions are only applicable in areas where they were developed bouma et al 2011 bouma 2016 to reduce the uncertainty in model outputs realistic site specific input data are needed robinson et al 2012 hydropedology is an interdisciplinary science incorporating the concepts of pedology soil physics and hydrology to understand soil water interactions at various scales lin 2003 lin et al 2005 2006 it can therefore provide a significant contribution to the better understanding of soil water interactions in a specific landscape considering hydropedology in watershed modelling has the potential to improve accuracies as its approach is to partition precipitation into infiltration and runoff thereby redistributing water in soils and landscapes bryant et al 2006 and highlighting the effects of lateral flow on the streamflow dynamics of a landscape me et al 2015 understanding the unique lateral flow dynamics of a landscape and how these strongly alter the flow patterns of water is an important component in hydrological modelling bouma 2006 this is due to runoff potential being influenced by soil properties such as depth to seasonal water table saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to impermeable barriers these properties determine the rate of infiltration during both dry periods and after prolonged wetting bryant et al 2006 neitsch et al 2002 having an influence on the streamflow dynamics of catchment areas the kwazulu natal drakensberg is a mountain escarpment that forms the watershed between the interior catchments of lesotho and the rivers in kwazulu natal thus enabling this province to contribute to a quarter of south africa s streamflow nel 2009 whitmore 1970 this escarpment is therefore crucial for runoff generation and it is consequently classified as a strategic water source area le maitre et al 2018 the runoff generation from the montane catchments of the drakensberg not only supplies kwazulu natal s water needs but is important in maintaining the water requirements of the economic hub gauteng nel 2009 the main aim of this study was therefore to highlight the importance of understanding the hydropedological behaviour of soils within three afromontane catchments of this escarpment to improve modelling accuracy the hypothesis for this study tests that hydropedologic information is needed to understand how water moves through a watershed and model the length of time required for water to flow through the catchment as it dictates the partitioning of rainfall between runoff and infiltration this is achieved through the following objectives digital soil mapping of the hydropedological behaviour of the three catchments utilising detailed soil data particularly of the hydraulic properties of the soils and using modelling to simulate a more accurate representation of the flow dynamics of the three catchment areas our aim was not to calibrate our swat models according to oreskes et al 1994 the term calibration refers to the process of the manipulation of independent variables of the model to obtain a match between the simulated results and the observed results it is therefore the process of adjusting model parameters so that the model is forced into particular margins we did not aim to do this but rather we used the best available data for the catchments to set the models up and then improved the models with the use of detailed soil information in the form of specific lat time information we did not perform calibrations on any parameters of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the cathedral peak experimental research catchment site forms part of the ezemvelo kzn wildlife maloti drakensberg park which is a world heritage site and is situated in the northern part of the ukhahlamba drakensberg escarpment kwazulu natal south africa the south african national environment observatory network saeon undertakes the monitoring of the catchment site there are fifteen research catchments within this site all of which are well defined and are situated at the head of three isolated little berg spurs and are underlain by basaltic lavas which overlie clarens sandstone nänni 1956 toucher et al 2016 this area is mainly covered by mesic grasslands of the ukhahlamba basalt grassland vegetation type with northern afrotemperate forest in narrow bands along the streams and wetlands in some catchments the main grassland species are bromus speciosus pentaschistis tysoniana cymbopogon nardus and themeda triandra while the forest species include leucosidea sericea and buddleia salvifolia mucina et al 2006 toucher et al 2016 the vegetation of the catchment areas is largely controlled by fire with fire regimes included as management treatments of the catchments since 1945 gordijn et al 2018 toucher et al 2016 the cathedral peak research catchments fall within the summer rainfall region of south africa the mean annual precipitation map for the area is approximately 1400 mm with a gradient from 1300 mm in the southeast cp ix to 1700 mm in the west cp iii schulze 1976 half of the rainfall events in the catchments are thunderstorms bosch 1979 everson et al 1998 toucher et al 2016 the fifteen catchments range in altitude from 1820 m a s l to 2463 m a s l topography varies from relatively flat to very steep 1 39 with the aspect ranging from north to south facing granger and schulze 1977 gordijn et al 2018 three catchments were selected for this study and are named cp iii cp vi and cp ix fig 1 these catchments are similar in shape and size but present different histories in terms of land management practices details of each catchment is provided in table 1 2 2 collection of monitoring data the collection of rainfall data within the catchments has been undertaken since 1950 with streamflow monitoring initiated in the three catchment areas during the late 1940 s and 1950 s at the outlet of each catchment a concrete weir and stilling hut with 90 degree v notches were installed fig 2 these v notches are 45 72 cm 18 in deep and are surmounted by 6 feet wide rectangular notches of varying depth the stilling ponds were dug to bedrock and rock walls for the pond were constructed details of how early measurements were taken error checked and processed are given in toucher et al 2016 the water stage height at each weir is currently monitored using an orpheus mini ott hydromet gmbh germany at cp vi weir and a cs451 stainless steel sdi 12 pressure transducers with cr200 loggers at weirs cp iii cp vi and cp ix there are two pressure transducers installed at weir cp vi as this is the core catchment and thus the quality of streamflow records is ensured toucher et al 2016 between 1987 and 2015 little to no data were collected in any of the three catchment areas due to funding constraints thus this time period was excluded from the model runs furthermore accidental fires weir silting and equipment problems has led to periods of missing data from 2016 to 2021 in cp iii and cp ix 2 3 soil and water assessment tool for this study the soil and water assessment tool swat version 1 2 2 with qswat version 3 10 9 a coruña was utilised to set up the hydrological models model inputs include spatial information terrain climate soil and land use swat is an adjusted and more flexible version of swat arnold et al 1998 bieger et al 2016 which is one of the most widely used hydrologic models in the world being applied in many watersheds across the globe bieger et al 2016 swat is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model operating on a daily time step to calculate runoff swat combines land processes and land management with channel processes to create a more spatially represented outcome of the interactions and process within a watershed bieger et al 2016 with improved runoff routing capabilities bieger et al 2019 kakarndee and kositsakulchai 2020 the swat model divides subbasins into water areas and landscape units lsus the lsus are then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus which are designated as separate spatial objects with their hydrologic interaction defined by the user for example an hru can have an interaction with an aquifer as either overbank flow lateral flow or surface flow and this can be set by the user based on site specific details bailey et al 2020 2 4 model inputs 2 4 1 terrain land use and climate data inputs for the swat model include a digital elevation model dem land cover information climatic data as well as soil information a 5 m resolution dem ezemvelo 2016 as well as the 2013 2014 sa land cover map information with a 30 m resolution geoterraimage 2015 were utilised given that the land cover of cp iii was plantations of pinus patula until 1981 historic model runs of this catchment area utilised a separate land cover map created to represent this more accurately climatic data were obtained from saeon precipitation and temperature data have been recorded on a daily basis from 1950 with additional climatic data solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed available from 2012 toucher et al 2016 precipitation data were obtained for each individual catchment while the remaining climatic data including temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were obtained from the mikes pass weather station located approximately 2 km cp iii 4 km cp vi and 6 km cp ix from the catchments while more site specific than utilising data from the global swat database the use of climatic data from the mikes pass weather station is seen as a limitation to the study as a result of the distance between catchments and this station 2 4 2 soil maps the soil maps utilised in this study were created following a digital soil mapping exercise for the three catchment areas the procedure used for the digital soil maps dsms is detailed in harrison and van tol in review and is briefly described here soil maps of the three catchments were classified using the south african classification system soil working group 2018 and then regrouped into hydropedological soil types namely shallow recharge soils deep recharge soils interflow soils and saturated responsive soils based on the classifications from van tol and le roux 2019 these groups of soils convey water differently and thus have different hydropedological behaviour the arcsie soil inference engine version 10 2 105 was used to create the dsms a rules based approach was first utilised based on knowledge of the catchments as well as the outcomes of the creation of digital terrain models dtms with the following environmental control variables applied to the rules wetness index slope elevation and planform curvature the rules applied were aimed at producing the optimal relationships between soil type and a particular dtm de menezes et al 2014 zhu et al 1997 the initial maps created following the rules based approach were then validated based on the information gained during soil surveys undertaken within each of the catchment areas the maps were refined according to the validation points taken during these surveys these final hydropedological soil group maps fig 3 were then utilised as the input maps for the swat model 2 4 3 soil parameters detailed soil information was obtained from a combination of laboratory based assessments for both particle size analysis utilising the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 and carbon analysis using the leco element analyzer as well as the work by kuenene et al 2007 this work provided details on the bulk density bd and available water capacity awc saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was calculated utilising hydrus 1d version 4 17 0140 šimůnek et al 2008 from the particle size analysis for the different horizons for each soil group kuenene et al 2011 utilised a combination of measured hydrograph and soil water content data to create drainage curves for the main soils associated with cp vi these drainage curves were created from measuring the soil water content at appropriate time intervals from a saturated profile until the decrease in soil water content becomes negligible hensley et al 1993 soil water content was measured using neutron water meter access tubes for a period of four years between 1991 and 1994 along a 200 m transect in cp vi over the four years approximately weekly soil water content measurements were made at 0 25 m depth intervals evapotranspiration values were then subtracted from the total change in soil water content to give the actual change in soil water content due to drainage the volumetric water content versus time data is used to construct a drainage curve for the particular profile this was undertaken in three separate profiles of the soils associated with cp vi to represent deep soils 1800 mm moderately deep soils 1600 mm and shallow soils 1300 mm the main components of the streamflow in cp vi were identified to be attributed to overland flow and subsurface flow from the vadose zone this information resulted in the formation of a series of time steps in days that shows how water flows through the catchment and contributes to the streamflow an example of a drainage curve produced by kuenene et al 2011 is shown in fig 4 here the different phases marked p1 to p6 of the hydrograph are displayed in relation to the time taken for water to move through the catchment utilising these results along with the hydropedological soil group maps it was hypothesized that the data obtained from the drainage curves formed in cp vi could be transferred to the lateral time lat time it takes for each hydropedological soil group to contribute to the streamflow the lat time is the flow time required for water to flow through the catchment before being discharged into the stream within swat the default value is set to 0 by default which allows the model to calculate the travel time based on the soil hydraulic properties input into the model neitsch et al 2002 based on the information obtained from the drainage curves and subsequent identification of the travel time required for water to move through cp vi and be discharged within the streamflow kunene et al 2011 the lat time input data were then manually specified within the model this was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this information will improve the accuracy of the model simulations 2 5 model setup the model was configured individually for each of the three catchments once the individual models were created the phenology trigger for the plant communities was set as a moisture trigger for growth moisture was chosen as the growth trigger over temperature as a number of studies have highlighted that plant growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature in sub saharan africa alemayehu et al 2017 lotsch et al 2003 nkwasa et al 2021 furthermore studies in cp vi have identified that soil moisture and particularly subsurface flow are major contributors to the hydrology and overall ecological drivers of the catchment everson et al 1998 the model was initially configured and run using the default lat time following this a second run was conducted where a specific lat time was used and all other parameters held constant the specific lat time inputs were based on the location of the hru within the hydropedological soil group map which was used as one of the base maps for delineating the hrus depending on the location of the hru and the associated hydropedological soil group a specific lat time number was manually input into the model these model runs were undertaken for two time periods as a result of the gap in data between 1987 and 2015 one run was therefore based on historic data and one run on current data this was to establish whether the inclusion of specific lat time values within the model improves the accuracy of the model both in the long term historic period and well as more short term current period data sets for cp iii the time periods were 1957 1983 historic and then 2015 2021 current for cp vi the time periods were 1962 1987 and then 2015 2021 and for cp ix the time periods were 1957 1987 and then 2016 2021 2 6 model validation observed streamflow data were obtained from saeon both daily streamflow and the sum of the daily streamflow as a monthly timestep was utilised in comparisons with the simulated results in a review of swat papers gassman et al 2014 showed that the majority of studies cite moriasi et al 2007 with regards to judging the success of their swat testing results the strongest results of these papers are reported for the aggregated annual and monthly timesteps however gassman et al 2014 also noted that over half of these studies further report relatively strong daily timestep statistics there is thus an increasing number of swat studies reporting successful testing at a daily timestep the use of monthly and daily timesteps in this study was therefore to highlight the strong statistical results for an improvement in the modelling accuracy the performance of the simulated results compared with the observed streamflow was analysed using the nash suttclife efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 as well as the alternative metric the kling gupta efficiency kge the nash suttclife efficiency nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line nse ranges between and 1 0 with 1 0 being the optimal value values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as being acceptable levels of performance knoben et al 2019 the nse is however sensitive to peak flows at the expense of a better performance during low flow conditions krause et al 2005 the kge was developed by gupta et al 2009 to address shortcomings in nse and is increasingly utilised in model calibration and evaluation however unlike in the nse there is no specific meaning attached to kge 0 the mean flow is therefore used as a kge benchmark and model simulations between 0 41 kge 1 are considered as reasonable performance knoben et al 2019 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the percent difference in standard deviation st dev were additional criteria used for the performance evaluation the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with positive numbers indicating an overestimation and negative values indicating an underestimation of the model gupta et al 1999 eqs 1 3 were used to calculate the performance indices 1 n s e 1 i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 i 1 n y i o b s y i m e a n 2 2 kge 1 r 1 2 δ sim δ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 3 p b i a s i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 100 i 1 π y i o b s where y i obs is the ith observation for the evaluated model y i sim is the ith simulation for the evaluated model y i mean is the mean of the observed data for the evaluated model and n is the total number of observations r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations δ obs is the standard deviation in observations δ sim the standard deviation in simulations μ sim the simulation mean and μ obs the observation mean graphical representations showing the comparison between the observed flow default lat time and specific lat time simulations were created a flow duration curve was created for each model run as an additional performance diagram for the models the flow duration curve is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time during which specified discharges the observed streamflow of the catchments were equalled or exceeded in a given period flow duration curves set up at a specific site have a key role to play in the knowledge of the streamflow characteristics at that site this is due to the flow duration curves providing information on the flow variability of the water regime of a specific site during a specific period of interest ridolf et al 2018 the flow duration curves show the improvement in the specific lat time model runs in this study 2 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted on the lat time parameter in order to determine if this parameter contributes greatly to the model outputs sensitive parameter or if it has only minor relevance non sensitive parameter to the overall performance of the model simulations moreira et al 2018 the model run for cp vi current time period was chosen for the sensitivity analysis as the specific lat time parameters were derived from the drainage curves created for this catchment the value range for lat time within the swat model is 0 180 days an initial mean value of 65 days was utilised within the sensitivity analysis as cp vi is largely dominated by hrus within the hydropedological soil group with a lat time of 65 days lenhart et al 2002 calculates a sensitivity index i as a ratio between the relative change of the model output and the relative change of the parameter lat time input a change of 25 of the entire lat time range 0 180 days was utilised this method does not account for interactions among different parameters sensitivity was calculated based on the equation by lenhart et al 2002 i y 2 y 1 y 0 2 δ x x 0 in which i is the sensitivity index y0 is the model output calculated from the initial value x0 which in this case is 65 days this initial parameter is varied by δx 25 yielding x1 and x2 with corresponding y1 and y2 values the calculated sensitivity indices were ranked into four classes table 2 as per lenhart et al 2002 3 results 3 1 lateral time used in the model hypothesis the lateral times taken for each hydropedological soil group to contribute to the streamflow within cp vi is displayed in table 3 the same lateral times were applied to cp iii and cp ix as the soil forms and associated characteristics are similar in all three catchments studied these times were input into each of the models set up for each of the three catchments based on the location of the hru within the hydropedological soil group map 3 2 hru and hydropedological soil group outputs both model outputs in all three catchments had the same hrus as the same input data were used in both model simulations with the exception of specific inputs in the lat time for cp iii the hrus were 800 for cp vi there were 717 hrus and for cp ix there were 712 hrus created comparison of the hrus with the hydropedological soil group maps revealed that each catchment had different number of hrus in the four different hydropedological soil groups and this is based on the different topographies of the catchments as well as the various soil inputs and land covers cp iii is dominated by the deep well drained soils of the recharge deep group which take 24 days to convey water through the catchment before they contribute to streamflow in cp vi the specific lat time taken for the soils to contribute to streamflow is dominated again by soils of the recharge deep hydropedological soil group followed closely by the interflow soil group in cp ix the recharge deep hydropedological soil group again dominates but in this catchment recharge shallow soils follow a close second the different flow dynamics of each soil type as well as the dominating hydropedological soil group therefore affects the streamflow dynamics of the individual catchment 3 3 model outputs the swat model was first run in cp vi as this catchment was utilised to create the drainage curves used to input the specific lat time values for each hydropedological soil group the models were run again with the same hypothesis used in cp vi as similar soils and similar hydropedological recharge groups were identified in both cp iii and cp ix the model was run twice with the integration of 1 the default lat time and 2 the specific lat time hydropedological data incorporated into the model parameters as stated previously data collection from the three catchments is patchy in some years and these have reduced the number of observed and simulated data inputs in the statistical equations utilised it has also led to gaps in the graphical representations of the simulated and observed flows 3 3 1 cp vi in cp vi climatic and streamflow data from 01 01 1961 31 12 1987 termed historic time period and then from 01 01 2014 31 03 2021 termed current time period were utilised in separate runs of the model printed data from 1961 as well as 2014 were not utilised as this was regarded as a warm up period for the models daggupati et al 2015 explains why a comprehensive guideline for warm up periods cannot be given due to the complexity of watershed scale processes they however recommend a warm up period of one to four years with this being related to the temporal and spatial scale of the governing processes shorter warm up periods are required when input values are measured as compared to estimated the watershed is smaller in size and the model is set up to evaluate soil moisture processes as compared to groundwater processes as this study is set in three small watersheds is studying soil moisture processes and detailed information on the catchments has been input into the models 1 year warm up period was regarded as being sufficient statistical results are presented in table 4 for both daily and monthly time steps with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 5 in the historical 1962 1987 data both the default simulation as well as the specific lat time simulations show an overestimation of streamflow compared to the observed flow in all runs of the model with the exception of an underestimated flow in the specific lat time simulated run for the daily time step 2015 2021 the overestimated runs however show an underestimation of the baseflows and overestimation of the peak flows in the original simulations with these variations from the observed flows being less pronounced in the specific lat time simulations fig 3 there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs are all categorised as very good 0 65 with the exception of the specific lat time simulated run for the current time period which is categorised as adequate 0 54 0 65 as per the classifications by moriasi et al 2007 according to knoben et al 2019 kge values between 0 41 and 1 0 are considered reasonable and thus all simulated runs original and lat time runs are classified as reasonable the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time period shows a marked improvement in the simulated lat time model run versus the observed streamflow as compared to the default model run and the observed streamflow this is particularly so in the current time period fig 3 and highlights the improvement in the accuracy of the model runs with the input of the specific lat time 3 3 2 cp iii in cp iii climatic data as well as streamflow data from 01 01 1957 31 12 1987 termed historic time period and then from 01 01 2015 31 03 2021 termed current time period were utilised in separate runs printed data from 1958 as well as 2015 were not utilised as these were regarded as warm up periods for the model statistical results are presented for both daily and monthly time steps in table 5 along with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 6 the historical time period for both the daily and monthly time step showed an underestimation of the simulated flows compared to the observed flows in both the default simulated and specific lat time simulated runs the current time period showed an overestimation of the default simulated and specific lat time simulated model runs in both time periods the graphical representation of the model runs shows an improvement in the simulation of baseflows as well as peak flows in the specific lat time runs of the model with the simulated data following the curves of the observed data more closely fig 6 as with cp vi there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations for both time periods historic and current as well as for both time steps used the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs improved in all models from classifications of unsatisfactory and satisfactory 0 5 to adequate 0 54 0 65 and very good 0 65 in the specific lat time simulations the very good classifications were obtained in the current time period for both the daily and monthly time step however the consideration of the disjointed input data for this current time period must be taken into consideration when comparing the historical and current time periods all kge values for all model runs are between 0 41 and 1 0 and are considered reasonable as with cp vi the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time periods in cp iii show the improvement in the accuracy of the model with the input of the specific lat time again this is especially apparent in the current time period fig 6 3 3 3 cp ix in cp ix climatic data as well as streamflow data from 01 02 1957 31 12 1987 and then from 01 01 2015 31 03 2021 were utilised in separate runs printed data from 1957 as well as 2015 was not utilised as these were regarded as warm up periods for the models statistical results are presented for both daily and monthly time steps in table 6 along with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 7 the historical time period for the monthly time step showed an overestimation of the simulated flows compared to the observed flows in both the default simulated and specific lat time simulated runs the remaining model runs monthly current time period as well as daily historical and current time periods showed an underestimation of the default simulated and specific lat time simulated model runs as is the case in cp iii the graphical representation of the model runs shows an improvement in both time periods in the specific lat time simulation of baseflows as well as peak flows with the simulated data following the curves of the observed data more closely when compared to the default simulated flow fig 7 as with cp vi and cp iii there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations for both time periods as well as for both time steps used the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs are categorised as very good 0 65 for both monthly time step periods as well as the current time period daily time step model run the historical time period daily time step run is categorised as satisfactory 0 5 all kge values for all model runs are between 0 41 and 1 0 and are considered reasonable with the exception of the default simulated run 0 205 for the current time period daily time step the kge values improve with the specific lat time run for the same time period 0 770 and are classified as reasonable as with cp vi and cp iii the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time periods in cp ix show the improvement in the accuracy of the model with a comparison of the default lat time versus the specific lat time compared to the observed streamflow this is apparent in both the historic and current time periods fig 7 the sensitivity index calculated for the cp vi monthly timestep and current time period is 0 092 this is categorised as class ii and medium sensitivity lenhart et al 2002 4 discussion and conclusions in this study the distribution of the hydropedological soil groups within each of the catchments played a role in how precipitation flows through the catchment either through overland flow or infiltration through the soil profile how it moved through the various areas of the catchment and how it influenced the streamflow for example cp ix had a greater distribution of soils in the recharge shallow group as compared to cp iii and cp vi and thus there is quicker distribution of water flow from the top of this catchment to the streamflow outlet in this catchment cp vi had a greater combined percentage of soils in the interflow and responsive saturated groups compared to soils in the recharge deep and recharge shallow groups and thus there is a longer lateral time taken for water to move through these soils before it contributes to streamflow the importance of understanding and incorporating specific lateral time periods taken for water to move through a catchment before it contributes to streamflow was identified in other studies jiao et al 2020 johnson et al 2003 ma et al 2017 me et al 2015 the ability to define the specific lateral time for each hru in this study was seen as a beneficial input of the swat model which helped to improve the understanding of the catchments dynamics the statistical parameters used in this study r2 pbias st dev nse and kge show a definitive improvement in modelling accuracy with the input of the specific lat time measurements per hru these improvements are apparent in all three catchments with cp vi obtaining the largest increase in r2 values particularly for the monthly time step when comparing the default simulations with the specific lat time simulations improvements in the other statistical parameters are clear in all three catchments with none of the catchments improving the most in a particular statistical validation this is despite the specific lat time inputs being derived from drainage curves created for the conditions of cp vi it is therefore postulated that the specific lat time inputs associated with cp iii and cp ix are due to the similar soil properties identified in these catchments as well as the detailed soil information input into the model which is particular to each catchment the sensitivity analysis conducted for this study showed that the sensitivity of the lat time parameter is classified as medium leng et al 2020 detailed the use of sensitive versus insensitive parameters in improving modelling accuracy and found that the use of an apparent insensitive parameter such as soil bd enhanced their model significantly with the r2 nse and rsr parameters improving this suggested complex hydrological processes occurring in the watershed and a wider variety of sensitive and insensitive parameters that need to be applied to the hydrologic model the same principles can be applied to this study with a number of parameters being sensitive to modelling accuracy including the detailed soil information the corresponding and detailed digital soil maps which highlight the hydropedological behaviour of the catchments as well as the detailed information obtained from kuenene et al 2011 on the soil drainage curves and how these translate into the time taken for lateral water movement to contribute to streamflow numerous research studies have highlighted the importance of detailed soil information on improving swat model accuracy adem et al 2020 chen et al 2016 krpec et al 2020 peschel et al 2006 soil information should be coupled with ecological information of the catchments such as the effects of fire vegetation as well as rates of evapotranspiration on hydrological modelling accuracy these aspects have been shown to be all interrelated in a study by manson et al 2007 within the cathedral peak area frequent burning was shown to result in nitrogen limited soils which in turn affects the vegetation type as well as vegetation condition which affects the soil condition and therefore the flow dynamics of the catchment a further study in the cathedral peak research catchments by gordijn and o connor 2021 shows that species diversity increased with heterogenous fire regimes over the long term improved species diversity has an impact on

the hydropedological behaviour of catchments enables a deeper understanding of the unique lateral flow dynamics of a landscape and how these affect the hydrological cycle this study aimed to highlight the importance of understanding the hydropedological behaviour of soils to improve modelling accuracy new hydrological insights two sets of swat models were set up for each catchment the default lateral time which is the measure of the time required for water to flow through the catchment before being discharged into the stream was used in the first set up specific lateral time inputs derived from hydropedological soil maps were utilised in the second model set up and the results compared against observed streamflow the specific lateral time inputs were based on measured hydraulic properties of the soils coupled with the location of hydrological response units within hydropedological soil maps created for each catchment the specific lateral time inputs improved modelling

information based on reliable site specific data is essential in hydrological modelling keywords hydropedology afromontane catchments hydrological modelling soil science catchment hydrology 1 introduction one of the important components of addressing challenges related to water resource management is understanding the interaction between water resources and the soil profile kahmen et al 2005 smith 2014 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 this is because soil and water are the fundamental elements in understanding the hydrological response of catchments and therefore the way in which a catchment responds to different management regimes bouma 2016 in a catchment each soil type is expected to have a unique influence on its hydrology van tol et al 2013 which also directly regulates soil water flows mamera and van tol 2018 soils therefore play a crucial role in rainfall runoff processes and constituent loading soil properties that relate to the rate of infiltration or ability to store water significantly affect the water balance in watersheds geroy et al 2011 krpec et al 2020 these soil properties include texture organic matter content bulk density porosity hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics some of these properties e g texture and organic matter are easily measured and typically recorded during routine soil surveys these properties are then used to predict those properties which are laborious and expensive to measure e g water retention and hydraulic conductivity through pedotransfer functions bouma 1989 vereecken 1992 vereecken et al 2016 poor results in hydrological modelling are however produced when simulation models assume homogeneity in soil properties and particularly pedotransfer functions as these functions are only applicable in areas where they were developed bouma et al 2011 bouma 2016 to reduce the uncertainty in model outputs realistic site specific input data are needed robinson et al 2012 hydropedology is an interdisciplinary science incorporating the concepts of pedology soil physics and hydrology to understand soil water interactions at various scales lin 2003 lin et al 2005 2006 it can therefore provide a significant contribution to the better understanding of soil water interactions in a specific landscape considering hydropedology in watershed modelling has the potential to improve accuracies as its approach is to partition precipitation into infiltration and runoff thereby redistributing water in soils and landscapes bryant et al 2006 and highlighting the effects of lateral flow on the streamflow dynamics of a landscape me et al 2015 understanding the unique lateral flow dynamics of a landscape and how these strongly alter the flow patterns of water is an important component in hydrological modelling bouma 2006 this is due to runoff potential being influenced by soil properties such as depth to seasonal water table saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to impermeable barriers these properties determine the rate of infiltration during both dry periods and after prolonged wetting bryant et al 2006 neitsch et al 2002 having an influence on the streamflow dynamics of catchment areas the kwazulu natal drakensberg is a mountain escarpment that forms the watershed between the interior catchments of lesotho and the rivers in kwazulu natal thus enabling this province to contribute to a quarter of south africa s streamflow nel 2009 whitmore 1970 this escarpment is therefore crucial for runoff generation and it is consequently classified as a strategic water source area le maitre et al 2018 the runoff generation from the montane catchments of the drakensberg not only supplies kwazulu natal s water needs but is important in maintaining the water requirements of the economic hub gauteng nel 2009 the main aim of this study was therefore to highlight the importance of understanding the hydropedological behaviour of soils within three afromontane catchments of this escarpment to improve modelling accuracy the hypothesis for this study tests that hydropedologic information is needed to understand how water moves through a watershed and model the length of time required for water to flow through the catchment as it dictates the partitioning of rainfall between runoff and infiltration this is achieved through the following objectives digital soil mapping of the hydropedological behaviour of the three catchments utilising detailed soil data particularly of the hydraulic properties of the soils and using modelling to simulate a more accurate representation of the flow dynamics of the three catchment areas our aim was not to calibrate our swat models according to oreskes et al 1994 the term calibration refers to the process of the manipulation of independent variables of the model to obtain a match between the simulated results and the observed results it is therefore the process of adjusting model parameters so that the model is forced into particular margins we did not aim to do this but rather we used the best available data for the catchments to set the models up and then improved the models with the use of detailed soil information in the form of specific lat time information we did not perform calibrations on any parameters of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the cathedral peak experimental research catchment site forms part of the ezemvelo kzn wildlife maloti drakensberg park which is a world heritage site and is situated in the northern part of the ukhahlamba drakensberg escarpment kwazulu natal south africa the south african national environment observatory network saeon undertakes the monitoring of the catchment site there are fifteen research catchments within this site all of which are well defined and are situated at the head of three isolated little berg spurs and are underlain by basaltic lavas which overlie clarens sandstone nänni 1956 toucher et al 2016 this area is mainly covered by mesic grasslands of the ukhahlamba basalt grassland vegetation type with northern afrotemperate forest in narrow bands along the streams and wetlands in some catchments the main grassland species are bromus speciosus pentaschistis tysoniana cymbopogon nardus and themeda triandra while the forest species include leucosidea sericea and buddleia salvifolia mucina et al 2006 toucher et al 2016 the vegetation of the catchment areas is largely controlled by fire with fire regimes included as management treatments of the catchments since 1945 gordijn et al 2018 toucher et al 2016 the cathedral peak research catchments fall within the summer rainfall region of south africa the mean annual precipitation map for the area is approximately 1400 mm with a gradient from 1300 mm in the southeast cp ix to 1700 mm in the west cp iii schulze 1976 half of the rainfall events in the catchments are thunderstorms bosch 1979 everson et al 1998 toucher et al 2016 the fifteen catchments range in altitude from 1820 m a s l to 2463 m a s l topography varies from relatively flat to very steep 1 39 with the aspect ranging from north to south facing granger and schulze 1977 gordijn et al 2018 three catchments were selected for this study and are named cp iii cp vi and cp ix fig 1 these catchments are similar in shape and size but present different histories in terms of land management practices details of each catchment is provided in table 1 2 2 collection of monitoring data the collection of rainfall data within the catchments has been undertaken since 1950 with streamflow monitoring initiated in the three catchment areas during the late 1940 s and 1950 s at the outlet of each catchment a concrete weir and stilling hut with 90 degree v notches were installed fig 2 these v notches are 45 72 cm 18 in deep and are surmounted by 6 feet wide rectangular notches of varying depth the stilling ponds were dug to bedrock and rock walls for the pond were constructed details of how early measurements were taken error checked and processed are given in toucher et al 2016 the water stage height at each weir is currently monitored using an orpheus mini ott hydromet gmbh germany at cp vi weir and a cs451 stainless steel sdi 12 pressure transducers with cr200 loggers at weirs cp iii cp vi and cp ix there are two pressure transducers installed at weir cp vi as this is the core catchment and thus the quality of streamflow records is ensured toucher et al 2016 between 1987 and 2015 little to no data were collected in any of the three catchment areas due to funding constraints thus this time period was excluded from the model runs furthermore accidental fires weir silting and equipment problems has led to periods of missing data from 2016 to 2021 in cp iii and cp ix 2 3 soil and water assessment tool for this study the soil and water assessment tool swat version 1 2 2 with qswat version 3 10 9 a coruña was utilised to set up the hydrological models model inputs include spatial information terrain climate soil and land use swat is an adjusted and more flexible version of swat arnold et al 1998 bieger et al 2016 which is one of the most widely used hydrologic models in the world being applied in many watersheds across the globe bieger et al 2016 swat is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model operating on a daily time step to calculate runoff swat combines land processes and land management with channel processes to create a more spatially represented outcome of the interactions and process within a watershed bieger et al 2016 with improved runoff routing capabilities bieger et al 2019 kakarndee and kositsakulchai 2020 the swat model divides subbasins into water areas and landscape units lsus the lsus are then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus which are designated as separate spatial objects with their hydrologic interaction defined by the user for example an hru can have an interaction with an aquifer as either overbank flow lateral flow or surface flow and this can be set by the user based on site specific details bailey et al 2020 2 4 model inputs 2 4 1 terrain land use and climate data inputs for the swat model include a digital elevation model dem land cover information climatic data as well as soil information a 5 m resolution dem ezemvelo 2016 as well as the 2013 2014 sa land cover map information with a 30 m resolution geoterraimage 2015 were utilised given that the land cover of cp iii was plantations of pinus patula until 1981 historic model runs of this catchment area utilised a separate land cover map created to represent this more accurately climatic data were obtained from saeon precipitation and temperature data have been recorded on a daily basis from 1950 with additional climatic data solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed available from 2012 toucher et al 2016 precipitation data were obtained for each individual catchment while the remaining climatic data including temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were obtained from the mikes pass weather station located approximately 2 km cp iii 4 km cp vi and 6 km cp ix from the catchments while more site specific than utilising data from the global swat database the use of climatic data from the mikes pass weather station is seen as a limitation to the study as a result of the distance between catchments and this station 2 4 2 soil maps the soil maps utilised in this study were created following a digital soil mapping exercise for the three catchment areas the procedure used for the digital soil maps dsms is detailed in harrison and van tol in review and is briefly described here soil maps of the three catchments were classified using the south african classification system soil working group 2018 and then regrouped into hydropedological soil types namely shallow recharge soils deep recharge soils interflow soils and saturated responsive soils based on the classifications from van tol and le roux 2019 these groups of soils convey water differently and thus have different hydropedological behaviour the arcsie soil inference engine version 10 2 105 was used to create the dsms a rules based approach was first utilised based on knowledge of the catchments as well as the outcomes of the creation of digital terrain models dtms with the following environmental control variables applied to the rules wetness index slope elevation and planform curvature the rules applied were aimed at producing the optimal relationships between soil type and a particular dtm de menezes et al 2014 zhu et al 1997 the initial maps created following the rules based approach were then validated based on the information gained during soil surveys undertaken within each of the catchment areas the maps were refined according to the validation points taken during these surveys these final hydropedological soil group maps fig 3 were then utilised as the input maps for the swat model 2 4 3 soil parameters detailed soil information was obtained from a combination of laboratory based assessments for both particle size analysis utilising the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 and carbon analysis using the leco element analyzer as well as the work by kuenene et al 2007 this work provided details on the bulk density bd and available water capacity awc saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was calculated utilising hydrus 1d version 4 17 0140 šimůnek et al 2008 from the particle size analysis for the different horizons for each soil group kuenene et al 2011 utilised a combination of measured hydrograph and soil water content data to create drainage curves for the main soils associated with cp vi these drainage curves were created from measuring the soil water content at appropriate time intervals from a saturated profile until the decrease in soil water content becomes negligible hensley et al 1993 soil water content was measured using neutron water meter access tubes for a period of four years between 1991 and 1994 along a 200 m transect in cp vi over the four years approximately weekly soil water content measurements were made at 0 25 m depth intervals evapotranspiration values were then subtracted from the total change in soil water content to give the actual change in soil water content due to drainage the volumetric water content versus time data is used to construct a drainage curve for the particular profile this was undertaken in three separate profiles of the soils associated with cp vi to represent deep soils 1800 mm moderately deep soils 1600 mm and shallow soils 1300 mm the main components of the streamflow in cp vi were identified to be attributed to overland flow and subsurface flow from the vadose zone this information resulted in the formation of a series of time steps in days that shows how water flows through the catchment and contributes to the streamflow an example of a drainage curve produced by kuenene et al 2011 is shown in fig 4 here the different phases marked p1 to p6 of the hydrograph are displayed in relation to the time taken for water to move through the catchment utilising these results along with the hydropedological soil group maps it was hypothesized that the data obtained from the drainage curves formed in cp vi could be transferred to the lateral time lat time it takes for each hydropedological soil group to contribute to the streamflow the lat time is the flow time required for water to flow through the catchment before being discharged into the stream within swat the default value is set to 0 by default which allows the model to calculate the travel time based on the soil hydraulic properties input into the model neitsch et al 2002 based on the information obtained from the drainage curves and subsequent identification of the travel time required for water to move through cp vi and be discharged within the streamflow kunene et al 2011 the lat time input data were then manually specified within the model this was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this information will improve the accuracy of the model simulations 2 5 model setup the model was configured individually for each of the three catchments once the individual models were created the phenology trigger for the plant communities was set as a moisture trigger for growth moisture was chosen as the growth trigger over temperature as a number of studies have highlighted that plant growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature in sub saharan africa alemayehu et al 2017 lotsch et al 2003 nkwasa et al 2021 furthermore studies in cp vi have identified that soil moisture and particularly subsurface flow are major contributors to the hydrology and overall ecological drivers of the catchment everson et al 1998 the model was initially configured and run using the default lat time following this a second run was conducted where a specific lat time was used and all other parameters held constant the specific lat time inputs were based on the location of the hru within the hydropedological soil group map which was used as one of the base maps for delineating the hrus depending on the location of the hru and the associated hydropedological soil group a specific lat time number was manually input into the model these model runs were undertaken for two time periods as a result of the gap in data between 1987 and 2015 one run was therefore based on historic data and one run on current data this was to establish whether the inclusion of specific lat time values within the model improves the accuracy of the model both in the long term historic period and well as more short term current period data sets for cp iii the time periods were 1957 1983 historic and then 2015 2021 current for cp vi the time periods were 1962 1987 and then 2015 2021 and for cp ix the time periods were 1957 1987 and then 2016 2021 2 6 model validation observed streamflow data were obtained from saeon both daily streamflow and the sum of the daily streamflow as a monthly timestep was utilised in comparisons with the simulated results in a review of swat papers gassman et al 2014 showed that the majority of studies cite moriasi et al 2007 with regards to judging the success of their swat testing results the strongest results of these papers are reported for the aggregated annual and monthly timesteps however gassman et al 2014 also noted that over half of these studies further report relatively strong daily timestep statistics there is thus an increasing number of swat studies reporting successful testing at a daily timestep the use of monthly and daily timesteps in this study was therefore to highlight the strong statistical results for an improvement in the modelling accuracy the performance of the simulated results compared with the observed streamflow was analysed using the nash suttclife efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 as well as the alternative metric the kling gupta efficiency kge the nash suttclife efficiency nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line nse ranges between and 1 0 with 1 0 being the optimal value values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as being acceptable levels of performance knoben et al 2019 the nse is however sensitive to peak flows at the expense of a better performance during low flow conditions krause et al 2005 the kge was developed by gupta et al 2009 to address shortcomings in nse and is increasingly utilised in model calibration and evaluation however unlike in the nse there is no specific meaning attached to kge 0 the mean flow is therefore used as a kge benchmark and model simulations between 0 41 kge 1 are considered as reasonable performance knoben et al 2019 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the percent difference in standard deviation st dev were additional criteria used for the performance evaluation the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observed data the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with positive numbers indicating an overestimation and negative values indicating an underestimation of the model gupta et al 1999 eqs 1 3 were used to calculate the performance indices 1 n s e 1 i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m

sim is the ith simulation for the evaluated model y i mean is the mean of the observed data for the evaluated model and n is the total number of observations r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations δ obs is the standard deviation in observations δ sim the standard deviation in simulations μ sim the simulation mean and μ obs the observation mean graphical representations showing the comparison between the observed flow default lat time and specific lat time simulations were created a flow duration curve was created for each model run as an additional performance diagram for the models the flow duration curve is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time during which specified discharges the observed streamflow of the catchments were equalled or exceeded in a given period flow duration curves set up at a specific site have a key role to play in the knowledge of the streamflow characteristics at that site this is due to the flow duration curves providing information on the flow variability of the water regime of a specific site during a specific period of interest ridolf et al 2018 the flow duration curves show the improvement in the specific lat time model runs in this study 2 7 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted on the lat time parameter in order to determine if this parameter contributes greatly to the model outputs sensitive parameter or if it has only minor relevance non sensitive parameter to the overall performance of the model simulations moreira et al 2018 the model run for cp vi current time period was chosen for the sensitivity analysis as the specific lat time parameters were derived from the drainage curves created for this catchment the value range for lat time within the swat model is 0 180 days an initial mean value of 65 days was utilised within the sensitivity analysis as cp vi is largely dominated by hrus within the hydropedological soil group with a lat time of 65 days lenhart et al 2002 calculates a sensitivity index i as a ratio between the relative change of the model output and the relative change of the parameter lat time input a change of 25 of the entire lat time range 0 180 days was utilised this method does not account for interactions among different parameters sensitivity was calculated based on the equation by lenhart et al 2002 i y 2 y 1 y 0 2 δ x x 0 in which i is the sensitivity index y0 is the model output calculated from the initial value x0 which in this case is 65 days this initial parameter is varied by δx 25 yielding x1 and x2 with corresponding y1 and y2 values the calculated sensitivity indices were ranked into four classes table 2 as per lenhart et al 2002 3 results 3 1 lateral time used in the model hypothesis the lateral times taken for each hydropedological soil group to contribute to the streamflow within cp vi is displayed in table 3 the same lateral times were applied to cp iii and cp ix as the soil forms and associated characteristics are similar in all three catchments studied these times were input into each of the models set up for each of the three catchments based on the location of the hru within the hydropedological soil group map 3 2 hru and hydropedological soil group outputs both model outputs in all three catchments had the same hrus as the same input data were used in both model simulations with the exception of specific inputs in the lat time for cp iii the hrus were 800 for cp vi there were 717 hrus and for cp ix there were 712 hrus created comparison of the hrus with the hydropedological soil group maps revealed that each catchment had different number of hrus in the four different hydropedological soil groups and this is based on the different topographies of the catchments as well as the various soil inputs and land covers cp iii is dominated by the deep well drained soils of the recharge deep group which take 24 days to convey water through the catchment before they contribute to streamflow in cp vi the specific lat time taken for the soils to contribute to streamflow is dominated again by soils of the recharge deep hydropedological soil group followed closely by the interflow soil group in cp ix the recharge deep hydropedological soil group again dominates but in this catchment recharge shallow soils follow a close second the different flow dynamics of each soil type as well as the dominating hydropedological soil group therefore affects the streamflow dynamics of the individual catchment 3 3 model outputs the swat model was first run in cp vi as this catchment was utilised to create the drainage curves used to input the specific lat time values for each hydropedological soil group the models were run again with the same hypothesis used in cp vi as similar soils and similar hydropedological recharge groups were identified in both cp iii and cp ix the model was run twice with the integration of 1 the default lat time and 2 the specific lat time hydropedological data incorporated into the model parameters as stated previously data collection from the three catchments is patchy in some years and these have reduced the number of observed and simulated data inputs in the statistical equations utilised it has also led to gaps in the graphical representations of the simulated and observed flows 3 3 1 cp vi in cp vi climatic and streamflow data from 01 01 1961 31 12 1987 termed historic time period and then from 01 01 2014 31 03 2021 termed current time period were utilised in separate runs of the model printed data from 1961 as well as 2014 were not utilised as this was regarded as a warm up period for the models daggupati et al 2015 explains why a comprehensive guideline for warm up periods cannot be given due to the complexity of watershed scale processes they however recommend a warm up period of one to four years with this being related to the temporal and spatial scale of the governing processes shorter warm up periods are required when input values are measured as compared to estimated the watershed is smaller in size and the model is set up to evaluate soil moisture processes as compared to groundwater processes as this study is set in three small watersheds is studying soil moisture processes and detailed information on the catchments has been input into the models 1 year warm up period was regarded as being sufficient statistical results are presented in table 4 for both daily and monthly time steps with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 5 in the historical 1962 1987 data both the default simulation as well as the specific lat time simulations show an overestimation of streamflow compared to the observed flow in all runs of the model with the exception of an underestimated flow in the specific lat time simulated run for the daily time step 2015 2021 the overestimated runs however show an underestimation of the baseflows and overestimation of the peak flows in the original simulations with these variations from the observed flows being less pronounced in the specific lat time simulations fig 3 there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs are all categorised as very good 0 65 with the exception of the specific lat time simulated run for the current time period which is categorised as adequate 0 54 0 65 as per the classifications by moriasi et al 2007 according to knoben et al 2019 kge values between 0 41 and 1 0 are considered reasonable and thus all simulated runs original and lat time runs are classified as reasonable the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time period shows a marked improvement in the simulated lat time model run versus the observed streamflow as compared to the default model run and the observed streamflow this is particularly so in the current time period fig 3 and highlights the improvement in the accuracy of the model runs with the input of the specific lat time 3 3 2 cp iii in cp iii climatic data as well as streamflow data from 01 01 1957 31 12 1987 termed historic time period and then from 01 01 2015 31 03 2021 termed current time period were utilised in separate runs printed data from 1958 as well as 2015 were not utilised as these were regarded as warm up periods for the model statistical results are presented for both daily and monthly time steps in table 5 along with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 6 the historical time period for both the daily and monthly time step showed an underestimation of the simulated flows compared to the observed flows in both the default simulated and specific lat time simulated runs the current time period showed an overestimation of the default simulated and specific lat time simulated model runs in both time periods the graphical representation of the model runs shows an improvement in the simulation of baseflows as well as peak flows in the specific lat time runs of the model with the simulated data following the curves of the observed data more closely fig 6 as with cp vi there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations for both time periods historic and current as well as for both time steps used the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs improved in all models from classifications of unsatisfactory and satisfactory 0 5 to adequate 0 54 0 65 and very good 0 65 in the specific lat time simulations the very good classifications were obtained in the current time period for both the daily and monthly time step however the consideration of the disjointed input data for this current time period must be taken into consideration when comparing the historical and current time periods all kge values for all model runs are between 0 41 and 1 0 and are considered reasonable as with cp vi the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time periods in cp iii show the improvement in the accuracy of the model with the input of the specific lat time again this is especially apparent in the current time period fig 6 3 3 3 cp ix in cp ix climatic data as well as streamflow data from 01 02 1957 31 12 1987 and then from 01 01 2015 31 03 2021 were utilised in separate runs printed data from 1957 as well as 2015 was not utilised as these were regarded as warm up periods for the models statistical results are presented for both daily and monthly time steps in table 6 along with graphical representations of a 5 year period for the monthly comparisons as well as the flow duration curves displayed in fig 7 the historical time period for the monthly time step showed an overestimation of the simulated flows compared to the observed flows in both the default simulated and specific lat time simulated runs the remaining model runs monthly current time period as well as daily historical and current time periods showed an underestimation of the default simulated and specific lat time simulated model runs as is the case in cp iii the graphical representation of the model runs shows an improvement in both time periods in the specific lat time simulation of baseflows as well as peak flows with the simulated data following the curves of the observed data more closely when compared to the default simulated flow fig 7 as with cp vi and cp iii there was an improvement in the r2 st dev and nse values in all specific lat time simulations compared to the default simulations for both time periods as well as for both time steps used the nse values for the specific lat time simulated runs are categorised as very good 0 65 for both monthly time step periods as well as the current time period daily time step model run the historical time period daily time step run is categorised as satisfactory 0 5 all kge values for all model runs are between 0 41 and 1 0 and are considered reasonable with the exception of the default simulated run 0 205 for the current time period daily time step the kge values improve with the specific lat time run for the same time period 0 770 and are classified as reasonable as with cp vi and cp iii the flow duration curves created for the monthly time step for both the historical and current time periods in cp ix show the improvement in the accuracy of the model with a comparison of the default lat time versus the specific lat time compared to the observed streamflow this is apparent in both the historic and current time periods fig 7 the sensitivity index calculated for the cp vi monthly timestep and current time period is 0 092 this is categorised as class ii and medium sensitivity lenhart et al 2002 4 discussion and conclusions in this study the distribution of the hydropedological soil groups within each of the catchments played a role in how precipitation flows through the catchment either through overland flow or infiltration through the soil profile how it moved through the various areas of the catchment and how it influenced the streamflow for example cp ix had a greater distribution of soils in the recharge shallow group as compared to cp iii and cp vi and thus there is quicker distribution of water flow from the top of this catchment to the streamflow outlet in this catchment cp vi had a greater combined percentage of soils in the interflow and responsive saturated groups compared to soils in the recharge deep and recharge shallow groups and thus there is a longer lateral time taken for water to move through these soils before it contributes to streamflow the importance of understanding and incorporating specific lateral time periods taken for water to move through a catchment before it contributes to streamflow was identified in other studies jiao et al 2020 johnson et al 2003 ma et al 2017 me et al 2015 the ability to define the specific lateral time for each hru in this study was seen as a beneficial input of the swat model which helped to improve the understanding of the catchments dynamics the statistical parameters used in this study r2 pbias st dev nse and kge show a definitive improvement in modelling accuracy with the input of the specific lat time measurements per hru these improvements are apparent in all three catchments with cp vi obtaining the largest increase in r2 values particularly for the monthly time step when comparing the default simulations with the specific lat time simulations improvements in the other statistical parameters are clear in all three catchments with none of the catchments improving the most in a particular statistical validation this is despite the specific lat time inputs being derived from drainage curves created for the conditions of cp vi it is therefore postulated that the specific lat time inputs associated with cp iii and cp ix are due to the similar soil properties identified in these catchments as well as the detailed soil information input into the model which is particular to each catchment the sensitivity analysis conducted for this study showed that the sensitivity of the lat time parameter is classified as medium leng et al 2020 detailed the use of sensitive versus insensitive parameters in improving modelling accuracy and found that the use of an apparent insensitive parameter such as soil bd enhanced their model significantly with the r2 nse and rsr parameters improving this suggested complex hydrological processes occurring in the watershed and a wider variety of sensitive and insensitive parameters that need to be applied to the hydrologic model the same principles can be applied to this study with a number of parameters being sensitive to modelling accuracy including the detailed soil information the corresponding and detailed digital soil maps which highlight the hydropedological behaviour of the catchments as well as the detailed information obtained from kuenene et al 2011 on the soil drainage curves and how these translate into the time taken for lateral water movement to contribute to streamflow numerous research studies have highlighted the importance of detailed soil information on improving swat model accuracy adem et al 2020 chen et al 2016 krpec et al 2020 peschel et al 2006 soil information should be coupled with ecological information of the catchments such as the effects of fire vegetation as well as rates of evapotranspiration on hydrological modelling accuracy these aspects have been shown to be all interrelated in a study by manson et al 2007 within the cathedral peak area frequent burning was shown to result in nitrogen limited soils which in turn affects the vegetation type as well as vegetation condition which affects the soil condition and therefore the flow dynamics of the catchment a further study in the cathedral peak research catchments by gordijn and o connor 2021 shows that species diversity increased with heterogenous fire regimes over the long term improved species diversity has an impact on soil fertility and flow dynamics bai et al 2001 mason and zanner 2005 having an impact on the hydrological flow of the catchment evapotranspiration is another important input into hydrological models as it is a vital component of the water cycle aouissi et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 several studies furthermore emphasise the importance of understanding the hydropedological character of a catchment or study area and translating this knowledge into input variables within hydrologic models bouma et al 2011 bryant et al 2006 sierra et al 2018 van tol et al 2020 and van tol et al 2021 in all these studies there is an improvement in the overall accuracy of the models following the input of soil and hydropedological information or an improved accuracy in a certain section of the model for example in van tol et al 2021 internal catchment processes were reflected more accurately with rerouting of water fluxes between specific hrus within the swat model in response to mounting environmental challenges integrative studies are needed requiring both specialists within a field as well collaborative efforts across disciplines hopmans 2020 pachepsky 2010 the use of soil hydraulic properties within a hydrology model can help one to understand the physical processes that control the partitioning and routing of precipitation into evaporation infiltration transpiration recharge and runoff brooks and vivoni 2015 thus improving the model runs for specific catchments this study contributed to the understanding of the hydropedological character of three afromontane catchments and how the characteristics of the soils as well as the flow dynamics of the catchments improves modelling accuracy it has highlighted that relevant information based on reliable data is essential to assess not only the current condition of water resources in a given catchment but also past trends and future possibilities droogersa and bouma 2014 funding this research was funded by the iphakade earth
